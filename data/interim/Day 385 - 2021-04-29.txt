PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 29 APRIL 2021 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Pretorius, good 
morning Mr President, good morning everybody. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Are you ready? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Chair Mr Freund will deal with the 
Parliamentary questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oversight. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And Parliamentary oversight for the 
next two hours until the short adjournment. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is alright. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is alright.  Mr President the oath 
you took yesterday will continue to apply today.  Thank 
you. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Good morning Mr President.  Perhaps 
you could turn on your microphone.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I – I thought that maybe the 
President decided that this morning he will – today he will 
keep his mask on. 
20 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  No.  I decided it is pretty safe 
in here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  Yes Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr President you 
should have open in front of you Bundle 1 of your material 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 4 of 288 
 
which is your affidavit.  I am going to start at page 48.  
Chair page 48 of Bundle 1 which is the one that contains 
the actual affidavit.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Using the black numbers again and not 
the red numbers. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Yes it is black numbers top left.  Mr 
President do you have at that page the section headed 
Role of the ANC in Parliament? Now Mr President Mr 
Pretorius 
and 
yourself 
debated 
yesterday 
the 
basic 
approach adopted by this commission.  What happened, 
10 
why did it happen and what can be suggested that might 
prevent future similar difficulties? 
 
I am going to deal with those issues as well but I 
am going to be dealing with the question of whether it is so 
that Parliament failed to exercise due oversight over the 
executive in relation to the issues of concern to this 
commission, 
whether 
it 
failed 
to 
hold 
the 
executive 
properly accountable. 
 
But on that issue we have had a lot of evidence and 
I am not going to re-traverse with you evidence that has 
20 
already been heard. 
 
The second question of course is why did this 
happen and I will say at the outset that the picture is mixed 
on Parliamentary Oversight.  There are some successes, 
there are arguably some failures and really the focus is not 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 5 of 288 
 
on the successes this focus is on the failures but it is 
appropriate to keep a balance to view on that.  And in the 
questions I ask you – I am really going to be focussing on 
what explains the failures to the extent that there were 
failures? 
 
And then very briefly because again on the third the 
question of – of what can be recommended to improve 
things?  That is an issue we have canvassed at some 
considerable detail already particularly in the evidence 
recently of Mr Mantashe so I am not proposing to spend a 
10 
great deal of time on that with you I will touch on a couple 
of issues. 
 
But the real focus then from my perspective is 
really if there were failures why did those failures take 
place?  
 
And in relation to that I want to start just reaching 
common cause and agreement with you on things I am sure 
we would agree about and in particular what are the 
applicable 
constitutional 
principles? 
 
What 
is 
the 
appropriate relationship as between Parliament and the 
20 
executive? 
 
Now you deal with that in your own affidavit and in 
particular if you have a look at paragraph 112 you will see 
that you summarise the duties of Parliament and at the 
footnote to 112.4 you refer to Section 42(3) of the 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 6 of 288 
 
Constitution and Mr President your own role in the 
formation of the constitution is well-known I presume we 
take it as read that you are reasonably familiar with the 
provisions of the constitution.   
 
So just to so that we all start from the same starting 
point Section 42(3) to which you refer says as you know 
this – it says: 
“The 
National 
Assembly 
is 
elected 
to 
represent 
the 
people 
and 
to 
ensure 
government by the people it does this by 
10 
and then various things but one of the ways 
it 
does 
it 
by 
is 
by 
scrutinising 
and 
overseeing executive action.” 
 
So we know that is part of Parliament’s functions 
and that is the function to which you expressly refer in 
your affidavit. 
 
But I am sure you will also be aware that there is 
another provision of considerable importance here and that 
is Section 55(2). 
 
Section 55(2) I will read to you. 
20 
“The 
National 
Assembly 
must 
provide 
for 
mechanisms 
a. To ensure and I would hyphenate – I would 
underline that word to ensure that all 
executive organs of state and the national 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 7 of 288 
 
sphere of government are accountable to it 
– to the National Assembly and 
b. To maintain oversight of  
1. The exercise of national executive authority 
and  
2. Any organ of state.” 
So in short there is an oversight constitutional obligation 
and there is a constitutional obligation resting on the 
National Assembly to ensure that the executive in all its 
components is accountable to it. 
10 
 
Now I presume there is no difference between you 
and I on those principles? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr President when you agree with him or 
do not agree better that you articulate whether you agree 
so that it will be recorded. When you nod it is not 
recorded. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Okay.  So my nod then not 
recorded? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.   
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  I agree. 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:  So the first point that flows from that I 
want to put for you – put to you to check that you agree 
with me is that the obligation to hold the executive account 
– to account to vest in the National Assembly it does not 
vest only in the ANC’s party’s structures.  I see you nod. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 8 of 288 
 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Yes I agree. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And secondly that the executive is 
accountable to the National Assembly and not merely not 
to the governing party.  Again I presume you agree? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Yes I agree. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Now can I take you to the – to the other 
bundle – Bundle 2 of your – of your material to page 564.  
You should find there a copy of a court judgment.  Is that 
correct? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Yes. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:  Now Mr President that is the reported 
judgment of the Constitutional Court in what is commonly 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the page number? 
ADV FREUND SC:  564. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And Chair if I can indicate that my 
intention this morning is to move backwards and forwards 
between Bundle 1 and Bundle 2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that is fine. 
20 
ADV 
FREUND 
SC: 
 
That 
is 
the 
judgment 
of 
the 
Constitutional Court on the Nkandla issue.  You will 
remember the Public Protector ’s Investigation Report on 
the Nkandla expenditure.  You will recall that Parliament 
reacted in a particular way.  The mezzo found its way to 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 9 of 288 
 
the Constitutional Court in a case brought by the EFF and 
others and the judgment as you will see was handed down 
on the 31 s t of March 2016.  You will see that on page 564 
but you can take it from me that is what it says.   
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Now if I take you to page 576 you will 
see at paragraph 95 that the Constitutional Court dealt 
there with it might be called the second issue that was 
before the court.  
 
The first issue was the issue about whether the 
10 
Public Protector ’s Reports are binding and have to be 
adhered to unless reviewed. 
 
But there was the second issue and it is the second 
issue that is relevant for present purposes and that was 
whether Parliament itself had failed – and when I say 
Parliament I am particularly referring to the National 
Assembly – whether the National Assembly had failed in its 
oversight obligations of a type that we have just been 
discussing and in short the court found that it had failed.  
It was in breach of its constitutional duties. 
20 
 
And what I want to draw to your attention in 
paragraph 95 is that what the court says is this: 
“That because the Public Protector ’s Report 
implicated the Head of State or the Head of 
the Executive it was this factor that made it 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 10 of 288 
 
and I now quote “A high priority matter that 
required 
urgent 
attention 
of 
and 
investigation by the National Assembly it 
ought 
therefore 
to 
have 
triggered 
into 
operation 
the 
National Assembly 
whose 
obligation 
to 
scrutinise 
and 
oversee 
executive action and to hold the President 
accountable.” 
 
Now that is a matter of record but the question 
which arises from that and where again I am assuming that 
10 
we are not going to be in any dispute between you and 
myself is that I want to know whether you accept this 
proposition.   
 
Do you accept that where there is information in the 
public 
domain 
which 
if 
true 
appears 
to 
implicate 
a 
President – any President in conduct which is allegedly 
unconstitutional, 
allegedly 
illegal, 
allegedly 
improper 
conduct if that sort of information is in the public domain 
do you – in relation to the President do you accept that the 
National Assembly is obliged by the constitution to do what 
20 
it can firstly to establish whether there is any merit in 
those obligations and secondly if it finds that there is to 
take appropriate action? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Yes I do. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And presumably you would accept that 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 11 of 288 
 
that same principle which we have said applies to the 
President must apply equally to Ministers, other senior 
representatives of the government, other senior officials 
and SOE’s and the like the principle must be the same? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Indeed I do agree. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And of course Mr President you would 
be aware having been a member of Parliament, having 
been sworn in as a President you know the oath of office 
that is taken – let us focus firstly on the – on every 
member of Parliament and it includes this I am quoting 
10 
from Schedule 2 Item 4 in the Constitution 
“I and I leave out some words will obey, 
observe, 
uphold 
and 
maintain 
the 
constitution 
and 
all 
other 
law 
of 
the 
Republic.” 
 
You are familiar with that? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  I am familiar with it. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And indeed when one looks at the oath 
of office the former President took, that you took there are 
words to identical effect to the words I have just quoted? 
20 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Indeed. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And I presume it goes without saying 
that you would fully endorse and accept that that is binding 
on the members of Parliament, it is binding on the 
Presidents, effect must be given to that oath. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 12 of 288 
 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Pretty obviously. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Now what may be less of yes and what 
I want to examine is this.  Do you accept that in its 
relationship with and in its instructions to its MP’s in 
Parliament the ANC as a political party is obliged also to 
respect those oaths of office that we have just discussed? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Now I want to move on to a related but 
slightly different feature of the constitution.  Both the 
constitution and the rules of Parliament and that is the 
10 
powers of Parliament and in particular the powers through 
committee inquiries. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Yes 
ADV FREUND SC:  Now you will know I am sure but let me 
read it into the record.  The Section 56 of the constitution 
says this: 
“The 
National 
Assembly 
or 
any 
of 
its 
committees may – and I leave out some 
words – summon any person to appear 
before it to give evidence on oath or 
20 
affirmation or to produce documents.”   
It 
is 
built 
into 
our 
constitutional 
design 
that 
Parliament and its committees have those powers and I 
presume you are fully aware of that. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Huh-uh. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 13 of 288 
 
ADV FREUND SC:  And similarly if I can draw your 
attention and perhaps I could take you to the second 
bundle at page 584.   
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  I must say these documents 
are well arranged Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  By your – by your staff. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you Mr President. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  I want to compliment them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much Mr President. 
10 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  I may want to steal them to 
come and work for us. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Please 
wait 
let 
us 
finish 
the 
commission’s work first. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Yes I have got it. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Mr President at page 584 what you 
should have in front of you is an extract from the Rules of 
the National Assembly as they stood in their 8 t h edition 
which was applicable until March of 2016.  Do you have 
their Rule 138 page 584? 
20 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  No 584  
ADV FREUND SC:  Bundle 2?  The other bundle sorry. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  I am on Bundle 1 sorry.  
ADV FREUND SC:  Not at all.  Just for clarity and to 
remind you Mr President Bundle 1 is really.. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 14 of 288 
 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Yes, no. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Your submission and the document you 
provided and Bundle 2 is really the documents the 
commission has put together.  So I am now in Bundle 2. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Indeed I have got it. 
ADV FREUND SC:  At page 584 you have the extract from 
the Rules of the National Assembly.  And you will see there 
at Rule 138. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And for the purposes of performing its 
10 
functions a committee may subject to the constitution, 
legislation 
and 
other 
provisions 
of 
these 
rules 
and 
resolutions of the assembly. 
a. Summon any person to appear before it to give 
evidence 
on 
oath 
or 
affirmation 
or 
to 
produce 
documents which is precisely what we saw in the 
constitution and then 
b. Conduct public hearings.   
So 
you 
would 
have 
been 
aware 
presumably 
that 
committees of Parliament have this power. 
20 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And just for the sake of completeness if 
you go to page 586 you will see that Rule 167 of the 9 t h 
Edition of the Rules which – and the reason why I focus on 
this is because the very moment at which the rules 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 15 of 288 
 
changed was a moment of deep crisis as we are going to 
see in a moment.  May of 2016 or March of 2016 and you 
will see that although the rules changed they do not 
change in any relevant respect.  So if we look at Rule 167a 
and Rule 167c you will see that they are absolutely 
identically worded to the provisions as they were so both 
before and after the rule amendment the power to compel 
oral testament, the power to compel the production of 
documents and the right to conduct public hearing is just 
indisputable. Everybody knows that those powers exist.  
10 
You accept that? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Now moving on from the as it were 
legal background to the factual background I presume that 
you accept that there have been indeed some instances in 
South Africa of effective Parliamentary Oversight through 
Portfolio Committee Inquiries and I would suggest that we 
focus right at the outset on the investigation by the 
Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises in relation to 
Eskom.  You aware of that and do you accept it was a 
20 
successful exercise? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Indeed. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And as regards that I just want to as it 
were sketch a bit of a timeline.  It was in May of 2017 that 
according to Ms Zukiswa Ranto’s affidavit – evidence 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 16 of 288 
 
before this commission the – that committee took a 
decision to conduct its Eskom inquiry it was really flowing 
from the allegations in relation to Mr Brian Molefe, 
allegations in respect of the Eskom board, they sought and 
were furnished resources that they needed and evidence 
leader, there is an additional budget they produced their 
interim report in March and April 2018, they finalised their 
report in November 2018 and then what I want to point out 
is what they conclude. 
 
They concluded amongst many other things but 
10 
probably the key sentence is this that it was patently clear 
that there was undue influence by private individuals and 
companies over the appointment of the Eskom board 
members as well as procurement decisions. 
 
That was as it were the bottom line of what they 
found and that of course was an allegation that had first 
been made many years earlier.  You accept all of that? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  (Inaudible). 
ADV FREUND SC:  Now another example of which I am 
aware but frankly possibly the only other example of which 
20 
I am aware was the ad-hoc committee’s inquiry into the 
SABC board and that was appointed by the National 
Assembly in November 2016 and it reported in February 
2017.   
 
And that too was widely welcomed as a – as an 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 17 of 288 
 
instance 
of 
effective 
Parliamentary 
Oversight 
and 
I 
presume that you would agree with that assessment? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  So if we take those two examples do 
we 
also 
agree 
that 
an 
inquiry 
by 
a 
Parliamentary 
Committee whether it is an Ad-hoc Committee like the 
SABC’s committee or whether it is a Portfolio Committee 
like in the PCPE Eskom inquiry is potentially at least an 
effective tool for Parliamentary Oversight when there is 
information in the public domain that suggests that there 
10 
are reasonable grounds for concern about the conduct or 
performance of members of the executive or other organs 
of state.  It is potentially an effective tool for dealing with  
that sort of allegation.  Do we agree on that? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  I would agree. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Now if I can take you to Bundle 1 your 
own affidavit at page 166 at paragraph 166 it is page 73. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is that page number? 
ADV FREUND SC:  Page 173 in Volume 1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:  Paragraph 166.  Volume 1 is your own 
affidavit and it is page 166 – page 73. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Yes I thought so.  I thought 
so.  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Now this comes in a portion of your 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 18 of 288 
 
affidavit in which you have sketched in some detail how 
allegations of alleged undue influence by the Gupta family 
allegations 
of 
alleged 
state 
capture, 
allegations 
of 
corruption 
had 
come 
to 
the 
attention 
of 
the 
senior 
structures of the African National Congress and you deal in 
your affidavit and Mr Pretorius later today I am sure will 
deal with this in a lot more detail and really directly 
relevant to my line of evidence but you deal with the 
discussions that took place within the NEC, the questions 
of how do we address these problems and particularly the 
10 
questions of what implications if any this should have of 
the position of the then sitting President.   
But 
in 
paragraph 
166 
having 
sketched 
that 
background and having referred to certain attempts that 
were made you say this: 
“Although the ANC as an organisation did 
not have direct evidence of state capture 
activities 
at 
the 
time 
they 
were 
being 
perpetrated 
and 
did 
not 
have 
the 
investigative capacity to probe the various 
20 
allegations it is necessary to address.” 
 
And you can – want to deal with certain other 
issues.  But the point you yourself make and it seems with 
respect to be a correct point is that the ANC does not have 
as an organisation the investigative capacity to probe 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 19 of 288 
 
allegations of this type.  That is your own position as I 
understand it, correct? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Indeed. 
ADV FREUND SC:  But would you accept that precisely 
that investigative capacity that you point out that the ANC 
as a party did not have but Parliament did have – 
Parliament had it through the provisions that we have just 
discussed this morning, you accept that? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  I would. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Alright let me move on.  Can I take you 
10 
to Bundle 2 page 409.   
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  What page is that? 
ADV FREUND SC:  409.   
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Okay.  
ADV FREUND SC:  Oh sorry my mistake it is 593 – 593. 
409 was its pagination in a different (inaudible).  593. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Now… 
CHAIRPERSON:  593? 
ADV FREUND SC:  593 Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV FREUND SC:  You will see Mr President that this is 
dated – it is issued as we see at the foot of the page by 
the Parliament of the Republic of South Africa.  It is 
headed The Parliamentary Investigation into Alleged State 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 20 of 288 
 
Capture emails.  It is dated as I said the 19 t h of June 2017 
and let us just look at the first paragraph. 
 
In the light of the recent accusations of State 
Capture linked to alleged emails involving a number of 
Ministers and if I can just pause in parenthesis that it 
would appear must be a reference to what has come to be 
known as the Gupta Leaks. So it says: 
“In the light of these emails involving a 
number 
of 
Ministers 
Parliamentary 
Committees have been directed to urgently 
10 
probe the allegations and report back to the 
National Assembly.” 
 
And it makes reference in the second paragraph 
towards 
the 
end 
of 
the 
second 
paragraph 
to 
the 
constitution the enshrined oversight function of Parliament 
and it says these committees must ensure immediate 
engagement with the concerned Ministers to ensure that 
Parliament gets to the bottom of the allegations and it says 
that these committees must report their recommendations 
to the House urgently and again expresses Parliament’s 
20 
constitutional obligations when there are allegations of this 
type in the public domain.   
 
Now can I ask you Mr President when you first 
became aware that this instruction had been issued or was 
to be issued? 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 21 of 288 
 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  The question is when did I 
first become aware? 
ADV FREUND SC:  Yes in other words were you aware of 
this before it was issued? Did you learn of it after? Did you 
only learn of it long after?  I am trying to understand what 
you personally knew in relation to this set of investigations 
which we have come to refer to in this inquiry as the 
Frolick Inquiry.  Because Mr Frolick the then Chair of 
Chairs issued a number of letters as reflected in this – in 
this report to four chairs of four committees said please do 
10 
these investigations. So my question to you is when for the 
first time did you become aware either that this was going 
to be happening or that it had already been decided and it 
was already underway? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Well Chairperson once these 
Gupta Leak emails came out it became clear to many of us 
that there needed to be a response of one sort or another.  
The ANC itself without having the investigative powers 
clearly knew that it would need to rely to get to the bottom 
of this on a number of other structures and indeed 
20 
Parliament would be one of those so when the Chair of 
Chairs Cedric Frolick MP issued this; this in our view would 
have been in line with what Parliament needed to do at 
that time because a flood of evidence was now becoming 
evident and available. Personally whether I became aware

of the move by Frolick I would not be able to put my finger 
on but once this instruction is noted and letter had been 
issued, I was quite relaxed and happy that this process 
had started. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright.  Now, Mr Frolick testified that 
Mr Jackson Nthembo was particularly supportive of this 
exercise.  I presume you can confirm that? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes, I can confirm that. 
ADV FREUND SC:   That was you, Mr President because 
although Mr Nthembo has furnished an affidavit, he, of 
10 
course unfortunately, passed away.  So he has never 
testified before us.  So I need to try and ask, as it were, 
indirectly things that I would have otherwise would have 
asked Mr Nthembo. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Mr Frolick also testified as follows.  He 
said: 
“Later in 2017, I think it was in October or in 
November, the then Deputy President, who is 
now the President of the country, came to the 
20 
Caucus 
to 
reinforce 
the 
importance 
of 
parliamentary committees to conduct these 
types of, be it inquiry or investigation or 
whatever...” 
 
Do you accept that that evidence of Mr Frolick is 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 23 of 288 
 
factually correct? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   It is factually correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Perhaps you could explain to us what 
happened, why you went to the Caucus, what happened in 
the Caucus that he is referring to? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   I guess I would start it off 
with the processes that the ANC had decided that it should 
embark upon and those would go back the 53 r d Conference 
of the ANC which would have been – which was held in 
2012 when I was elected Deputy President where the ANC 
10 
took 
a 
decision 
that 
we 
now 
needed 
to 
get 
our 
parliamentary structures to be more activist, to be more 
alert when it comes to the issue of oversight, to exercise 
more accountability or to demand more accountability on 
the Executive, whether it be at national level or provincial 
and indeed even lower than that. 
 
Now I must confess that it took a while within the 
African National Congress for this type of initiative to take 
route and it was during this period that the activism of 
parliamentary colleagues started moving forward in a much 
20 
more demonstratable way and I remember very clearly that 
I had occasion to address Caucus and insisted that our 
parliamentary committees must now move ahead with 
greater vigour on the issue of oversight. 
 
And this, in a way, was also prompted what was 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 24 of 288 
 
coming out in the open about this issue of state capture 
that we needed to go to the bottom of.  So the events that 
happened activated this decision that had, in some ways, 
remained latent and it now was being activated and our 
committees became more activists and as we had said, we 
wanted an activist type of Parliament and that is what 
happened then.  I addressed Caucus to that effect and that 
then started or further went on with this train of activism 
events that started unfolding. 
ADV FREUND SC:   I did hear you correctly.  You say it 
10 
was the 2012 NEC? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   That specifically made such a decision 
as you described? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes, it was the National 
Conference. 
ADV FREUND SC:   The National Conference? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes, sir. 
ADV FREUND SC:   So when you say the National 
Conference - I am sorry, I said NEC.  Of course, that is 
20 
wrong. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   It is the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...conference. 
ADV FREUND SC:   ...the elected conference. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 25 of 288 
 
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright.   
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   National Conference. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And from that time – in fact, I think we 
have that document.  I think it is at Bundle 1, page 140 and 
the following.   
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   140, did you say? 
ADV FREUND SC:   140 and following. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:   And you will find the resolutions from 
150 and following.  Mr President, I had not anticipated the 
answer you gave me about the 2012 Conference.  So, I 
have not read through this document but I am just 
wondering if you are in a position to point out to us 
perhaps now or perhaps later you have had a moment 
where we will find in this – in these ...[intervenes]  
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   ...conference resolutions what you are 
talking about.  Perhaps that is an unfair question. 
20 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   [laughs] 
ADV FREUND SC:   But I should find it somewhere in these 
...[intervenes]  
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   It is not unfair.  I should know 
but this morning I woke up on the other side of the bed.  
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 26 of 288 
 
So... 
ADV FREUND SC:   [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] Well ...[intervenes]  
ADV FREUND SC:   We can come back to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well...  Ja, I think we can come back.  
Your junior ...[intervenes]  
ADV FREUND SC:   ...activity ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...can have a look at the resolutions.  
Ja. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Ja.  But it is there.  It is there 
10 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now, Mr President.  If we can step 
back a little? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And focus on your own personal role. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   You were, as I understand it, Deputy 
President of the Republic from the 25 t h of May 2014 and 
you remained in that capacity until your appointment as 
20 
President on the 15 t h of February 2018.  Is that correct? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And as Deputy President of the 
Republic, 
you 
performed 
several 
different 
roles 
of 
relevance 
to 
this 
topic, 
the 
topic 
of 
parliamentary 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 27 of 288 
 
oversight.  One of those is that you were appointed as the 
Leader of Government Business in Parliament.  Is that 
correct? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   H’m? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now, if you could just briefly describe 
to us so we have some understanding of what that role 
entails and particularly what that role entails in relation to 
the question of oversight by Parliament over the Executive 
and accountability by the Executive to Parliament? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   The role of the Leader of 
10 
Government Business, it is really the facilitation of the link 
between the Executive and Parliament, two distinct bodies, 
obviously observing the separation of powers but more 
specifically to ensure that the Executive works, one, 
according 
to 
the 
rules 
of 
Parliament, 
the 
Executive 
responds 
to 
questions 
from 
Parliament, 
from 
parliamentarians in the form of written questions, in the 
form of appearing in Parliament, answering questions 
whenever. 
 
And 
attend, 
whenever 
they 
are 
asked 
in 
20 
attendance in Parliament, and ensuring that members of 
the Executive observe or fulfil, rather, their duties as 
members of Parliament.  And also to work together with the 
heads of Parliament, specifically the Speaker, Deputy 
Speaker as well as the Chair of the House, of the NCOP, 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 28 of 288 
 
as we call it.  And ensure that there is harmony in the 
working of all these structures.  Now that is largely the role 
that the Leader of Government Business plays.   
 
And indeed, to also ensure that - it is not so 
much to supervise, it is not to supervise activities of 
Parliament.  It is to play that link between the two because 
Parliament is independent.  It is a distinct organ of the 
state and the Executive is also.  So, the Leader of 
Government Business plays that very delicate role between 
the two just to ensure that there is that harmony. 
10 
 
And sometimes, even parliamentarians tend to 
want to exaggerate the role of the Leader of Government 
Business and it is not, and as Deputy President, you really 
work also under the leadership of their president who links 
the Executive.  So in some ways, your role much as it 
would appear like it is expansive.  It is also a role that is 
constricted in terms of your role as Deputy President 
working together with the President. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it largely a facilitation role? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   It is largely that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To make sure the smooth functioning of 
both the Executive and Parliament. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   It is not an Executive role. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 29 of 288 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   And I see it now that, you 
know. I play the role of President that the Deputy President 
plays that role and I am able now to look at it from an 
advantage point of view and see how that role spans itself 
out.  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   And of course, I should add 
that to the extent that it is an Executive role in those 
inverted 
commas. 
 
It 
is 
where, 
as 
the 
Leader 
of 
10 
Government Business, you are able to exert pressure on, 
for instance, towards ministers, if I can call them that, to 
answer questions.  There are occasions when the Leader 
of Government Business will be quite precipitous in 
Cabinet in insisting that members of the Executive must 
answer questions and you know pull them on the carpet 
and even meet them and say you have got fulfil your 
obligations.  So the role is a little behind the scenes to 
some extent. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:   And I presume, it follows from what 
you have said, that where instances arose, and this 
Commission has heard of quite a few instances, where 
ministers 
were 
due 
to 
attend 
meetings 
in 
portfolio 
committees and simply did not turn up. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 30 of 288 
 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   That would be part of the LOGB 
business to try and address and rectify that sort of 
problem? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Can I take you back now to Bundle 1, 
page 177?  I think we found the paragraphs we were 
looking for.  Your bundle, Bundle 1, page 177. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And just to get your bearings. 
10 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Indeed. 
ADV FREUND SC:   You will see that document starts at 
157 and we are now dealing with the part that seems to be 
the part you had in mind. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   In strengthening the legislature. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Is that the resolution you had in mind? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   That is the resolution I had in 
mind. 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:   And I see, what it says amongst 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Freund.  What is the 
paragraph? 
ADV FREUND SC:   It is paragraph 12 under the heading, 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 31 of 288 
 
Strengthening of the Legislatures, at page 177. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
ADV FREUND SC:   And there are various sub-resolutions 
of 12.2 and I am just going to focus on several of those. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  No, no it is fine.  I can see 
paragraph 12.2.1. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And if I then take you to 12.2.3, it 
says: 
“The 
legislature’s 
oversight 
model 
and 
capacity should be improved...” 
10 
 
That is, presumably, one of the decisions made 
at this conference? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And if I can just digress on that.  In 
2009, I am not sure if you know this but I imagine you do, 
the so-called Oversight and Accountability Model, the 
OVAC model was adopted by Parliament but that referred 
quite a bit of evidence in this Commission that good 
suggestions apparently adopted in 2009 had to this day not 
yet been implemented. 
20 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   H’m. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And I think that what I am seeing here 
is that at the 2012 ANC Conference that problem was 
recognised.  It was said it should be addressed.  Am I 
understanding that correctly? 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 32 of 288 
 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   You are. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And is there anything else you would 
like to refer me to, to support the proposition that you 
made that this conference made a deliberate decision that 
there should be more vigorous parliamentary oversight 
over the Executive, more vigorous holding the Executive to 
account? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Without referring to any 
specific document, I would say that, if I can call it a 
political speak of this and the interpretation that was 
10 
overlaid on 12.2.3 where we say improve the capacity of 
our 
oversight, 
meant 
that 
we 
needed 
to 
have 
our 
Parliament and legislatures to be more activist.  To be 
much more – to improve their oversight role.  And you – I 
could refer you to a number of speeches that were also 
given by a number of leaders including myself about 
activating, if you like, the activism of our parliamentary 
structures on the question of oversight.  So it was 
recognised that this was one of the weak areas. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
20 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   And that is why one of the 
paragraphs then refer to:   
“The legislature should play a more effective 
role in shaping the national agenda...” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, actually, Mr President.  Paragraph 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 33 of 288 
 
12.2.1 makes the point you made quite early in your 
answer to Mr Freund’s question that: 
“There 
should 
be 
a 
more 
activist 
people 
centred 
model 
of 
legislatures 
should 
be 
developed...” 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Precisely the point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   If you read from that and the 
10 
interpretation, that was also put in various speeches that 
were made following that conference.  It reinforced this 
activist role that we wanted our legislatures to play 
because there had been a realisation that it was lagging 
and lagging behind and it, therefore, for Parliament needed 
to be - and in political speak in the ANC, we always say, 
that Parliament was a sight of activism, it was a sight of 
struggle.   
 
So we needed to have parliamentarians who 
would be more active particularly on oversight.  So it was 
20 
recognised.  I should immediately add that it did take some 
time to take effect and to be fully activated and it took the 
better part of three years but when it did start happening 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I think five years Mr President. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 34 of 288 
 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Well, I would say four. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   [laughs]  Give some change.  
I would say four years. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Oh, yes. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   I was being a more ambitious 
when I said three.  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you are the President of the ANC.  
[laughs] 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   [laughs]  It did take up four 
10 
years before it was fully activated. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   And as I said, Chairperson.  It 
was actually brought to full effect by the events that were 
happening.  The Gupta leak emails just really were a flood 
of evidence that required that Parliament which had an 
investigative and an oversight role should actually start 
doing its work. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  I want to put my understanding of 
paragraph 12.2.1, Mr President and I would like you to say 
20 
whether you agree with my interpretation of it.  My 
interpretation of it – and let me say what it says firstly. 
“There 
should 
be 
a 
more 
activist 
people 
centred 
model 
of 
legislatures 
should 
be 
developed...” 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 35 of 288 
 
 
My understanding of it, is that two features of 
this paragraph is that the ANC wanted to see more activism 
on the part of legislations including Parliament but two, 
people centred model seems to suggest to me that this 
resolution was saying, those who are in Parliament must 
put people first.  Is my interpretation in accordance with 
yours? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Absolutely.  But it could also 
that the people centred approach would also mean that we 
should also be willing and be prepared to work with non-
10 
parliamentary structures. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no I – ja. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   To listen to them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   To hear their views. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   And that is hearing the views 
of the people. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, not it does not exclude 
...[intervenes]  
20 
PRESIDENT 
RAMAPHOSA: 
 
 
It 
does 
not 
exclude 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...hearing other people. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 36 of 288 
 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr President, can I 
refer you to Bundle 2 at page 602? 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the page on bundle 2? 
ADV FREUND SC:   602 in Bundle 2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   602...   
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   That should be headed, The Political 
Committee.  You have the right document? 
10 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright.  Now, Mr President, we have 
heard very little in these proceedings about the Political 
Committee.  This document, I simply downloaded it a 
couple of nights ago from the ANC’s website under 
Parliament, under Caucus.  You go through and this is what 
I find and we have printed it out and it tells us the 
following:   
“The ANC Political Committee is responsible 
for 
the 
overall 
political 
guidance 
of 
the 
20 
organisation’s parliamentary Caucus and the 
Office of the Chief...” 
 
That is presumable the Office of the Chief Whip? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Chief Whip, yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 37 of 288 
 
“Amongst 
its 
chief 
responsibilities, 
the 
committee 
provides 
strategic 
direction 
to 
Caucus on macro political matters within the 
institution...” 
 
Now I presume that is what we see in this 
document.  This is correct, is it? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   It is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And it says on the second paragraph 
that: 
“The Political Committee is a sub-committee of 
10 
the NEC...” 
 
Is that also correct? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   It is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And then it states: 
“The members of the Political Committee, [it 
states 
as] 
member 
number 
one, 
Cyril 
Ramaphosa, Chairperson...” 
 
And it then gives another ten names.  I do not 
know if that is still correct or if this is an out of date 
document, whether this referred to the period when you 
20 
Deputy President or whether it still applies when you were 
President? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   No, it does not apply today.  
The Political Committee is chaired by the Deputy President 
of the ANC and its responsibility is as is set out in this 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 38 of 288 
 
page that you have referred to.  So right now, David 
Mabuza is the Head of the Political Committee and all the 
other members would be, in terms of their titles, would be 
the Speaker, it would be the Chief Whip, and it would be 
the Chair of NCOP and so forth.  And the others would then 
be brought in as per their members of the National 
Executive.  So it is the sub-committee of the National 
Executive Committee. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And this particularly constituted 
membership of the Political Committee that we see on this 
10 
page.  Would you be able to tell us what period this would 
have 
been 
referring 
– 
this 
would 
have 
been 
the 
composition of the Political Committee? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   It would be from the time I 
became a member of the National Assembly.  That would 
be 2014. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Indeed. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   H’m. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And would that have remained the 
case until you became President? 
20 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   That would have remained the 
case until I became President. 
ADV FREUND SC:   So,  Naledi Pandor, Baleka Mbete, 
Thandi Modise and all the other names that we read there, 
they collective for that period compromised of the Political 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 39 of 288 
 
Committee? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Indeed.   
ADV FREUND SC:   Now, I just want to read to you 
something Mr Frolick said.  I think it is really saying the 
same thing as what we read here but I just want to put it to 
you.  He says: 
“The Political Committee is an internal ANC 
structure consisting of members of Parliament 
and members of the Executive who have been 
deployed 
by 
the 
ANC 
to 
serve 
on 
that 
10 
structure. 
That structure is usually chaired and convened 
by the Deputy President...” 
 
Then I leave out something and he continues: 
“The function of the Political Committee is to 
give guidance and oversee the work of the 
deployees of the African National Congress in 
the 
National 
Assembly 
and 
also 
in 
Parliament...” 
 
And he says: 
20 
“...also to deal with any situation that may 
occur and may require further guidance...” 
 
Would you accept that? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Indeed. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now, you were not, I do not think, in 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 40 of 288 
 
Parliament at the time, that you will recall that there was a 
SCOPA Inquiry into the arms deal quite some years ago 
and 
there 
was 
some 
considerable 
controversy 
about 
whether that committee had been enabled to do what it 
thought was appropriate.  And I read recently at work, by 
an academic commentator – it is not in the bundle but I am 
quoting 
from 
Christie 
van 
der 
Westhuizen, 
Working 
Democracy, Perspective on South Africa’s Parliament at 20 
Years.  And she says this. 
She says: 
10 
“The Political Committee was formed after 
SCOPA’s inquiry in 2000 into the arms deal 
with “parenting intention to exert direct control 
over ANC and...” 
 
Do you think there is any fairness in that?  
Would you like to comment on that view? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   I think that is fanciful 
because – I guess that is her position or the author ’s 
position but what I do know is that it did become necessary 
to have a sub-committee of the ANC to give general 
20 
guidance to members of the ANC in Parliament where a 
fairly senior leader of the ANC in the form of a Deputy 
President and not the President would lead this structure 
and be able to report back to the National Executive 
Committee. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 41 of 288 
 
 
Now Parliament being what we characterise as a 
sight of struggle is seen by the ANC as a very important 
forum, really, where we need to give guidance on an 
ongoing basis, and we are involved in whose activities we 
need to get involved.  It could not just be left without any 
form of giving guidance and that to me is the correct 
political posture to take in this regard. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you.  If I could ask you to turn 
to the next page in the same bundle, Bundle 2 at page 
604?  This is the linked document from the same website of 
10 
the ANC that is headed ANC Parliamentary Caucus.  Do 
you have that? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now, I am not going to read into the 
record the whole – the detail there explains how the 
Parliamentary Caucus works but I want to draw your 
attention to the fourth paragraph, that is the one that starts 
with the Principle Tasks and the last sentence of that 
fourth paragraph, it reads as follows: 
“The ANC 
Caucus 
carries 
out 
the 
above 
20 
functions under the supervision of the Political 
Committee...” 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Would that be a fair description? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   It is.

ADV FREUND SC:   Now, the Political Committee in the 
period 2014, 2015, 2016.  Did it meet regularly? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes, it did. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Could you give us some sort of insight 
into sort of how regularly, typically it would meet? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Oh ...[intervenes]  
ADV FREUND SC:   Or is this monthly ...[intervenes]  
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   I would say ...[intervenes]  
ADV FREUND SC:   ...half-yearly?  I have got no sense. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   No, at the very least, it would 
10 
meet monthly. 
ADV FREUND SC:   At the least it would meet monthly? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Ja.   
ADV FREUND SC:   So ...[intervenes]  
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   At times whenever there were 
issues that needed to be address it would be convened.  
So it did not meet annually or six-monthly.  It would meet a 
little bit more regularly and certainly not weekly but I would 
say, at the very least, once a month. 
ADV FREUND SC:   So, therefore, if we want to understand 
20 
where does the direction of the caucus come from on 
controversial issues of the day, it is fair to look to the 
political committee. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes, it would be fair you 
looked at because there are a number of layers as well.  
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 43 of 288 
 
The Chief Whip plays a critical role in the work and the 
affairs of the political committee but the Chief Whip also 
plays another role in the affairs of parliament as well so in 
a way they have a dual role and sometimes caucus meet 
without the political committee having discussed various 
matters, caucus having to deal with current matters, 
contemporary matters on an ongoing basis in relation to 
legislation, the budget and everything else. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And you have told us a moment ago 
that although you cannot be specific and exact, the 
10 
committee – the political committee would meet probably 
no less than monthly.  Would you normally attend?  I mean, 
I am sure there might have been exceptions but was it the 
normal practice for you as Chair of the committee to be 
present at those meetings? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes, I would normally attend 
but certainly not every meeting.  Some meetings would 
take place in my absence and a member of the committee 
would be delineated to chair the meetings of the political 
committee. 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:   And if you miss meetings was there 
some process of minutes or something like that where you 
could keep yourself abreast of what might have happened 
in your absence? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Ja, I mean it was a committee 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 44 of 288 
 
so it had minutes and I would be, you know, kept abreast. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, alright.   I want to move to a 
different topic.  Sorry, just one last question on this line.  
You told us earlier that in October or November 2017, as 
Mr Frolick described, you went to address the caucus in 
support of these portfolio committee inquiries.  Can I ask 
you, in what capacity you did that, was that as chair of the 
political committee, what were you – what capacity were 
you speaking in the caucus on that occasion? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Well, it would have almost – 
10 
well, as chair of the political committee certainly because 
that was my official role in relation to the caucus, yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes.  Now I want to go back a little 
earlier, we are going to come to the debate about whether 
it was three years or five years or whatever.  This is the 
question that interests me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But well, Mr President, I think you will 
probably need to think about whether it is not five years 
because even Mr Mantashe, when he testified here, he did 
say the ANC is very slow to do things.  Did he really say 
20 
that?  We will play the recording.   
ADV FREUND SC:   Mr President, can I take you to bundle 
2, page 606? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, what is the page number? 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 45 of 288 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   606. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Bundle 2.  This is a newspaper report 
that I also discussed with Mr Mantashe a few days ago.  
There are of course many hundreds of news articles that 
we could focus on but this one I choose to illustrate an 
issue.  I would like us just to look at and understand what 
is being reported in the Sunday Times on the 27 February 
2011 under a heading – and I am speaking from memory, I 
might be wrong, but I think this was the banner headline on 
10 
the front page of the Sunday Times: 
 “Ministers ‘shiver ’ when summoned to family’s 
home.” 
And I just draw your attention to some of the allegations in 
this report. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   They shiver when they are 
summoned to whose home? 
ADV FREUND SC:   It says family’s home. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Oh, family’s home. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And the family, when one reads the 
20 
article, is the Gupta family’s home. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Oh, okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:   That is the allegation. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Oh, okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:   That is the allegation. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 46 of 288 
 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:   If you go down to about the fifth 
paragraph you will see there is a paragraph that starts: 
“A member of the working committee…” 
Do you see that? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:    
“A member of the working committee who attended 
the most recent meeting…” 
This is presumably the National Working Committee which 
10 
is the, as I understand it, the most senior day-to-day 
structure of the African National Congress. 
“A member of the working committee who attended 
the most recent meeting said: 
‘The concern is that these people (the Guptas) now 
have influence in the appointment of CEOs and 
Chairmen of state owned entities which then means 
the ANC has lost its way and its influence in these 
crucial deployments.’” 
It says two paragraphs further down: 
20 
“The Gupta brothers, Atul, Ajay and Rajesh, also 
known as Tony are said to wield so much power that 
they often summoned cabinet ministers and senior 
government officials to their family compound in 
Saxonwold, Johannesburg.” 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 47 of 288 
 
And it continues: 
“Other accusations levelled at the Guptas are that 
they telephoned at least three deputy ministers and 
told them that they were to be promoted days 
before 
Zuma 
announced 
his 
cabinet 
reshuffle; 
phoned several ministers to assure them that their 
jobs were secure ahead of Zuma’s announcement; 
bragged about their influence, telling one ANC 
Premier that he was fortunate they went to his 
office to see him, as many other public officials had 
10 
to meet them at the Gupta’s home; pressured 
several 
top 
officials 
at 
the 
government 
communications’ 
section 
and 
directors 
of 
communication 
at 
various 
departments; 
placed 
advertisements in their newspaper at the New Age.” 
And then in the middle of the page: 
“A 
member 
of 
the 
working 
committee 
claimed 
ministers feared the family believing they had too 
much influence over Zuma, ‘people are scared of 
them and they are called to their house all the 
20 
time’.  The Guptas are known to be the President’s 
people and that is why even ministers shiver.  
Another top ANC leader said you must see the way 
they treat ministers.” 
Now, Mr President, I understand this is merely a report in 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 48 of 288 
 
the Sunday Times but it is a report purporting to quote off 
the record very senior ANC personnel making very serious 
allegations.  Do you accept, Mr President, that if those 
allegations were true, a matter yet to be determined 
certainly at that time and perhaps still by this Commission, 
but if those allegations were true, they reveal a subversion 
of our constitutional order.  I see you nod? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   I nod, yes.  Yes indeed, I 
mean, if these were true, they would be because our 
constitutional architecture is such that things like the 
10 
appointment of ministers, deputy ministers, should be the 
sole preserve of the President and there should really be 
no one who goes around offering people positions like that 
and telling him that you will be fired, you will be this and 
that and that.  No, it would be subversion. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And they same when we look at the 
section dealing with the SOEs.  You remember I read you 
the passage: 
“The 
concern 
is 
that 
these 
people 
now 
have 
influence in the appointment of CEOs and chairmen 
20 
of 
state 
owned 
entities 
and 
influenced 
those 
deployments.” 
That too would be a subversion of our constitution on legal 
order. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Precisely, that too would be a 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 49 of 288 
 
subversion particularly coming from people who have no 
real role either in the executive or even in the party and 
that, to me, would be unbecoming. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now we have agreed this morning that 
when 
there 
are 
allegations 
that 
implicate 
a 
senior 
executive, parliament has a constitutional duty to get to 
the bottom, to investigate those allegations and to act 
appropriately in accordance with what emerges, with the 
benefit of hindsight at least.  And do you agree that then 
parliament should have been starting to investigate the 
10 
veracity or otherwise of these allegations? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   I do agree that parliament 
has a role and when it comes to allegations of this nature, 
I would say it is the governing party that should activate its 
own processes and I guess where it fails, it then needs to 
yes, rely on parliamentary processes or structures.  That 
would need to go beyond just newspaper article, they 
would need to have much more substantive information 
which is why the Gupta emails saga presented much more 
weighty information that needed to be followed up, so it 
20 
was no longer just an allegation, there was real substance 
with documents and what amounted – or adhered to the 
real evidence that could be followed through.   
 
So whilst I agree that yes, parliament structures 
should – they need to do so based on more substantive 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 50 of 288 
 
information such as they did when they started their 
activist process. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes but, Mr President, as you well 
know, the Gupta Leaks were more than five years after 
this. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   So for more than five years these 
allegations – and this is one example and I am sure you 
were aware that there were literally hundreds of articles. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:   Making allegations of this character.  
For more than five years, I want to put to you, parliament, 
as a matter of fact, did not investigate, hold inquiries or do 
what was appropriate to investigate the veracity of these 
facts.  Do you accept that? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   I accept that and I concede 
that and it is for that reason that in 2012, the decision that 
I referred you to which you gladly showed me the relevant 
passages of the resolutions of – was then taken because, 
Chairperson, it was realised that we now need to activate 
20 
another arm to go into this much more deeply than the ANC 
itself could and that was the parliamentary process and 
yes, as you said earlier, there was a dropping of the ball, if 
I may say so, at that level.  That will be conceded. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And just to get certainty, I assume that 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 51 of 288 
 
the conference to which you have referred, the 2012 
conference, like all conferences, as I recall, take place in 
December, so it would have been December 2012 that that 
resolution was taken. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Indeed. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now in your affidavit at page 41 in 
bundle 1. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   48 you say? 
ADV FREUND SC:   41 I said. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Got it. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:   Just before I ask you about that, there 
was a question I omitted to ask.  When the Sunday Times 
report 
appeared 
and 
other 
reports 
in 
the 
Mail 
and 
Guardian, Business Day, various other media, the then 
Secretary General Mr Gwede Mantashe issued a statement, 
he said these allegations are simply racist.  Do you agree 
with the benefit of hindsight there was no basis for that 
response? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes, with the benefit of 
hindsight I think all of us would agree that our reading and 
20 
interpretation of a whole lot of things that happened then 
was blinded by the events of the time and that is why, 
Chairperson, I will comment the role of the media.  The 
media has played a phenomenal role in investigating state 
capture and bringing it to light and continuously reporting 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 52 of 288 
 
on it and at times, as politicians, we do not always believe 
what the media writes because we look at what they write 
through a particular prism or lens but in this regard I have 
to commend them, the media, that is, for the role – 
phenomenal role that they have played and I would say 
they played a patriotic role and possibly I have never ever 
said patriotic role and I am prepared to say it now, that 
they have been patriotic in the way that they have followed 
all these matters through and they often make us very 
uncomfortable as politicians but in this case, we will 
10 
applaud.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I must just say, Mr President, for 
what it is worth, I think I have said it before, I too think 
that the media played a very important role and facilitated 
to a very large extent, because of their investigation, the 
work of this Commission.  There is a lot of assistance that 
this Commission in its investigations found in material that 
was unearthed by the media in their own investigations, in 
their articles, so there is no doubt that they have really  
played an very important role. 
20 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   If I may add, Chairperson, 
that 
is 
why 
when 
they 
are 
targeted 
with 
threats,  
sometimes 
when 
they 
are 
attacked 
physically 
and 
sometimes when they are harmed and sometimes killed, it 
is an affront against democracy and what our country 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 53 of 288 
 
stands for and I have read in one of the affidavits that one 
journalist, Adriaan Basson, was threatened to a point 
where he needed to pen down an affidavit detailing the 
threat that he was subjected to as he was investigating, 
trying to ferret corruption and unlawful contracts that had 
been awarded.  So it is important for our country to stand 
firm in defence of a human right that is enshrined in our 
constitution about the freedom of the press and upholding 
the right of journalists to do their work and to report on 
these types of matters however uncomfortable it might 
10 
make us feel. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Freund? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr President, I had 
referred you to page 41, I had in mind paragraph 93.  I do 
not want to unduly belabour this point and I think you have 
touched on this paragraph yesterday with Mr Pretorius, but 
you will recall this is the incident where Minister Fikile 
Mbalula 
according 
to 
other 
evidence 
before 
the 
Commission, there was quite an outburst at this NEC 
meeting and amongst the things that he said at the time 
20 
was that he had been told by the Guptas, I think some two 
weeks or so before his appointment as minister that he was 
to appointed as minister.  You say in your affidavit yes, 
that is quite right, I recall the incident.  You say – and I am 
sure it is quite right, the ANC did not really act in response 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 54 of 288 
 
to that but you also said that: 
“For me the statement did not at the time prompt 
any specific concerns about the capture of the 
state.” 
Now I would just like to re-examine that statement in the 
light of the very article we have just looked at, the Sunday 
Times article which preceded it.  It preceded it by three or 
four months.  That was one of the core allegations made in 
that article, not specifically by name with reference to that 
specific minister, but now you have a minister standing up 
10 
in an NEC, I do not know if he was standing up or sitting 
down, but certainly expressing his view forcefully.  Surely 
this must have been of very much greater concern and 
really ought to have elicited quite a different reaction given 
what was already being alleged in the public domain then 
to really just make the point well, it did not raise any 
specific concerns at the time. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes indeed and to quite a 
number of it did not raise at the time the concern that it 
should have evoked in us when one looks at it with the 
20 
benefit of hindsight and that one is prepared to concede it 
did not and when one looks back at, including even the 
article that you are referring to, you will almost kick 
yourself in the foot and say these were the signs that we 
needed to pay attention to, the lights were flashing amber 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 55 of 288 
 
and we should have been more alert at looking at them, but 
we did not at the time. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now, Mr President, if I can refer you to 
another article at page 609 in bundle 2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Page 609 in bundle 2.  We are now in 
2013, in May of 2013 and three paragraphs from the bottom 
of page 609, Mr Mantashe is reported by The Star as 
saying this – not saying this, it is reported: 
“Mantashe allegedly went so far as to tell some 
10 
ministers to have the backbone and to refuse to 
take instructions from the Guptas.” 
If you think back to that time were the members of the 
political committee already of the view that there was a 
problem of ministers taking instructions from the Guptas 
and the need for them to backbone to resist such 
instructions? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Well, this was 2013, I was not 
yet a member of parliament again. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Ah, correct. 
20 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   I had been elected President 
– Deputy President, rather, but I was not yet in parliament. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of the ANC? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes, Deputy President of the 
ANC. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 56 of 288 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Deputy President of the ANC, yes. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   I was not yet a member of 
parliament and so could not have been Chair of the 
political committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But of course just for the sake of 
completeness, 
being 
Deputy 
President 
of 
the 
ANC 
obviously you would have been a member of the NEC. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes, I was a member of the 
NEC, indeed. 
ADV FREUND SC:   I think the point you make is a fair 
10 
point, that you were not on that political committee in 2013 
and therefore, certain questions that I would otherwise 
have asked I will not ask but I want to fast-forward now.  
We were in 2011, we were in 2013, I want to fast-forward 
to February of 2016. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And can I take you to page 612, 
bundle 2?  This is an article reporting in some detail on 
what you yourself was saying publicly in February of 2016.  
The article starts as follows: 
20 
“Deputy 
President 
Cyril 
Ramaphosa 
says 
the 
ongoing review into the performance of state owned 
enterprises will go a long way into rooting out the 
capture of government institutions by politically 
connected individuals for personal gain.” 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 57 of 288 
 
Now I presume you are fairly quoted in saying that? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Indeed. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And I presume it seems to be a matter 
of logic that what that necessarily implies is that by 
February 2016 you personally were of the view that there 
was a need to root out the capture of government 
institutions by politically connected individuals for their 
personal gain. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes, I agree with that. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And then you will recall that in March 
10 
of 2016 a minister or Deputy Minister Mcebisi Jonas made 
a 
public 
statement 
and 
his 
statement 
included, 
that 
according to him, the Guptas represented that they could 
have been appointed as the Finance Minister and that they 
offered him a huge bribe if he would do their bidding, if 
appointed.  I am sure that came to your attention at the 
time when that statement was made. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Indeed. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now did you or the political committee 
in March of 2016 have any reason to doubt the credibility 
20 
of Mr Jonas when he made those allegations? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   No, I personally did not doubt 
the credibility thereof but …[intervenes] 
ADV FREUND SC:   And – sorry, I interrupted you. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   But we sat in a process 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 58 of 288 
 
through the ANC itself through the Secretary General’s 
office to engage with Mcebisi Jonas so that we could go to 
the bottom of it. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now that is where I think the tension 
between your views and the questions I am putting now 
starts to emerge because if I hear you, I hear you to be 
saying the proper way to deal with this is to deal with this 
internally through the party structures. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   H’m. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And I want to put to you for your 
10 
comment that there is nothing wrong with that happening, 
of course the party is entitled internally to address its own 
internal affairs. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   But when allegations of this type – and 
of course it was not just an allegation, of the Hogan’s 
allegations, 
Mentor ’s 
allegations 
and 
lot 
so 
other 
allegations were made at that time.  When allegations of 
that type were made, was it not incumbent on the political 
committee, recognising what we recognised at the outset of 
20 
your evidence this morning, to see to it that the National 
Assembly probe these inquiries and investigate it? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Fair enough, I think we 
obviously initially wanted to get to the bottom of this 
through the party structure and that does not mean that we 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 59 of 288 
 
did not believe that it could not be better done but as you 
will have seen, it may well have taken a number of months 
but it was then when the parliamentary structures became 
activated to look into these matters.   
When we realised that the party structures had their 
limitations, serious limitations, even Secretary General at 
the time did say there is just no way we can investigate 
this matter and get to bottom of it and the best way would 
be through the structures that we are part of in parliament 
to go into this matter.  I would not immediately say whether 
10 
this one was then referred for such an investigation, I think 
the accumulation of all these matters then prompted, I 
would say again, the activation of the resolution that we 
took, that we now needed to have a much more activist 
parliament that would look into these matters and that is 
when a flurry of activity then commenced starting off, as 
the late Jackson Mthembu says in his affidavit, and he 
says that was the turning point when some of these 
committees then started their work of looking closely into 
all these matters.  And a turning point had to be reached 
20 
because it was just a flood and a flurry of all these, so – 
but that is how it happened. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you.  Can I ask you please to 
go to page 619 in volume 2? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 60 of 288 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   There you will find a letter, about 
which quite a lot of evidence has been led already, from 
Natasha 
Mazzone, 
the 
shadow 
Minister 
of 
Public 
Enterprises, she was the then chairperson of the portfolio 
committee on Public Enterprises, page 619, are you with 
me?   Page 619 in Bundle 2 it should be a letter 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   This is the bundle that had the article 
that we just talked about, page 619, black numbers. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   619, oh, I am looking at 618 
10 
sorry about that. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Not at all. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Ja, yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   That you will see is the letter dated 
the 14 t h of March 2016, which is very much the period we 
just been talking about addressed by the Shadow Minister 
of 
Public 
Enterprises, 
Natasha 
Mazzone, 
to 
the 
Chairperson 
of 
the 
Portfolio 
Committee 
on 
Public 
Enterprises, requesting that the Portfolio Committee on 
Public Enterprises conducts a full Parliamentary inquiry 
20 
into the capture of SOE’s by the Gupta’s, it refers to a 
number of allegations of undue influence that had been 
raised in relationship with Gupta’s involvement in a number 
of State owned enterprises.  
And asks that the Gupta’s be summoned to appear 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 61 of 288 
 
that, amongst others Minister Gigaba being summoned to 
appear that SOE’s and Chairpersons of the largest SOE’s 
be summoned to appear, and the evidence says that the 
committee, because of the view taken by the African 
National Congress members of Parliament refused to 
conduct that inquiry.  
Now, my first question to you is this with the benefit 
of hindsight, do you agree that that was ill advised and it 
would have been far better had they exceeded to that 
request? 
10 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes, it was ill advised as it 
turns out, this mistake, this error was then corrected as we 
moved forward, as set out in late Jackson Mthembu’s 
affidavit, where he says these committees started being 
very active, but at the time, I would say it was ill advised. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now, Mr President, this would have 
been a measure of great sensitivity, I assume, whether or 
not at that time in our history, a Portfolio Committee should 
or should not accede to a request for a public inquiry of 
the type we seeing here.  Did this matter come before the 
20 
Political Committee for guidance? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Not in that direct manner, it 
did not come to the Political Committee in that direct 
manner. What obviously was being discussed on an 
ongoing basis was these concerns that were continuously 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 62 of 288 
 
being raised, and to find a way of having to deal with them.  
And also, to find a way we would have discussed a 
way of empowering our Portfolio Committees to be able to 
take up the issues and in many ways, because the ANC 
was the leading party in Parliament, it needed to be 
activated by the ANC as well and when it was, then I would 
not want to say all hell broke loose but that is when the 
process really started in earnest. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Can I refer you Mr President, to the 
article at page 621 in the same bundle.  
10 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes, 621, yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   You will see it is an article dated the 
8 t h, if I read it correctly, the 8 t h sorry it is the 29 t h of March 
2016, a week or two after that request that we just looked 
at from Ms Mazzone and it is dealing with the ANC's 
response to that request under the headline, ANC: 
“DA’s 
claims 
of 
support 
for 
Gupta 
probe 
is 
delusional.” 
And then in the second paragraph, you will see that, 
according to a statement issued by the African National 
20 
Congress: 
“The DA Chief Whips ridiculous claims in the media 
that the ANC Chief Whip, Jackson Mthembu has 
agreed 
the 
DA’s 
opportunistic 
proposal 
for 
Parliament to institute an investigation into the 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 63 of 288 
 
alleged State Capture by the Gupta family are 
imaginary and baseless.” 
This is the ANC in a statement attributed to the office of 
the party's Chief Whip, and then if I can take you to the 
next page, the 3 r d last paragraph, starting with the ANC: 
“The ANC said only a delusional misapprehension 
would 
interpret 
this 
clear 
assertion 
on 
Parliamentary debates to mean that the ANC chief 
whip supports the DA’s proposal for Parliamentary 
investigation into alleged State influenced by the 
10 
Gupta family.” 
Now, Mr President, this must call into question the 
commitment that you say was expressed in the preceding 
national conference about the need to utilise Parliament as 
an instrument for oversight.   
Again, with the benefit of hindsight, is this not an 
entirely regrettable stance that was adopted by the African 
National Congress in relation to Parliamentary oversight? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Well, I think these types of 
responses should be seen within the context of the fulcrum 
20 
of 
contestation 
between 
various 
political 
parties 
in 
Parliament and revolve around when an issue is raised.   
How it is raised, who raises it, but as you can see, 
there was an interaction between the then Chief Whip of 
the ANC, late Mthembu and representatives of the other 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 64 of 288 
 
party and their discussion could have led to something 
which the two of them could have had an understanding 
around it.  
But in the end, as matters were evolving there was 
that contestation, but I think what we should be grateful for 
is that our democracy much as it is a young democracy and 
a recent democracy at that it is developing, it is growing 
and maturing, maturing to a point where now in 2016/2017, 
we started seeing a see change on matters like these 
where issues that had been raised were now being properly 
10 
and fully entertained, and so the process was developing 
and growing. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Mr President, can I refer you to page 
624, please in Bundle 2.  Now, this is the beginning of an 
extract, where you will see it is from Hansard and it relates 
to allegations of State Capture by certain individuals and 
there alleged undue influence of the government and we 
have the whole Hansard quote. 
But if I can then take you what is really pertinent, 
which is at page 654. 
20 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   654? 
ADV FREUND SC:   654. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   There you will see that one Mr 
Maimane of the Democratic Alliance moves a motion in the 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 65 of 288 
 
House on the floor of the National Assembly, do you have 
it? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes.  
ADV FREUND SC:   And the motion is that the House, 
1. notes the allegations of State Capture by certain 
individuals and their alleged undue influence 
over the government; 
2. Establishes an ad hoc Committee in terms of 
Rule 2531A. 
The committee, 
10 
2A Investigate the alleged capture of State 
resources and undue influence over the 
government.  
B 
recommend 
measures 
in 
line 
with 
the 
assembly's oversight constitutional mandate 
to prevent such incidents from occurring.” 
And then it goes on to propose how this should be 
constituted.  Now it is a matter of record that the ANC 
caucus voted against this motion and what I have not 
specifically referred you to is what appears on the next 
20 
page, at page 655. 
There you will see that a counter motion was 
proposed, and the counter motion was far from Parliament 
appointing an ad hoc Committee to investigate.  
What the African National Congress proposed was 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 66 of 288 
 
the following, to be replaced with the following: 
2: 
“Refers all such allegations of State Capture to the 
SA Police Service or Chapter Nine Institutions for 
investigation including the Public Protector.” 
3: 
“Notes that all parties and individual members of 
Parliament with evidence of such alleged State 
Capture should make available such evidence to the 
Police Service or Chapter Nine Institution.” 
10 
And 4: 
“Further notes that such investigations by either 
Police Service or a Chapter Nine Institution should 
culminate 
in 
prosecution 
of 
all 
individuals 
or 
companies engaged in such State Capture if such is 
proved as a criminal activity.” 
Now, that seems to be in line with aligning of evidence in 
your affidavit about the approach adopted by the NEC.  
The NEC’s approach was, as I understand it, on the one 
hand, there was in March of 2016, a proposal that if 
20 
persons with information of relevance, would please come 
to 
the 
officers 
of 
the 
African 
National 
Congress, 
presumably to the Secretary General's office, they can 
bring them information or to go to the Police or other 
institutions.  
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 67 of 288 
 
But what seems absolutely clear, I want to put to 
you for comment, is that there was a very determined 
resistance 
and 
unwillingness 
that 
Parliament 
should 
exercise what you have said this morning was its duty, in 
the 
face 
of 
these 
sorts 
of 
accusations, 
a 
complete 
unwillingness to enable Parliament to investigate and 
exercise oversight, again, with the benefit of hindsight, do 
you accept that is fair? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Let me put it this way, I think, 
at the time Chairperson, the thinking would clearly have 
10 
been, which of the structures we have got, we have in the 
State 
that 
would 
have 
a 
greater 
effectiveness 
of 
investigating these matters and coming to a conclusion 
that prosecutorial processes should commence.  And at 
this stage, rather than say it was distance as such to have 
these matters investigated, I would say no.  
It was thought at the time that the other institutions 
the Public Protector, the Police, would possibly have a 
much better grip on all these matters because they would 
go way beyond maybe what Parliament can do, they would 
20 
immediately if they find fault have prosecutorial powers.  
But if you look at it with hindsight, I would say the 
two would not be mutually exclusive and if anything, both 
checks 
could 
easily 
have 
been 
followed. 
 
The 
Parliamentary process, as well as another more effective 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 68 of 288 
 
investigative process.   
So I would not say it was a cop out, I think it was 
then the alternative motion that was being put on the table 
was let us get this done more effectively to the extent that 
it could. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Can I refer you please, Mr President, 
back to your affidavit in Bundle 1 at page 52. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Oh, Bundle 1. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Bundle 1. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes, indeed, I apologise for 
10 
that. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Not at all. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   I am looking at the wrong 
bundle, yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   You will recall this is in your own 
affidavit, paragraph 125.  You say: 
“It is clear from Mr Mthembu’s account, and you are 
referring there to the affidavit he submitted to the 
Commission, that the determination of the ANC in 
Parliament to probe these allegations was both a 
20 
response to the evidence of wrongdoing that was 
accumulating 
in 
the 
public 
domain 
and 
the 
implementation of the decisions taken by the ANC’s 
constitutional 
structures, 
especially 
at 
NEC 
to 
ensure proper investigation into these allegations.” 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 69 of 288 
 
Now, what I want to put to you for comment, is this we will 
come in a moment with further committee’s investigations 
and how successful they were or were not.  
But what I want to put to you at the moment for 
comment is that it is simply not correct as a matter of fact, 
that prior to the further clatters Parliament, the ANC in 
Parliament in response to evidence of wrongdoing that was 
accumulating was determined in Parliament to probe these 
allegations.  The true fact of the matter is; it was 
determined not to probe them in Parliament.  Is that not 
10 
correct? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Well, I would not say so that 
it was not determined to probe them in Parliament, I would 
say it was determined to have them probed. I mean, 
initially there was inertia, there was not much movement 
that we will concede and when it became clear that the 
evidence was just accumulating. Initially, the thinking was, 
investigate them through your law enforcement agencies or 
your chapter -  one of your Chapter Nine Institutions and in 
the end, the Parliamentary process or the Parliamentary 
20 
track was then activated, go ahead.  
I think where you could say there was fault 
Chairperson was the delay in having it done and I would be 
the first to concede that, that there was a delay, which 
should have been done a lot earlier. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 70 of 288 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   May I should say at this stage Mr 
President, because I wanted to say it but I was going to 
say it later because Mr Freund has got a certain amount of 
time to use, and I want him to use it.  
I was going to ask you exactly that, whether the 
delay in acting both in respect of the ANC as a party and in 
respect of Parliament and maybe one should focus both in 
regard of the fact that the majority of MP’s are ANC.  
Whether the delay was not was not acceptable particularly 
for me, quite a platform what was coming out in the media, 
10 
but also taking that into account after the Waterkloof 
landing. 
That the ANC and Parliament took a number of 
years after 2013, the Waterkloof landing was in end of April 
2013, that they took another three years or so – June 
2017, that is now the Portfolio Committee has to start 
being active.  It seems to me to be a delay that is difficult 
to accept you know, and we also factor the same in regard 
to the ANC to say, with what Mr Fikile Mbalula had said at 
the NEC meeting in 2011, with what was in the media after 
20 
that certainly the ANC ought to have done something much 
earlier than it did to say something needs to be done.  
This is this is something that needs to be done 
urgently.  I do not know whether you want to comment on 
that Mr President, I just think 2017 was too far and there 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 71 of 288 
 
seems to have been enough that had happened for the 
ANC and Portfolio Committees and Parliament to have 
acted much earlier and if they had done so, it may well be 
that some of the damage that happened in the meantime 
may have been avoided. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Chairperson, I did say in my 
opening statement that I am not here to make any excuses. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you did Mr President. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   And I also said that I am not 
here to defend the indefensible.  I also said that, yes, I am 
10 
also here to explain.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Some of the lapses that 
happened and what I can say is that, yes, you are 
absolutely right, Chairperson, DCJ, in saying that the delay 
to reaction to all this was not a correct way to handle 
matters and I will concede to that, and I did also say that 
in my opening statement that because we are a political 
organism, 
and 
there 
are 
continuous 
debates 
and 
contestations and even in society, and in the ANC, a 
20 
contestation on the existence of State Capture, continued 
for quite a while.  
And I guess it will continue, right until you present 
your report, because there are those in the nation who 
deny that there was State Capture and indeed, in many 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 72 of 288 
 
sectors of society and organisations the same obtains, as 
it does in the ANC as well.  So that amount of contestation 
about matters of this nature could in many ways have led 
also to the delayed reaction.  
And these contestations do take place, as I said 
without bemoaning the point in various organisations. What 
we should be grateful for Deputy Chief Justice is that we 
have now arrived as the African National Congress, the 
point where, as I said, the majority, majority of members of 
the African National Congress agreed that State Capture is 
10 
something that militates against the interests of our people 
at a social and economic level, and it also weakens our 
own organisation, as it gives rise to all manner of 
challenges like factionalism and divisions.  
But what is good is that we are now here.  Many 
other leaders of the ANC have appeared here.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   And so am I and to agree with 
you that delay did not serve our country well.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:    But we are here to take 
corrective measures and say we have got a country that 
belongs to all of us, let us work together to build this 
country going forward.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, Mr Freund. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 73 of 288 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you, Mr President.  I have very 
little time remaining so certain issues I would have covered 
with you I am going to leave but there are two aspects that 
I would like to wrap up with.  The first is if I could refer you 
to page 74 in Bundle 1. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Of Bundle 1, 74. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Your own affidavit. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   You yourself make the point and with 
respect correctly, we say this, this is paragraph 167.2 at 
10 
page 74: 
“The ability of any organisation, but especially a 
political 
formation 
to 
act 
on 
allegations 
of 
malfeasance relies not only on its formal rules and 
procedures, but also on the balance of power within 
its structures.” 
The question I want to ask you is whether you accept and 
if you do accept if you could elaborate a little that 
precisely this factor, the balance of power within ANC 
structures, actually, is the true explanation for the delays 
20 
that you now say, of the benefit of hindsight regrettable?  
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes, I would say so, this is 
precisely the point I was making to you, Chairperson that 
there 
has 
been 
contestation, 
in 
terms 
of 
even 
understanding what State Capture is, is it the capture of 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 74 of 288 
 
the judiciary?  Is it the capture of the executive? Is it the 
capture of which arm of the State? 
So 
those 
contestations 
have 
ensued, 
and 
the 
preponderance of views now in the African National 
Congress, is that, there has been a major problem and as I 
said, yesterday, has been a massive system failure and we 
need to correct what has happened in the past and chart a 
new path, a completely different path of our country and 
correct the wrongs of the past.  
I think that is generally accepted and that is the 
10 
balance of understanding, the balance of conviction, and 
the balance of conscience as well.  That I am also 
addressing here. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Mr President finally, I want to turn to a 
very controversial question, which has been much debated 
before the Commission and precisely because it has been 
much debated I will leave it in the hands of the Chair, to 
what extent he wishes me to pursue this.  But it is the 
question of party discipline, and party instructions in 
relation to questions such as the votes of no confidence, 
20 
which is part of a bigger question, and the bigger question, 
which you address in your affidavit, and will be part of the 
record should of course be taken into consideration by the 
Commission.   
But the bigger question is, whether having regard to 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 75 of 288 
 
the oath of office of MP’s…[intervene] 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Towards, sorry? 
ADV FREUND SC:   To the oath of office taken by MP’s 
which we debated right at the outset, there are issues on 
which the party must accept that whatever views it would 
prefer its MP’s to take there comes a point at which the 
duty of the member is to act in accordance with the 
members 
own 
understanding 
of 
the 
constitutional 
obligations and where necessary, to vote, as for example, 
Dr Makhosi Khoza did on the vote of no confidence.  
10 
Now, as I read your affidavit you are a little 
equivocal but if I have to say, where do you finally come 
down, I think you have come down on the point of view that 
an ANC MP, must simply accept party discipline and do as 
told.  And what I want to explore with you is whether I 
understand you correctly, or whether you accept that there 
comes a point that there must be an exception to that rule. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Our political system is 
granted by our Constitution is that of a party system under 
where representatives that are elected by our people vote 
20 
to represent their party.  That is our system, they do not go 
and represent themselves and their jacket.  
That being said, though, they do take an oath, as 
each member of Parliament goes into their position and the 
oath that they take places the Constitution and the country 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 76 of 288 
 
and the nation first and we accept that but in order for the 
party to put a member in Parliament, they do not put 
themselves there.  
Notwithstanding the decisions of the Constitutional 
Court recently, they are transported, as it were, by the 
party to be in Parliament and the party functions as a 
collective on all matters, we – that is why we have a 
caucus and this happens all over the world.  We have 
adopted a Westminster system you know has the caucus 
system as well where members of parliament of a particular 
10 
party will meet on their own, collectively take decisions on 
how to approach certain issues that are debated in 
parliament.  So there is a party line on all issues, even 
where there is a single member who will propose the bill, 
the party basically coalesces around behind that member.  
 
Given that that is the case, the party itself will 
insist on party discipline and insist that we vote together, 
but that vote is also inspired or based on discussions that 
happen in the party, there are study groups where people 
study 
issues 
very 
intricately 
and 
there 
are 
party 
20 
discussions in the party itself and in the caucus so that 
informs the understanding and indeed the conscience of 
members to vote as they would.  
 
However, there are matters Chairperson where the 
individual conscience of a member would be such that it 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 77 of 288 
 
would compel them to act and vote in a particular way and 
that too needs to be discussed.  It needs to be put on the 
table.   
 
In our past we have had votes on issues such as 
termination of pregnancy where certain members have had 
strong religious views that are based on religious affiliation 
and those have had to be discussed, and in those cases an 
allowance has been made that your religious affiliation and 
your conscience needs to be given consideration and that 
is brought to bear on what needs to happen. 
10 
 
But in the main I must say with the current political 
dispensation we have it is the party line that is followed 
and followed all over the world.  We, it was of great 
interest to watch what was happening in the United States 
recently, where and I do not know whether they have a 
caucus system like we have in their congress and senate, 
where members voted slightly differently from the party line 
and that led to a lot of ostracisation and a whole lot of 
other challenges that some of those members have.  
 
Because there is a down side to doing things like 
20 
that, but when your conscience drives you I guess you are 
prepared to take the downside.  So whilst you may argue 
that I am equivocal, I am a party person.  So I am a party 
animal because and have to be because I am the president 
of the ANC. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 78 of 288 
 
 
If I am to be faltered, let me be faltered on that.  
But I do however open a window to look at issues of 
conscience that drive particular individuals who want to 
bark the trend, who want to go against what a party might 
well want, and that is often exceptional.  
 
It is not often the rule by and large members of a 
party, certainly the members of the ANC will always want to 
go along with the party rules, but I think former secretary 
general Mantashe addresses this quite pointedly in his 
affidavit, because on a matter which Mr Freund refers to of 
10 
a vote of no confidence, where anyone outside would say 
you know, vote as you wish. 
 
He argues that you have got to look very, very 
closely at the consequences of that action because you 
need to look at if you vote to you know remove and we 
have done that within the party ourselves, we remove a 
president through a vote of no confidence.  
 
What then ensues because when you do that, you 
are actually imploding the executive.  You are imploding it 
and you have got to do all manner of things to reconstitute 
20 
that and members then had to ask themselves is that what 
we want, and certainly if that is the desire which is 
collectively agreed to, then that is what should be opted 
for.  
 
But we are actually saying you need to analyse the 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 79 of 288 
 
situation very carefully so that we just do not run blindly 
into something that is emotionally charged.  I hope that 
helps you. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Ja, thank you Mr President.  Chair, I 
think my time is up and unless there is anything you would 
like me to pursue further. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, that is fine.  I know that you cannot 
be with us for a long time, as I understand the position.  I 
do want to take this issue further with the president after 
the tea break.  I thought he would.  I definitely want to.  So 
10 
if you are still around. 
ADV FREUND SC:  I am certainly here Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  So I think let us take the 
tea adjournment and then we can take it further.  Okay, it 
is twenty past eleven.  Let us take the tea break.  We will 
resume at twenty five to twelve.  We adjourn.   
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay so I will have some – few questions 
for the President in regard to the last question you raised Mr 
20 
Freund and his answer.   
 
Now Mr President from what you have said it is quite 
clear that you accept that it is very important that Parliament 
should perform its functions of oversight properly and should 
hold the executive accountable. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 80 of 288 
 
 
You agree?  Ja. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  My apologies I do agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  What you have just (inaudible). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and of course you referred also to one 
of the resolutions of the National Conference of the ANC in 
2012 in terms of which the conference resolved that you 
know Parliament should be more active which you explained 
includes performing its oversight functions as I understand it 
properly. 
10 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  That’s alright. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you would accept too would you not 
that the provisions relating to the vote of no confidence in 
the constitution constitute part of the mechanisms that the 
constitution makes available to Parliament in order to hold 
the executive accountable. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  I have – I accept and I agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Would you also accept that the oath 
20 
of office to which Mr Freund referred earlier on means that 
the members of Parliament have got to put the interests of 
the people of South Africa first? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  I accept and I agree to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:    You agree to that? 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 81 of 288 
 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Now when there is a motion of no 
confidence 
placed 
before 
members 
of 
Parliament 
my 
understanding is this and I just want you to comment 
whether you agree with my understanding.   
 
My understanding is that what each member of 
Parliament is called upon to do is to ask himself the question 
or herself the question do I still have confidence in this 
President? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You agree? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now  
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Or do we collectively have 
confidence? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well  
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  (Speaking in vernacular). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr President.  So now if that is the correct 
question that each member of Parliament is called upon to 
answer is the position not that when his or her political party 
20 
instructs her or him to vote in a particular way irrespective of 
what her position is as to whether she still has confidence in 
this President or not is that not that should not be right?  
Because she has taken an oath this is a constitutional 
obligation that the constitution contemplates he or she 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 82 of 288 
 
should perform – she thinks I have lost confidence in this 
President.  It is not in the interest of the people of South 
Africa that he or she should continue to be President.  He or 
she is taking the country somewhere else. That is what she 
or he believes so if the party says no, no, no vote a different 
way is that not acceptable in the constitutional framework 
that we are talking about within her oath of office and within 
the context of the question that he or she is called upon to 
answer? 
PRESIDENT 
RAMAPHOSA: 
 
Yes 
Chairperson 
it 
is 
a 
10 
controversial issue and there is a tension between. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  And let me say we are not the 
only ones who are postulating or thinking about this – this 
matter.  We are not the only ones in the world even your 
oldest democracies are at this point in time deliberating over 
these types of matters. 
 
The constitution obviously looks and in a way there is 
a bit of a schizophrenic type of relationship that – because 
the constitution has given rise to a party system in our 
20 
constitution but at the same time in terms of our con – the 
very same constitution in terms of what the Constitutional 
Court decided recently about the freedom of every person to 
exercise their own political rights has actually said you stand 
as an individual.   
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 83 of 288 
 
 
But we also have a constitution where a member 
takes as I was saying earlier their oath as an individual and 
pledging their loyalty to the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Their country 
PRESIDENT 
RAMAPHOSA: 
 
Republic 
and 
to 
the 
constitution.  So there is a tension that is created there.  But 
political parties by their nature have what you could call a 
herd mentality so like cattle they move together as a herd.  
So that being the case we do say and I do say that there is 
always an exception for one or two or a few members of the 
10 
herd to hold different views but the general rule of thumb in 
a party system is that you go along the party 00:07:26 or 
party line.  And in exceptional circumstances for instance 
where there is a major risk to democracy where it is clear 
that the conscience of a particular or particular members is 
driving 
them 
towards 
saying 
we 
have 
got 
to 
defend 
democracy and one of the ways we can defend democracy is 
to go against what the herd who believes should be the 
direction.  So I would argue yes that is allowable but it is an 
exception because the general rule of thumb is party 
20 
discipline and if you look even at our current parties and in – 
you will find that even other parties in our system are much 
more disciplinarian than the ANC where if you violate party 
rules you get dismissed and get fired instantly without even 
a hearing and the ANC has tended to have a slightly more 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 84 of 288 
 
liberal type of approach to this. 
 
Also with a view of saying we want to herd everyone 
in the same direction. So in exceptional circumstances where 
democracy is at risk or where there is a real conscientious 
member who believes that my religion, my certain beliefs are 
propelling me to go in a different direction it is a matter that 
should be discussed and this being a party system it is 
allowable that it should discussed, it should be understood 
and then in the end the party leadership will say we will 
allow that.  And they would then be free to vote in whatever 
10 
way. 
 
So whilst I tend to follow more to what is party 
discipline there is the other if you like liberal side of me that 
says you – you can actually have an exception where 
conscientiousness as well as a risk to democracy has to be 
00:10:06 attention.  That is what I would say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course the position would be most of 
the time I guess that whoever is President of the country 
because the vote no confidence is directed I think … 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  At the President you mean? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the President. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  The President of the country will I 
think almost always be … 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  The victim. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 85 of 288 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The – ja – or the target – or the target.  
But also the – the President of the country is likely to be 
most of the time the President of the majority party. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he is – he or she is President of the 
majority party because he or she enjoys majority support in 
the party.  And if she or he enjoys majority support in the 
party he or she is likely to enjoy majority support among 
members of Parliamentary of that party in Parliament. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Indeed. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if that is so it may well be that the 
issue of a vote of no confidence – I mean the mechanism of 
accountability of the vote of no confidence which is meant to 
keep the President on his or her toes will be rendered 
ineffective if the President will know that there is no way 
Parliament can pass a vote of no confidence in me because 
my party will never allow that.  What do you say to that? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Well I think any President 
should want to serve the people and the country knowing 
that they enjoy the support of the Parliament if not the entire 
20 
Parliament the majority of the members of the Parliament 
which elects him or her into that position.  And if they no 
longer 
enjoy 
that 
support 
of 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
Parliamentarians then they should accept that they have lost 
it and be willing to being subjected to that type of vote of no 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 86 of 288 
 
confidence because it basically means that they would be 
saying well you –you have basically failed to – to lead 
government.  However if amongst that majority of the 
members there are a few who would hold a different view but 
then the majority still retains then I would say they should 
not have any fear. And those few would be all – some of 
those would then have articulated their concerns about the 
confidence that they still have in that President.  So in other 
words the debate would have had to have ensued in the 
majority party where it would have had to be clear to the 
10 
President that I no longer have the support because those 
who are in Parliament are then really representatives of the 
entire body of the party itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course Mr President the approach that 
you take that the ANC takes because I think Mr Mantashe 
also took the same line means in effect and I would like you 
to comment on this – means in effect that before a President 
of the country can be voted out of office through a motion of 
no confidence the majority party should have lost confidence 
in him on its or – in him or her on its own. 
20 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In which case probably it might not need to 
go through that process even to just use its own structures 
and processes to recall him. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Yes. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 87 of 288 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if that is so the question arises why do 
we then need these provisions of the constitution about a 
vote of no confidence in the President of the country if 
everything will be dictated by the majority party can be 
dictated by the majority party outside of Parliament. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  No.  I hold a different view. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Because we need checks and 
10 
balances. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  The check and balance that is 
embedded in our constitution is a strong enough sword of 
Damascus which hangs over the head of a President. But the 
other important check and balances in the party itself where 
the party system – well the party will go through a number of 
processes and I think that it where the strength of our 
constitutional structure or architecture rests that it does not 
necessarily just revolve around an individual it resolves 
20 
around a collection of people who will apply their minds and 
sometimes you could argue well maybe they could be 
brainwashed or they could all be captured or whatever there 
is that risk but in the main the check and balance is that it 
will be in the party.  We have had in our history two 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 88 of 288 
 
situations where we have had Presidents removed or 
recalled rather not removed but recalled by their own party.  
A very painful process – deeply painful and that brought 
divisions in the governing party that almost tore the 
governing party apart but it was an important check and 
balance which in many ways if it had cascaded all the way 
through to Parliament would have really even divided the 
party down the middle and maybe that is not that and 
decisions were then taken in the party itself. 
 
So I do not think we should ever see political parties 
10 
as 
alien 
entities 
they 
are 
part 
of 
our 
constitutional 
architecture and they have very good checks and balances.  
Sometimes they fail but for the most part there would be you 
know good checks and balances that can put the brakes on a 
runaway vehicle that is going to crash. 
 
 But then again it does not mean that that dilutes the 
efficacy of the construct that we have in the constitution that 
provides for a vote of no confidence in a President because 
when the wheels have come off in the party itself you do 
need that check and balance in the constitution of the 
20 
country where you would be able to – to have the type of 
outcome that you are talking about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let me just say this in case it is 
misunderstood. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Yes. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 89 of 288 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think what I am saying would apply to 
even opposition parties I think that – that is now if it is 
correct to say in the context of a vote of no confidence is the 
individual who must make up his or her mind about whether 
he or she has lost confidence in the President and bearing in 
mind their oath of office so that even with the opposition 
parties it would – if it is not right for the majority party to 
give an instruction it would not be right for the opposition 
party to say you are instructed in effect to vote in support of 
the vote of no confidence.  So – so it would apply both – or 
10 
both sides.  It is a question of whether it is correct and of 
course we know that there was the secret ballot judgment of 
the constitutional court which dealt with some of these 
issues and obviously we will have – we all have to have due 
regard to what it said.  But I agree that it is not an easy 
subject.  It is controversial in the context of party – the kind 
of system that we have but obviously faced with what this 
commission is investigating it would be failing in its duty if it 
did not look as deep as possible into saying what are the 
things that made these things happen?   
20 
 
Because one the questions we posed to Parliament 
was the mechanisms of oversight and of holding the 
executive accountable that you have are they adequate?  
Were they adequate or for the purposes to which they have 
been put in place?  Were they used you know?  And of 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 90 of 288 
 
course when you come to the vote of no confidence the 
evidence emerged that well sometimes the majority party 
gave instruction to members of Parliament to say though 
shalt not vote that way or to this way.  And the question 
arises whether what that does to what the – is that what the 
constitution 
contemplated? 
 
Is 
that 
the 
right 
thing 
constitutionally or not?  But I think you have put your views 
Mr President so – so I do not know whether you want to say 
anything before I (speaking over one another). 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  I do.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  I do because it is interesting 
that 
you 
also 
talk 
about 
opposition 
parties 
because 
opposition parties here also have that same herd mentality 
and when they vote they vote as a block.  Even when they 
walk out of Parliament they walk out as a block – as a herd 
of cattle.  You just see one of them walking out and they all 
follow.  And that is in a way that is another check and 
balance because what it does it shows disapproval that they 
want to display of whatever and sometimes when the 
20 
Presiding Officers rule that one of them should walk out they 
all walk out – so it is a very controversial issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is yes. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  It really is and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No it is very controversial and yes.  Mr 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385

Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Thank you Chair.  I have no further 
questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  Thank you Mr Freund. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Thank you. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Thank you Mr President. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Can I go home now? 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is too early Mr President.  Too early.  Mr 
10 
Pretorius will toyi toyi if you leave now. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  Morning Mr 
President. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Morning Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We stopped yesterday at the issue of 
party 
funding 
and 
we 
were 
dealing 
with 
the 
funding 
relationship at least between BOSASA on the one hand and 
the African National Congress on the other. 
 
By way of background between 2007 and 2009 there 
were a number of press articles about corruption involving 
20 
BOSASA and the administration at least. 
 
There was a SIU investigation that received a lot of 
publicity and in 2009 charges were contemplated.  For some 
reason nothing happened for over ten years and that reason 
has been explored fully or virtually fully in evidence and the 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 92 of 288 
 
Chair will make his findings in regard to that. 
 
In 2015 Ms Dudu Myeni handed copies of the 
investigation file to Mr Angelo Agrizzi that evidence as we 
regard it stands and at least the former President it was 
probable that he knew of it because she was there on the 
foundation of the former President’s defences. 
 
There were several meetings between Mr Watson and 
the leadership of the ANC and finally in the media the 
relationship between Mr Gavin Watson and the party – 
leadership in the ANC was manifest.  There was that War 
10 
Room at the elections you will know about that that was 
financed by BOSASA operations and it was no secret. 
 
In those circumstances it is difficult to accept that 
vigilant members of the ANC would not have been aware 
firstly of the fact that BOSASA was helping the African 
National Congress through donations and benefits. 
 
And secondly that the company involved BOSASA 
was 
the 
recipient 
of 
large 
contracts 
under 
dubious 
circumstances from government.  That being so how – how 
could it happen and the facts are there – how could it 
20 
happen and that is the second question – broad question 
that we ask that the party continued to receive benefits from 
and be financed by BOSASA? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  I think it is a valid question – a 
very, very valid question and one should have been aware at 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 93 of 288 
 
an earlier stage about all this. I went to the election centre 
which BOSASA have to finance during the election campaign 
and even then it never really I must be honest occurred to 
me firstly that they were bank rolling or they were financing 
in full that whole centre for – on behalf of the ANC. 
 
The Treasury General as well as colleagues or 
comrades who ran the elections knew and I must say it never 
really fully occurred to me.   
 
So with hindsight as they say hindsight is the 
00:28:18 signs one would say we should have been more 
10 
alert particularly to those reports that had emerged a lot 
earlier because during the course of all this I mean there 
was almost like a nine year – ten year period after they had 
occurred according to my own recollection so there had been 
a lapse. Ordinarily I think I said in my evidence – my 
opening statement we would not knowingly – knowingly and 
intentionally accept donations from companies or donors with 
– who had been involved in criminal activity and all that so 
that should be regarded as a major lapse in our part 
particularly it had been proven that they had obtained their 
20 
contracts unlawfully. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That is viewed at hindsight but 
looking at what was happening at the time I am not sure that 
hindsight is an accounting for what happened.  It is an 
explanation one can shot – shut the door on it and one can 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 94 of 288 
 
resolve not to do so in the future and that is being the trend 
of the evidence thus far and I am going to deal with that 
issue in due course. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But it is difficult to avoid the 
conclusion on the facts that in the circumstances the ANC 
received donations from BOSASA and BOSASA officials, 
board members, leaders in BOSASA in circumstances 
which was such that required a proper investigation and 
that the principle that it would not knowingly accept 
10 
donations in these circumstances, was in fact a breach 
because people knew, the President of the time knew.   
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes.  Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And is it not correct, and this 
theme would come up later, that the reason why there was 
no reporting of this particular receipt of donations was 
that, in fact, the President was in control of the party, the 
then President? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes, certainly the President 
20 
plays a very key-role in the life the party it leads or she 
leads 
the 
party 
and 
provides 
leadership 
and 
gives 
direction.  That is so. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now we have been accused in the 
media, Mr President, of having kept blindside(?) [laughs] 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 95 of 288 
 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   [laughs] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It certainly will not remain on 
today.  [laughs] 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   [laughs] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And perhaps it is important for the 
public to understand, Chair.  This is a commission of 
inquiry.  It is not a trial.  We are not here to panel beat the 
answers in accordance with any particular view.  This is an 
opportunity for you, Mr President, to say and you have said 
what you think.  Good or bad.  Whatever the public might 
10 
think about it, this is your opportunity to say it.   
 
Nevertheless, there are certain things that we do 
have to raise which we will raise today and the one is the 
CR17 Donation from BOSASA operations into the FNB 
account.  Now this has been dealt with by – I have gave 
you for, and yesterday, just an opportunity to explain to the 
public and the Commission what happened.  
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Well, there are two aspects to 
this.  The one aspect is.  The donation that was solicited 
by one of my colleagues into the funds of CR17 Campaign.  
20 
Now the campaign managers had taken a conscious 
decision that they would not involve me at all in the 
fundraising process.   
 
They had also taken a conscious decision to say 
they would not want me to even know who would give 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 96 of 288 
 
money to the campaign because they wanted to almost 
create a wall that those people who give money should 
never really think that there is anything that they will get in 
return.  That if I knew that there could be that compromise.   
 
So they took a conscious decision and they told 
me that that is what we have decided.  We – you are the 
candidate, we are the campaign managers, and we are 
building a wall and we are going to make sure you do not 
know where the money will come from.  We would, 
however, as it – when time went on, we will, however, want 
10 
money from you.   
 
They solicited money directly from me which I 
gladly gave and it was put in account and I never knew.  
Up to today I do not know how those funds had been 
managed.  I did meet some of the people who gave money, 
at dinners or whatever to explain precisely what we were 
seeking to achieve by my candidature and that is where it 
ended.   
 
So, when one of my colleagues then approached, 
I think one of the Watson brothers, whom he knew from 
20 
long ago because he was a comrade before he passed 
away, a comrade in the ANC structures, UDF structures 
and all that, to give money, he seems to have said:  I want 
you to give money personally from your own money and 
not...  It seems like he made that distinction from your own 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 97 of 288 
 
purse and not from the company itself.  So that is what I 
believe he seems to have done.   
 
So, of course, as the story, you know, was made 
public, it seems like it came from BOSASA.  I do not quite 
remember the finer detail.  I think it came from him or one 
of his companies or accounts.  And I think the Public 
Protector and the legal processes looked into all that.  So 
that is the one aspect that had to do with monies that had 
to do with anything BOSASA related even though I think 
the money never really came from there.   
10 
 
So I was far away from the finances that 
financed the CR17 Campaign for the reasons that I have 
articulated that the managers did not want me to know so 
that I should never be beholden to any of the people who 
gave money to the campaign.  And as it turned out, we had 
by – maybe by osmosis in the ANC arrived at a situation 
where there are formal campaigns that are now mounted 
for people to be elected to positions.   
 
It never used to be like that in the past and we 
still demean the fact the we have now arrived at a 
20 
campaign style type of contestation for leadership which is 
regrettable but that is where we are and I will remark on 
this in a little while.  The other part was how the campaign 
managers 
then 
went 
ahead 
to 
raise 
money 
for 
the 
campaign.   
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 98 of 288 
 
 
It has been said a billion rand was raised.  It 
was never a billion rand.  I am told that the money that was 
raised was some R 300 million or so but never a billion but 
I do not know the full facts because they have neutrally 
decided to keep it away from me.  And the money, what 
was it used for?  There is a legend that goes around that 
the money was used to buy homes and far from it.   
 
And 
I 
said 
to 
my 
comrades 
right 
in 
the 
beginning, I never want to be part of a campaign that is 
going to descent into all these deviant part of behaviours 
10 
that we talk about in the ANC about vote buying.  And I 
even said I would rather lose the race rather than have 
votes bought.   
 
So what was the money used for?  It was used to 
transport people, to hire venues, and actually I got really 
surprised that it has become so expensive to have all 
these things, like, meetings, bussing people, feeding 
people, the paraphernalia T-shirts, caps and so forth that 
have been given out for the campaign.   
 
And I think people who run campaigns will know 
20 
that yes there is a cost to all of that.  As it turns out, there 
is still a debt that still has to be paid in a number of forms 
and ways after that campaign that happened in 2017.  So 
money was used for that.   
 
And 
I 
guess 
one 
of 
the 
key-issues 
and 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 99 of 288 
 
challenges is that the people who were running the 
campaign were so methodical.  They recorded everything in 
black and white. They recorded who was given money, 
what was it for, and some of the money was deposited into 
people’s account to pass onto to others, to people in the 
regions and people all over.   
 
And most of that money was then distributed or 
advanced towards a meeting, to hire a venue, for people to 
travel, for airtime, and all those types of things.  So when 
it came to – people often talk about these accounts that 
10 
are locked up or where the courts decided and that had 
nothing to do with me because I did not block from all that.   
 
And the comrades who ran the campaign have 
been quite, almost in ensuring that that is held to 
themselves and I never get involved in all that.  But be that 
it may.  That is now being deliberated by the courts and in 
some ways quite a bit of the information of who gave 
monies is known.   
 
Those who have taken the matter to court know 
who gave the money and the money that was given was 
20 
also donated by a number of people.  And many people, as 
they give money, the old dispensation before the new law 
about political funding takes place.  They gave money on 
the understanding that we want – we do not want it to be 
publicised 
that 
we 
had 
given 
money 
for 
a 
political 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 100 of 288 
 
campaign.   
 
So they wanted their own identity, to be kept out 
of the media and it was on that condition which the 
campaign managers agreed.  They said:  Okay, of course, 
you are giving money and we will keep your information 
confidential to ourselves.  As it has always been the case 
with a number of monies that are given to political parties.  
Political parties by their very nature go around asking for 
donations and I think it will not be surprising for them to 
hear that other donors do not want their information to be 
10 
known but this is now a subject of a major court battle.  
 
But in the end, Chairperson, there was nothing 
sinister, I must say, about the CR17 Campaign.  Nothing 
underhand.  People will always say and fear that those who 
gave money wanted something in return.  I will never allow 
that and I would also say – and because I do not know, 
that to me is a safeguard, you know, how much so and so 
gave and all that because they kept it away from me.   
 
I should say so that I never been seen to be 
economic with the truth.  Some of the people who gave 
20 
money I got to know because some of them would them 
that:  I had given money.  And how much they had given, I 
do not know.  So I should never be heard to be saying I do 
not know or some of them I know but I would say the 
majority I do not know until today.   
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 101 of 288 
 
 
And I have to say:  No, we agreed at the 
beginning of the campaign that we are not going to tell you 
and we are sticking to that.  And there are like three or 
four people who are the key principles of this.  They are 
like the able bodied people who refuse to even come out 
with the information.  So that is how CR17 went and 
beyond that there were lots of court cases.   
 
The Public Protector got involved because – I 
should explain this when some of the money was given, 
particularly by Mr Watson, it went one from account to 
10 
another and that was his own arrangement having been 
asked by one of my colleagues to give money and even 
that colleague never told me, by the way, that he asked for 
money from Watson and he moved the money from one 
account to the other. 
 
And it sounded then to the Public Protector that 
that was money laundering and there was no such money 
laundering.  And that is what I can say about the CR17 
Campaign saga, if I can call it that.  And then there have 
been calls by other people to say:  Well, we should also 
20 
look at other campaigns.  Let us look at other campaigns.  
And I have often said:  Comrades, it is enough.  Look at 
the CR17.  It is enough.  Let us put this behind us.   
 
I have said that because soon after this whole 
story broke out, I went to the NEC and I said to the NEC I 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 102 of 288 
 
would like us as the ANC now to start regulating how 
internal leadership contents are managed in the ANC 
because we do not have such rules.  I should hasten to 
add that in 2012 – no, after I think the Polokwane 
Conference, an attempt was made to regulate this and 
there was ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The Mangaung Conference or the 
Polokwane Conference? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   I think it was ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   [Indistinct]  
10 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   ...2012.  Ja, 2012. 
CHAIRPERSON:   2012 was Mangaung, I think.  
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   It was Mangaung.  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   You see, Chief Deputy 
Justice, you know so much.  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   It was at the Mangaung 
Conference where a constitutional provision was drafted 
and the NEC was instructed, in one way or another, to 
20 
finalise this and that constitutional provision never saw its 
way into the constitution.  Until today, we do not know how 
it happened, why it happened, and some journalists have 
written about it.   
 
And that provisions was going to be saying, we 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 103 of 288 
 
need to regulate how these contests are run and funded 
and it basically said there should be no fundraising, there 
should be no this and that and that.  So that was never 
regulated and that is why these campaigns and almost on 
their own – there were seven campaigns for leadership for 
president leading up to Nasrec or to the 54 t h Conference.  
And they were all somehow funded.   
 
They were all somehow managed in way or 
another which in a way, you know, shows that a new era 
has arrived in the ANC but it needs to be regulated.  So I 
10 
was the first to go to the NEC and said:  In the light of 
what we have been through and in the light of what I 
personally have been through it is important that we should 
regulate the running of these campaigns.   
 
We should regulate the funding thereof, the 
management of the campaigns, how much money should be 
given, if any, and there should be accountability.  After 
each campaign there should be full accountability of money 
that was given, what it was used for, where it came from 
and so forth.   
20 
 
So 
this 
issue, 
Mr Pretorius, 
that 
you 
also 
glassed together with political party funding, originates 
largely from the ANC.  The first issue about political party 
funding was first discussed in the ANC in – at – was it 
2012?  Or even earlier.  I think it was in Polokwane which 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 104 of 288 
 
was – would have been the earlier conference, the 50 t h 
Conference or the 51 s t Conference.   
 
We discussed it then and said we need to 
regulate party political funding.  The law that we know 
have originated from discussions in the ANC and similarly 
this provision that I am calling for regulate political party 
funding for internal contents.   
 
It is something that we will discuss and come for 
a more sensible conclusion around it, so that we never 
have any doubt that conferences were bought as there had 
10 
been a doubt about my election that my election was 
bought which is absolutely untrue, completely devoid from 
any truth whatsoever and I am prepared to lay out 
everything.  Thank you very much. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
You 
referred 
to 
litigation, 
President, and we know that matters related to the Public 
Protector were before court and the high court was given 
your full explanation under oath and its comment was that 
that explanation was both honest and reasonable.  That is 
a matter of public record.  You recall that? 
20 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But two issues arise out of your 
answer.  Well, three perhaps.  And I think you have 
answered the three issue now.  Is that the principles which 
applied to party funding should also apply to individual 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 105 of 288 
 
campaigns within a party. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Is that acceptable? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   It is acceptable to me.  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  The second issue is that, 
if those 
principles 
applied 
to internal 
contest, 
party 
contest, then the public...  Well, first of all the recipient of 
the donation should note that fireball is perhaps not the 
best idea in those circumstances.  And secondly, and 
perhaps 
more 
importantly, 
the 
electorate, 
the 
ANC 
10 
electorate and the people out there who may be affected in 
the sense of public officials are now – their careers are at 
stake.  They should also know that is an acceptable 
principle.   
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes, I would accept that and 
the reasons I would is that.  You know, there needs also to 
be a limitation.  A limitation of how much should be given 
even as we raise money because to avoid a situation where 
you could have huge amounts coming from one donor, 
because that will give rise to a sense and a suspicion that 
20 
they need to be given pre-eminence in any relationship.  
So if there is a limit and everybody know that this is the 
limit that everybody could...   
 
Like, 
now 
we 
have 
created 
a 
limit 
that 
R 15 million is the most that can be given.  So it basically 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 106 of 288 
 
means that there can be no donor who could give much 
more than that.  Of course it is to the disadvantage of 
political parties but that is how our democratic system 
should work because that adds to transparency, openness 
and also confidence.  It gives people confidence in that 
regard.  So I would agree to that.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Similarly, to the BOSASA acts and 
history and its relation to the ANC, there had been an 
admission by ANC Treasurer General, Zweli Mkhize, that 
the Guptas also donated money to the ANC over the years. 
10 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes, the then Treasurer 
General has admitted to that fact. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And there can be no doubt that the 
conduct of the Guptas have also received visibility in the 
media and elsewhere.  There can be no doubt that any 
donation from the Guptas should have been investigated. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes, I would say so too. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   There was, in fact, an allegation 
that was made to the Treasurer General that the Guptas 
the bill for the ANC’s 2012 Conference in Mangaung.  Is 
20 
that correct? 
PRESIDENT 
RAMAPHOSA: 
 
 
I 
have 
heard 
of 
this 
allegation, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do you know whether it is correct? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   No, I do not. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 107 of 288 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  The point about that and 
the point about the BOSASA donations is that surely there 
was enough information current against the principle that 
the ANC would never knowingly accept donations that were 
the proceeds criminal conduct but there should have been 
an internal investigation.  Is that right?  Both in relation to 
BOSASA investigations and in relation to Gupta donations. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes, I would concede that 
there should have been, possibly, an internal examination.  
I do not know to the extent to which an investigation would 
10 
have 
been 
possible 
but 
an 
examination 
because 
investigation conjures up in one’s mind an idea that you 
will subpoena this document.  You will get this and that and 
being a political party, I know the limitations, even of the 
powers 
of 
the 
Secretary 
General 
to 
subpoena 
documentation and evidence.  So there should have been 
an examination. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Could it have been outsourced? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Pardon? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It could have been outsourced the 
20 
investigation. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Well, that is a thought.  It 
could certainly have been outsourced, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay.  To move on to a different 
topic in regard to party funding.  I raised the issue 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 108 of 288 
 
yesterday, Mr President, with you about the – what I 
understood then to be two affidavits.  It is in fact one 
affidavit which was provided to your team overnight.  That, 
to put it briefly, the affidavit is some 170 pages.   
 
You make some very strong allegations but to 
put it very briefly and given the restrictions of time.  
Ambassadors appointed by the President because the 
President appoints ambassadors, were required to sign 
debit forms to – in order to pay monthly contributions to 
the ANC.  Do you know of that? 
10 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Well, let me say I know of 
this in a different guide.  I did not have the benefit of going 
through the 177 pages for my bedtime reading last night.  
So I did not go through that but let me say.  Those who 
would have received that would have received that as per 
their membership of the African National Congress.   
 
Now as ANC members right from 1994, we took 
the view that we are a party that is strapped for money and 
we need to scour all over to find the money and one of the 
best ways was to ask those who are members of the ANC 
20 
to sign a levy form that they agree that the banks should 
tunnel money from their salaries or their accounts to the 
ANC.   
 
Now when I was in business, as a member of the 
ANC, I did that as well.  I signed a levy form and every 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 109 of 288 
 
month the money was docked from my account to the ANC 
coffers as per ANC member.  Now that happens to many 
people.  And those that it gets to be known are, you know, 
active in places where the ANC knows that you are getting 
a salary.  In the private sector – when I was in the private 
sector, I paid or in the public sector.   
 
For instance, today every member of Parliament 
representing the ANC legislature and local government, we 
pay levies to the ANC so that we can boost the coffers of 
the ANC.  And the same would happen if you are an ANC 
10 
member, if you are, let us say, the chair or the CEO of one 
of the entities or if you are an ANC member.  I know when I 
was Secretary General I used to solicit members who were 
in the private sector to sign levy forms.   
 
Just anyone I knew would be a member of the 
ANC I would say:  Sign the levy form and give money.  And 
because you are in the private sector, give more money 
which is exactly what happened to me.  Whereas others 
would be given five thousand or two-and-a-half thousand, I 
would 
be 
giving 
ten 
to 
fifteen 
thousand 
because 
20 
presumable one would be earning more.   
 
So it is in that context that I would say, you know, 
even ambassadors who are ANC members would – they do 
not do it because they are appointed as ambassadors.  
They do it because they are ANC members. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 110 of 288 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  Mr Malloy, as I 
understand it, does say – or Ambassador Malloy does say 
that this contribution required by the ANC is paid by even 
those who are not members of the ANC as a reciprocal 
obligation for being appointed to ambassadorship in the 
first place.  Do you know anything about that? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   No, I do not know anything 
about that, I would have a huge question mark around that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, something that perhaps 
may be investigated. 
10 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The practice of donations to the 
parties, does it apply to all persons deployed into public 
office? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes, it does.  I am afraid it 
does.  As I said, every member of representing the ANC at 
local, provincial and national level does give money to the 
ANC. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   There is a third aspect to the 
funding relationship that the ANC has with members or 
20 
even non-members.  There has been evidence of the Free 
State asbestos scheme, you would have known about that, 
where to put it in very broad terms and subject obviously to 
certain 
qualifications, 
a 
contract 
was 
awarded 
to 
Blackhead Consulting, a firm owned by Mr Edwin Sodi.  Its 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 111 of 288 
 
tender 
value 
was 
approximately 
R255 
million, 
a 
subcontractor for R50 million, it was again subcontracted 
for approximately R20 million and there was still profit left 
for the second subcontractor to take over.  Mr Sodi then, to 
the knowledge, it must be, of those who granted the 
contract, officials in the Free State, made a large profit 
and from that profit made several substantial donations to 
the ANC. 
 
Now that is a matter of record and also a matter of 
criminal charges now.  Two aspects arise.  One, it is 
10 
evidence of the very patronage practice that has been 
identified by the ANC and spoken about by the ANC and we 
will deal with that in due course.   
But is it not a concerning practice or pattern that 
proceeds of procurement, state procurement, go to private 
companies associated with and known to persons who are 
members of the ANC or might be members of the ANC and 
then come back to the party?  In other words, the proceeds 
of procurement, around which there is a question mark, 
come to the party as donations.  Is that not an important 
20 
issue that requires consideration? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Well, I think in the way you 
have qualified this by saying around which there is a 
question mark, that certainly should be a matter that makes 
us take a second look at this and say should this be 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 112 of 288 
 
happening?   
 
However, I should say  - and the backdrop to this is 
that we now have legislation that is going to regulate 
donations.  I should, however, say that there is inherently 
nothing wrong if – in the past there would have been 
nothing if a business entity then donated money which 
money was not given in return for anything, for any 
favours.  If a business entity, whatever business it does, as 
long as it is not illegal, unlawful, gives money and does not 
want anything in return, in my book is patently nothing 
10 
wrong.   
 
There is everything wrong – everything wrong if that 
business wants something in return, that we want you to 
favour us when it comes to a procurement or a service that 
we need to provide and all that.  So that, in my book, 
should not be allowed.   
 
But, 
Chairperson, 
we 
now 
have 
a 
revolution 
underway which in many ways is going to save our 
democracy in that donations that now have to be made 
have to be accounted for.  If a political party receives a 
20 
donation it has to be kept at a particular amount and it 
must be accounted for in the books and the IEC is going to 
be rigorous when it comes to this and I would expect that 
our other agencies would also be wide awake when it 
comes to this. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 113 of 288 
 
 
So one is not able to comment fully on the asbestos 
case because it is a subject of legal processes, so one 
leaves that as it is but in terms of the question that you 
have qualified, I would say yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  The next source of political 
party funding is the use of state resources for political 
party activities.  We have evidence that Telkom sponsored 
an ANC conference, Mr Montana and Mr Molefe, albeit that 
they were on either side of a fence, spoke about PRASA 
providing facilities, transport and other support for the 
10 
ANC.  Again, pressures of time, surely that cannot be 
accepted? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   I would agree that that should 
not happen because those are public monies and it creates 
a problem when monies that are meant are to be managed 
by one of our state institutions are then utilised for party 
political funding. 
 
Now you could say if the situation were to allow – if 
they were going to give money right across to all parties 
that will be different, but I do not think that too should be 
20 
allowed because the monies that aid PRASA and Eskom 
and all these others have to be used for developmental 
purposes, develop infrastructure, develop everything they 
do for the majority of the people. 
 
So the Party Political Funding Act comes in handy 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 114 of 288 
 
here as well because it will help us to prevent these sorts 
of things from happening. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The Political Party Funding Act, I 
am told by our research team, that it was passed by 
parliament in 2018 and signed into law by yourself, Mr 
President, in January 2019 but promulgated in April this 
year.  Why was there that delay?  Were the political 
pressures involved. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   You know, all things like 
these have to properly and fully discussed and fully 
10 
embraced and as, you know, Mr Mantashe said, you know, 
things in political organisations take a long time to happen.  
That is precisely what happened here as well.   
 
Whilst it was the ANC conference that decided – 
and if my recollection is correct, it decided at its 50 t h 
conference that there should be regulation of party political 
funding and the process leading up to where it is finally, to 
where the President was able to set a date for the 
commencement of the Act has been fraught with a lot of 
discussion and some of it, just to give you a flavour, is that 
20 
even the political parties in parliament themselves had 
great challenges with this law because once the ANC had 
discussed and once it was introduced by some of  - ja, into 
parliament, we found that political parties were not ready.  
Simply put, they were not ready for this to come into effect.  
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 115 of 288 
 
When they started looking at their balance sheets where 
they get money from, they realised that unless the fiscus is 
able to, you know, give sufficient money to fuel their own 
democratic processes, it was going to be difficult to have 
money, sufficient money and even their donors would baulk 
at the idea of being  - their information, that they have 
given money be known by everyone. 
 
So whilst it is good for democracy, in the end it is 
going to be very difficult for political parties for their 
funding purposes.  So it took a while.  It took quite a while.  
10 
Debates internal to many of the political parties and even 
in the ANC and finally we have arrived where we are and in 
the end the President had to say we have got to sign this 
bill and it must come into effect and that is the journey that 
we have travelled and with the maturing of our democracy, 
some of these things take a while, they take some time to 
happen but I would say even – there is a saying in 
Afrikaans which I now – die agteros kom ook in die kraal, 
even the slowest ox does come into the kraal, so I would 
say that exactly what has happened. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It was a very slow ox, it seems. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   It was a slow ox. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   There is one other aspect in 
relation to party funding that we can probably better deal 
with when you return, Mr President, but on the principle 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 116 of 288 
 
that secrecy should never be utilised to trump or cover up 
criminality, that principle is expressed in a regulation which 
ironically is itself secret but that we may come to in due 
course. 
 
The State Security Agency, there has been evidence 
that money has been uses, state money, taxpayer money, 
has been used in funding political activities.  That is a 
matter that I would like to deal with next time but for the 
moment simply to ask you to comment.   
There has also been evidence that the CR17 
10 
campaign was disrupted to funds supplied by the SSA.  Do 
you know anything about it?  That would be entirely 
criminal …(intervenes) 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   That is was disrupted?   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  Well, the precise manner of 
disruption is not entirely clear but the reports were that the 
regalia that was being provided to your supporters was 
interfered with, let me put it that way.  You know of that? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   No, I do not know about that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Perhaps we will get further 
20 
information in that regard.  But do you know of any 
circumstances where State Security funds have been used 
in relation to party activities? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   I have heard but I have no 
evidence that yes, they have been utilised but I have no 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 117 of 288 
 
evidence. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We will deal more comprehensively 
with the State Security evidence but it does seem that 
many of these issues require proper outsourced and 
empowered investigation and I know that will be put to you 
and it seems without much [indistinct – dropping voice] 
 
Then there is one other issue that has arisen in 
papers clearly submitted by yourself and that is the issue 
of branches and vote buying but I would like to deal with 
that later, if I may. 
10 
 
If I may go back to another issue briefly, hopefully.  
We discussed yesterday the eye of the needle document, 
that 2001 document which was a very important document 
in the history of the African National Congress, as I 
understand it.  There was in 2020 a review of this 
document and it appears in your own bundle at page 449, 
bundle 1, 449. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   549? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   449. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say bundle 1 or bundle 2? 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Bundle 1, 449. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes.  I try to be like you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That document is a review of the 
eye of the needle document, do I understand it correctly? 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 118 of 288 
 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It says many things but it does say 
in its 2020 review – and we have put on record the 
problems 
highlighted 
in 
2001 
in 
the 
document 
but 
something deeper has gone wrong. 
“Deviant behaviour is finding protection and is 
thriving inside the ANC liberation alliance.” 
Now the proposition has already been put and it may be 
put again …[intervenes] 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Where were you reading? 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If I may just get it for you, page 
450. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 14, bottom of the first 
column. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    
“It is now acknowledged that something deeper has 
gone wrong in the movement.  Deviant behaviour is 
finding protection and is thriving inside the ANC-led 
20 
liberation alliance.  It is perhaps the fact that the 
document is dealing with a needle and not the 
needle, it is the size of the needle.” 
And then it goes into a series of analogies.  If one goes to 
the first paragraph, to put that statement in its context, the 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 119 of 288 
 
introduction reads in paragraph 1 on page 449: 
“It has been 30 years since the unbanning of the 
ANC, it has been 26 years since the democratic 
breakthrough, it has more than 19 years since 
through the eye of a needle choosing the best 
cadres 
to 
lead 
transformation 
document 
was 
produced.  In these years the ANC has grown in 
membership and yet the qualities of its cadres is 
fast diminishing.” 
Now we do not have time, unfortunately, but it would be 
10 
instructive to go through the various statements made by 
various presidents, amongst others, over the intervening 
years between 2001 and 2020 and I will come to your own 
documents shortly but it seems that the problems not only 
generally but in particular patronage corruption and the 
like, factionalism were always present throughout these 
years.   
 
They had never been successfully dealt with and 
the language as indeed got stronger but South Africa looks 
to the party which governs the levers of power, which 
20 
govern the people of South Africa for some change and the 
question arises what is new?  But before we get there, may 
I just go to the – there is a document on page 581, 
paragraph 8 of the bundle 1.  This is the 52 n d national 
conference report, the Polokwane conference of 2007. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 120 of 288 
 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   What page are you on? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am on page 580. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Oh, 580. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Of bundle 1. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes, I indeed.  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you would just bear with me a 
moment? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Of course. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In paragraph – I am sorry, that is 
my notes, that is my error.  Paragraph 8 on page 581, now 
10 
this is 2007, it reads: 
“Our accumulated weaknesses include inability to 
effectively deal with new tendencies arising from 
being a ruling party such as social distance, 
patronage, 
careerism, 
corruption 
and 
abuse 
of 
powers, ineffective management of the interface 
between the movement and the stage, a flawed 
approach to membership, recruitment decline, and 
ideological depth amongst cadres and a lack of 
institutional resources to give practical effect to the 
20 
movement’s leadership role.” 
Quite a strong and stark repetition of the issues facing the 
ANC over the years, this is 2007.  What is interesting 
about it is that a reference is made to new tendencies but 
these were not really new, were they?  Were they – did 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 121 of 288 
 
they arise somehow in 2007? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   No, I would agree that they 
were not new tendencies but they have been evolving and 
evolving around the number of eras that we have been 
through, one of those being, as you read in one of the 
paragraphs, that being a governing party has given rise to 
a number of opportunities to be in government, their 
access to resources, be able to dispense patronage, to be 
in control of, if you like, procurement, resources and 
opportunities and that is – well, that started in 1994 but as 
10 
time went on, we got used to being the incumbent.  
Incumbency then gave rise to a whole number of deviant 
behaviours which we have acknowledged openly that this, 
in many ways, is a source of our problems and we have got 
to navigate our way around  or – well, out of these type of 
problems that we now have.  
 
So in 2007 this would not have been new but I 
guess if you are asking – we have always known that these 
are the challenges and the problems and are you able to 
get yourself out of all these challenges?  I guess that is 
20 
your question. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, perhaps we can deal with 
that after the long adjournment.  I do want to get to three 
statements that you made in August 2020, a month in 
which you must have been angry, your blood pressure must 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 122 of 288 
 
have been very high.  But we will get to them in due 
course. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, it is six minutes past one, let us 
take the lunch adjournment and we will resume at five past 
two.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before we continue let us have a 
common understanding about what time we will adjourn this 
10 
afternoon.  Yesterday we spoke about the possibility of 
going up to five if necessary but later on we decided to 
start at nine, one hour earlier but I think we did not have 
clarification whether - because we started at nine we will 
stop at four, whether if necessary we could still go to five.   
Maybe – Mr President what is your situation?    
PRESIDENT 
RAMAPHOSA: 
 
 
I 
am 
at 
your 
service 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Okay, no thank you, thank 
you.   Okay Mr Pretorius so we see how it goes but the 
20 
President is able to go up to five if we need to, ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thanks Chair, I did negotiate ten 
past five with his office. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing] No that is alright, okay.   
Okay let us continue. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 123 of 288 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  Mr President would 
you look at what is known as the Diagnostic Report of July 
2017, you will recognise that document.   It is in Bundle 1 
at page 836, or that is certainly the passage I would like to 
refer to.  For the record the first page of the document is 
on page 821.  It is a document prepared I understand for 
the National Policy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Pretorius, you said 835, 
but I think you said another page after that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, the document begins at page 
10 
821. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you want us to go to that page?  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, please it is a document dated 
July 2017.  It is known as a Diagnostic Report and it was 
prepared for the, is it the July 2017 conference, is that 
correct?  If you go to page 836 and you refer to this report, 
Mr President in paragraph 131 of your own statement, that 
is on page 58, Bundle 1 and it is the date of the statement 
that is important, as well as, of course, the content.  It 
reads: 
20 
“The public outcry about the influence of the Gupta 
family has led to investigations by both the office of 
the Public Protector and the South African Council 
of Churches, serious allegations were made against 
a number of the leaders of the ANC.  Instead of 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 124 of 288 
 
dealing with the reality facing the movement, a 
defence was developed by using the real threats we 
face as a movement.  A narrative was developed to 
link any discomfort with the influence of the Gupta 
family to the regime change agenda. While it must 
be acknowledged, that regime change is a real 
threat, that needs to be analysed and a strategy to 
defend the country and the movement needs to be 
developed.  This cannot be used as a response to 
the perception or reality of corruption both objective 
10 
and subjective factors in this regard, need to be 
understood.” 
And then in paragraph 6.5: 
“Another defence that has been bandied out is the 
one that counter pose as the behaviour of this 
family to (white) monopoly capital.  White monopoly 
capital is invented as if it is a new phenomenon 
instead of affirming that its defeat is at the heart of 
the revolution and the essence of NDR.” 
And then in the middle of paragraph 6.6, five lines down 
20 
the statement is made that: 
“Society on the other front expects the ANC to take 
a stand against corruption by taking serious action 
or being seen to do so.” 
It seems that this document, Mr President, and the short 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 125 of 288 
 
passages I have referred to indicate what you have 
referred to as internal contestation, that there was within 
the governing party - and I think it is no secret an internal 
context and back there is a period through which the ruling 
or governing party went during the period under review.  
It seems here that what you refer to as the line 
being drawn at its origins, the most recent line being drawn 
but had been drawn many times over 20 years, is that 
correct?  
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes.  
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Then if you go to the December 
2015, NASREC 54 t h Conference Report, that is in Bundle 1, 
page 256 you refer to it as well, in paragraph 133 and 
following of your own statement, and many of these 
statements that I have put to you in fairness have not been 
discovered by us they are in your own statement.   
Page 256 of Bundle 1. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  There is on that page a resolution 
that was taken at the conference and I would just like if I 
20 
may to refer to certain parts of that resolution. It is 
resolution headed ANC credibility and integrity dealing with 
corruption.  The first bullet reads: 
“An increase in corruption, factionalism, dishonesty, 
and other negative practices that seriously threaten 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 126 of 288 
 
the goals and support of the ANC.” 
Again, the phrase an increase in corruption, it is not the 
first time it's been used, we pointed it out this morning.  
The third bullet: 
“That corruption robs our people of billions that 
could be used for their benefit.” 
The fifth bullet: 
“That current leadership structures seem helpless 
to arrest these practices, either because they lack 
the means or the will or are themselves held 
10 
hostage by them.” 
Now, I understand, Mr President, that you are here as a 
party leader, and what is said and how it is said is 
important in relation to, let me say, how the party responds 
to issues and strategies going forward, no one is blind to 
that fact.  
But what is being referred to there, is it correct to 
assume that one is talking about the hold that previous 
leadership had over the party? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes, the leadership is to be 
20 
seen as a continual that leadership of the ANC and this is 
what 
in 
large 
measure 
distinguishes 
us 
from 
other 
organisations that the leadership that we have would have 
been in place for quite a while, though it continues.  
But I think what we have is that we are now having 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 127 of 288 
 
to respond to precisely some of the challenges that we 
face, which you articulated in the noting part on 256.  
Where 
we 
say 
there 
is 
an 
increase 
in 
corruption, 
factionalism, that seriously threatens the goals and support 
of the ANC that the leadership right now that has had to 
draw a line is responding to precisely to the increase in 
corruption, factionalism and that this problem is not going 
away, it is continuing to entrench itself by increasing.  
Therefore, it requires a drastic action that should 
be taken because it is resulting in less and less support for 
10 
the ANC, weakening the ANC, dividing the ANC and simply 
making the ANC less of a modern party by lack of renewing 
itself, because it is a living organism, it needs to continue 
renewing itself and it remains merry bound and therefore it 
needs to change and this is what has led to realigning the 
set. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   This is…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Pretorius.  When I see 
this part of the report, Mr President, I am reminded of the 
fact that earlier this morning when Mr Freund was leading 
20 
your 
evidence 
and 
questioning 
you 
on 
Parliamentary 
oversight, there was a time where he made the proposition 
that it seemed that the Portfolio Committees I think he was 
talking about that did not have the will or were unwilling to 
do the necessary to deal with these allegations of the 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 128 of 288 
 
Gupta’s, there influence on government and so on.  
But it is interesting that in this report, one of the 
things that is said is, well, maybe the current leadership 
does not have the means, but maybe does not have the 
will.  Maybe they are themselves held hostage by these 
challenges.  
So maybe Mr Freund might not have been too far 
from what the ANC itself was talking about, this is 2017 
August, I think and I think he was talking about the period 
in 2016 here if I am not mistaken. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And this is a resolution of the 
conference.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so it seems to me that he might not 
have been far from what the ANC itself were - after 
analysing the situation came to.  
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes, if you do read this noting 
part, the ANC is being very honest with its – it is being 
very realistic. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   And it goes even further and 
20 
this is precisely what we have experienced, sadly, where it 
also says that, at times, we do things that are not 
according to ANC, or government policies or not legal or 
constitutional, and wait for Courts to correct our actions 
and that is the sad part that this conference was talking 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 129 of 288 
 
about.  But it goes on to resolve what now needs to be 
done, which is precisely what we are now working on 
towards. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So just to put that in its context in 
relation to a statement you made yesterday, that this is 
about drawing a line in the sand that the - what was 
recognised in this resolution, on the face of it are two 
things.  
 
Firstly, that corruption had increased and quite 
10 
simply had become intolerable with the ANC.   
But secondly, that current leadership was unable to 
deal with it, something new had to happen, is that correct? 
We will deal with this the next time around but 
whilst we are here, Clause 7 of the resolution reads; 
“ANC deploys to cabinet especially finance, police 
and justice to strengthen the State capacity to 
successfully investigate and prosecute corruption 
and account for any failure to do so.” 
There has been, let me put it, overwhelming evidence 
20 
before the Commission over the last three years that law 
enforcement agencies over the period under review were 
weakened, is that a fair statement? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Indeed they were weakened. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But we will deal with that insofar 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 130 of 288 
 
as is necessary in the next session.  
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Indeed.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   A third statement was made in 
January 2018 and this is again in reference to the drawing 
of the line, it appears in Bundle 1 at page 152 and in your 
own statement, at paragraph 143, you yourself refer to the 
statement, if I could ask you to turn to page 862, please. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   I seem to have made life very 
easy for you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   As it appears from page 852 this is 
10 
a statement of the National Executive Committee of 8 
January 2018.  
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And if I could take you to page 
862. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes, that is where I am. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is a very clear statement is made 
again, which accords with your description of drawing a 
line in the sand in the 4 t h paragraph: 
“We shall confront corruption and State Capture in 
20 
all 
the 
forms 
and 
manifestations 
that 
these 
scourges assume.  This includes the immediate 
establishment of a Commission of inquiry into State 
Capture, the investigation and prosecution of those 
responsible will be given top priority mechanisms 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 131 of 288 
 
for 
the 
appointment 
of 
individuals 
to 
senior 
government positions, State owned entities and law 
enforcement 
agencies 
will 
be 
strengthened 
to 
improve transparency, prevent undue influence, and 
ensure adequate vetting of candidates.” 
And a lot more is said in the same vein, about that 
renewal, the drawing of the line in the sand and the move 
forward. But if we could, then fast forward to August 2020 
by all accounts a difficult month for you, Mr President you 
will remember, but if we could go to Bundle 1, page 934 
10 
and you deal with this in paragraph 147 of your statement. 
This is a statement of the NEC of August 2020.  
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is an ANC statement on the 
outcomes of the National Executive Committee meeting and 
on page 934, under the head corruption drawing a line it 
reads: 
“The ANC is outraged and deeply embarrassed by 
recent allegations that some including its own 
leaders 
and 
members 
have 
sought 
to 
benefit 
20 
unlawfully 
from 
the 
devastating 
suffering 
and 
impoverishment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
These developments caused us collectively to dip 
our heads in shame and to humble ourselves before 
the people. We acknowledge the justifiable public 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 132 of 288 
 
outrage caused by the depravity and heartlessness 
played 
by 
some 
elements 
in 
government, 
our 
organisation 
and 
the 
private 
sector. 
We 
unequivocally condemn all forms of corruption, 
dishonesty and State Capture involving the public 
and private sectors including collusion, price fixing, 
tender fraud, bribery, illicit financial flows, illegal 
imports 
and 
misuse 
of 
tax 
havens. 
We 
will 
comprehensively fight corruption combining both 
prevention and punishment.  Those who loot public 
10 
resources must face the full might of the law.” 
And then over the page: 
“The moral standing of the ANC has been severely 
damaged by the conduct of some of its members 
who in fact do not deserve to be in our ranks.  We 
are committed to draw a clear line.” 
This is another drawing of the line; 
“Between our organisation and those who steal from 
the people thereby subverting the very essence and 
reason for the ANC’s existence as a servant to the 
20 
people.” 
The next paragraph reads: 
“The meeting recognise that the NEC was clearly 
mandated at the 54 t h National Conference to deal 
decisively 
with 
corruption, 
and 
to 
restore 
the 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 133 of 288 
 
integrity and values of the ANC.  This is a 
responsibility 
that 
cannot 
defer, 
outsource, 
or 
avoid.” 
And that is the page at which the term outsourcing was 
used as being something that could no longer to be done.  
If I may just refer to, two other statements, before asking 
the questions that we need to, if you go to Bundle 1, page 
940. This is also dealt with in your statement at paragraph 
148. This is a letter to the members of the African National 
Congress if I understand it correctly dated 23 August 2020 
10 
and authored by yourself, is that correct? 
This is the well-known statement, which has caused 
some controversy.  If one goes to page 942, it reads two 
thirds the way down the page, well, let us deal a little more 
thoroughly with it on page 942 under the heading we need 
to take responsibility, it reads: 
“As the inheritors of the legacy of Lathuli, Thambo 
and Mandela, we must be honest with our people 
and ourselves.  We must acknowledge that our 
movement the African National Congress has been 
20 
and remains deeply implicated in South Africa's 
corruption problem.  We have to be sensitive to the 
concerns that are being raised by our people about 
our role as a movement in corruption.” 
Certain further statements are made, but further down the 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 134 of 288 
 
page the statement is made: 
“Today the ANC and its leaders stand accused of 
corruption.  The ANC may not stand alone in the 
dock but it does stand as accused number one.  
This is the stark reality that we must now confront.” 
And then if we go finally to the Presidential newsletter of 
August 2020 at page 560.  Sorry, that is the wrong page, 
Bundle 2 I am afraid sorry I have misled you, Bundle 2, 
page 560.  This is a newsletter…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, Mr Pretorius I am still waiting 
10 
for my bundle.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the page Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   560. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I am there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It reads, this is a communication 
from yourself, Mr President, to the nation in your capacity 
as President of the nation but it is appropriate to deal with 
it now: 
“Dear fellow South Africans corruption during a 
20 
national disaster is a particularly heinous type of 
crime and perpetrators are going to be dealt with 
decisively and harshly.” 
And then a few paragraphs down before the next heading: 
“Attempting to profit from a disaster that is claiming 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 135 of 288 
 
the lives of our people every day is the action of 
scavengers, it is like a pack of hyenas circling 
wounded prey.” 
And then an issue that I would like to raise later, Mr 
President over the page under the head multidisciplinary 
approach, you say: 
“Experience here and in many other countries 
shows that a multi-disciplinary approach to tackling 
the commission of alleged criminality is needed for 
the fight against corruption to be successful.  A 
10 
broad 
range 
of 
investigative 
and 
prosecutorial 
capability need to be brought together under one 
roof.” 
And that is one issue regarding the way forward that 
perhaps we can canvass later.  But for the present, this is 
perhaps the strongest language used in the history of 20 
years 
of 
identifying 
corruption, 
corrupt 
activity 
and 
undertaking for the nation as a whole to deal with it 
decisively.  
In other words - and we have seen it before from 
20 
2001 and perhaps before that too, in fact, before that too, 
many lines have been drawn in the sand.  It has been 
drawn in the sand repeatedly, the language, particularly 
under 
your 
Presidency, 
has 
got 
stronger 
and 
less 
equivocal. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 136 of 288 
 
But the question remains in 2018 the line was 
drawn, in 2020 the nation refused, what is it about 
corruption and how can it be explained that despite the 
statements and let us accept that those statements were 
made with seriousness.  What is it about our society that in 
2020 you have to say what you have say about circling 
hyenas when that line has been drawn decisively so many 
times before? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Chairperson I do state it quite 
clearly in my both opening statement and in my main 
10 
statement that over the periods, including the period under 
review, there has been recognition of malaise of corruption 
in the ANC, and what I said earlier, before the break about 
this issue of incumbency that we got into government, and 
we were robed with the powers of the State and ability to 
manage resources, dispense patronage and all that.  
And we have accepted and admitted in the past that 
that has resulted in a number of deviant type behaviours 
and having recognised this over time we have said we need 
to act against it.  And with the elapse of time, we have 
20 
seen the price that is being paid by the people as a whole, 
as they are deprived of good service delivery, because the 
resources are being diverted, have been plundered. 
We have realised that at an economic level, it is having a 
dent against our economy and at a social level it is also 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 137 of 288 
 
having a serious impact.  But over and above that it is also 
having an impact on the ANC itself because it results in the 
breakdown of party discipline, the breakdown of party 
morality and the disregard of our principles and what that 
leads to is the ANC becomes less attractive to ordinary 
citizens and we should support it, we should join it and 
finally it leads to election loss or diminishing support that 
we can see and with this in mind, we decided that we need 
to plug those holes so that the ANC can renew itself and 
regenerate itself, because if we do not we are just on a 
10 
one way ticket to oblivion really, to defeat the poles and we 
therefore need to do something, and either two people 
would have taken less, paid less regard to the impact that 
it has on the ANC itself and on our electoral position. 
 
This time around, that realisation is there, that we 
have got to change direction and do it at the pain if you 
like, you knowing that we could lose support and we have 
seen the decline of our electoral support going down 
continuously.  
 
So all these measures and initiatives and solutions 
20 
have to be embarked upon so that the ANC rids itself of 
those who may well be having other intentions on the 
resources of public. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, it seems to me Mr President that 
because of the influence that the ANC has in society and 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 138 of 288 
 
because 
it 
is 
the 
majority 
party 
in 
parliament, 
the 
government is its government.  It has a very important role 
to play in where the country is going, and if one looks at 
the types of issue that the commission is investigating, one 
can see that whatever it is that the ANC may say we did, 
did not do.  
 
Simply to the point.  That is why corruption has 
reached the levels that it has reached.  That is why we 
hear the kind of evidence that the commission has been 
hearing.  So to the extent that the ANC wishes to be part 
10 
or to even play an important role because it must I think, in 
changing the situation in the country on these matters, it 
cannot do so it seems to me and you may comment on this, 
by looking at those things that are comfortable for it to 
change.  
 
It cannot make a meaningful impact.  It cannot 
make a serious contribution for making a meaningful 
impact on corruption and issues of State Capture unless it 
confronts issues that are painful to confront, and say to 
change things we will have to deal, we have to do certain 
20 
things that we are not comfortable to do.  
 
So as you prepare to come back later, because 
even though you will be dealing with matters wearing your 
cap as president of the country, there will still be ... there 
is still some homework to do as president of the party as 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 139 of 288 
 
we discussed yesterday.  
 
It is going to be important to really look at what are 
those really important things that may need to be looked 
at.   
MR RAMAPHOSA:  That is so true and we have gone 
through the period of retro -  what is it?   
CHAIRPERSON:  Introspection.   
MR 
RAMAPHOSA: 
 
Introspection, 
of 
introspection 
Chairperson, and in part the reason we then decided that 
we are going to advocate seriously advocate for the 
10 
establishment of this commission, whilst there was doubt 
and whilst there was even talk that this commission could 
tear the ANC apart, we were brave enough, courageous 
enough to say this is a necessary process that we must go 
through as part of our own renewal process.  
 
It is almost akin to this legend that is spread around 
of an eagle.  An eagle that has reached its old age, as it 
were and finds that it can no longer catch its preys and 
feed itself.  There is a legend that when that time comes, it 
withdraws and goes to the highest peak of the mountains 
20 
and whilst there, it goes through a very painful process of 
shedding its claws.  
 
Of plucking out its feathers.  They argue that, and it 
is a legend I think, that it bleeds.  It goes through pain and 
suffering and after it has plucked its feathers and taken out 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 140 of 288 
 
its claws, they grow back and it emerges with new 
feathers, new claws and it then starts to fly off and it soars 
and goes even higher and then it functions a lot better.  
 
So this commission is a cathartic moment for the 
ANC, I must say.  It is a very difficult period for the ANC to 
go through because whether people like it or not, the ANC 
is the governing party and it has a dominant presence in 
the life of this country.  
 
It has got to renew itself and this is what has 
brought us here, and our presence here and our support 
10 
for the commission and our participation, is that whole 
process of plucking out our claws and pulling out our 
feathers, so that we may come out of this process new, as 
part of the renewal process.  
 
So this is what we are doing.  Not that it was 
doubted, it was feared, it was contested.  But in the end 
this is where we are and we have got to go through this 
process and beyond your report we should be able to fully 
renew ourselves and deal with the matters that brought us 
here.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The Chair has raised the issue a 
number of times and we have, and in fairness you have Mr 
President, and that is to pry over and above introspection 
which is aimed at the future, but in retrospection to look at 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 141 of 288 
 
the past, to try and understand that things that did happen 
within the party actually happened in order to inform the 
way forward, and is there not, although this is succinctly 
stated, and it is in a sense carefully stated.   
 
It is never the less quite clear and firm and it is 
noting part of the resolution of the 54 t h national conference 
which says current leadership structures seem helpless to 
arrest these practices.  Either because they lack the means 
or the wealth or are themselves held hostage by them.  
 
In other words the practices of corruption and State 
10 
Capture.  Is there not a need to look at that statement 
more carefully, to dissect it, to understand why this 
conference got to where it was, who made the decision? 
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Conference made that it was the noting 
statement and conference being a conference of more than 
5000 delegates from branches, the predominant views that 
are expressed at conference are from ordinary members 
who are representing the branches of the ANC. 
 
As conference reflected on this, it did correctly say 
we seem to be helpless and the leaders seem to be 
20 
helpless as well, and it is either they lack the will or they 
themselves are captured in one way or another but that is 
conference noting and noting with a measure of sadness 
that this is where we are.  
 
Are you helpless, are you do you lack the political 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 142 of 288 
 
will.  So it is a proper analytical observation by delegates 
at the conference and I agree with that, but would say it is 
not true that the entire leadership is captures and it was an 
observation by the delegates.  
 
In a way the proper interpretation of that resolution 
means to me that proof to us as delegates that you, the 
leaders, you have the political will and you are not 
captured and you are going to do something about this.  So 
for me that is the flip side of the coin of that noting 
statement.  
10 
 
So we then have as a leadership to prove to the 
membership that no, as leaders who were then elected at 
that conference, we are not and that is why we fully 
embrace the decision that was taken at the conference that 
we 
will, 
we 
will 
have 
this 
commission 
established, 
purported and we will appear before it to come and testify, 
because we are now involved in a new process.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The concern remains and perhaps it 
does not bear repeating more than once more.  But this 
statement was made, quite starkly made in 2017.  Three 
20 
years later or almost three years later you used the 
language of the heinous of accused number one in the 
dock.  
 
Is there a concern that the observer might have that 
although 
the 
will 
is 
there, 
the 
means 
will 
be, 
the 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 143 of 288 
 
achievements and the methods are not?   
MR RAMAPHOSA:  I would argue that the contrary is true 
now.  The will is there, we are all for instance the 
conference 
having 
taken 
the 
decision, 
the 
national 
executive committee having endorsed that decision.  Also 
as clearly exemplified through the letter that I pend to 
members 
of 
the 
ANC, 
particularly 
after 
the 
Covid 
procurement debacle.  
 
The NEC endorsed the fact that we now need to 
draw a line.  We have got to underscore what we have 
10 
been saying with now action and that is precisely where we 
are headed to now, because we do not want to keep talking 
about this forever and a day.  
 
We now need to be seen to be taking action.  So 
the will is there, the political will is there unquestionably.  
Secondly, the means are also articulated in the same 
resolution that those who are in charge of certain key 
organs of state, like finance, like the police and all that 
must act, and which is precisely what is now happening.  
 
You referred earlier to a multi-disciplinary organ or 
20 
entity that should investigate and opt to prosecuting 
criminality.  This is unprecedented.  It is happening for the 
first time where we have all these disciplines working 
together, but we will talk about that I guess in the next 
session.  
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 144 of 288 
 
 
So the means are being found, the will is there, and 
there is clearly proving that where there may have been 
doubt that action is not being taken because people were 
either not having the will or the means of themselves 
captured with disproving.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I think the resolution or the noting in the 
resolution was new leadership. 
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  We think some of you are held hostage, 
are captured. 
10 
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Yes sir.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Not all of you, but some do not have the 
will.  
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Yes sir.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Some have the will but there is no, they 
do not have the means, but some of you are captured.  
Okay. 
MR RAMAPHOSA:  That is the noting part.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, that is the noting part.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Mr President, if we could move 
20 
briefly to another topic.  Since the line was drawn in the 
sand, the most recent 2017, 2018 line.  
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The question that the Chair would 
be interested in, in order to assist him to formulate his own 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 145 of 288 
 
recommendation, would be what has the ANC done, tried to 
do, 
what 
has 
been 
successful, 
what 
has 
not 
been 
successful and if I could assist in that analysis Mr 
President.  
 
As I understand it, for corrupt activities within the 
party, there are two categories of recourse.  The one is 
internal discipline or referral to the integrity committee, 
and the other is an external consequence or outcome and 
that is criminal prosecution.  
 
Are 
records 
kept 
within 
the 
ANC 
of 
internal 
10 
disciplinary 
proceedings 
and 
internal 
criminal 
prosecutions?  Is there a record? 
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Chairperson, there would be a record 
of 
internal 
disciplinary 
proceedings, 
because 
the 
disciplinary proceedings are quite formal.  I used to be the 
Chairperson of the national disciplinary committee of 
appeal and we kept formal records.  
 
There was nothing that was loose and informal.  So 
they would be there.  They would be scattered all over 
because discipline starts right at the bottom, right through 
20 
to the top.  The criminal prosecutions, I would doubt if we 
would have such a record, because it is a much more state 
formal process which I am sure if we sought to find it, we 
would find it.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We may follow that up in due 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 146 of 288 
 
course Mr President, but for the moment can I ask you 
please to go to page 38 of your own affidavit, paragraph 
86. This is again in the category of recourse.  Paragraph 
86 reads: 
 
“A recurring challenge in the management or 
organisational discipline is that in certain 
instances, 
the 
institution 
of 
disciplinary 
proceedings is dependent on a conviction in a 
court of law.  This is particularly the case with 
respect to offences related to corruption and 
10 
fraud.  This has meant that the organisation 
has been unable to act against members 
facing serious charges or financial impropriety 
until the completion of court processes, which 
then often be lengthy.” 
 
Now that statement can be understood in two 
senses.  The first is that the ANC will only take disciplinary 
action once court proceedings have been concluded or 
conviction in a criminal court is itself a ground for 
disciplinary action in terms of the ANC constitution, but 
20 
whichever way it is regarded, is there any necessary logic 
behind the reservation that one has to wait for criminal 
proceedings to be concluded before internal disciplinary 
proceedings can take place?   
 
Should 
they 
not, 
as 
our 
law 
allows, 
be 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 147 of 288 
 
independently treated?  Our law is quite clear that, well at 
least it is now, that internal disciplinary proceedings and 
voluntary 
organisations 
or 
companies 
or 
elsewhere 
[indistinct – dropping voice], there is no right to remain 
silent.  You may remain silent and suffer the consequences 
and still be disciplined.  
 
I do not want to get into detail and argue the law 
with you.  But there is no need, there is no necessary legal 
barrier to internal disciplinary proceedings being instituted 
and completed before criminal conviction. 
10 
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Yes, I think Chairperson the difficulty 
has always been a person is charged and then at the same 
time simultaneously they are disciplined.  They stand trial 
and the disciplinary process has been done and concluded 
and then they are found not guilty.  
 
In the former state law enforcement.  So what do 
you then do?  Do you go back and undo, for instance if the 
charge was theft in the ANC and the charge is theft in the 
state, what do you then do when they are found not guilty, 
and where we have sort to deal with it, is to say if you 
20 
have been charged of a serious crime that has to do with 
corruption and so forth you should step aside and you are 
then given an opportunity to go and clear your name, while 
having stepped aside.  Go clear your name, and having 
done that, then the disciplinary process in the ANC can 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 148 of 288 
 
then ensue.  
 
Unless of course you could be charged with the 
charge of bringing the ANC into disrepute by having stolen 
a chicken, stolen money or whatever, that will be a 
different matter, but people will always want to link the 
two.   
 
So we thought that the safest route is actually to 
say people should step aside, which were provided for in 
our resolution.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, ja.  Why should it only be ANC 
10 
which has got this problem?  Of course Mr President, with 
your 
trade 
union 
background 
you 
know 
that 
in 
the 
workplace for instance, if an employee is alleged to have 
done something that is a criminal offence, the employer is 
not going to wait for the criminal, for the police to 
investigate and for him to be convicted.  
 
The employer will convene a disciplinary hearing, 
come to a conclusion and if the police get involved and 
there is a criminal case, that is a different process 
governed by Criminal Procedure Act and the criminal law, 
20 
but the employer is done.  
 
If the employee is aggrieved by the employer ’s 
decision, there are forums where to go to.  There are 
processes where to go to and challenge it, and sometimes 
the decision in a criminal court and the decision in a 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 149 of 288 
 
disciplinary inquiry would be different, but the standards 
are different too.  
 
They are applied to the determine the guilt and so 
on. 
 
I 
mean, 
within 
government 
too, 
government 
departments.  I know that the government departments are 
notorious for keeping people’s suspensions for a long time.   
MR RAMAPHOSA:  They do that even to judges.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, judges have got certain processes 
that are compulsory, but the government departments have 
got no processes that are compulsory for them to wait.  So 
10 
and I do not think that those delays are because they are 
waiting for criminal force, but they have got those delays, 
but they do not need to have those delays.  
 
So the proposition is that is not a good ground.  
Every organisation you know, has its own rules.  You 
cannot let somebody who you believe has done something 
completely unacceptable to your organisation, not be 
disciplined by the organisation because if you are going to 
wait until the outcome of a criminal case, which might 
finish in three years and then there might be an appeal 
20 
which might take another three years.  
 
By the time the process is finished, how can you 
still say you are going to have a disciplinary hearing?  So 
it is like you just wait for the courts and when you can deal 
with the matters yourselves.  So the proposition would be 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 150 of 288 
 
that 
the 
organisation 
would 
need 
to 
reconsider 
that 
because I do not think anybody else follows that route.  
MR 
RAMAPHOSA: 
 
I 
think 
Chairperson, 
a 
political 
organisation is very different of say a company and a non-
governmental organisation of another sort.  This is an 
organisation that is composed of very active members who 
take views and positions, and who when they have a sense 
that they are being treated unfairly, respond.   
 
They 
can 
either 
go 
to 
court, 
disrupt 
your 
organisational purpose, processes and all that, and this is 
10 
what we have thought would be fitting for us as the ANC, 
because it has not really been the practice to say if you 
are charged you must step aside.  
 
It has not been the practice.  I know that in many 
organisations, including the private sector, that is the norm 
that if you are charged, you immediately step aside and 
some even do it voluntarily, because they fear that they 
will 
compromise 
the 
image 
and 
the 
integrity 
of the 
organisation.  
 
So they step aside, and could also sometimes argue 
20 
that allow me space, I will take a leave of absence to clear 
my name and of course the hopes on the organisation 
itself, whether they are going to prefer charges against 
that type of person. 
 
So for us it has been a major, major step for the 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 151 of 288 
 
ANC to take, that when charged you have got to step aside 
and when serious allegations, you have got to go to the 
integrity commission and explain yourself.  Now this is a 
new way of dealing with issues that have to do with 
wrongdoing, and it needs space and time to be allowed, it 
needs the space and time so that this new process which 
will eventually emerge as a culture should – should mature 
in the organisation   
 
I would argue that you know suddenly changing it 
before it is tried and tested would lead to a lot of confusion 
10 
hither to people have always argued that innocent until 
proven guilty and they have always said I stay where I am, 
come hell or high water and yet it has an impact – a very 
negative impact on the integrity of the organisation. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you.  There is a great deal of 
academic writing which I am not going to refer to this is not 
an academic occasion that says that in relation to corruption 
a systemic approach should be adopted and it is not enough 
20 
simply to say well if someone does wrong we must discipline 
or charge in a criminal court for whatever it is. 
 
You yourself have mentioned and the resolution of 
the 54t h National Conference spoke about weakening of law 
enforcement agencies.  That we can deal with if we have 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 152 of 288 
 
time next time around. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  For sure. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But I would like to raise it insofar as 
appointments and dismissals are concerned because that is 
a topic we have dealt with here today and yesterday. 
 
The constitution makes it very clear that the head of 
the NPA the NDPP National Director of Public Prosecutions 
has a term of ten years and it has emphasised in that 
judgment that that is very important because it goes to the 
independence and security of tenure of the office. 
10 
 
It is an interesting fact that since 1994 or since the 
establishment of the NPA not one NDPP has lasted his or her 
full term.  What – and you have already taken certain steps 
but perhaps these should be clarified not only in relation to 
the NPA but other law enforcement agencies what steps have 
been taken or considered by the ANC in relation to 
appointment of the heads of the law enforcement agencies 
and their security of tenure and how they should be selected 
and how they should be appointed? 
 
I am not going to ask you to account for the evidence 
20 
led – it has been given over a long period of time before the 
Chair about appointments and dismissals and the period 
under review by the commission but to look at it and we all 
understand that this is the contributing factor as the 
resolution does.  What steps in relation to appointments has 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 153 of 288 
 
– have been considered? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  None – none have been 
considered.  When I initiated the process of appointing the 
current head of the NPA it was like unchartered territory, 
unchartered waters and one did that precisely we wanted to 
have a very transparent process – a process which everyone 
in the country would have confidence in which would go 
through a number of candidates who would be interviewed by 
a selection committee which I appointed at the time it was 
headed 
by 
former 
Minister 
Jeff 
Radebe 
who 
is 
well 
10 
experienced and well 00:04:26 in doing this and he helped 
considerably well in getting us to arrive at this point and he 
was very, very scrupulous in going through a myriad of 
applications that we received. So that – that was a very good 
process whether we will do it with – for others is a matter 
that one would still need to consider. 
 
So in the ANC itself know it has not been including 
the tenure.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And appointments to the civil service 
clearly that is a matter that concerns the ANC as a party has 
20 
referred but also may be dealt with through legislation and 
elsewhere as we have – yourself pointed out.  But is there 
any step that can be taken to isolate appointments and 
dismissals from patronage policy or is that too general a 
question to be fair at this stage? 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 154 of 288 
 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  No it is not too general a 
question.  We mean to put into effect what we have said that 
we need to move away from the politics of patronage.  We 
need to exercise fairness, openness and equity.  
 
Now those are generally accepted principles of doing 
things and there is nothing wrong with approaching the 
appointment of people in that way.  So – and that – that 
saves you from an attack on the issue of patronage that so 
and so was appointed because they are going to be news of 
this and that purpose or nepotism and what have you. 
10 
 
So – so those are principles that I would want to see 
observed as well. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Has any consideration then arising 
from your answer been given to precluding party officials or 
government employees from doing business with the state 
that has been met? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Yes that has been mentioned 
and when it comes to the government officials as it is clearly 
stated in our regulations and in our law that it is prohibited.  
You have got to declare your interest upfront when it comes 
20 
to even public representatives who are in the executive 
positions like ministers that too is prohibited and you have 
got to declare your interests as well. 
 
The one that has to do with the party officials who 
may not be employed in government that is under discussion.  
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 155 of 288 
 
We have got strong views on both sides. There are people 
who argue that what is wrong with me as a party official 
doing business without me and others who hold a strong 
view that once you are a party official you and your close 
relatives should not find yourself doing business with 
(inaudible).  So the latter is still in discussion. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Then has any thought been given to 
legislation 
specifically 
directed 
at 
governing 
executive 
employment 
and 
board 
appointments 
of 
state 
owned 
entities? I know they are covered in certain 00:08:55 of 
10 
legislation? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  What was the question? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Appointment of senior executives and 
board 
appointments 
in 
state 
owned 
entities 
need 
consideration given to directed legislation? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Well that falls under the rubric 
that I spoke about that there are some really key top 
positions that we would still want to have well-appointed and 
for the rest it should really depend on the entity itself as to 
who it appoints.  We should never find ourselves bothering 
20 
about the employment of the janitor of – to the building 
where the state owned enterprise operates or the sweeper or 
you now secretary or director.  So we would only want to 
focus on those who have a bearing whose appointment 
rather has a bearing on the general direction of the company 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 156 of 288 
 
or the entity.   
 
With regards to legislation and of course I mean any 
legislation that would enhance good governance, good 
leadership and everything that is good is – should always be 
welcomed and the state owned enterprise counsel which is 
the presidential state owned enterprise counsel is ceased 
with this matter if I can use a parochial term like that so and 
it is dealing with this and we should be able to get really 
good outcomes and in fact there are already drafts that is 
going to be addressed in precisely this. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The two further topics that perhaps 
could be dealt with in the next round Mr President and the 
first is the draft national implementation framework or its 
professionalization of public service. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I am sure that would be of great 
interest to the Chair. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And the second is procurement 
reform and what is envisaged in relation to that legislation 
20 
that it might – well that is on the table. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  At present.  I may then move to 
another topic please.  It is a topic related to party financing 
in a way or the allocation of party finances.  In your 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 157 of 288 
 
statement at page – to the annexure to your statement in the 
alliance summit declaration page 750 of Bundle 1 there is 
talk of 00:11:55 vote buying.   
CHAIRPERSON:  What page did you say it is? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  750 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  This is a statement made by the 
former President in 2015 he says: 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Which page is it? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The statement begins at  page 748. 
10 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  48? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I want to if I may Mr President refer 
to page 750. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The last paragraph reads: 
“Among other things we have identified the 
debilitating effect of money politics.  Many 
comrades gave concrete examples of how 
some of us participate in the practice of 
buying other comrades to vote for us.” 
20 
And then on page 753 the last few paragraphs read: 
“I want to talk briefly on the challenges we 
are 
having 
on 
the 
membership 
system 
especially how we have approached it as 
primarily a technical matter. Virtually all 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 158 of 288 
 
comrades talked about this. Comrades have 
talked 
about 
instances 
where 
the 
membership system is abused, manipulated 
and subverted.  We have talked about people 
being given money and wined and dined in 
exclusive hotels.  In other words comrades 
here know who has been given money by 
whom, when, how.  The question is whether 
we reported this to the relevant structures, 
what has been done about it?  Does a list 
10 
exist of cases that are being investigated 
and what progress has been made?  The 
officials and the national working committee 
should give urgent attention to this.” 
 
Now just by way of introduction it is – would be 
obvious to any close observer that the practice of buying 
votes is a very important part of the circle of patronage 
politics in other words a person is put in an important 
position cumulates well is able then to buy membership of 
the ruling party and that if anything is a – I do not suppose it 
20 
is a matter of – that could even be debated but I will say it 
anyway that the complete distortion of the constitution 
democratic 00:15:10 system and the (inaudible) association 
and the like but do you have any comment on that practice 
as it occurred, to what extent has it occurred, what has been 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 159 of 288 
 
done to stop that practice? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Well we have spoken about this 
practice 
of 
the 
usage 
of 
money 
and 
the 
usage 
of 
compromising comrades through money, vote buying, yes 
even wining and dining and just spreading money around.  
And when it comes to distorting our membership system 
which former President speaks about here steps have been 
taken to – to streamline our membership systems so that it is 
not made subject to manipulation or to being hijacked by 
those who may want to just buy a membership for others or 
10 
pay membership for others. 
 
It is – it is now digital, it is almost human free in 
terms of the way it functions, so that outside human free it 
depends on the member you have to do work through various 
other 
identity 
items 
or 
devices 
so 
it 
frees 
us 
from 
manipulation so that helps a lot and what former President is 
talking about here is absolutely to the point. 
 
The one about wining and dining and handing out 
money and all that it is much more difficult to deal with I 
guess because it happens in the shadows, dark corners and 
20 
those type of places.  In the end you need to more broadly 
guard against you know those who would be brought into 
various positions for patronage purposes and this is where 
we will work very hard to uphold the values and principles of 
the ANC so that those who may get into the grip of such 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 160 of 288 
 
people should be minimised to a large extent. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You yourself Mr President – sorry had 
you finished? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You yourself raised the issue in quite 
clear terms in paragraph 167.3 of your statement at page 74 
of Bundle 1 if I can read it to you? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   
“The ANC has recognised the erosion over 
10 
time of its organisational integrity.  This 
process as had been manipulated to advance 
the material interest of certain members and 
associated 
private 
companies 
and 
individuals. This manifests itself and weak 
and pliable branches vote buying and gate 
keeping where certain potential members are 
deliberately 
prevented 
from 
joining 
or 
participating 
factionalism 
and 
even 
open 
conflict this provides fertile ground for state 
20 
capture and corruption.” 
 
We have spoken about the patronage circle where it 
compounds itself like compound interest to the patron 
obtaining resources favours and money to be able to cement 
his or her position through these processes.  Do you have 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 161 of 288 
 
any comment on that articulation of the issue? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  No, no, no, no comment except 
to say yes and I agree entirely those are ills that you want to 
get rid of in the ANC. It will take time but the will and the 
means are certainly there to ensure that we – we rid the 
organisation of such ills. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And it is in effect those branch 
members who elect senior officials in the party who have a 
great influence on the way the country is run and what 
happens in (inaudible) but also in effect the President.  They 
10 
elect the President of the ANC who becomes the President of 
the country so it is an enormous power in our democracy that 
can be so manipulated.  It is a serious issue. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  It is a very serious issue and it 
is for that reason that the – we raise this issue because it is 
serious and we raise the level of consciousness and 
alertness 
against 
such 
deviant 
behaviour 
within 
our 
membership structure. So we – it is a process that we need 
to embark on and we have already started with that one 
(inaudible). 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  In your … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius if we are going to go up to 
four 
maybe 
we 
can 
proceed 
up 
to 
four 
without 
an 
adjournment.  If we are going to go to five maybe this might 
be the right time for a short adjournment? 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 162 of 288 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Chair I … 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  It depends on what you… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I certainly do not want to be 
presumptuous. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But I think it is for the President to .. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I – it just appears to me that it has 
been two long days and the President should be free to say 
whether and when. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  So I can go home now? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  With my permission. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  I am just pulling your leg. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well – maybe whatever the position is 
maybe let us take a ten minutes break whatever – whether it 
is going to be four or whatever let us take a ten minutes 
break.   
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  That is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  That is fine with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   The President is the only one who is 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 163 of 288 
 
being questioned here, so maybe you are right to say we 
must find out whether his instance where he was earlier.  
They said we can go in – up to five.  Is that still the 
position? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes, that is the position. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Thank you, Mr President.  
Mr Pretorius, I know that you are the only one standing, 
who has been standing for some time.  [laughs]  But I 
guess, if you still have issues to deal with, let us try and 
go up to five because the President is making himself 
10 
available.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, it will be until quarter to five 
because ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ..the President does have a closing 
statement he wishes to make. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So if I may go for, say, an hour but 
I am not sure I will take that time.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Because I intend to wrap up 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, the idea is just that we must use 
every minute we can, that we should use it.  We still have 
issues to deal with ...[intervenes]  
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 164 of 288 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...subject to ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...where I fail you will... 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am sure if I stop early, you will fill 
the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] Okay alright. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You have a section of your 
statement Mr President, that talks about your response to 
the ANC allegations of state capture and you deal with that 
10 
at paragraph 93, page 41 and following.  The concept of 
state capture has been defined by yourself, I do not want 
to put words into your mouth in your statement, but how do 
you understand the concept of state capture?  It is still 
something that the Chair will have to deal with in the 
fullness of time but perhaps you could assist him in that 
regard. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Well, in our country the state 
or the concept of state capture, really, it is wrapped up 
with corruption and it gained prominence as we were 
20 
observing how certain interests positioned themselves to 
have control over, you know, state institutions in relation to 
the appointment of people to them, in relation to the 
resources of those institutions, and also how they had 
ensconce to themselves with political leaders who they 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 165 of 288 
 
sought to, as it appeared, to want to influence and what we 
got to hear was how it manifested itself in the form of 
whisperings by those people about dispensing patronage, 
dispensing positions, appropriating government contracts 
in various state institutions as well.   
 
And that smacked of unlawful involvement in 
those institutions and undermined the processes, the 
known and legal processes that those institutions were 
supposed to have.  And it was represented through a family 
who befriended certain people in government up to and 
10 
including getting those people to claim that these our 
friends and they even underpinned what they were doing 
with ideological articulations that they were advancing the 
concept of black economic empowerment.   
 
And as it involved, we started seeing how even 
that concept of black economic empowerment was being 
undermined and in fact eroded because they tendered also 
to monopolise and appropriate onto themselves nearly as 
many contracts as possible in the most lucrative ones that 
pushed out your black economic players who by deemed of 
20 
our own policies as government we should have been 
placing more emphasis on because they were previously 
disempowered and we needed to empower them.   
 
So the capture was multifaceted and was so 
effective in that it was all pervasive.  And it was in many 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 166 of 288 
 
ways done in the most clever way because they tended to 
know which contracts will becoming available, where they 
will becoming available.  But I guess, Chairperson, one will 
talk about that in the next session.  So one should not 
carried away.  So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no ...[intervenes]  
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   ...that is how I understood the 
matter of state capture. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine.  May I ask this question 
because it crossed my mind earlier.  I seem to read 
10 
somewhere and maybe it was not true that one or more of 
the Gupta brothers were members of the ANC.  Would you 
know that or is that something that you do not know? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Chairperson, I have also 
heard that.  I never saw the evidence or proof of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   There were certain signposts along 
the road of state capture history in the period under review 
or alleged state capture.  As the Legal Team we must 
confine ourselves to the moment.  The signs were quite 
clear.  It deserves more attention but perhaps if we have 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 167 of 288 
 
time in the next round we can deal with it in more detail 
but there was the address to the NEC by Mr Mbalula.   
 
There 
was 
the 
Waterkloof 
landing 
and 
the 
response to the Waterkloof landing.  I must say in that 
regard, it is a matter of some amazement but Mr Koloane, 
who clearly breached security, became an ambassador with 
a security clearance.  Should that not cause huge outrage 
within the party? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Well, it did raise eyebrows, 
let me say.  It raised quite a few eyebrows but it happened 
10 
as it did and that is how it happened. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I see your eyebrows are raised as 
far as they can go.  [laughs] 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   [laughs] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But perhaps that belongs in the 
state portion.  It is such an alarming event that I should 
not comment further but I could not resist mentioning it.  
Then there was the dismissal of Mr Nene and the 
appointment of Minister Van Rooyen and related to that 
was the March 2006 revelation of Mr Jonas and you have 
20 
dealt with that this morning but those issues gave rise to at 
least series of events that I think should be dealt with and 
to one observation that I would wish to put to you for your 
comment.   
 
He says the events was the appointment of the 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 168 of 288 
 
internal inquiry.  We know that the internal inquiry that was 
mandated by the ANC NEC received one written response, 
eight people came forward with oral responses and there 
was, as it appears from your own bundle, at page 126 and 
following, a sense that these eight at least said they were 
prepared to make submissions to an independent body.  
How does one explain that?  How does one explain, firstly, 
the failure of the internal inquiry?   
 
Secondly, the sentiment that they would prefer to 
testify before an independent body?  And thirdly, the fact 
10 
that the knowledge was within the ANC and it did not come 
out.  What happened there?  What was the explanation for 
that series of events?   
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Chairperson, I guess the 
inquiry that was initiated by the Secretary General was a 
rather proper process to follow because he wanted as the 
Head of the SGO, that is the Secretary General’s Office, to 
formulise the receipt of the complaints because one person 
had complaint publicly and we realised that it is much 
bigger problem and let us elicit more of such and in the 
20 
event, only one person was prepared to put that in writing.   
 
I guess the others, I guess, for reasons best 
known to them, wanted a more formal a process which 
would be two things.  Which would be able to conduct a 
thorough investigation and two, which would in some ways 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 169 of 288 
 
also shield them so that they can speak freely because for 
a variety of reasons because some of these things are so 
sensitive.   
 
People did not just want to talk about them 
freely and loosely.  They wanted a more formalised 
process.  And I think we should applaud them because in 
many ways those seven are the unsung heroes and 
heroines who helped us to get to this Commission because 
they basically said we are prepared to talk so long as there 
can be a formal process.   
10 
 
That they then asked to realise that this is a 
much bigger problem.  We now need to advocate for the 
establishment of a commission and that, in many ways, 
was the beginning processes of, in a way, demanding, 
advocating and calling for the establishment of your 
Commission, Chairperson.  So I would say the realisation 
within the ANC was growing and growing and this is where 
we are now. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  Mr Mantashe had certain 
comments to make about it.  He said that, in fact, that 
20 
because of the low numbers of submissions it would be a 
fruitless exercise for the ANC to investigate.  He said:  
When they do not come forward to the ANC, the ANC will 
not force them.  It does not mean that we are walking away 
from it but if you make allegations then you must be bold 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 170 of 288 
 
enough to take the matter through. 
 
Many did say that the discussion of the ANC on 
state capture is going to continue for a long time.  So he 
did not see it as the end of the road, clearly.  But you have 
commented on what it says about the eight members 
concerned and what their view was.  Was that say about 
the ANC?  Did they trust the ANC as it was constituted at 
that time and if they did not, why not? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   I guess they did not distrust 
the ANC.  They were rather grateful that their inputs had 
10 
been 
solicited 
because 
for 
them 
too 
it 
would 
have 
represented an opportunity, almost a valve to take out, you 
know, the tension and everything.  But then again, knowing 
the limitations of a political organisation like the ANC in 
terms of investigating very fine allegations and all that, 
they felt that a more state sponsored or appointed entity 
would be better placed and would be able to add also 
credibility more publicly.  And I think it is less about not 
trusting the ANC and more about wanting a formal process. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But also, Mr President, I must say that I 
have a feeling that there are many maybe current DG’s, 
DDG’s and past DG’s and heads of departments who 
maybe members of the ANC who must have known a lot of 
things 
that 
should 
have 
been 
brought 
before 
the 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 171 of 288 
 
Commission and who simply have not responded positively, 
both to my own cause or people in South Africa to come 
forward with information which I have made over the two-
and-a-half years, as well as to the cause by the ANC itself 
to say its members must come forward and assist the 
Commission.   
 
So one wonders what it is because there must be 
so many others.  Those who have come forward who have 
testified, I think we applaud them but I think they are a 
very small minority if one has to think of how many DG’s 
10 
and HOD’s in provinces and so who must know quite a lot 
of things that happened.   
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Chairperson, I think we need 
to look at the personal circumstances of people because 
the human element does kick in.  Your Commission is a 
very highly publicised forum.  It takes guts and courage for 
anyone to come here to testify and I am filled with awe as I 
have looked at the many people who have become before 
the Commission to testify.  Others had to come, they have 
been directed to come and some you have subpoenaed and 
20 
others have volunteered.  So it is not everyone who will be 
inclined in that way and who will have that type of courage 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   ...to have their testimony 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 172 of 288 
 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, ja.   
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   ... in public ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   ...and under the scrutiny of 
the media.  And sometimes people may think it is career 
limiting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  I suspect so.  [laughs] 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Its career - it could affect 
their families, it could affect them personally and their 
10 
career prospects.  So it is not easy, Chair, to come before 
you.  People come here trembling and fearful.  So it is not 
everyone who is brave enough to come here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Thank you.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr President, 
there was over time in the period under review a series of 
approaches to the ANC and to the ANC leadership, both 
from within and from without the party, in relation to the 
observation to state capture and I will ask you about your 
own in due course and its manifestation and the frustration 
20 
amongst many but there was the memorandum from the 
veterans.  You will recall that.  That was dealt with at page 
517 of Bundle 02 for the record.   
 
There was the letter from - Watts Foundations.  
You will recall that.  There was the memorandum from the 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 173 of 288 
 
Director General.  You will recall that.  There was the 
inquiry 
conducted 
by 
the 
South 
African 
Council 
of 
Churches and there was, of course, the Public Protector 
Inquiry.  In that context, I want to put to you if I may, and if 
I am taking it out of context, you will pull me up for it.  
Paragraph 103 on page 45 of your affidavit where you say: 
“Another important development during this 
time was the decline in the ANC’s electoral 
support and the local government elections of 
August 2016. 
10 
The 
...[indistinct] 
research 
at 
the 
time 
indicated that the issue of corruption was 
becoming an issue of greater concern amongst 
votes and that it was among the factors that 
contributed to the ANC’s weaker performance. 
This 
was 
one 
of 
the 
more 
direct 
ways, 
although not the only one, in which public 
opinion contributed to a shift in the ANC’s 
response to state capture...” 
 
Let me repeat that last sentence: 
20 
“This 
was 
one 
of 
the 
more 
direct 
ways, 
although not the only one, in which public 
opinion contributed to a shift in the ANC’s 
response to state capture...” 
 
Now you will recall, Mr President, our discussion 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 174 of 288 
 
at the beginning of our evidence yesterday when we spoke 
about 
the 
leadership 
role 
of 
the 
party 
which 
you 
acknowledged.  If an observer was to say to you what the 
ANC did here, was not to respond to the glaring signals of 
stat capture and corruption in the period under review.   
 
Even those various approaches made from within 
and without the party, did not seem to take hold until the 
truth of the loss of electoral support hit home and that was 
the reason the ANC reacted.  In other words, not as leader 
but as follower.  What would you say to that observation? 
10 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Well, it is true that it was the 
reaction of ordinary South Africans that was demonstrated 
through the electoral support that got the ANC to sit up and 
reflect on what corruption and state capture was doing to 
its fortunes.  Even that issue alone was contested in the 
ANC.  There were those who did not think so although they 
were the minority but the majority took heed and this 
became apparent leading to those elections with the 
various election surveys that the ANC does which is done 
by nearly every political party.   
20 
 
Wherever we went and as we engaged with 
people, the number one issue that people were concerned 
about was corruption/state capture.  They were most 
unhappy that their movement that they love so much seems 
to be so deeply emerged in corruption and things to have 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 175 of 288 
 
been captured because as all these reports came out and 
particularly the emails issue it had a negative impact 
whether one likes it or not.  A very, very negative impact, 
the integrity of the party, the image of the party was dented 
and that was reflected in the electoral returns. 
 
So that in itself also had a huge impact on 
getting the ANC to then have the sense that it needed to 
do something because otherwise it would just be a 
continuant slide in its electoral fortunes.  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   For yourself, Mr President, what 
10 
were the signposts along the road or along the way of the 
path of state capture that first alerted you to the existence 
of something much more than corruption?  What was it for 
you that alerted you to the fact that state capture was a 
phenomenon that needed to be dealt with? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Should I answer you on that 
now or when I come back as President of the Republic? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Maybe both but perhaps a summary 
...[intervenes]  
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   [laughs] 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But if it is something you need to 
think about, we ...[intervenes]  
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   That is exactly what I wanted 
to plot out very, very clearly in ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 176 of 288 
 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Because I want to look at the 
various markers for me that indicated where we were.  And 
just like yesterday when I said, you asked me a very good 
and clear question:  What is that we believe were 
indicators that things were going wrong and what should be 
done?  Which is what I will undertake to focus more 
attention on when I return for the next session. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, h’m. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So if you also consider that there 
were these markers and signals and approaches on the one 
10 
hand. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And then there were almost 
contemporaneously events that seemed to counter what 
ought to have been recognised, for example the closure of 
the bank accounts and the response of the ANC Cabinet 
and the pop sticks to that but maybe a matter that could be 
dealt with.   
 
But if one looks at the timeline of warning 
signals and actions taken and actions not taken and look, 
20 
actually, at what was happening within government at the 
time, there is a call for an explanation which would take 
me to and I am happy to wait for the fuller explanation 
because after all the reason you have given two days of 
your time so far, Mr President, is to give a full explanation. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 177 of 288 
 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   A considered explanation and 
which is understandable. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Let me say, the issues that 
you raised, what were the markers before me is contained 
in my statement which you have not seen yet.  You have 
just ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Oh, you will ...[intervenes]  
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   ...the content.  The full 
statement is going to be handed in and it will deal with it.  
10 
It is not a question of avoidance now.  It is a question of 
seeking to do it systematically. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   So that I do not do it on a 
piece-fully basis. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  No, that is fine.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  By way of summary, there 
are two issues that I would like to deal with.  One is a 
summary on deployment just to put very clearly where the 
Commission and the Legal Team stands on the evidence.  
20 
The other is to outline, by way of summary, what we have 
discussed earlier but it seems clear that there is an 
acknowledgment 
by 
yourself 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
party, 
Mr President, that there is no doubt that it is in the 
evidence that you have put out that corruption and state 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 178 of 288 
 
capture was to a serious degree is acknowledged.  No 
question about that issue.  There may be a debate about 
the degree. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And those issues will be dealt with 
by the Chair, finally, in reviewing two years’ of evidence 
before the Commission.  The second area and perhaps 
could be more systematically explored and that is how 
could these things happen, what was going on within the 
party that allowed these things to happen to the extent 
10 
they did and we have certain clues and signs and 
resolutions and the like.  And perhaps it will be up to the 
Chair to translate the careful political language and the 
rest of the issues... 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   [laughs]  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...into a more clearly directed 
language and I am sure the Chair will not shy away from 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   [laughs] 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But it does, I think, a more 
systematic approach particularly in regard to the second 
round where we will...  And the third thing is, the way 
forward in terms of the proposed legislation and reforms, 
procurement, deployment, appointments to support SOEs 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 179 of 288 
 
and the like and perhaps that will be summarised the next 
time around but there is one gap that we have not dealt 
with and that is the consequences.  We have closed the 
door gently on the past but we have not really spoken of 
who should be called to account and for what.   
Now again that is up to the Chair to deal with, it is 
wrapped up with the question of law enforcement agencies 
but I certainly I think that – not that I think, certainly there 
is a view that accountability should be a priority in this 
whole process, we cannot just shut the door gently on the 
10 
past and perhaps apart from internal discipline, which we 
have dealt with, the question of accountability before law 
enforcement agencies, how that is going to be approach, 
what is to be done, whether it should be done or whether 
we should just leave the door, be shut gently, can be 
discussed in the next round because it is a matter of state 
governance, law enforcement agencies and the like. 
And the final issue that perhaps should be closely 
explored – it is a sensitive issue but it is an issue that I 
certainly think should be dealt with – those institutions of 
20 
government 
whose 
job 
it 
was 
to 
alert 
government 
leadership of what was really happening, where were they?  
Were they disempowered?  Were they misdirected? What 
happened there?  That I think is an important element for 
understanding 
what 
happened, 
how 
it 
should 
have 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 180 of 288 
 
happened or how it could have happened and why it was 
not 
detected 
a 
prevented 
earlier 
and 
I 
am 
talking 
particularly about State Security Agency in this case, but 
we can deal with next time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are done? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Done.  Well, yes, in more ways 
than one.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But you are done for now? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is there an answer? 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Apart from the closing statement 
that the President wishes to make. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  But you have not asked him a 
question that he still needs to answer, is that right? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Well, Mr President …[intervenes] 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
Certainly 
it 
has 
not 
been 
interpreted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let me ask you this – let me raise 
this issue with you, Mr President.  The current electoral 
20 
that we have does not give the people, the voters the right 
to choose or elect their President, that is the President of 
the country.  It allows each political party that is taking 
part in elections to put up its own candidate and the voters 
have – or the voters know that if I vote for this party this 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 181 of 288 
 
will be the – this candidate or their candidate will be the 
President.  Now I cannot remember whether there is a 
requirement legally that each party must indicate who its 
presidential candidate is at the time of campaigning or not, 
probably it can change, I am not sure, but basically the 
voters cannot – do not elect the President, they vote for a 
party and effectively the majority party in parliament after 
the elections will get their own candidate to be voted as a 
President.   
 
Now what do you say to the proposition that that 
10 
system puts at least some voters in a predicament if the 
party that they would like to vote for and that they love 
puts up a candidate that they consider to be unsuitable to 
be president because they cannot say I am voting for the 
party but not for this person.  If they vote for the party, 
they are taken to have voted for that candidate and yet 
they know they do not want this candidate because they do 
not think the candidate is suitable but that is the system, 
as it stands.  What would you say to the proposition that 
consideration should be given to changing that part of the 
20 
system at least to enable the president of the country to be 
voted directly by the voters so that the system would be, if 
I want to vote for this party but I do not want their 
candidate because I think they have made a wrong choice 
but I see somebody else who is a good candidate, I can 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 182 of 288 
 
vote for that person, I am not tied to this either party that I 
like or nothing.  So, in other words, you give the power to 
the people to that extent.   
Obviously each party could still say so and so is our 
candidate, presidential candidate, but when you come to 
the actual voting, a vote for the party is not necessarily a 
vote for that candidate, you can vote separately and in that 
way the president of the country comes directly from being 
voted by the people and in a way parties are encouraged to 
put up candidates that are suitable because if they put up 
10 
candidates that might not be suitable, the voters might not 
vote for them.  Have you got some view on that? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Lots of views, Chairperson.  
Lots and lots of views.  It is a proposition that is quite 
complex and obviously requires a lot of time and maybe it 
goes to the origins of the constitutional construct because 
when we started off – and maybe it was a problem of 
learning from so many constitutions around the world that 
we ended up wanting to craft a different path and in 
crafting a different path, we opted for the Westminster type 
20 
of system but which is not, you know, full Westminster 
process because with Westminster, it is party-based but it 
is also constituency-based which is what obtains in say 
Lesotho, which is pure Westminster, which is what obtains 
in the UK, so we in a way opted for that but at the same 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 183 of 288 
 
time we opted for no constituency at the national and 
provincial 
level 
but 
still 
went 
for 
constituency 
and 
proportional representation at the local level.  And, if you 
like, would have said well, we wanted to attain certain 
objectives 
at 
the 
local 
level 
because 
we 
saw 
local 
government as being the level of government that matters 
most.   
 
But at a national level what we were seeking to 
achieve as the unity of the nation, we did not want to go 
for pure Westminster which would be based on winner 
10 
takes all because if we had one that, we feared that a 
dominant party like the ANC would take too many seats 
and you would remain with too few parties or maybe a two 
party system as they have largely in a country like the UK.  
We wanted more representation, even smaller parties 
should feel that they are represented in the parliament of 
the people. 
 
When it comes to the point that you are raising, 
which is the election of the president, I could say that we 
are – possibly the one odd out on our continent because 
20 
many countries on the African continent and indeed many 
other countries around the world who have a presidential 
system where people vote for a president, at the same time 
vote for the party and then it in some cases cascades 
further down to a constituency system and sometimes a 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 184 of 288 
 
mixed system. 
 
Now we did not consider that, we rather opted for a 
system where the party would be the one to be voted for 
through a proportional voting system and that even if it is 
not written in any regulation or law it is presumed and that 
is what has evolved through practice, that every party that 
will be running for elections will nominate the face of the 
campaign who, if they win, would presumably become the 
number one or sort of be the president.  
 
Now clearly in our system, when people vote, they 
10 
would know – and in the ANC constitution and systems it 
has been written clearly that the President of the ANC 
becomes the face of the campaign, so ANC members and I 
say 
supporters 
would 
know 
that 
the ANC 
President 
automatically becomes the candidate for the party.  So that 
is known but it is not part of the national constitutional 
system. 
 
So what you are saying, clearly it is a matter that 
we have never really subjected to debate within the ANC 
and largely because we have never really seen the need 
20 
for it because when we go to the polls it is known who is 
going to be the face of the campaign as well as when we 
do win, who becomes the president. 
 
Now I suppose what you are saying is based on the 
ability of the populace to either recall in one form, shape 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 185 of 288 
 
or other and they would only be able to recall through 
another vote, another national vote, I presume, without 
being seen as being negative.  We have been able to do 
that 
through 
international 
party 
processes 
where 
unfortunately, we have had to do President Zuma being 
recalled..   So I think it is a matter that can be discussed 
and one need to demonstrate its attractiveness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   What would be attractive with 
it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   You look at – let me for one 
moment – you look at for instance a pure presidential 
system as, I would say, operates in a few countries and the 
United States for me stands out where a President 
basically without so much hearty full party support, you 
know, amasses a machinery that propels a person.  And 
then they then start acting as Lone Rangers, as it were, on 
a whole number of things.  One would argue that is that 
what we want?  Do we want almost like an imperial type of 
20 
political system where a president acts, you know, on a 
lone basis on many things or do you want a president who 
is – who operates on a collegiate basis with his other 
colleagues in the party, who is bound by party strictures, if 
I can put it that way, party rules, party policies, so that it is 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 186 of 288 
 
never seen like it is an individual who propounds a policy 
and then acts on it on their own and yet in the system that 
we have, you will hardly ever find [indistinct] for the ANC, 
an ANC president who would just wake up one morning and 
just say we are going to build a wall from here to 
Beitbridge without having discussed it in the party.  So one 
needs to consider things like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Whether we want a sole-
acting president or we want a president who acts within the 
10 
confines of the collegiate type of a forum where issues are 
properly discuss but, more importantly, where policy – 
where policy is properly discussed and where the president 
does 
not 
pronounce 
policy 
through 
Twitter, 
through 
Facebook where the president pronounces policy as it 
emerges from a collective discussion.  So those are the 
issues that we would need to discuss. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, no, that is fine.  I now give you 
– or Mr Pretorius, you want to say something? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   There is perhaps once thing I 
20 
should mention.  In fact I intended to mention it and that 
was in relation to cadre deployment or deployment, that 
the topic is still live, Mr President.  We have discussed 
your views which we put on one side of the spectrum, that 
it is recommendations only, we have discussed to a certain 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 187 of 288 
 
extent the evidence on the other side of the spectrum, the 
hard definition of deployment, where it is a compulsory 
appointment in the hands of the committee and we have 
discussed 
a 
third 
category 
which 
was 
appointment 
principally by the former president and ministers in the 
period under review which may or may not have anything to 
do with the deployment committee.   
There will be evidence that deals with the issues of 
appointments particularly to state institutions like National 
Prosecuting Authority, law enforcement agencies as well as 
10 
the state owned entities in which the issue will be 
canvassed further and after that there may be some issues 
to raise concerning whether the deployment committee 
should continue to exist, but that is a party decision, it is 
not our decision.  And, if so, the form of regulation that 
might exist which might be within the province, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, Mr Pretorius, there are two matters 
that have crossed my mind which the President needs to be 
asked questions on at some stage or another.  The one 
relates to a matter that could have been dealt with while he 
20 
was appearing as President of the ANC but he can be 
asked next time because there are other matters relating to 
the party that he will still deal with when he comes back. 
 
The other one falls under the session where he will 
be appearing as President of the country.  The one is a 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 188 of 288 
 
matter which was raised by – relates to evidence that was 
given by a witness here who complained that the President, 
while he was Deputy President, gave an instruction to an 
SOE that affected his employee in the SOE.  So that 
clearly falls under the next session because that relates to 
government. 
 
The other one relates to, as I see it, at least in part, 
when he was not in government, yes, and that is where a 
witness alleged that he was chairperson of a certain 
company at a certain time and maybe he should not have 
10 
played a certain role after he went into government so they 
will have to be dealt with in the next session. So I just 
thought …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Indeed, Chair. That is currently 
dealt with by one of the SOE evidence leaders. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, not that is – I mean, the one clearly 
falls under the next session but the other one could be 
said to fall under when he appears as president of the 
party but can be dealt with the next time because there are 
matters that fall under party that will still be dealt with. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair, and there is one other 
matter that relates to the question that the President is 
going to consider and that is the warning signs along the 
path. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 189 of 288 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And that relates to the President’s 
affidavit filed with the Commission in 2019. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And that will be raised then. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, that is fine.  Mr President, I now 
give you the opportunity to make the statement that you 
wish to make. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   No, thank you, Chairperson.  
It is really a statement to say thank you to the Commission 
but maybe before doing so, I would just like to take a 
10 
moment to reflect on one matter.   
It is about the passing away of the first Mayor or 
Executive Mayor of Johannesburg who served the City from 
this building here.  He passed away a few days ago at the 
age of 89 and that was Mr Isaac Mogase.  And I do so to 
pay respect – may respect to him, to his memory as the 
first Mayor of Johannesburg and the fact that we are 
meeting here in a room where he worked.  It is significant 
to mention his passing at this time because it was in this in 
this very chamber that Mr Mogase so ably represented the 
20 
people of this city but it is also a joy for me to pay my 
respects to him because I worked with him in 1990 when 
we 
were 
both 
together 
with 
Mama Albertina 
Sisulu, 
members of the Soweto People’s Delegation led by Mr 
Isaac Mogase as we engaged with the then Transvaal 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 190 of 288 
 
Provincial Administration to deal with the rent boycott in 
Soweto but also to deal with another important issue which 
was the transfer of the ownership of the houses to the 
people of Soweto.  As you well know, in the past our 
people never owned their homes, they just rented forever 
and ever and part of the rent – the boycott of paying rent 
was largely around that and he led us very ably.  So, for 
me, this is an opportunity to pay my respects to him 
particularly because we are here and to pay condolences 
to his family. 
10 
But I would like, on behalf of the ANC to thank the 
Commission for allowing the organisation the space and 
the time to present our statement and to present ourselves 
to be questioned by you as well as by the evidence leaders 
to give an explanation of what happened.  We hope that 
this testimony together with the testimony that has also 
been given by other leaders of the ANC who testified on 
behalf of the ANC will assist the Commission because our 
understanding is that this is not a trial, this is a 
Commission of Inquiry and we have come here to assist 
20 
you, Chairperson, so that you can form a clearer picture of 
the ANC’s approach to corruption so that we can also 
explain our knowledge of and response to allegations of 
state capture.   
I know that there are a number of other issues that 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 191 of 288 
 
you will still need to put questions to me on as the 
President of the Republic and but you also hopefully have 
heard the measures that we have put in place to address 
some of the mishaps, the gaps and state capture itself so 
that we ensure that it never ever happens again and how 
we are addressing it with regard to our own organisational 
measures. 
Now over the past two days we have traversed what 
I see as a number of matters.  These are matters that have 
been of public interest and of importance to your work as a 
10 
Commission.  Now due to the constraints of time we were 
not able, as clearly evidenced by the evidence leaders 
saying that they would have wanted to ask more questions, 
but we have been able in the past two days to cover quite 
a lot of ground and I hope, Chairperson, you would be able 
to read through the detailed account in my own statement 
as well as the annexures that I presented so as to shed 
more light on                       our own explanations on what 
we have put forward. 
Obviously when I return to the Commission I will 
20 
reflect on the actions that we have taken in the state to 
end state capture, to dismantle the networks that made it 
possible and to rebuild the efficacy and integrity of state or 
public institutions. 
We are mindful of the fact that the mandate of the 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 192 of 288 
 
Commission does not extend to how political parties must 
function and that it is the sole prerogative of political 
parties themselves, particularly the ANC to determine their 
own organisational arrangements and some of the thoughts 
and the suggestions that have been put there obviously we 
will reflect on with a view of seeing how best we too can 
improve the way that we function.  For instance, we too 
can be able at a very early stage to see all those markers, 
those indicators which we have spoken about.   
We do, however, accept that it is necessary for the 
10 
Commission 
to 
examine 
how 
internal 
processes 
and 
practices of political parties impact on the functioning of 
public institutions, we fully appreciate how the state 
capture occurred because in the way that we have 
functioned 
as 
a 
party, 
it 
has 
an 
impact 
on 
public 
institutions in our country and we must accept that and 
your Commission has patently made that very clear to us. 
Now in undertaking this examination, it is necessary 
to recall that there was significant contestation within the 
African National Congress on some of the matters that are 
20 
before the Commission and I think we have articulated 
that.  So as we examine all this, we should not be just 
lineal in our examination of this.  We should be able to 
deal with the contours of the various issues that the party 
itself had to deal with. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 193 of 288 
 
It is also important to remember that state capture not only 
undermined the integrity and the capability of public 
institutions, it also deeply damaged the effectiveness of 
the African National Congress itself.  So it did affect us a 
party, it did affect the state.  As we recognised at our 54 t h 
conference, state capture has had a profound impact on 
the coherence and the unity of the ANC, its ability to carry 
out its mandate and mission to work for the people of 
South Africa, as part of its efforts to make what I would all 
a decisive break with the era of State Capture.  The ANC 
10 
itself has embarked as I sought to explain on a journey of 
a new world regeneration and I believe that the work of 
this Commission, as much as its purpose is to serve the 
nation will in the end also assist the ANC along the path of 
renewal. 
 
Although it is at times very uncomfortable and 
difficult for the ANC we welcome this scrutiny as a 
necessary step in tackling corruption in the State and 
across the side, and when I say across the side I say so 
advisedly because in many ways it would also be helpful if 
20 
we could have reflected on greater scrutiny on other 
entities other than the State in the way they themselves 
aided 
and 
abetted 
State 
Capture. 
 
That 
is 
various 
companies because in the end it is possible and indeed it 
is not only the Gupta related companies that participated, 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 194 of 288 
 
it is other companies as we well, but I wish to conclude by 
paying tribute to all those South Africans who have played 
a role in unearthing corrupt activities that we now know as 
State Capture. 
 
Here I make reference to those who have been 
whistleblowers and whistleblowers have not had a great 
time in our country, once they blow the whistle they have 
been subjected to enormous pressures, pressures that 
have affected them personally, professionally, career wise 
and also has affected their own household.  There have 
10 
been brave men and women of our country who because of 
their abhorrence of corruption blew the whistle and I regret 
that in many instances we have not treated them well, and 
we therefore need to have some process, legislation, of 
being able to protect whistleblowers.    
 
We could say that we have got various policies but 
they have not really proven that they are effective.   Some 
whistleblowers have even been killed, but I also want to 
pay tribute to journalists.  Journalists have really gone 
beyond the call of duty in many respects, in getting the 
20 
country to be where we are today.  ...[Indistinct] spoke 
about some of the challenges that journalists face but we 
pay tribute because they have in many ways been very 
patriotic and played a very key role. 
 
I also want to pay tribute to law enforcement 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 195 of 288 
 
officials, staff of Chapter 9 Institutions, members of the 
judiciary, no doubt members of parliament and government 
officials as well as members of the governing party and ot 
her parties as well as the alliance partners of the 
governing party and leaders of a whole number of other 
parties and various civil society formations who were vital 
in bringing many issues to light and to the fore, and they 
continue 
where 
there 
is 
wrongdoing 
they 
are 
even 
courageous enough to be able to bring those to the fore.   
 
There are many people who paid a great price 
10 
Chairperson for taking a principled stand, and as I was 
saying it takes a lot for people to come to this Commission 
but it even takes a great deal more to either be a 
whistleblower, to be a journalist and to be an active citizen 
who will want to take a stand. 
 
There 
are 
many 
people 
who 
withstood 
great 
pressure and took great risks.  The nation owes much to 
each of these people for they have each in different ways 
reaffirmed 
the 
values 
of 
our 
constitution 
and 
our 
democracy.   
20 
 
Now the existence of this Commission owes much to 
the determination of ordinary South Africans who stood up 
against corruption and State Capture.  The existence of 
this Commission and the fact that it is able to undertake 
such 
a 
far-reaching 
denomination 
or 
investigation, 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 196 of 288 
 
expensive as it has been, is a testament to the strength of 
our democracy and the institutions that support it. 
 
So a sitting president come to a Commission such 
as this one, a Commission that he has established, some 
people said it is unheard of, but we felt that it was 
important to come both as President of the Governing Party 
as well as President of the country.   Now as the ANC we 
deeply appreciate the work of this Commission and reaffirm 
our total commitment to provide whatever assistance we 
can to ensure that this Commission fulfils its mandate and 
10 
it is with those words Chairperson that without being 
patronising that I would like to thank you and thank this 
opportunity that you have given to the ANC. 
 
Thank you very  much. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much Mr President for 
your remarks, we appreciate them very much. 
 
I was going to say and I don’t know whether you 
read my mind, I was going to also refer to the fact that I 
am not aware in the history of this country of a sitting 
President appearing before a Commission, I may be 
20 
mistaken but I cannot remember but I think it is very 
important and I say that quite alive to the fact that 
yesterday and today you were appearing not as President 
of the country but as President of the ANC but the reality is 
that you are President of the country as well, that you have 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 197 of 288 
 
appeared before the Commission but also to state that it is 
quite important that the ruling party, the majority party in 
Parliament, has taken the attitude that you have conveyed 
to the Commission and to the nation at large that they 
decided that they would support this Commission.  They 
know that some of the things – they knew that some of the 
things that would come out of the Commission would not be 
easy to deal with but nevertheless concluded that it was a 
process that they should support and the President of the 
Ruling Party, President of the country, came to the 
10 
Commission and said I will give evidence on all the matters 
that I have knowledge of and that the party has knowledge 
of and I am opening myself up to being questioned openly 
in front of the nation because as the ruling party we 
support 
this 
process, 
we 
support 
the 
work 
of 
the 
Commission. 
 
So I think that it is very important and it is 
something that suggests that the ruling party wants to 
account to the nation through this Commission, because it 
realises that while a lot of the things that the Commission 
20 
is looking into were happening it was the ruling the party 
but it wants to come to the Commission and say to the 
nation we may have gone wrong somewhere but we are 
here and we will account and we will explain what we can 
explain and we accept that there may have been certain 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 198 of 288 
 
shortcomings.   I think that that is quite important and as 
the Commission we appreciate that. 
 
As I – as we have agreed the questions have not 
been exhausted they will still be pursued next time, both in 
respect of your position as President of the country and as 
President of the ANC, but I think it is important and the 
fact that the ANC came here also voluntarily is important, 
so thank you very much for making yourself available to 
assist the Commission. 
 
Thank you. 
10 
 
We are going to adjourn the day session of the 
Commission, some of us will come back after a few minutes 
and start the evening session of the Commission.   
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Can I go home now? 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you can go home, you can go home 
now Mr President, you are allowed to go home.  I note that 
you ask whether you can go home. 
 
Thank you we are going to adjourn now, the time is 
one minute to five, I will adjourn for 15 minutes and then I 
will return to deal with another matter. 
20 
 
We adjourn.

CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I didn’t realise you were there so 
sorry about that. 
ADV MASUKU SC:   No, no, no I know that Chair, you had 
10 
better things to do this afternoon than to realise someone 
in Cape Town ... it is good to see you Chief Justice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is good to see you, thank you, thank 
you, and thank you for the cooperation also for us to be 
able to sit this evening.  Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes Chairperson you will recall that 
at the last sitting of Mr Molefe’s evidence he asked for the 
opportunity to put in an affidavit relating to the Abalosi 
settlement, he has done that, we intend to take him 
through that affidavit and then there are a select number of 
20 
other issues that we wish to deal with whereupon I 
presume 
then 
Mr 
Masuku 
would 
conduct 
his 
re-
examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay no that is fine 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I don’t know if Mr Molefe needs to 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 200 of 288 
 
be sworn in again. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, please administer the oath or 
affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:   Please state your full names for the record. 
MR MOLEFE:   Brian Molefe. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed affirmation? 
MR MOLEFE:   I have no objection. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you affirm that the evidence you will 
give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the 
10 
truth, if so please raise your right hand and say I truly 
affirm. 
MR MOLEFE:   I truly affirm. 
BRIAN MOLEFE:   [Affirmed] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  Okay you may proceed Mr 
Myburgh.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  Chairperson there is 
something I need to place on the record before I do so, if I 
may.   You would – you may recall that when I was leading 
Mr Molefe I questioned him about the session of the T-
20 
System Computer contract to Zestinor and I ultimately took 
him to the Zestinor session which he had signed and there 
were some questions that I asked him.   In the context of 
doing that I read to him paragraph 5.12.3 of Mr Mohamedi’s 
affidavit and that paragraph ends with the sentence that 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 201 of 288 
 
says both Zestinor and Innovent are partly owned by Salim 
Essa, a well known associate of the Guptas and a majority 
shareholder of Trillian Capital Partners.   It was in that 
context that Innovent was also then roped into things. 
 
This caused Innovent’s attorneys on the 12 t h of 
March, K A Mabani Cooper to write a letter to the 
Secretariat when they took exception to that, they said that 
hadn’t been proven in evidence, they said in fact Mr 
Marway had made a similar allegation and they were 
served with a Rule 33 notice and they put in an affidavit.   I 
10 
understand that they were aggrieved by that, they made 
reference to the fact that it was defamatory and might 
cause business complications. 
 
In response to that on the 24 t h of March I caused 
the Secretariat to write this letter, which I would like to 
read into the record if I may. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It is addressed to Mr A Cooper of K 
A Mabani Attorneys, it is headed Innovent Retail and Asset 
Management Solutions Innovent. 
20 
“1. 
Further 
to 
your 
letter 
dated 
12 t h 
[but 
received on 15 March 2021] members of the 
Commission’s 
investigation 
team 
have 
determined that Innovent was not partly 
owned by Mr Salim Essa. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 202 of 288 
 
2. 
As is duty bound to do Advocate Myburgh SC 
will formally place this on record when Mr 
Molefe is recalled as a witness before the 
Commission [on a date in the near future 
that you will be advised on]. 
3. 
We trust that this will resolve the issues 
raised in your letter under reply.  Should you 
however 
require 
anything 
further 
please 
contact Mr Myburgh or Advocate Myburgh 
directly. 
10 
We trust that you will find this in order. 
Yours faithfully  
The Secretary” 
We then  also caused an email to be sent to Mr Cooper, I 
understand that he acknowledged receipt earlier today 
advising him that this statement would be made on record 
what we then thought was four o’clock but no doubt he 
would understand why it is later. 
 
Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay not that is fine. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Molefe ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   If I may Chairperson on this matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MR MOLEFE:  I think this underscores the problem that we 
had where I was expected to answer questions on things 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 203 of 288 
 
that I was not involved in or on conversations that took 
place with people that happened in my absence and I 
remember that the Commission did not seem happy that I 
was reluctant to drag myself into conversations and issues 
that I did not know anything about.   If I had I may have 
been party, cited as a party to this damages claim that they 
are now claiming and so Chair I wish to request that in 
instances where I do not have any information, do not 
know or a meeting took place in my absence that really I 
would be assisted by the Commission to desist from even 
10 
offering an opinion because it may be used later on, if I am 
wrong on things that I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I understand what you are saying 
Mr Molefe and I think it is consistent with some of the 
remarks you made previously when you were asked or a 
comment if you had any on things that may have been said 
by people discussing issues and maybe mentioning your 
name when you were not there.  I think I did say last time 
but I think it may well be that if one understands what you 
are saying in a certain way one might take a different 
20 
approach, I think I said to you last time some of the things 
that were being mentioned to you to give you a chance to 
comment on, are things that may well have an impact or an 
effect on the evidence given by other people but that effect 
might well because they have been talking about your 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 204 of 288 
 
name, maybe it might mention your name and there may 
have been a few to say if you were not told and given a 
chance to comment on those things, even though you might 
not have been in such a meeting or in such a discussion 
you might complain to say but why is this evidence being 
taken into account maybe to make certain findings which 
mention my name in circumstances where I was not given a 
chance to say something, so it might be out of caution you 
know, but it may well be that your statement amounts to 
say look if you know that I was not there I was not party to 
10 
that discussion I am not going to complain if you make 
whatever you make out of that discussion which involved 
my name without me being there, but you understand 
people are talking about you, you are not there, but 
whatever their evidence is might well have to be taken into 
account, so there might have been caution to say we don’t 
want anybody to say afterwards at least you should have 
told me that certain people were saying the following about 
me, maybe I could answer and say that one was falsely 
saying A, B, C, D about me because we have had issues in 
20 
the past or something like that, I am now making an 
example. 
 
So it is not out of trying to put you in a difficult 
position but as I say it may well be that what you are 
saying amounts to saying as long as I was not there I am 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 205 of 288 
 
not going to comment, so whatever you ask just take into 
account that I don’t wish to comment on things that people 
may have discussed about my name when I was not there 
and then that can be taken into account. 
MR MOLEFE:   I understand Chair but you know the 
problem really is instances where people who are talking 
do not have firsthand information and were not involved in 
the issues at all, so it is somebody repeating what 
somebody else said for the third time and I am supposed to 
comment on that Chair. 
10 
 
I think, I don’t know if in the Commission that is 
good quality evidence, but when two people who do not 
have first hand information are talking at a dinner between 
themselves about what they heard somebody else say is 
very difficult for me to comment Chair because it may have 
been twisted in the process or it may not be true and I do 
not know where they heard it from and they don’t say 
where they  heard it from, so I just ask Chairperson that 
the evidence of people who heard from other people who 
were talking in a corridor somewhere about something that 
20 
they had heard and they do not have first hand information 
that it should really Chairperson it should not have a lot of 
weight when you finally make your decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, ja, no, no that is fine. 
ADV MASUKU SC:  Chairperson may I just add something 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 206 of 288 
 
to the discussion? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MASUKU SC:   It relates to when the Commission 
sends documents to us for Mr Molefe to consider I think it 
is very important that that is also, it is a complaint that I 
have made in almost all my appearances for Mr Molefe that 
we get new documents or at least we get new documents a 
day 
before 
his 
hearing, 
because 
it 
does 
give 
an 
uncomfortable impression that the late giving of these 
documents is intended to ...[indistinct] or to ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   To ambush him. 
ADV MASUKU SC:  Ambush him ja, and so what he is 
mentioning now is very important for the Commission to 
consider, just being fair to the witness ...[indistinct] the 
information that ...[indistinct] I am just adding to what kind 
of debate it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, that is fine if there is any issue 
or – about which you received documents late Mr Molefe 
and you don’t think you have had enough time to consider 
it just say so and you will be given a chance to deal with it 
20 
when you have had a chance, if you receive them late 
obviously the legal team will respond to say whether this is 
something that was received late or this was just a 
resending of a document that had been sent much earlier 
or whatever, but the idea is certainly not that anybody 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 207 of 288 
 
should receive documents late so that when they are 
questioned they have not had enough  time to prepare, that 
is not the approach, so but I know Mr Masuku is not saying 
that is the case but he says no it could give rise to that 
impression.    
MR MOLEFE:  And Chairperson it is not necessarily new 
documents, but when it gets sent the thick pile of 
documents that had been sent last year September the 
night before you come to the Commission I mean those 
issues you – I consider them because when I was given the 
10 
notice to come here there were already frictions on the 
table and now these documents contain other issues and I 
am not sure if they are going to be dealt with, and I do not 
want to waste the Commission’s time by keeping on asking 
to go and consider these documents.   At the same time it 
is unfair for me to not have refreshed my memory by 
reading the documents properly, if the matters are going to 
be dealt with in the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no fair enough, I think as we go 
along, where you feel uncomfortable because you did not 
20 
think those issues were going to be part of today raise that 
and let’s deal with each one on its merits. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Chairperson perhaps I could just 
explain something as well, and I will get the exact date.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 208 of 288 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You would know that the Secretariat, 
the people involved with the documents, have a pipeline, I 
mean every day they are preparing bundles for the hearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And it is very difficult to get a slot 
other than the day before. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But what happened in this case 
when we added documents to the bundle that was done a 
long time ago and one of the investigators will give me the 
10 
date, so in preparation for Mr Molefe’s recall we said we 
are going to add these documents to the bundle and we 
emailed them to him, sometime ago, weeks ago. 
 
It is true then that yesterday or maybe even during 
the course of the day the actual bundle itself was added to, 
in other words with this pagination, but the documents 
themselves had been sent some time ago and we are 
constrained to do it that way, so when you are told the 
documents were only received yesterday yes that is in the 
form of the bundle as you have it before you, but the actual 
20 
documents that I am going to question Mr Molefe about he 
got some time ago. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no that is fine, I know about the 
challenges in terms of the preparation of bundles, I have 
previously instructed the Secretary to get that issue 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 209 of 288 
 
resolved so that there are no undue delays in the 
preparation of bundles, I am going to find out from him 
what the position is. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No it certainly it is not a criticism 
from our side. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I don’t think it is a problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  As long as the legal teams take the 
trouble of sending the documents before then it is really 
10 
just a matter of pagination, so I mean from our perspective 
we understand entirely that the people in that department 
obviously need to deal with bundles on a day to day basis. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, now I think the problem might be 
associated with the number of people who are assigned the 
duty and I have said that that problem should be resolved, 
so it remains a problem  if we might not be able to deal 
with some issues because documents were received by 
witnesses late, so but let’s see as we go along, in the end 
we want to make sure that there is fairness. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   Just for the record Chair, I mean it is not 
just about preparation and so on, it is also when you get a 
summons to come to the Zondo Commission you have to 
psychologically prepare  yourself and you go through the 
stuff and prepare and you think of all possible questions 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 210 of 288 
 
that can be asked and then at quarter past ten in the 
evening, late at night, you get a call from the lawyer to say 
go and check your emails, there are new documents and 
that just messes you up psychologically. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no I understand that completely.   
The better situation is that there should be a certain 
number of days by when you have got everything you need 
and you know all the issues that will be under discussion 
that would be dealt with so that is the better situation 
which we should strive for and I think which at some stage 
10 
in the past was possible to achieve with many witnesses, 
but there have been some challenges in recent months but 
let us see how we go on, and where you feel that you were 
not – you didn’t think certain issues would be dealt with, or 
you were not ready for them let’s take it from there. 
MR MOLEFE:   Appreciate Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright.   Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, thank you.  Mr Molefe can we 
start with your affidavit. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Chairperson you will have in front of 
you Transnet bundle 5 Exhibit BB22, I understand that 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Before that, before that Mr Myburgh you 
mentioned that after you were done Mr Masuku may or will 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 211 of 288 
 
wish to re-examine, I just want us, all of us to be ont he 
same page more or less what kind of time we think we are 
going to need this evening.   How long do you think you 
will be on your side? 
ADV MYBURGH:   Not more than 45 minutes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not more than 45 minutes.  Mr Masuku 
what is your position, is it that you will need to re-examine 
or you may need depending, and if you may need to you 
have an idea how long you might take? 
ADV MASUKU SC:   Deputy Justice I will listen to the 45 
10 
minutes of this – of Mr Myburgh cross-examining – sorry 
called cross-examination ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, questioning ja. 
ADV MASUKU SC:   ...to the evidence, and then depending 
on what questions he asked I may want to ask Mr Molefe 
one or two questions, so I certainly won’t be long, I won’t 
be asking on the totality of the evidence that he has been 
asked in the Commission but just one or two issues that 
may be necessary to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   To clarify yes, okay no that is fine, that 
20 
is helpful, I just wanted us all to have some idea of how 
long we might need to be.   
 
Okay, Mr Myburgh?  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.    Mr Molefe at page 97 
you will find an affidavit, your Abalosi affidavit. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 212 of 288 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That runs up until page 102, you see 
it is 405.97.  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It runs up to 405.102. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It includes a number of annexures 
that run up until page 405.143. 
MR MOLEFE:   Indeed. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Do you see that? 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Could I ask you please to go back to 
page 405.102 and would you confirm that you deposed to 
this affidavit on the 29 t h of March 20 – presumably that 
should be 2021. 
MR MOLEFE:   I do confirm. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you confirm the truth and 
accuracy of this affidavit? 
MR MOLEFE:   I do confirm. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Chairperson might ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I must just – so we just need to confirm 
that is 2021 not 2020 hey? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes my apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Can I ask you Chairperson to admit 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 213 of 288 
 
into evidence Mr Molefe’s affidavit dated 29 March should 
be 2021 commencing at page 405.97 as Exhibit BB22.6. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The affidavit of Mr Brian Molefe which 
starts at page 405.97 is admitted as an exhibit and will be 
marked as Exhibit BB22.6. 
AFFIDAVIT OF MR BRIAN MOLEFE HANDED UP AS 
EXHIBIT BB22.6 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Molefe what you do and I think 
very usefully in this affidavit is to set out and attach all the 
documents that makes it easy to take you through it. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But what I propose to do is to jump 
straight into page 101 paragraph 9, are you there? 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is page 405.101? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Correct Chairperson. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And this is really what the 
controversy is about and what you were asked to address.  
It says at paragraph 9: 
“On the 4 t h of August I signed a Deed of Settlement 
20 
relating 
to 
the 
dispute 
between 
Transnet 
and 
Abalosi ...” 
That is the order that we have seen. 
“This was to settle all disputes between the parties 
in litigation under case number 10/43494.” 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 214 of 288 
 
You would confirm that, that is the document we dealt with 
last time? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then if I can take you to 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  But Chair just to recap, because if we just 
go to the settlement we may forget exactly what had 
happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   And what had happened was that Abalosi 
10 
had won a tender to provide services, they did provide the 
services.   The information ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am just trying to think whether they 
had won a tender or they had been given a tender. 
MR MOLEFE:   Well I am not sure what had happened, but 
they were employed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja because I seem to think there were 
no competitors but I may be wrong. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, no, no I would not know but the 
contract went to them. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, they were awarded ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   They were awarded work to do at Transnet, 
they did the work, however Transnet disputed that they had 
done the work and they had evidence that when I arrived 
they showed evidence from General Duka that the work had 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 215 of 288 
 
been done.   In the meantime they had been blacklisted 
and they were feeling very aggrieved and as a result of 
that there was a court case, 1/10/43/494 in the Gauteng 
High Court and when I investigated the matter I found that 
their blacklisting had not been proper and that it was 
unfair, that they should not have been blacklisted in the 
first place 
 
The blacklisting was the blacklisting of all of 
Abalosi, its directors, GNA, in their personal capacity and 
any associated companies, that is how the blacklisting 
10 
read.  So all of these people were blacklisted like that.   
So because I was advised that the Group Chief 
Executive has the power to rescind the blacklisting I did so 
because I felt procedurally and as well substantively the 
blacklisting had been unfair and that is what led to what we 
are now getting into which is the settlement. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja, and perhaps you can just keep 
your finger there at 101, the deed of settlement that you 
find and it is something that the Chairperson will be 
familiar with, that is at 137 Mr Molefe. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   Page 137. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, you confirm that?  In the 
South Gauteng High Court, Johannesburg. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, yes, that is the Deed of Settlement. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, and you signed it we see at 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 216 of 288 
 
page 138. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, and ... 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   If I could ask you please to go back 
to page 101, you say at paragraph 11 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
I 
am 
sorry 
Mr 
Myburgh, 
I 
see 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Sorry Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry Mr Molefe, I see the – your 
10 
counsel is not there on the screen but I don’t know if he 
hears us.  Mr Masuku are you able to hear us, you are not 
appearing on the screen? 
ADV MASUKU SC:   Yes, no I am following. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you are following, okay.   No that is 
alright, okay, you may continue.  
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, I think it is important to note that in that 
deed of settlement it says that Transnet and Abalosi have 
agreed to settle all disputes between them in this litigation 
on the following date, in this litigation, referring to that 
20 
case number. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, absolutely and you said that at 
paragraph 9 in your affidavit at page 101. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Which we have gone through.  
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 217 of 288 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright then at paragraph 11 you say: 
“No 
payment 
was 
made 
under 
the 
Deed 
of 
Settlement of 4 August.” 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then at paragraph 12 which 
seems to be a plea paragraph: 
“On 16 October 2014 Abalosi indicated that they 
would issue a Bill of Costs and proceed with the 
review application.”   
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    
“They also indicated that the settlement agreement 
on 4 August excluded the following ...” 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    
“1. 
Loss 
of 
revenue 
from 
Transnet 
of 
R250million; 
loss 
of 
revenue 
from 
SASS 
R387million; 
loss 
of 
revenue 
from 
GFleet 
of 
R82million and pain and suffering arising from 
20 
defamation of R700million.” 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Now what you ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   That comes to about one point – I think 
about R1.4billion. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 218 of 288 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Yes, and what you referring to there 
is the letter from Abalosi at page 139, is that correct? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, that is correct, which outlined their 
next course of action which is to institute these actions 
yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes, and then what you say at page 
102, at paragraph 13, these additional claims were in the 
amount of R1.4billion.  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   They proposed a settlement of 
10 
R40million which they considered to be fair restitution and 
compensation including legal fees incurred in all matters 
with Transnet. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then you say on the 16 t h of January 
2016 I agreed without admission of liability to offer Abalosi 
Risk 
Advisory 
Services 
R20million 
in 
full 
and 
final 
settlement of all claims. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Costs against Transnet, this was 
20 
accepted by Abalosi on the 22 n d of January 2015. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    
“I 
am 
of 
the 
opinion 
that 
the 
settlement 
of 
R20million 
was 
reasonable 
under 
the 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 219 of 288 
 
circumstances. 
 
I 
deny 
any 
suggestions 
of 
impropriety on my part.” 
MR MOLEFE:   Indeed. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And as I understand the nub of your 
case here is you say look these people were threatening to 
sue us for another four billion and I considered that a 
settlement of 20 million was reasonable.   
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  
MR MOLEFE:  Especially that I was convinced that it was 
10 
Transnet that was at fault.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So what I just wanted to point out to 
you, if you go to paragraph 12 is as you know Abalosi’s 
claim, they brought a counter claim and they sued for a 
loss of revenue in respect of a whole lot of contracts.  As I 
understand it they are now listing other contracts which 
were not part of their counter claim, is that correct? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now Mr Todd’s evidence was that all 
of those claims would have prescribed.   
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Well, I am not aware of that.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then you said ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I assume you know what prescribed 
means? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes, yes they had been overdue for over 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 220 of 288 
 
three years.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  The impression that I have ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words could not be enforced in a 
court of law anymore.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  Chair, the impression that I had is that 
the loss of revenue and all of these claims had actually 
occurred between the period where they were blacklisted 
the time that we were settling.  That is the impression that 
I had.  
10 
 
I may have been wrong, but that is the impression 
that I had.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But did you not consider it necessary to 
first to say let us settle the claim that is in court, which 
has been filed in court that we know about, settle that.  If 
they have other claims, let them make their claims.  Let us 
instruct attorneys, lawyers, to look into these claims and 
collect whatever evidence from us and give us advice.  
 
Legal advice what to do. 
MR MOLEFE:  You will remember Chair, that even when I 
20 
made that [indistinct] it was on advice from the legal 
department that it was reasonable.  
CHAIRPERSON:  From the internal legal department? 
MR MOLEFE:  From internal legal department, yes.  That it 
was a reasonable offer to make.  So I would presume that 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 221 of 288 
 
the legal department would have looked at issues of 
prescription and so on which are quite technical.  From 
where I was sitting, it was a business decision that said 
rather than be involved in litigation and defending litigation 
of 1.4 billion, when you know that we did not act our action 
on this matter or our handling of the matter was not 
professional, why would you want to go and defend 1.4 
billion rand claims rather than settle? 
 
When, I mean Chair there was no point in fighting 
for the sake of fighting.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  Just because I am a fighter ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  I can take them on, so bring it on.  It is a 
destructive attitude.  We know.  Why waste the court’s 
time, go to court and waste the court’s time, when you 
know that the evidence of their work had been hidden. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes, ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  But Chair, also it would be useful perhaps 
20 
for the commission to find out why was that evidence 
hidden in the first place that led us to where we are, that 
led us to this discussion.  Why was the evidence hidden in 
the first place, and I think the answer to that question is 
very, very clear.  
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 222 of 288 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you previously tell us who to your 
knowledge was responsible for hiding it? 
MR MOLEFE:  It was the TRF and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  TFR? 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja, Transnet Freight Rail and somebody at 
TFR contacted our head of security, who is general Duka 
who I had asked to investigate the matter.  He contacted 
him [indistinct] if you like and said there is evidence that 
those people did their work and I can provide it to you any 
day and we have got the evidence.  
10 
 
I even presented it to the risk committee.   
CHAIRPERSON:  My Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes, thank you.  I just wanted to, I 
mean you know that one of Abalosi’s claims was a 
defamation.  If you have a look at page 405.134. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  It says there at paragraph 30.5, it 
talks about articles that were published in the Mail & 
Guardian.  30.5: 
 
“As a result of the said defamation, the 
20 
plaintiff has been damaged in his reputation of 
good will and character in the amount of 600 
million rand.” 
 
Do you see that? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 223 of 288 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And do you see also that in relation 
to the blacklisting, if you have a look at paragraph 31.4, at 
page 135, it says: 
 
“As a result of the defendant’s mala fide 
conduct, all the state departments and or 
entities 
which 
were 
intending 
to 
conduct 
business 
with 
the 
plaintiff, 
seized 
from 
considering the plaintiff, and then it claimed 
300 million.” 
 
Do you see that? 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  Now you talk about 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  But Mr Myburgh, the defamation in their 
counter claim ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes.  
MR MOLEFE:  Related to that particular case.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes.  
MR MOLEFE:  The defamation later on ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes.  
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Was something else in my understanding.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So when you say, if we go back to 
paragraph 12, they were, they said they are going to 
proceed with the review application.  In relation to what? 
MR MOLEFE:  Chair, that is what was in their letter.  That 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 224 of 288 
 
is what they said ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes, but what review application Mr 
Molefe? 
MR MOLEFE:  The review of the Transnet’s conduct, I do 
not know what review it was.  My interest in the matter was 
to settle the 1.4 billion rand.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So your evidence is you settled for 
20 million in circumstances where you did not even know 
what review they were going to ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  No, on circumstances where the legal 
10 
department of Transnet had considered the issue at hand. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  The legal department of who? 
MR MOLEFE:  The legal department of Transnet, because 
they advised the settlement.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  We can find no trace of that Mr 
Molefe.  
MR MOLEFE:  Come again? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  We can find no trace of that.  
MR MOLEFE:  It does not mean it does not exist.  I asked 
for it as well.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it a written legal opinion? 
MR MOLEFE:  No, it was you see Chairperson, this letter 
that I wrote would normally have been accompanied by a 
memo from the legal department, recommending to settle.  
As you have seen in these documents, even at Eskom, my 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 225 of 288 
 
style is never to take a decision alone.  
 
So I would never sit alone and decide that I am 
going to pay so and so 20 million.  It has to come from the 
operations and they have to say well, we recommend that 
you do this.  There is hardly anything that I did without a 
recommendation.  
 
So it is unlikely that this settlement letter was 
written by me without a recommendation.  I am quite 
adamant that there must have been recommendations.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I assume that if somebody in the legal 
10 
department prepared a memo that was going to be sent to 
you or given to you, it would be a senior member of the 
legal department.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes, usually ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  An advocate or somebody ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  The head of legal, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  The head of legal.  
MR MOLEFE:  Just like this other, the 20 sorry, the 
settlement is accompanied by a recommendation.  Even the 
payment is accompanied by a recommendation.  Everything 
20 
is done on recommendation.  There is, I cannot think of 
something maybe that I decided on my own and decided to 
do.  
 
What I discovered yesterday Chairperson, just out 
of interest, is that I was in the commission, being accused 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 226 of 288 
 
that I unilaterally decided to cancel Glenco’s contract.  
What 
I 
discovered 
yesterday 
is 
in 
fact 
that 
was 
recommended by Clive, CDH.   
 
Clive Dekker Hofmeyer and for the first time in the 
last two days I found that document where they actually 
say you must settle and where they actually show how the 
two billion rand is calculated, and in fact Chairperson that 
is in the commission’s document, but we spent half a day 
where I was being accused here of having unilaterally 
decided to cancel.  
10 
 
Where there was a clear recommendation from 
CDH, from the lawyers.  I hardly ever do things without 
recommendation in my role as chief executive.  That is my 
style Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, well just talking on the last point 
about the document you found, are you going to send it 
through particularly to the Eskom team?   
MR MOLEFE:  Chairperson, it is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  The secretary, how ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  Paragraph, I think 45 of CBH affidavit 
20 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR MOLEFE:  To the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR MOLEFE:  They confirmed that they made that 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 227 of 288 
 
recommendation.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR MOLEFE:  I think it is 45 to 63. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 If we look at their affidavit to the 
commission itself.  So I mean I can go onto the internet 
and download it and send it again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no, no that is fine.  I just want to, I 
know there is a lot of documentation.  As you know there 
are bundles and bundles.  So ...[intervenes]  
10 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja, sometimes I get nightmares just thinking 
how you are going to write the report from all this 
information coming from all angles.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no it is a lot of documentation.  The 
last time a few weeks ago when I wanted to find out about 
how 
many 
thousands 
of 
pages 
the 
transcript 
is 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I was told of 52000. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, but please do that or ask your 
lawyers to send and say this is what our client has recently 
discovered or send it yourself.  That would be fine, just so 
that it is the legal team is, under Eskom is alerted.  
MR MOLEFE:  I have it on my phone.  We will do it before 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 228 of 288 
 
we leave.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, no that is fine.  Okay.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr Molefe, what I was getting as is 
you see there is three loss of revenue claims.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well, in their counter claim Abalosi 
brought three loss of revenue claims as well.  Large 
figures.  50 million, 40 million, etcetera. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And those were settled for nothing, 
10 
only for costs.  
MR MOLEFE:  No, the amounts are not the same and 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Sorry? 
MR MOLEFE:  The amounts are not the same.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well, yes but sorry, bear with me 
then if you would go to it.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  The amounts may be higher, but if 
you have a look ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes, the amounts ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Just bear with me.  At page 129 that 
deal 
with 
the 
claim, 
the 
Mpumalanga 
provincial 
government, at 130 at paragraph 28.19 the amount claimed 
was 45 million.  Then they at 130 deal with the Department 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 229 of 288 
 
of Public Transport, G Fleet.  The amount claimed at 28.25 
is 40 million. 
 
Then a smaller amount, the Department of Public 
Transport.  The amount claimed was 8.3 million.  So in 
respect, I am just putting this proposition to you.  In 
respect of those claims, they were compromised simply for 
the payment of costs.  Why now would you feel that it was 
necessary to settle these claims for 20 million? 
MR MOLEFE:  I appreciate Mr Myburgh, you are going into 
the detail but the fact of the matter is that there had been 
10 
a legal claim and Abalosi had made a counter claim and we 
had settled in terms of that legal case.  I am not sure, and 
you might know better.  
 
If there was anything in law that precluded them to 
pursue other claims that were falling outside of that case, 
and I think this is what they were intending to do and I am 
convinced that they were serious.  So I do not know, if we 
start comparing the counter claims and the new claims that 
they would make, we never went there.  
 
We settled before they even opened the amount to, 
20 
before they even issued summons or whatever, because 
they went up to 1.4 billion and I felt that the 20 million was 
a reasonable settlement.  So there is nothing that, even 
the ones that are listed here, if they found that there were 
other things that they wanted to add on, they could amend 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 230 of 288 
 
their particulars any time.  I believe that that is, that can 
be done and that is usually done.  
 
So Chair, ja we did not want to go there.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr Molefe, was this not a wildly 
inflated claim?  I mean pain and suffering arising from 
defamation of 700 million? 
MR MOLEFE:  I do not believe that it was wildly inflated.  
They had been blacklisted, their business had been 
literally almost ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And had it been compromised for 
10 
costs?  That case was put in their counter claim.  
MR MOLEFE:  No, no, no that was, that case, these are 
other cases.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  
MR MOLEFE:  That they were bringing up.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So as I understand it, it really was 
not a matter of you getting legal advice.  It seems that you 
said well, they are suing us for 1.4 million, 20 million ... 
1.4 billion.  20 million is a bargain.  
MR MOLEFE:  Are you patronising ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV MASUKU SC:  [00:15:21] Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV MASUKU SC:  Sorry to interfere with Mr Myburgh’s 
cross-examination.  I think it is not fair what he is now 
doing.  Mr Molefe has given him a full answer on why they 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 231 of 288 
 
settled the claim.  He said to him that it was a business 
case.  He said that he felt that or given the, there were two 
things.  
 
The legal opinion that we heard, the legal opinion 
advice from the internal lawyers and the fact that there 
was a business reason for him to settle that.  I do not 
understand the role of Mr Myburgh to be to cross-examine 
Mr Molefe on the ... on what he has clearly stated.   
 
If Mr Myburgh feels that he is not telling the truth, 
he must tell him the basis on which he forms that view, but 
10 
this is now cross-examination based on something, that 
somehow a settlement of this nature would have been 
either corrupt or not justified, but the reasons had been 
given already by Mr Molefe.  
 
I think we should move on and get to the other 
elements or questions to ask, because this answer has 
been given.  It is given in full.  I do not understand why Mr 
Myburgh wants to cross-examine Mr Molefe on that aspect.  
Because I do not see where he is taking us to.  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
My 
Myburgh, 
you 
might 
wish 
to 
20 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Chairperson, I really simply want to 
enquire.  Was this a business case or was it based on legal 
advice?   
ADV MASUKU SC:  It was bought, that is what he says.  
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 232 of 288 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes, and if it was both, then if that 
could just be clarified.  That is all I am seeking to achieve.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Mr Molefe? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes sir.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, was ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  Chair, I am giving evidence about the facts 
as they happened, and I have stated the facts are that they 
came up with potential claims of 1.4 billion and I believe 
on advice from the legal department, the advice was that 
settle, and they had proposed to settle at 40 million, and 
10 
we settled at 20 million. 
 
Those are the facts.  If Mr Myburgh does not like 
them, I am sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, let me ask this question.  do you 
remember whether the legal opinion dealt with the question 
of whether the claims that had been put up by Abalosi, 
amounted to one comma something billion, were inflated 
because if the claims were for one point whatever billion, 
and they themselves, that is the legal department, were 
suggesting that a reasonable settlement would be 40 
20 
million, that suggest to me that they must have thought 
that these claims were inflated way above what they could 
get in court.   
MR MOLEFE:  Well Chair, it was not a legal opinion as 
such, in a sense that one would get a legal opinion 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 233 of 288 
 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  It was not a written opinion you mean? 
MR MOLEFE:  No, it was not a written, it was a 
memorandum such as one of these.  
CHAIRPERSON:  A memorandum? 
MR MOLEFE:  To the group chief executive that says this 
is the situation that we are in, and our recommendation is 
that we should settle at 20 million, and I would imagine 
that in making such a recommendation, they would have 
considered these legal issues that you are now raising with 
10 
me.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR MOLEFE:  So it was not a legal opinion, it was a 
memorandum from the legal department and as I say, the 
fact that I mean I asked if we can try and look for it, but we 
cannot find it.  The fact that it does not exist, I know that 
such a memorandum would have preceded my making an 
offer such as that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see, I would expect that if as group 
chief executive officer, you are faced with a situation 
20 
whether to settle a claim for one comma something billion 
rand, or not and if you must settle it, what amount you 
must offer.  
 
Your legal department says make an offer at 40 
million rand.  I would expect that one of the things that 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 234 of 288 
 
would raise questions with you, is when these people have 
trained 1.4 billion, how do you arrive at 40 million rand and 
say that is reasonable?   
 
What if even the 40 is not based on anything?  So 
in other words I am trying to see whether your own legal 
department conveyed to you something that make you feel 
comfortable or whether they just said settle at 40 without 
really putting before you reasons that would make your 
think 40 is realistic, it is not a thumb suck? 
MR MOLEFE:  Chair, I mean 40 is what they made, their 
10 
offer.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR MOLEFE:  So you would have to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  You mean Abalosi? 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja, they said ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Your legal department, what did it offer? 
MR MOLEFE:  20. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, it said 20? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, I am sorry.  I missed that.  
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I thought your legal department 
said 40, offer 40 and you offered 20. 
MR MOLEFE:  No, Abalosi said 40.  It is in the affidavit.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay, alright.  
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 235 of 288 
 
MR MOLEFE:  So I do not know why they jumped from 1.4 
billion to 40.  You would have to ask them that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But it is suspicious, you would agree? 
MR MOLEFE:  No, I am not suspicious because it is not as 
linear as you paint it Chair.  Abalosi may have thought you 
know, the sooner we get rid of this matter because it was 
even in the press, it releases us to go and do other 
business.  Perhaps if they came here, that is what they will 
tell you.  
 
It releases us and it removes the blacklisting and it 
10 
unchains our hands.  I am not saying that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  If somebody comes and says you owe me 
one comma something billion rand and then after a few 
weeks they say if you give us 40 million rand we will 
accept it, surely that must be suspicious? 
MR MOLEFE:  No, it does not sound illegal Chair.  It is 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  You would not think it is suspicious? 
MR MOLEFE:  There would be, no.  There would be perfect 
business reasons.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  That I may not be in the position to advance 
now but perhaps they could advise.  Perhaps they have 
reasons why they would, why they would waive at 1.4 
billion.  Perhaps they think, they do not want to be seen as 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 236 of 288 
 
having being paid maybe a settlement of seven or 800 
million by Transnet because that would not be good for the 
image of their company.  
 
I do not know, but maybe if you ask them they will 
tell you, but I can imagine from a business point of view, 
that decisions like that are possible.  Maybe not from a 
legal point of view, but from a business point of view Chair 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no I must just tell you ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  Business is not linear Chair.  One plus one 
10 
is not always two.  
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I understand that in some 
situations, people whether in business or not in business, 
when they settle matters, sometimes you do not know their 
own considerations, you know.  What motivates them so 
settle and they will not tell the other side, because it is 
their own matters, you know.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But for me, if the gap between what they 
claimed and what they are prepared to settle for, is too big 
20 
I would think that it is suspicious that it had been inflated, 
and that is why I would ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  So Chair, if you were in my position you 
would have said this gap is too big, that is fine.  Then you 
have a 1.4 billion rand claim and then eventually let us say 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 237 of 288 
 
you settle at 200 million ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  SO what will happen in that instance is that 
there will be a commission like this, where it will be said 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  No, there will not be a commission. 
MR MOLEFE:  Where I will be asked but you were offered 
40 million and you decided to fight and settled at three or 
four hundred, or 500 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, it depends what you do after you do 
10 
not accept.  
MR MOLEFE:  And then when they ask me why I fight, I will 
say because I was suspicious.  
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no hang on.  Well, you are 
entitled to be suspicious when you have got reasonable 
grounds to be.  You might reject it or you might not reject it 
and delay going back to them and do a certain amount of 
homework before you then say we reject it or we make a 
counter offer.   
 
So all I am simply saying is that you cannot say to 
20 
demand that I pay you 100 million rand.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You say I am legally obliged to pay you 
100 million rand today.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 238 of 288 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you come in a month’s time or 
whatever time and say I will accept R1 000-00 and then I 
do not become suspicious.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So I say when the gap is too big for me it 
should raise suspicions, but that is my thinking.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, Mr Myburgh?   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes, thank you.  I am going to move 
to a different topic if I may.  Could I ask you please to turn 
10 
to page 147?  You were given a 33 notice in respect of Ms 
Gigaba’s affidavit.   
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I just want to take you to certain 
paragraphs which I will refer to you and just ask you for 
your comment if you have any Mr Molefe.  At page 148 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Paragraph 31.1 and all of these 
things are things which were versed before: 
20 
 
“After one of the new age breakfast sessions, 
Mr Gigaba told me that Mr Brian Molefe was 
going to be moved from Transnet to Eskom 
Holdings.  I was told this before Mr Molefe was 
officially appointed.” 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 239 of 288 
 
 
You want to say anything about that? 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja Chair, it takes us to the discussion that 
we had.  
CHAIRPERSON:  To the issue that you raised?   
MR MOLEFE:  Yes, that I raised.  Mr Gigaba and Ms 
Gigaba were talking there.  I do not know what prompted 
the discussion, I do not know what was the context.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR MOLEFE:   In fact one of the things that I noticed is 
what does Mr Gigaba say about his wife saying this?  I 
10 
mean does he confirm that the discussion did take place?  
Did the investigators go and ask Mr Gigaba?  Is this true 
what your wife is saying about you, and what was the 
answer.  
 
So I am not in a position to comment on what 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR MOLEFE:  Mr Gigaba was saying to Ms Gigaba. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then at paragraph 46 at page 
20 
150, paragraph 46 deals with you see from the heading 
above it, Mr Gigaba’s transfer from the Department of 
Home Affairs to the Department of Finance.  This is when 
he was appointed as the Minister of Finance.   
 
Ms Gigaba says at paragraph 46: 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 240 of 288 
 
 
“This change in Mr Gigaba’s portfolio appeared 
to upset him very much.  He informed me that 
the former president told him that he initially 
wanted to appoint Mr Molefe as the Minister of 
Finance, but finally decided to appoint him (Mr 
Gigaba) 
at 
the 
request 
of 
other 
MEC 
members.” 
 
Any comment on that? 
MR MOLEFE:  No Chair, I am not in the position to 
comment.  
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then the last paragraph which I 
want to take you to and I do not think that this is 
contentious.  At paragraph 50, at page 151 Ms Gigaba says 
that: 
 
“Mr Gigaba and I married on 30 August 2014.  
I did most of our wedding planning.  We both 
invited the former president and the Guptas, 
but none of them attended.  Mr Molefe was 
invited and he did attend.” 
 
You confirm that? 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  If I may ask, what relevance is this to the 
commission that I went to Mr Gigaba’s wedding? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I am just simply putting to you that 
she says you did.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not wish to comment?   
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 241 of 288 
 
MR MOLEFE:  No, I did attend the wedding but I have no 
further comment.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Then the next document that I want 
to take you to very briefly, please is the document at page 
155.  Now this is a recommendation from Mr Mkwanazi, the 
then Chairperson of Transnet to Mr Gigaba, on the 
appointment of the new chief executive.  
 
Are you there at 155? 
MR MOLEFE:  Page? 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  155, it is right towards the end.  
When I say 155, I beg your pardon Mr Molefe, it is 
405.155.  So it is right, literally right at the end of your 
bundle.  
MR MOLEFE:  Right at the end? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Ja.  
MR MOLEFE:  Oh, 405.155.  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now what I just want to take you to if 
I may, is this.  I do not know if you know anything about 
this, but if you go to page 160, you remember and I think 
20 
we dealt with this, I have mentioned it to you but I want to 
show you the document.  You recall that we spoke about the 
fact that as I recall Mr Sharma nominated you for the 
position of CEO. 
MR MOLEFE: Yes. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 242 of 288 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And he sat on the selection panel. 
MR MOLEFE: Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And what happened then is a decision 
was made that because he might have had a conflict of 
interest because he had nominated you his scoring would be 
removed. 
 
If 
you 
look 
at 
page 
160 
paragraph 
4.5 
Consolidated Summary of Ratings and Rankings of all 
candidates interviewed for GC of Transnet after withdrawal 
of scores of one panellist. 
 
What you will see is if you go to the far right hand 
10 
side you will see overall ranking Mr Gansha ranked first at 
8.1 then you ranked second at 7.9 and Mr Salinga ranked 
third at 6.7 do you see that? 
MR MOLEFE: Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then under the recommendation 
the heading The committee conducted interviews of the 
shortlisted 
candidates 
and 
have 
identified 
three 
recommended candidates who could fill the position.  Mr 
Gansha, yourself and Mr Salinga.   
MR MOLEFE: Yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  While the overall ratings by the panel 
member indicate the highest score for – I see it is Dr Gansha 
followed by Mr Molefe and then Mr Salinga the committee 
believes that all three of these candidates are highly suitable 
for appointment as GCE of Transnet and recommend the 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 243 of 288 
 
appointment of any three of the individuals. 
MR MOLEFE: Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then the recommended candidates 
they put three forward.  I just wanted to point out to you is if 
you go to page 163 you will see that Mr Gigaba in 2010. 
MR MOLEFE: Mr Gigaba? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  2010 at 163 sent to Mr Mkhwanazi 
guidelines for the appointment of Chief Executive Officer and 
those guidelines were attached and you find them at page 
165.  I just want to take you to one paragraph and ask you to 
10 
comment if you want.  At page 166 paragraph 2.4: 
“The board shall through its governance and nominations 
committee submit a minimum of three shortlisted candidates 
and their preferred candidate to the shareholder minister for 
further assessment and interview by the minister.” 
You see that? 
MR MOLEFE: Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I just want you to comment if you – if 
you wish that what you see is that Mr Mkhwanazi did not put 
forward 
a 
preferred 
candidate 
he 
put 
forward 
three 
20 
candidates.  Do you have any comment? 
MR MOLEFE: No I think Mr Mkhwanazi and the board would 
be best with that one. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you.  Then I want to just put to 
you when we were speaking or I was leading you in relation 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 244 of 288 
 
to the driver I think I did mention to you and I think you 
corrected me in relation to the witness number.  I just want 
to – to make the point that I noted the other day that Witness 
number 2 and Witness number 2 was the CPO to Mr Gama.  
Witness number 2 said: 
“On another occasion while waiting for Gama 
in the parking area at his residence Brian 
Molefe arrived with his Audio S8 and went 
into the house.” 
 
Talking about the Gupta Saxonwold house.  Do you 
10 
want to comment on that? 
MR MOLEFE: Chair this is one of those things it was not in 
the agenda for today the indication was that we would… 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Ja sure. 
MR MOLEFE: Discuss three issues and in fact I would have 
like to have refreshed my memory and read it again. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well let me show you – let me show 
you it.  It is in fact something that I think I touched on last  
time but we may have got the numbers of the witnesses 
wrong. If you behind you and someone will help you fish out 
20 
the file it is Exhibit BB14(d).   
MR MOLEFE: Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So he says he saw me arrive… 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Let me show – in fairness let me show 
you. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 245 of 288 
 
MR MOLEFE: He says he show – he saw me arrive. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE: I do not have an Audio S8 – never had an 
Audio S8. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Okay well then you have – that is your 
answer can I perhaps in fairness let me take you Mr Molefe if 
you would like – let me take you please – I am referring to 
the red numbers now. Page 89.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that of the same bundle? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  No this is Bundle. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  A different bundle. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  This is Exhibit BB14(d) Chairperson.  
So at page 89 you find Witness 2’s affidavit – Witness 2 was 
he CPO to Mr Gama alright.  If you scroll through this 
affidavit you will get at page 92 a heading Trips to the Gupta 
residence, you see that? 
MR MOLEFE: Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then Witness 2 is outlining the 
occasions that he says that he took Mr Gama to the 
residence and then at paragraph 14 at page 93  
20 
“On another occasion whilst waiting for Gama 
in the parking area at the residence Brian 
Molefe arrived with his Audio S8 and went 
into the house.  He drove there on his own.  
At the time he had already been seconded to 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 246 of 288 
 
Eskom as CEO.” 
MR MOLEFE: Ja I have no recollection of this but I can also 
say that if this means that Mr Gama was at the – at Gupta 
residence in the same time as I was that never happened. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry just repeat that. 
MR MOLEFE: I have never been – it has never … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I am sorry your mic just switch it on. 
MR MOLEFE: It has never happened . 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR MOLEFE: While I – when I went to the Gupta residence 
that Mr Gama was also present.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
MR MOLEFE:  So I – I have no recollection of what he is 
talking about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE: But I can categorically say that I have never 
been there at the same time that Mr Gama was there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But could it – could it be that – well I 
do not know how the house there looked like except what 
20 
pictures that I have been shown.  Could it be that he could 
be there but in another part of the house and you would not 
know and you would be in another part. 
MR MOLEFE:  I do not know Chair.  Yes.  But if.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Because you – your evidence was that if I 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 247 of 288 
 
recall correctly you did go to the Gupta residence many 
times. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I am – if somebody says on one 
occasion I saw him arrive. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is possible. 
MR MOLEFE:  It is possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  But what I am trying to do is – because I 
10 
know that what you may want to read into this was that I was 
there on a common purpose with Mr Gama. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  So we were not – I was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I do not think that – I do not think 
that – well he certainly does not seem to  
MR MOLEFE:  To suggest that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To suggest that you were there together 
you arrived. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  On your own he and Mr Gama arrived – I 
do not know whether Mr Myburgh reads it differently. 
MR MOLEFE:  The thing is that in this era of joining 
thoughts any thoughts can be joined.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Myburgh. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 248 of 288 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes I just wanted to echo your 
comment Chairperson I do not think the suggestion by 
Witness 2 is that there is any sort of common purpose. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I think he is saying look in passing he 
saw you there.  But you have addressed that.  Mr Molefe the 
last thing I want to deal with is the TNA business breakfasts. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now you were provided on the 26t h of 
March with a copy of what is Exhibit MN4. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You will be given a copy now.  I just 
have a few questions to ask you on this and that is my last 
topic for the evening.   
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I am just waiting for the Chairperson to 
be handed his file.  MN4 thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you got the page number? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  If I can ask you – if you could perhaps 
go to page 1. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes page? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Page 1 it is a statement of Daniel 
Phahlane. 
MR MOLEFE:  It is not a – it is not an affidavit? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I think you correct yes. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 249 of 288 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  It appears to be a statement on the face of 
it.  
MR MOLEFE:  So this is not a sworn affidavit? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  No. 
MR MOLEFE:  And it – did he give evidence.. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr Phahlane gave evidence yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  He did give evidence.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So these are things that are – the 
commission is familiar with. I just wanted to … 
MR MOLEFE:  He gave evidence under oath? 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  As I understand it yes.  Yes he did.  I 
assume it was under oath or (inaudible) when you say he did 
give evidence I assume it must be under oath.  But Mr 
Molefe there has been not a lot of controversial things that I 
want to deal with.  Can I just ask you if you have a look at 
page 2 what Mr Phahlane does is he sets out just above that 
– above 3.1 last two sentences. 
“Transnet had ten ad-hoc TNA breakfasts and 
five contracts with TNA breakfasts from 2011 
to 2017 which translated to almost 100  TNA 
20 
breakfasts.” 
And then at 3.1 he lists the ad-hoc breakfasts from 11 to 14 
there are ten of them the cost of that was about R12.5 
million so the breakfasts costs about R1.2 million each. And 
then over the page he deals with the five contracts that were 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 250 of 288 
 
then concluded.  And that was 12/13 through to 16/17 and 
the number of breakfasts there if you add up to 16, 15, 20, 
20 and 20 comes to 91 and the cost of that was R99.3 
million.  So there the breakfasts were costing about R1.1 
million per breakfast. 
 
Then at paragraph 4 he lists the sorts of people that 
would attend the breakfasts and there is familiar names Mr 
Gigaba, President Zuma and then it ranged if you look at… 
MR MOLEFE:  And Mr Motsoledi, Mr Mashidele. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  Mr Jeff Radebe, Minister Dipuo Peters, Nama 
lewa, Gwede Mantashe, Rob Davies,  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  It then ranges what caught my eye. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  That perhaps is a little bit… 
MR MOLEFE:  No I was just thinking that the examples that 
you were giving were just convenient. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  No, no not at all In fact I wanted to 
refer to Graham Smith who caught my eye.  You will see his 
name at page 4 in the middle. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Graham Smith yes he is a 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Cricketer. 
MR MOLEFE:  Cricketer yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Ja. So it is a wide range of people. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 251 of 288 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I am not trying to make anything of any 
particular.  So I merely wanted to just ask you really two 
questions.  One relates to you have believed that Transnet 
got value for money from these very expensive business 
breakfasts and then I am going to ask you one or two 
questions about delegations of authority. 
 
But deal with if you could comment on whether you 
believed this was really value for money that you paid out 
from 2011 to 2016/2017 well in excess of R100 million for 
these breakfasts? 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja Chair I mean you would have to exclude 
2016 and 17 because I was not there and that is about R50 
million.  But to – to come to a determination of whether this 
was good value for money or not one would have to make a 
comparative 00:13:52 if we had been spending this money 
elsewhere engaged in similar activities how much would we 
have spent?  And to do that one would have to look at the 
Transnet advertising budget 00:14:09 in preparation for the 
commission I tried to look at what the budget was and I 
suggest that the commission goes and does that what the 
20 
budget was for advertising with the regular media houses.  
So the Transnet budget for advertising and for what it was. 
So in one of my affidavits for example I – I show that adverts 
– some of the adverts that I was against Transnet 00:14:47 
were actually television commercials where a train would 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 252 of 288 
 
come and knock a taxi and the commercial would last just a 
minute or maybe two minutes – three minutes and to say how 
much for that exposure we got – I mean how much – how 
much we paid for that kind of exposure.  Unfortunately 
because I have left Transnet I do not have access currently 
but it would be interesting to see how much we paid for 
those kinds of advertisements but also for a one page spread 
advert that says that railway crossings are dangerous and so 
we spend a whole full page on a newspaper saying that 
railway crossings are dangerous and we spend a lot of 
10 
money.  In comparison this was a breakfast show that was on 
television and each one of them lasted more than an hour 
with the exposure of Transnet logo in a similar way that you 
do with the state capture commission behind you. 
 
And I know you are going to say you do not pay for it 
but I will come to that.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you probably have heard what I have 
said to certain witnesses about – about the breakfast shows 
and the adverts but I do not want to .. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Impact you . 
MR MOLEFE:  This was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  In short you are saying ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  This was exposure of over one hour and it 
gave a key newsmakers an opportunity to talk at the 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 253 of 288 
 
breakfast show for over an hour about what they were doing 
and whatever else they wanted to talk about.   
 
Something that the media did not voluntarily bring out 
for example the successes that we have had in this country 
as the government in delivering services Chair.  I mean there 
is controversy now about water and electricity and so on and 
so forth but in Limpopo where I have worked 30 – 40 years 
ago Chair the water situation was very bad.  People did not 
have water within walking distance – now they do.  I mean it 
is not the best but now they do and nobody talks about that 
10 
and this is what these people would bring out and make 
people aware that the situation is not as hopeless as it is –
yes that is what I wanted to say.  That the situation is not as 
hopeless as it is made out to be by the media 
 
The thing with the media Chair is that they control 
the predominant ideas in society and they are very negative 
and they continue to be very negative and therefore a 
predominant idea – the predominant feeling in South Africa 
is a negative one. 
 
These 
people 
would 
assist 
in 
putting 
into 
the 
20 
mainstream news – into the mainstream news because a lot 
of these breakfast shows after they had been aired a lot of 
the issues would then get into the mainstream news.  So it 
went beyond the one or two hours that we paid for.  It also 
spilled over into the mainstream news which is what we were 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 254 of 288 
 
looking for and for the money that we paid I think that – even 
the other news channels would cover it.  I think Mr Phahlane 
talks about it somewhere in his affidavit that after the 
breakfast shows that some of it would – would come onto 
other news. 
 
Now before Chair you comment because I see you 
are about to comment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am holding myself back. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  Yes before you hold yourself let me tell 
you about an incident you might realise that I like telling 
10 
stories. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh. 
MR MOLEFE:  You might realise that I like telling stories.  
So when I was here my first hearing there was a Covid scare 
and the hearing was suspended for a few days and during 
those days I also was wondering what is happening because 
there was no communication – when are we going back – 
what is going to happen and so? 
 
There was a newspaper article where they showed 
you making an award at some ceremony without a mask, 
20 
without anything.  I could see that this was probably a 
picture from a long time ago you see it was not at that time.  
But this is the kind of thing that I am talking about.  So – and 
I also noticed that the commission never responded.  In the 
minds of people – certain people in South Africa some 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 255 of 288 
 
people are saying even on Twitter and so on I say the 
Chairperson suspended the hearings because of the Covid 
scare and went to a – an award ceremony of a – I cannot 
remember what it was – a primary school or something – ja 
and I remember last time you said ja you got good coverage 
because… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  You went to a primary school and so on but 
now look at how that coverage – how that picture was used 
in the media? 
10 
 
You see Chair if it was this time I would invite you to 
the breakfast show to come and explain what happened.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well – well one I did not see what those 
that information that what they said if it was social media 
because I do not – I am not into social media but if it was 
what you are talking about it is something happened I think 
in 2019.  It was the primary school which I attended as a 
boy. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja.  Okay but … 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  And it was a good thing Chair but it ended up 
being cast in very bad light. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  That in fact here is a Deputy Chief Justice 
Raymond Zondo giving out awards when he is supposed to 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 256 of 288 
 
be in quarantine and I said it was unfair Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I was – I was in quarantine it was an 
old thing. 
MR MOLEFE:  But this incident for me captures the essence 
of the attitude of our media. There is no – there is no 
attempt to raise the standard of research and the show.  
There is a thing in the media they call it show if you say 
something you must be able to show that it is true.   
 
I have heard a lot of things said about me that are 
blatantly not true and I know that there are a lot of things 
10 
that are said even by the government I mean about the 
government even about the President, about that are 
blatantly not true.  People are – and the media does not care 
to show.  And when it is pointed out to them that in fact the 
article was wrong the retraction and the apology usually 
update has been to (inaudible).  I do not know if he is still 
there.  It is very small on page 17. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well that is true well sometimes they 
(speaking over one another). 
MR MOLEFE:  That is – that is unfair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  They refuse even when they know it is not 
true I have had that experience.  But I think Mr Myburgh 
wants to carry on with serious business. 
MR MOLEFE:  No but what I wanted to say Chair because I – 
today I am – is that these people who have been given an

opportunity to put into the mainstream media in to their news 
headline issues that they think are important and to correct 
perceptions that are weighing South Africa down with 
negativity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr Molefe just to take an example.  I 
mean how would what Graham Smith had to say about 
presumed he spoke about cricket how would that benefit 
Transnet as it were? 
MR MOLEFE:  No I cannot remember but Transnet looks like 
10 
an outlier here but I cannot remember the context of what he 
was saying.  I mean we would have to watch the thing and 
maybe get the answer to your question.  I mean if I had 
known that you going to ask that I would have gone to give 
and say this is exactly what he said. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But take any of these people they were 
not speaking about Transnet they were not advancing the 
interest of Transnet? 
MR MOLEFE:  No it… 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  They were presumably and you would 
20 
correct me if I am wrong I mean they would – they would 
have their own agendas they would talk about things that 
were close to their own hearts. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  How did that rub off beneficially on 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 258 of 288 
 
Transnet? 
MR MOLEFE:  But precisely that – that they are raising 
these issues of national concern and on a platform that has 
been provided by Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I must … 
MR MOLEFE:  That is the logic. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I must tell you that – that the evidence that 
I have heard is that sometimes I do not know whether often 
or just sometimes there would not even be anybody from 
Transnet speaking and I asked the question so how would 
10 
Transnet be benefitting then I was told that the mere fact 
that Transnet’s logo would show on television or that it was 
there justified that was quite something justifying … 
MR MOLEFE:  No that is not true Chair it you call any of the 
people including Mr Phahalane who was involved they will 
tell you that before everything started the sponsor usually 
the Chief Executive would then speak about (inaudible). 
CHAIRPERSON:  You speaking too slowly.  I am sure .. 
MR MOLEFE:  And usually those – those 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sure you spoke too softly just repeat. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  So I am saying for every one of them before it 
– the breakfast show started the Group Chief Executive or 
somebody from the company would then speak for about ten 
minutes on the topic of their choice and I can send you some 
of the speeches that I made there about how we pride 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 259 of 288 
 
ourselves in raising the level of dialogue in South Africa 
through these breakfast shows and how it is important that 
certain 
things 
that 
the 
media 
is 
not 
interested 
to 
communicate I have communicated nevertheless and that we 
attempt to get these things onto the mainstream media.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I think if you do have such it would be 
important maybe just do an affidavit and attach them or 
some of them. 
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
Even 
– 
even 
better 
still 
Chair 
the 
investigators if they ask the SABC for every single one of 
10 
these breakfast shows. for every single one of these 
breakfast shows. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  They will be able to show you the footage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no, no that is… 
MR MOLEFE:  That is better than me going to look (speaking 
over one another) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it is just that – because we are 
approaching the end of the work of the commission the life of 
the commission we no longer have as many investigators 
20 
around as we used to so there is limited resources so if you 
can send what you can send that would be good but I wanted 
to say … 
MR MOLEFE:  I will send it in and submit an invoice as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I wanted to say in regard to what I just told 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 260 of 288 
 
you mainly that I heard evidence that sometimes and I do not 
know whether it was often there would be nobody from 
Transnet speaking.  Maybe I should have spoken generally 
because I have heard evidence about these breakfasts in 
relation to different SOE’s maybe that evidence did not 
relate to Transnet. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe it related to Eskom. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And so on so our – you see I do not want 
10 
to be –  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To show that the evidence included 
Transnet but I have heard some evidence along those lines. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  I mean. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes thank you.  Mr Molefe then I just 
want to take you there is an attached bundle of documents it 
20 
starts at page 8 could I ask you just to have a look at page 
11 it is a cover page of Transnet procurement procedures 
manual if you can – at page 12 right at the bottom it says: 
“Sponsorship and donations.” 
See that they are excluded from this manual and they are 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 261 of 288 
 
strictly governed by delegated powers you see that? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now the first signed document that we 
have is a document signed by you in this bundle is to be 
found at page 18 and it is  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry on which bundle are you now Mr 
Myburgh? 
MR MOLEFE:  MM4.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh the most recent one. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  Page 18? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Page 18 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   BKP-018 are you there Mr Molefe? 
MR MOLEFE:  Ah yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  It is addressed to you by the General 
Manger 
of 
Corporate 
Affairs 
dated 
20 
March 
2012 
sponsorship proposal New Age business briefing session.  If 
you go to the end of the document at page 20 you will see 
that the financial implications there for 16 sessions will cost 
20 
R60 million and then it deals with other sponsorship, finance 
etcetera and you then signed that you see 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  The 23rd of March 2012.  And then over 
the page one has the accompanying sponsorship agreement. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 262 of 288 
 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  For the amount of R60 million. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now perhaps I could just [word cut] the 
2012 Delegation of Authority.  And if I could ask you to turn 
to page 167? 
MR MOLEFE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You will see at paragraph 5.8.5 the 
last schedule ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
10 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
...headed, 
Sponsorships 
and 
Donations.  And if you track the second row, Operating 
Division, and then you see the first row is DCE right in the 
middle. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Just correct me if I am wrong but as 
I understand it, your level of authority was up to but not 
exceeding R 10 million for a sponsorship.   
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then if you read the text at the 
20 
bottom, approved limits are accumulative per annum.  Do 
you see that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So your limit was up to R 10 million.  
Then 
the 
Social 
and 
Ethics 
Committee 
between 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 263 of 288 
 
R 10 million and R 20 million and then the board for 
anything in excess of R 20 million.  Is that right? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So I suppose that if that was the 
prevailing delegation at the time in 2012, you did not have 
the authority to enter into a sponsorship agreement of 
R 60 million? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  Once again, Chair, I would have to go 
and research this properly about what happened.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Because I think, sitting here and trying to 
answer it now ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay you are speaking too softly.   
MR MOLEFE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It will not be recorded. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, I would want to go to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   To research ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Ja.  Because if I have an indication that 
you are going to ask me about Delegations of Authority 
responses ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   ... I would have had ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   ...and look for a document ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 264 of 288 
 
MR MOLEFE:   ...if I find it and try and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Reflect and so on. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja.  So, I mean, this is a very thick 
document.  It was given to us timeously. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   But then just an indication that this is what 
we would like to focus on. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I am sure, as we have before, 
Mr Molefe, with the leave of the Chairperson, if you would 
like to put in affidavit after your evidence on this, certainly 
10 
from the Legal Team’s perspective, we will not have an 
issue with that. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you can have time to go and have a 
look and then one way for you would be to do an affidavit 
and say:  I have had a look at this.  This is my response.  
Or we can arrange for you to come back and say 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   No, no, no.  I am not coming back Chair. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   [laughs] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
MR MOLEFE:   [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I was giving you options. 
MR MOLEFE:   No, no ...[intervenes]  
[Speakers intervening each other – unclear] 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 265 of 288 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Even – even ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But if you want to put in an affidavit, that 
is fine. 
MR MOLEFE:   No, Chair even an affidavit, I think that the 
correct people, really, that can point us in the right 
directions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MR MOLEFE:   The correct people that can point us in the 
direction in terms of these delegations, would be either 
Internal Audit or the CFO’s office.   They can say – they 
10 
can answer that question more perfect.  Because even if I 
go and try and research this thing, I do not have access to 
the document and it was not an area of my speciality.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   So maybe Internal Audit can be asked:  why 
did you not pick this thing up as irregular expenditure?  
And maybe they can give a more intelligent answer than I 
can hope to give. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I hear that part but at some stage, 
we need to have your answer as – your answer to the 
20 
question whether, as far as you knew, you would have 
delegated authority or not.  So ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Okay ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...you can check with Internal Audit and 
so on but at some stage or another, one needs to hear 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 266 of 288 
 
from you, whether you say you think you were because of 
A, B, C, D or you cannot remember or whatever, but there 
needs to be some answer.  And if you say:  Look, I would 
need to check something, that is fine.  But if you say:  
Look, I do remember.  I did have authority and this is what 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, I will go and check, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Chairperson, could I just take an 
instruction on something for one second? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   Would it be too much to ask for a bathroom 
break, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, we can take a bathroom break.  
Okay let us take a ten minutes adjournment, Mr Myburgh.  
Just take a ten minutes adjournment.  If you would like 
some comfort break? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That is fine.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ten minutes adjournment.  We 
adjourn. 
20 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It is the first sponsorship agreement 
and we see that you signed that on the 23 March 2012.  Do 
you confirm that? 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 267 of 288 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now I had taken you to the 2012 
delegation of authority at page 167 which shows that your 
authority was up to 10 million. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But what we must place on record is 
if you have a look at page 141, the 2012 delegation of 
authority was approved by the board, you see at page 141 
on the 25 April 2012.  Do you see that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So in other words …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, delegation – page 141, that 
is the cover page, is that right? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   141 is the cover page of the 2012 
delegation of authority. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   At page 167 is part of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So when you signed the document 
on the 23 March 2012, the 2012, as we call it, delegation 
20 
of authority, had yet to kick in, so to speak. 
MR MOLEFE:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So the question then is what was 
your delegation of authority as of the 23 March 2012 and in 
answer to that – and the point I was getting at but in a 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 268 of 288 
 
different way is to be found at page 113, this is the 
preceding delegation of authority.    
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The 2011 one. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you will see there – but if you 
turn to page 138 your delegation of authority before the 
new April 2012 delegation was much higher. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   At page 138. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Paragraph 5 …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I cannot keep up with your pages, Mr 
Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay, so the 2011 delegation of 
authority starts, DCJ, at page 113. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Included in that is page 138. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and what does 138 have? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   At the top of 138, the first schedule 
20 
– I think it is paragraph 5.8.5, you will see that Mr Molefe’s 
delegation of authority when it came to sponsorship was 30 
million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So in 2011 it was 30 million and then 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 269 of 288 
 
with effect from - effectively the beginning of May 2012 it 
nosedived to 10 million. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now with that in mind I want to take 
you …[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   So I do not have to do the... 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, you do not, fortunately for 
everyone.  Okay. 
MR MOLEFE:   The supplementary affidavit. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But the point I am going to make is 
10 
the one that I am actually driving at but now in a different 
way.  So we see that first agreement that you signed is 
filed as a sponsorship agreement. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you see attached to that, if you 
now go to the beginning, page 21, was a sponsorship 
agreement.  We have been through that before. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Let us go to what happened then in 
2012 where the now reduced delegation of authority kicks 
20 
in, had kicked in. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You will see that the document that 
you sign now in 2013, where your delegation of authority 
for sponsorship had reduced to 10 million, in 2013, if you 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 270 of 288 
 
go to page 31. 
MR MOLEFE:   31? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You signed this document, you see 
the 2013? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you signed it on the 4 April 2013 
by which time the 2012 delegation, the reduced one, had 
kicked in. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But I just want to draw your attention 
10 
to the subject.  Now instead of this being called a 
sponsorship, it was all of a sudden called the partnership.  
Do you see that in the subject line? 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And if you go to page 32, paragraph 
7, the partnership will cost 15 million. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So if it was still styled the 
sponsorship you would not have had the delegation of 
authority but now it is a partnership and you do. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   In fact it is advertising because you will 
see that it will come out of the Public Affairs advertising 
budget. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But, Mr Molefe, how do you explain 
the change from – first year it was a sponsorship, the next 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 271 of 288 
 
year it is a partnership. 
MR MOLEFE:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Is it just coincidental, has it got 
nothing to do with your reduced delegation of authority? 
MR MOLEFE:   Then I will have to do a supplementary 
affidavit. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright. 
MR MOLEFE:   To go and find out how that happened. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Because if you look at page 33, now 
the agreement was a partnership agreement. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Advertising.  It says Advertising Partnership 
Agreement.  So it is a branding and advertising. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I think simply the proposition – and 
you are free to put in an affidavit if you wish to.  The 
question is was it just coincidental. 
MR MOLEFE:   As in once because it says Branding and 
Advertising Partnership Agreement.  You choose to focus 
on partnership and not on branding and advertising. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But it was …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not think, Mr Molefe, I do not think 
20 
that for Mr Myburgh’s proposition it matters that there is 
advertising 
before 
partnership, 
I 
think 
what 
he 
is 
comparing is sponsorship and a partnership, even it’s an 
advertising partnership, that is what - Mr Myburgh, is that 
correct? 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 272 of 288 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   But the sponsorship – was a sponsorship 
not also a partnership? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, he is giving you an opportunity to 
explain that to say why is it that when it was called a 
sponsorship, why is it that it was called a sponsorship at a 
certain time and this was the delegation.  When there was 
a change of the delegation suddenly its characterisation 
also changed and then …[intervenes] 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   To advertising. 
CHAIRPERSON:   …it turned into a partnership. 
MR MOLEFE:   No the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   As I said, you are free to emphasise that 
it was an advertising partnership, you are not precluded 
from the – because you may know, you would know what 
point it brings up but he is giving you a chance to explain 
the difference but if you say you want to put in a 
supplementary affidavit, that is fine. 
MR MOLEFE:   Okay.  In English? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MOLEFE:   I must write the affidavit in English. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Molefe... 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You see, Mr Molefe, perhaps I could 
…[intervenes] 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 273 of 288 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not suggest that you cannot 
explain this in English.  Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   If we go to 2014, for example at 
page 44, you will see that the New Age – they are still 
talking about – wanting you to – they are offering you a 
sponsorship and then what you see at page 46 in 2014, if 
you have a look at page 47, paragraph 8, it is deliberately, 
it 
seems, 
styled 
a 
partnership. 
 
Now 
of 
course 
a 
partnership 
would, 
I 
assume, 
have 
been 
a 
standard 
contract.  Would I be correct, financed through the 
10 
department’s budget and you would have been able to 
approve it.  Is that correct? 
MR MOLEFE:   Come again? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   A partnership of that sort would have 
been a contract that would have financed through the 
department’s budget and you would have been entitled and 
had the power to approve it, correct? 
MR MOLEFE:   If it was a sponsorship? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   If it was a partnership.  We know if it 
was 
a 
sponsorship 
you 
would 
not 
have 
because 
it 
20 
exceeded your delegation of authority. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja but can you please give me an 
opportunity to go and reconsider this and write it properly 
because it says from the advertising budget and it is a 
branding and advertising activity, as we saw it.  And I think 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 274 of 288 
 
that even Mr Mahlani’s memo, somewhere there, will 
probably 
explain 
it 
because 
he 
was 
the 
branding 
department, not partnership. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Chairperson, we have no further 
questions, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, that is fine.  Well, before I let 
Mr Masuku re-examine, he is going to re-examine, I must 
just raise this issue going back to the value of this brief, 
as shows for Transnet, I just want to say one of the issues 
that I tried to get one of the witnesses – I think it may have 
10 
been a Transnet witness, to explain about the importance 
of this advertising, if it was advertising, but I think he 
sought to explain it that way, you know?  Bearing in mind 
what Transnet’s business is, what Transnet is about, and I 
cannot 
claim 
to 
know 
everything 
that 
Transnet 
gets 
involved 
in, 
obviously 
you 
would 
know. 
 
I 
did 
not 
understand why it would be necessary to spend this kind of 
money for nothing more than simply to say – at least that 
is how I understood from one of the witnesses – to say you 
just want to get people to have a positive image of 
20 
Transnet.  I think whoever the witness was even talked 
about saying well, we may – Transnet may wish to attract 
certain professionals to look at employment at Transnet 
and if Transnet has a bad name, that is not good, it cannot 
attract those people.  It may be my lack of understanding 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 275 of 288 
 
about branding and so on but I said to him I can 
understand if a company in the private sector which, for 
example, sells some products to the public, you know, 
spends a lot of money on advertising in order to get a lot 
of customers.  But I was thinking, you know, Transnet, 
generally speaking, as far as the public is concerned, I 
think provides certain services and as long as those 
services are – that service is good, generally speaking, 
you know, people would use those services but of course 
my knowledge might be outdated because Transnet has 
10 
been broken up into different entities over the time, but 
that was part of my concern.  Do you want to say anything 
about that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Chair, it is a marketing thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think that is what they said too. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, in marketing and branding.  The most 
important thing about the brand is when somebody, a man 
in the street, average person, is the brand, what first 
comes to mind?  That is what we want to achieve, the 
brand.  What first comes to mind when he sees the brand.  
20 
Now take Transnet, Transnet does not provide services to 
people to you and me, they provide services to big 
corporates, big corporate who transport their containers on 
rail to the ports, we load them onto ships and they export.  
So these are big businesses.   But every day people see a 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 276 of 288 
 
Transnet train passing in the neighbourhood on the way to 
Saldanha or on the way to Richards Bay.  So when they 
see that Transnet logo what does it evoke in their mind?  
At that is what the fight is about.  It is not about telling 
people about your services.  I see Nando’s – I am going to 
say something wrong again – they hardly ever talk about – 
okay, they talk about how nice their chicken is but they 
usually say – they tell jokes and when people think about 
Nando’s, they think about a fun brand, a brand that, you 
know, more than the amount of salt that they put on the 
10 
chicken and the peri-peri that they put, they make it fun 
thing.  So Nando’s is about fun.  You might not know that 
McDonald’s 
actually 
makes 
very 
little 
money 
from 
hamburgers, they make money from property.  So they 
hardly ever talk about property and that is a business 
model, you see?  So branding is about what the brand 
evokes, right?  So in the context of South Africa, which is a 
developmental state, the Transnet brand that certainly 
when I was CEO wanted to evoke was a company that is 
involved, that is concerned about the fact that maybe there 
20 
is no water in a certain community or that a company that 
gave the community an opportunity to understand the 
problems in the Department of Water Affairs because 
people would also call in, into this Breakfast, just from all 
over the country and ask questions that they would like to 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 277 of 288 
 
ask.  But in the end, that leaves an impression in their 
minds of the brand, of the branding, because otherwise 
they would not – okay, now they will see a train but at least 
they can associate the train …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   With something good. 
MR MOLEFE:   With something good, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Masuku, do you have any re-
examination? 
ADV MASUKU:   Deputy Justice, happily I have maybe two 
questions. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, that is fine. 
ADV MASUKU:   Yes.  The first question that I would like 
to ask, Deputy Chief Justice, Mr Molefe, do you believe 
that you managed the Transnet business or the Eskom 
business in order to advance the private interests of 
anybody? 
MR MOLEFE:   No, Chair.  And in fact on reflecting about 
this and listening to the President talk over the last two 
days, the frustration that I have is the frustration of a foot 
soldier. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of a…? 
MR MOLEFE:   Of a foot soldier who is out there trying to 
do their best under very difficult circumstances and then 
people come and criticise the trench and they say this 
trench could have been six metres wider or two metres 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 278 of 288 
 
smaller and why did you use this ammunition and not that 
ammunition and yet you are fighting in the heat of battle 
and responding to the demands of the battle.  I mean, the 
President was here talking as a commander that we deploy 
and so on and so forth, but the foot soldiers, what did they 
do when they are confronted with certain situations?  And 
the other frustration is this Commission, for example, it has 
chosen a particular narrative and the family and their 
involvement in Transnet and Eskom and ignored others and 
I ask myself why these particular issues and this particular 
10 
family.  There are other families that also did things with 
these entities, there are other families’ whose behaviour 
qualifies with the definition of state capture, but there is no 
interest in that. 
 
Classic example, the locomotives tender, it was not 
to the Chinese only, the Americans were there, the 
Canadians were there, the Germans were there but the 
focus was on the Chinese business there is appropriate 
narrative and interpretation and understanding of state 
capture.   
20 
Let me give you an example, Chair, in the 1930’s, 
the famous painter here in South Africa called Pierneef. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who? 
MR MOLEFE:   Pierneef.  Ja, his painting are very 
expensive, they go into the hundreds of millions, in fact 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 279 of 288 
 
one of Ace Magashule’s bodyguard has been sentenced to 
15 years for removing a Pierneef painting from the Free 
State government building.  In the 1930’s the CEO of 
Transnet…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you go there, Mr Molefe, because 
I think you go there in pursuit of whatever it is to support 
the issue of the narrative.  Let me remind you that the – as 
you recall, this Commission came about as a result of the 
report the Public Protector at the time. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   The issues that the Public Protector said 
should be investigated by this Commission related almost 
exclusively to the relationship between the Gupta family 
and the President and the executive and so on and so on.  
So, in other words, the Public Protector had in mind that 
those 
are 
the 
issues 
that 
this 
Commission 
should 
investigate.   
However, when the terms of reference for the 
Commission were made by the then President, Mr Zuma, 
the terms of reference were much wider which meant the 
20 
Commission could look into other families and so on, okay?   
So when the Commission started, it went on the 
basis that its terms of reference were wide but you will 
recall that Public Protector had said the Commission 
should finish its job within six months.  So we took the 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 280 of 288 
 
view that it was impossible so we asked for an extension 
but after about a year and a half, we realised that there 
was no way we would finish within a reasonable time if we 
went – we continued to use these wide terms of reference 
and when we applied for an extension of the period of the 
term of the Commission at the end of 2019, we said to the 
court since the whole idea of the Commission from the 
Public Protector was really about this family, we would 
focus from then going on on the issues that the Public 
Protector had identified but we said that whatever we had 
10 
started we would try and finish. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I thought let me just mention that 
…[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   Chair, my understanding of the genesis of 
the Public Protector ’s report is that Glencore went to 
complain that Eskom is squeezing them to sell the mine to 
the Guptas and without investigating it any further, she 
took it as the gospel truth and wrote the report without 
even asking us exactly what was happening and I have 
20 
tried to address that issue here and very little attention 
was in fact paid to that issue by the Commission.  In fact 
the Commission went on to BOSASA and other things and 
that is why …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I am sorry …[intervenes] 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 281 of 288 
 
MR MOLEFE:   That is why my story of the Pierneef 
paintings, Chair, if I could finish it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, finish it, ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, the Pierneef paintings.  The CEO of 
Transnet 
in 
the 
1930’s 
commissioned 
the 
Pierneef 
paintings, what they call the station paintings which was 
Pierneef paintings about Johannesburg railway station.  
Those paintings are very, very expensive at the moment.  
They belong to Transnet but they have been given to Mr 
Johan Rupert to look after and they are in a private 
10 
museum in Franschhoek.  When I was there I tried to go 
and look at how we can get them back or some other 
arrangements and so on and so forth.  So why is that issue 
not of interest if BOSASA is of interest.  I am not saying 
there was corruption, in fact I think there may be a 
legitimate loan agreement with the foundation but it is a 
family 
that 
had 
an 
interaction 
with 
Transnet 
whose 
activities the Commission was not interested in.   
I am trying to implicate anybody in anything, I am 
just making an example. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but you did not also - Mr Molefe, 
you did not in 2018 and 2019 when I went on TV and radio 
said anyone who has information that could fall within 
terms of reference and has got information, they must bring 
that 
information, 
you 
did 
not 
bring 
that 
issue, 
that 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 282 of 288 
 
information to the Commission. 
MR MOLEFE:   Would you have investigated, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if you had given it to us and we 
had not – you would have a better case but you did not.   
MR MOLEFE:   No, actually do not – I was just making an 
example, I did not want to investigate it, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MR MOLEFE:   I was just making an example that there is 
a myriad of issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   That go beyond – that could have been 
investigated.  But anyway… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  You have answered to Mr 
Masuku’s question.  Mr Masuku? 
ADV MASUKU:   The last question, Mr Molefe, you have 
appeared in the Commission I think more than four times, if 
I am not wrong, to deal with a myriad of issues relating to 
decisions that were taken, governance matters that you 
were involved in when you served in Transnet and in 
Eskom.  Do you feel that in the more than times that you 
20 
have engaged – you have engaged with the Commission, 
you have engaged the Commission on your role, do you 
feel that you now have a better grasp of what state capture 
really is? 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 283 of 288 
 
MR MOLEFE:   No, actually I – you know, state capture is 
one of those things that happen all the time everywhere.  I 
just feel that there was a convenient use of the term to 
probe certain things in a bigger fight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just go closer to your mic. 
MR MOLEFE:   In a bigger fight, there was a fight that was 
going on and the parties to the fight decided to use a 
particular set of events and the other party that was also 
involved in the fight could have used another set of events 
and we would still be here.  So I feel like it was a tactic 
10 
that was being used, that we could this term and so on.  I 
mean, I appreciate the fact that we are trying to get to 
corruption but we are just looking at corruption of a 
particular type.   
The fact that Glencore was trying to extort R470 a 
ton is a particular type in my books the risk of being sued 
with 
R1 
billion 
from 
Glencore, 
a 
particular 
type 
of 
unacceptable behaviour that I felt did not promote a 
particular narrative, did not promote a particular size of the 
fight and my feeling is that I think it is a pity that we did 
20 
not try to go to the core of the state capture itself, if we 
wanted to, all corruption.  What has been unearthed here 
is just a tip of the iceberg. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let me say this, Mr …[intervenes] 
ADV MASUKU:   [indistinct – recording distorted] 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 284 of 288 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I am sorry, Mr Masuku, let me say 
this.  I do think that what the Commission has unearthed is 
indeed the tip of the iceberg, we did not touch – we did not 
deal with municipalities and there are many provincial 
government departments we did not get to.  There are 
many national departments that we did not get to, so 
indeed on that score, that what the Commission has looked 
at will be a tip of the iceberg, I would agree.   
 
But going back to the question you raise about why 
– about what you say is Glencore’s extortion of Eskom, let 
10 
me say that you may or may not have realised – well, 
actually last time you appeared here or even before that, 
you were the one who drew my attention to a question that 
I had raised some time earlier about whether they had 
done due diligence and all of that, you know? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Subsequent to your being here – well, I 
do not know whether subsequent but I think probably 
subsequently I said to the legal team they need to get Mr 
Ephron ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes Clinton Ephron. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To put up an affidavit and deal with this 
issue and subsequently an affidavit was filed by him and if 
it was not sent to you and you would like to see it I think 
the legal team relating to Eskom can consider that but he 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 285 of 288 
 
has dealt with it in a certain way and I have said to the 
legal team that deals with the Eskom work stream they 
must consider calling him back to come and deal with that 
version, so I am just mentioning what happened that you 
might not be aware of. 
MR MOLEFE:   What I am aware of is that he made a 
statement subsequent to my evidence, not an affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, well maybe it might not be an 
affidavit, it might be a statement. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes it was a statement that was not under 
10 
oath in which he denied that Mr Ramaphosa had been 
Chairman of ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but let’s deal with one issue at a 
time, ...[indistinct - laughing] now, so I am saying that I  
have said to the team that deals with the Eskom work 
stream they must consider calling him to come and take a 
report and deal with that issue, so I am just mentioning 
that so that you know that it didn’t – it wasn’t left at you 
just saying there is this and nothing was done. 
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
 
But 
maybe 
Mr 
Glasenberg 
Chair, 
20 
Glasenberg. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well Mr Glasen – well I don’t know about 
that aspect but we have gone to – the Commission has 
gone to Mr Glasenberg about other issues and acquired 
some affidavit and he was asked from the reports I have 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 286 of 288 
 
received whether he will be prepared to come and testify 
and I was told that apparently he was not available or keen 
but that was in relation to something else, not necessarily 
this.  Anyway Mr Masuku was that your last question? 
ADV MASUKU SC:   There is just one issue I just thought I 
would ask Mr Molefe to clarify. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MASUKU SC:   The question from Myburgh which was 
just over – relating to an allegation that he may have 
visited the Gupta family driving in the Audi S8 right, you 
10 
have never owned a car like that in your life? 
MR MOLEFE:   No I have never owned an Audi S8. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MOLEFE:   And Chair there is another matter that I 
would like to have an opportunity to explain further. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MR MOLEFE:  There is another matter that I would like an 
opportunity to explain further by way of an affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   An affidavit? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, ja, and a properly considered affidavit. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, is that in relation to ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To Transnet? 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, the increase. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 287 of 288 
 
MR MOLEFE:   From twenty something billion, or 38million 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   To 54? 
MR MOLEFE:   54billion, is not an increase, not even in 
accounting, it is a variance, it is the difference between 
budget and actual and not an increase in anything.  So, 
and I would like to go and write what you know what you 
call the difference between a budgeted amount and an 
actual amount, it is not an increase but I would like to 
explain it in more detail properly, academically researched. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, Mr Myburgh I don’t think there 
should be any problem with that? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, except I perhaps would ask Mr 
Molefe to consider whether Mr Singh is not more than able 
to deal with that, perhaps we could ask him ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Let’s limit to Mr Singh there, I am sorry, I 
can explain, he is a ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, well I just don’t want a situation 
where 
you 
feel 
you 
were 
prevented 
from 
explaining 
20 
something that you wanted to explain, in case Mr Singh 
doesn’t explain it satisfactorily. 
MR MOLEFE:   I will leave it to Mr Singh, but just an 
increase and a variance are two different things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no, that is fine, but well if you 
29 APRIL 2021 – DAY 385 
 
Page 288 of 288 
 
say you leave it to Mr Singh that is fine.   Okay Mr Masuku 
are you done? 
ADV MASUKU:   No Chairperson I think those are the 
questions I would like to have asked Mr Molefe, but Chair 
maybe I am speaking over the – I am engaging the 
Commission virtually ...[indistinct] submission something 
could I ask Mr Molefe to talk to – on his own deal with an 
aspect that he believes I may have missed, I will ask him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that is fine, that is fine.   Okay 
thank you very much to everybody, thank you for your 
10 
cooperation and thank you to the staff and the technicians, 
thank you to Mr Molefe’s legal team.  Mr Molefe thank you 
for your cooperation and thank you Mr Masuku, thank you 
Mr Myburgh and your team, we will adjourn now and 
tomorrow I will be – for the benefit of the public I will be 
hearing the evidence of Mr Gama. 
 
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise.
