PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 9 OCTOBER 2019 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair perhaps the parties should 
place themselves on record and then if I may address you after that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright.  Thank you. 
ADV REG WILLIS:  Morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning. 
ADV REG WILLIS:   As introduced to you in chambers I am Advocate 
10 
Willis.  I appear with my learned friend Ms Gaba we are from the 
Johannesburg Bar we are instructed by Maphalla Mokate Conradie

CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV REG WILLIS:   And we appear for Mr Wakeford.

examine and have his evidence led.  Thank you Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much. 
ADV DEON POOL:  Good morning Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning.

CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DEON POOL:   And I am appearing instead of Advocate Witz and I 
09 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 180 
 
Page 3 of 17 
 
retain the instruction from Witz Attorneys in this instance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DEON POOL:   For purposes of today’s proceedings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DEON POOL:   As it pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Yes Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair briefly as stated in 
chambers it is perhaps necessary for a short adjournment and if I can 
just explain that to you.   
You granted an order Chair on the 7 t h October granting Leave 
10 
to Mr Wakeford to cross-examine Messrs Agrizzi and Vorster and for 
certain other matters to take place.   
The position is today that Messrs Agrizzi and Vorster will apply 
for a postponement for various reasons that will become apparent in 
due course.   
That at present is intended to be opposed by Mr Wakeford.  
However the differences between the parties and a thorough joint 
submission to you Mr Chair is yet possible if the parties can be given 
an opportunity to speak to the investigator involved.   
Part of the dispute between Messrs Agrizzi and Vorster on the 
20 
one hand and Mr Wakeford on the other relates to factual matters of 
which there would be records in the Bosasa documentation.  That 
Bosasa documentation is at present under the control of one or other 
curators who are in dispute as to who the curator lawfully is.  That 
matter will be resolved by the Supreme Court of Appeal later in 
09 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 180 
 
Page 4 of 17 
 
November when an appeal comes before it.   
The documentation relative to these disputes were summons 
as far back as June by the investigators but that execution of that 
summons was resisted on the basis that the dispute had to be resolved 
before a curator properly appointed could release the documentation.  
And that is the explanation for the curators of Bosasa in liquidation or 
to not to comply with the summons.  That documentation may be 
relevant to either party in promotion of either party’s version of the 
facts.  We do not know that yet until that documentation has been 
examined.  So Chair what I have suggested to the parties is that they 
10 
confirm the position with the investigators and then make an informed 
decision as to whether it would not be preferable to wait for the 
outcome of that part of the investigation before proceeding.  Otherwise 
it may result in a multiplicity of hearings which might benefit no-one but 
I will make submissions on behalf of the legal team in due course 
depending on the outcome of that discussion.   
So in short Chair we asking for a very short adjournment so 
that the parties may speak to the investigator to ascertain whether 
further information might be necessary for proper examination to take 
place. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would – what fifteen minutes be enough for that 
purpose? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Perhaps twenty Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe twenty? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes please. 
09 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 180 
 
Page 5 of 17 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I will grant that. What may have to be taken 
into account is that there may be no guarantee that the decision of the 
Supreme Court of Appeal would mean the end of that dispute.  In the 
sense that obvious I do not know the papers I – and so on.  In the 
sense that there is still the Constitutional Court in case somebody is 
unhappy and if they can find an issue that falls within the jurisdiction of 
that court. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Chair it… 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of possible delays. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No I understand that but in any 
10 
event the commission would take steps. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then to compel production of the 
information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. Ja no I am mentioning this just so that everybody 
as they confer with one another they do not necessarily work on the 
basis that once there is a decision of the Supreme Court of Appeal it 
necessarily will mean the end of the litigation.  It might not.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes that is true Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja that is the only point ja. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  It is nearly twenty past ten.  I will 
adjourn until twenty to eleven. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes we adjourn.

REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you.  The contemplated 
meeting has been held.  It has gone some way to bringing about some 
consensus of course it is all subject to your decision Chair but at least 
the parties have [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Have reached a degree of 
10 
consensus.  But Mr Willis would like to place some matters on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Well maybe before Mr Willis does that I 
must just say that for what it is worth when the decision to grant Mr 
Wakeford Leave to Cross-examine the two witnesses when that decision 
was announced or made and announced a few days ago and I indicated 
that the cross-examination would take place today.  I think I said today.  
It was on the understanding that all parties concerned were available.  
It may be that there was some misunderstanding in terms of the 
availability of all parties but certainly it was on the understanding that 
the legal team understood the parties to be available and their lawyers 
20 
or at least that is what I understood and I may have misunderstood 
something but otherwise I would not have issued a decision a few days 
ago and say cross-examine must start in two days or three days’ time.  
I would not have done that.  I would have given everyone enough time.  
So it was only done on the understanding that there had been 
09 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 180 
 
Page 7 of 17 
 
communication between the legal team and the – all the legal – the 
lawyers for the various parties and my understanding was that they 
were available.  If I had understood differently I would have arranged 
that they should be another time.  So I thought maybe I must just make 
that clear that that is the context in which I said the cross-examination 
would take place today.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Yes. 
ADV REG WILLIS:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Chair the – before 
communicating in precise terms. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV REG WILLIS:  My instruction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV REG WILLIS:  Although Mr Pretorius has indicated that there is 
consensus. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV REG WILLIS:  That we will concede the circumstances. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV REG WILLIS:  That prevail.  I would just like to – I have been 
instructed and wish to place the following on record Mr Chairman. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV REG WILLIS:  The first is a dissatisfaction on the part of our 
client Mr Wakeford as to the commitment by Mr Agrizzi and Mr Vorster 
to these proceedings and to being willing to be cross-examined and to 
hear his evidence.  You were handed when we saw you in chambers the 
09 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 180 
 
Page 8 of 17 
 
application for a postponement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV REG WILLIS:  Mr Chairman I am not going to labour the issues 
but must place on record that this affidavit that was placed before you 
ignores the facts in relation to the history of this matter. The facts in 
relation to the last few days are as you know them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV REG WILLIS:  But the affidavit does two things.  It misrepresents 
the facts over the past number of months in fact since the 26 t h February 
when our application – our client’s application was brought. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Hm. 
ADV REG WILLIS:  It strives to then tar our client with the results of 
today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV REG WILLIS:  This affidavit is wilfully misleading of you Mr 
Chairman and this commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV REG WILLIS:  But it serves no purpose in me taking it any further. 
Mr Agrizzi knows the facts and this will probably become material in the 
future in his cross-examination as to his credibility and his reliability. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV REG WILLIS:  That speaks to the disparity of commitment and the 
frustration our client has – has experienced since the 29 t h January 
when he was implicated by Mr Agrizzi before this commission without 
compliance of the rules – with the rules of this commission that was 
09 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 180 
 
Page 9 of 17 
 
necessarily directly Mr Agrizzi’s fault but those were circumstances that 
prevailed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV REG WILLIS:  For Mr Wakeford.  Mr Chairman Mr Wakeford has 
declined all opportunity to respond to the media in good faith and in 
accordance with your own comments in this commission.  He has – he 
has had to forego work opportunities, employment opportunities.  You 
would have read in his application that his tenure came to an – an 
employment tenure came to an end in April.  And he has also had to 
experience a continual fleshing out of new facts and new information in 
10 
the affidavits that have come before this commission.  The purpose of 
these submissions Mr Chairman is in as much as he concedes the 
circumstances today and consensually you may order a postponement 
of the proceedings he asks that – that you order the parties to return as 
soon as at all possible in accordance with the diaries of yourself and 
the various other stakeholders in this – in this commission.  Mr 
Chairman the – the discussions that endured in the adjournment 
between the investigating team and the legal team and the two other 
legal teams was to the effect that there is some outstanding information 
which either – which will either suit one or other party or narrow the 
20 
issues.  In those circumstances and in keeping with his commitment to 
cooperate he is not left with any opportunity but to accord with the 
advises given and the good faith dealings in particular by the legal 
team for the commission and the investigating team.  Those are the 
submissions save if there is anything else that we can be of assistance 
09 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 180 
 
Page 10 of 17 
 
with.   
CHAIRPERSON:  No that – that is fine.  I am quite alive to the fact that 
Mr Wakeford launched his application many months ago and that there 
has been some delay in dealing with it.  But I also do know that at a 
certain time when I thought it could be dealt with I heard that he was 
intending to file some further affidavits so we had to give him that 
opportunity.  But the bottom line is that we want to try and as far as 
possible be fair to everybody.  So – so it would not have been fair to 
everybody to proceed today in the circumstances which prevail.  So – 
so – so that is fine.  So I – I will postpone the matter at this stage 
10 
without fixing a date but with a clear understanding that everything that 
needs to be done should be done to make sure that we can fix a date 
as soon as possible.  What still remains in regard to the Leave to 
Cross-examine that has been granted is the question of how much time 
will be [intervenes] 
ADV REG WILLIS: Indeed so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes – so [intervenes]  
ADV REG WILLIS:  I was going to ask after that shortly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  In due course that will have to be determined.  I 
am quite happy – I am quite happy if the legal team and your side and I 
20 
do not mind everybody if they have got some submissions to make with 
regard to how much time should be set aside to make submissions and 
obviously at some stage I will decide.  As of today I intended that I 
would determine that at the beginning of the cross-examination if the 
cross-examination was going to proceed.  But there is room for various 
09 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 180 
 
Page 11 of 17 
 
submissions to be made – maybe written submissions ahead of the 
actual commencement of the hearing.  So – so maybe I can leave that 
part to be agreed upon among all the legal teams in terms of who might 
want to submit – deliver written submissions – short written 
submissions on that by when and take from there.  But should no 
submissions or notices be made ahead of the first day of the cross-
examination I would then make the decision at the commencement of 
the hearing.  But it might be preferable if it is done earlier than that 
because then everyone has an idea of how much time is allocated and 
therefore what are the important issues to focus on within the time 
10 
allocated.  But I think I can leave that to the various legal teams to 
agree upon and then that can be brought to my attention in due course. 
ADV REG WILLIS:  That is a – thank you Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV REG WILLIS:  That is a salient suggestion we will take advantage 
of it and hopefully agree that and have that – well the submissions 
referred to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV REG WILLIS:  If we cannot agree on it and you can decide ahead 
of time. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV REG WILLIS:  It would be very helpful if one [indistinct] knows 
ahead of time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV REG WILLIS:  What to expect. 
09 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 180 
 
Page 12 of 17 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV REG WILLIS:  Mr Chairman one last comment per instructions of 
our client is to thank you for the alacrity with which you dealt with his 
application once it was placed before you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much. 
ADV REG WILLIS:  Thank you Mr. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV REG WILLIS:  Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know if counsel for Mr Agrizzi and Mr Vorster 
who has – wishes to say anything? 
10 
ADV DEON POOL:  If it pleases the honourable Chairperson there are 
just certain matters that I just have been instructed to just record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DEON POOL:  At your discretion.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DEON POOL:  I have taken cognisance of Advocate Willis’ 
comments regarding the affidavit that was submitted and in order to 
comply with the substantive application requirement before this 
commission.  I will pass those comments on to Mr Witz and they can be 
dealt with by him accordingly.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DEON POOL:  Just as far as Mr Agrizzi is concerned and I have 
appreciation for the fact that Mr Wakefield – Mr Wakeford is to a certain 
extent has placed before your honourable self the fact that he is 
severely prejudiced. I do believe that that ought to be balanced by the 
09 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 180 
 
Page 13 of 17 
 
fact that Mr Agrizzi has not sought an indulgence of this kind before 
this commission at any point in time since he has been part of these 
proceedings.  He had been present at every single instance that he has 
been required to do so.  The nature of these proceedings is that 
prejudice will be suffered by implication.  It is – these proceedings are 
laying a scalpel into the bare essentials that undermine our democracy 
if that was not true the President would not have ordered it and Your 
Honourable Self would not have been presiding in this matter for the 
time that you have been.  My bottom line is that the rules of natural 
justice in respect of providing Mr Agrizzi and every party here an 
10 
opportunity to deal with these matters properly and appropriately so 
that everything can be laid bare and there is a complete understanding 
of the nature of whatever went on is important.  As far as the times just 
for the intra – or for the information of – of the various parties I have 
been advised that times have been suggested and they are similarly 
contained.  Periods of either the 18 t h – the week of the 18 t h to the 21 s t 
November or the 2 n d to the 6 t h December. Those might be dates that 
can be kept in mind.  My further instruction is that depending of course 
on Your Honourable – The Honourable commissioners discretion an 
direction that Mr Agrizzi’s team would not at least three days in order to 
20 
cross-examine Mr Wakeford and as for the remainder I believe that that 
has been dealt with by either Mr Willis or the other members of this 
commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright.   
ADV DEON POOL:  Thank you Sir 
09 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 180 
 
Page 14 of 17 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You must just – or those advising Mr Agrizzi must just 
remember to have a look at the rules and see whether there are any 
procedural steps that must be taken. 
ADV DEON POOL:  I will advise them accordingly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Taken care of first yes.  Yes. 
ADV DEON POOL:  Thank you Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I must just say for what it is worth as different sides 
contemplate making submissions with regard to the time that they can 
be allowed that I should consider allowing for cross-examination.  They 
should take into account that I am inclined not to allow too much time 
10 
but at the same time I do not want to be unfair and therefore two 
parties and allow too little time. 
ADV DEON POOL:  Honourable Chairman I think we will [intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I – ja you will bear that in mind. 
ADV DEON POOL:  Yes we – I think we all agree that we serve at your 
discretion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DEON POOL:  And at your pleasure in this instance and we take 
your direction accordingly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I think the first time when I determined 
20 
allocated time for cross-examination was with regard to I think Ms – the 
cross-examination of Mr Jonas.  I do not know whether also Ms 
Mentoor. I think at that time I may have granted an hour or two or 
thereabout. Yesterday not – well not yesterday – ja I think in the past it 
was about an hour or two but obviously it depends on the issues and 
09 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 180 
 
Page 15 of 17 
 
how fast they are.  But I just want everybody to take that into account. 
ADV DEON POOL:  I have – I take that into consideration thank you 
Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you very much.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  Just three 
points.  Firstly the legal team appreciates the cooperation of the 
parties.  It is obviously best for the investigative work of the 
commission that evidence and cross-examination takes place on as 
thorough an investigation into the underlying facts as possible.  The 
second point is that the – to place the history of this matter in its 
10 
proper context it was concluded by the filing of a reply on behalf of Mr 
Wakeford of some 290 pages on the 1 s t October. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In other words very recently. So 
in assessing the delay that must be taken into account.  And thirdly it is 
important to put one matter straight and on the record Chair.  It has 
been said today and in public and in correspondence many times that 
Mr Agrizzi implicated witnesses without compliance with the rules.  That 
is not correct.  There was a – if – if regard is had to the record which is 
available for all to read the evidence of Mr Agrizzi was given after a 
20 
comprehensive and proper application in terms of the rules that he do 
so without the issue of 3.3 Notices in particular circumstances that 
were placed in evidence before you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair. 
09 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 180 
 
Page 16 of 17 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in other words you just remind everybody that to 
the extent that there might not have been any Rule 3.3 Notices that 
were issued it was under circumstances that the legal team submitted 
justified doing that. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that was placed before the commission. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. And you permitted it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In terms of the rules. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you.  We – I am going to postpone the 
cross-examination of Mr Agrizzi and Mr Vorster by counsel for Mr 
Wakeford. I am not going to fix any date because that must still be 
worked out.  But attempts will be made to fix a date as soon as 
possible and I have no doubt that the investigation that must be carried 
out in order to facilitate that cross-examination is going to be done as 
soon as possible.  So the cross-examination of Mr Agrizzi and Mr 
20 
Vorster is postponed sine die and another date will be determined in 
due course.  That is going to – that play puts us at the end of the 
proceedings for – of today.  We – Mr Pretorius are not having any 
witnesses tomorrow and Friday.  Is that – is that confirmed? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Friday is still relatively 
09 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 180 
 
Page 17 of 17 
 
uncertain.  I say relatively uncertain the witness for that day will 
probably not appear but there is a chance that it can still be arranged 
and notification can be given to today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So somebody must just let me know but certainly not 
tomorrow there is no witness tomorrow? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And with regard to that there will be no hearing on 
Monday and Tuesday next week as well. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There will be a hearing on Wednesday involving a 
10 
witness from the Free State Government in relation to Estina.  So – yes 
– so the public will be advised about Friday either sometime today or 
tomorrow.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn.  We adjourn.
