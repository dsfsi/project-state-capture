PROCEEDINGS HELD ON 22 FEBRUARY 2019  
CHAIRPERSON:  I see there is nobody ready to address me.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Maleka, good morning everybody, good morning 
Mr Mabuza.  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair today we are going to begin with the first of 
witnesses from Eskom or relating to Eskom.  It is Mr Jabulane Albert Mabuza of course 
representing the board of Eskom.  He is legally represented.  May I ask those who 
represent him to place their names on record? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja thank you.   
10 
ADV THEMBEKA NGCUKAITOBI:  Thank you Mr Chairman my name is Thembeka 
Ngcukaitobi I am with Ms Lerato Zikalala I act on behalf of Mr Mabuza and the board of 
Eskom.  We are acting on instructions of Clare Tucker from Bowman Gilfillan. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much Mr Ngcutaitobi.  Thank you.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair the evidence of Mr Mabuza will be guided by a 
statement he made which he submitted to the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The statement is in a file which has been marked Exhibit 
U1 to U3.  At the moment it comprised two files of documentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No this one is marked Volume U and then it says File 1 so I guess 
20 
that is in substance the same thing. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes we can work with that description. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can I though for the record ask you to mark the 
statement of Mr Mabuza as U1.   
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 3 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Registrar can just mark it.  Zonika.  Just go and mark that file 
U1.  Actually if we call it U1 it seems to me it is going to be much more convenient and 
easier. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I think I will change mine from Volume U File 1 to simply U1. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that fine? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is much more then when we say Volume U1 we know which one 
we are talking about. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  I understand from the rest of my colleagues who 
were presenting evidence relating to Eskom that there are additional statements which 
have already been designated file numbers of exhibit numbers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Flowing from U1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So it will be U2 up to U4.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I see there is a lever arch file marked Volume U File 2 of this one 
that we have just marked U1 is marked Volume U file 1 of and there is space left but we 
have now amended that to say U1. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I assume that this other one marked Volume U File 2 is the one that 
should be U2?  Is that right? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We can ignore it for the moment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We can ignore it for now okay. 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 4 of 115 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Because it was given to you in advance so that you 
familiarise yourself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  With the different witnesses who would unfold after the 
evidence of Mr Mabuza. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair there are housekeeping matters that I would like 
to deal with before we get to the actual evidence of Mr Mabuza. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The first relates to the notices that have been dished out 
10 
to persons who are or might be implicated from the evidence – sorry from the statement 
of Mr Mabuza. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We have prepared a separate bundle for your records.  
May I beg your permission to hand up a copy of the bundle of the notices? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You will see then the bundle begins with an index of 
Eskom implicated parties.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  They are eight in total.  The first is Mr Anoj Singh. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The second is Mr Sean Maritz.  The third is Mr Edwin 
Mabelane.  The fourth is Mr Charles Kalima.  The fifth is Mr Govender.  The sixth is Mr 
– is Ms Daniels.  The seventh is Mr Magango and the last is Mr Koko.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 5 of 115 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Copies of these notices are included in the bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Nothing tends on them for the moment.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I merely give you this bundle at this stage in the event 
those persons elect to exercise their right in terms of Rule 33 either to apply for the 
introduction and presentation of their own evidence or the cross-examination of Mr 
Mabuza in due course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  For now we do not have any response from their side.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So we will ask you to pack this document for now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The next set of documents Chair is a bundle that has 
been prepared by Mr Mabuza and his lawyers in the course of the preparation of his 
evidence and in respect of additional matters that we raised with his lawyers and with 
him.  They have kindly prepared the bundle and have made it available to us. May I ask 
once again for your permission to present that bundle to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I have taken the liberty of marking it U5. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Arrangements must just be made for the marking to be also 
on the spine. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  We will definitely mark it in accordance with our 
own internal processes and requirements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 6 of 115 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But this is the method, fashion and model in which it 
was presented to us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no that is fine. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I like you have not had an opportunity to go through it in 
detail. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But I was given some guidance as to how I should 
approach this document as and when an opportunity to carefully consider it arises. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But for now just to take you through what its contents 
10 
are and it will be an exercise of the blind leading the blind for the moment.  You will see 
that the file begins with an index. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Then the index has different parts, Parts A to C for now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And Part A describes documents relating to disciplinary 
proceedings.  You will see A2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  In particularly relates to the charges that were put to Mr 
Koko. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And his plea. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And his plea.  You will see that A3 relates to the 
summary of what they conceive to be objective evidence relating to allegations made in 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 7 of 115 
 
the public domain regarding Mr Koko based on Seva emails and Eskom Board 
resolutions.  These are emails which Eskom retrieved and sought to utilise in support of 
the charges that were brought against Mr Koko.  The Chairman of Eskom in the course 
of his evidence will take you through the charges, Mr Koko’s response and some of the 
emails.  Of course we will want to find out from him what was the upshot of those 
proceedings.  And then Chair what follows is A4 the disciplinary charges brought 
against Ms Daniels. We do not have her plea yet but I am sure Eskom’s lawyers will 
guide us on that issue in due course.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What follows are the findings made by the Chairperson 
10 
of the Disciplinary Enquiry of Ms Daniels?  You will find it at A5.  We will take you to 
some of those findings in due course and then thereafter you have A6 which is the 
charges brought against Mr Kalima and A7 is the charges brought against Mr Maritz.  
Again the Chairperson will take us through all of this in order to explain to us what is 
the status of the proceedings in that regard.  Part B relates to several of the responses 
that we ask Eskom to present or provide in relation to the - or some of the reports that 
we have presented before you including the Fundudzi Report.  You will find that the 
response relating to Fundudzi is set out in Park B and then what follows is Eskom’s 
notice of revue application.  In that litigation involving the setting aside of the contract 
or contracts awarded to McKinsey and there would be one aspect relating to those 
20 
proceedings which we would like to draw your attention to in due course.  And it relates 
to a so called Rule 35.12 notice that Eskom gave to McKinsey to produce several 
documents.  And we will refer you to the response of McKinsey in that regard.  And then 
you will find Eskom’s response in regard to the investigation which we now know has 
been initiated by the SIU.  It is set out in B2 and then there is another notice of motion 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 8 of 115 
 
in B3.  And B4 it is styled separate pack provided.  This is a pack of documentation 
again which the Eskom lawyers have produced for our consideration relating to 
exchange of confidential information between some of its executives and third parties 
who in our view had no right to receive, consider or distribute that information.  It has 
now been given to me in a separate pack.  I have not yet time to consider it but I will 
again ask the administrative team of the commission to make several copies and we 
will make sure that a copy is placed before you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So that in due course you would consider it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And lastly it is a memorandum on the status of Eskom’s 
Contractual Relationship if any with Tegeta and related group of companies and the 
concern of the legal team was whether Eskom is still doing business with Tegeta and its 
related entities. We have been told that Tegeta is under business rescue and the 
Chairperson will canvass that issue again.  We raised it with him and we will raise it in 
the course of this proceedings in the light of the concerns that we have around its 
involvement in allegation relating to state capture in Eskom.  And lastly it will be the 
Eskom note.  And then Part C relates to the directors declaration of interest in line with 
Eskom’s conflicts of interests, policies and processes.  This is one of the issues which 
we raised with Eskom in the light of the contents of Mr Mabuza’s statement.  You would 
20 
recall that at some point that statement deals with two of Eskom’s erstwhile directors 
who were forced or elected to resign months into the employment – sorry months into 
their appointment as directors and in regard to at least one of them there were 
allegations of conflict of interest.  So the issue that we ask the Chairperson of Eskom to 
address is how a board appointed on the premise of cleaning up would in turn have 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 9 of 115 
 
some of its members facing allegations of conflict of interest.  I am not suggesting any 
wrongdoing at this stage but it becomes un-axiomatic that you are appointed to clean 
up and yet you face allegations of debt.  So that is the bundle that the Eskom lawyers 
have usefully given to us arising from several questions that we have asked them to 
address.  Chair that is the sum total of the documentation that we are going to use.  
May I mention that we have asked your registrar to bring with her for your assistance 
several reports that we have canvassed on Wednesday relating to previous enquiries, 
findings and reports on allegations of state capture.  We have done so because we are 
going to ask Mr Mabuza to deal with some of the findings, recommendations and 
remedial measures made by a number of those entities especially the remedial 
10 
measures suggested by National Treasury in the report which you will find in 5.11 of 
Volume 6.  But that is something that we will deal with in due course.  Chair against the 
background of that data set … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I think Volumes 1 to 6 are certainly here and I think those are the 
volumes you have indicated would be necessary. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So that Mr Mabuza is not in just at the right time, at the 
right moment we will present Volumes 1 to 6 to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Yes thank you.  Chair we would then ask you to make 
sure that Mr Mabuza takes the prescribed oath unless there is any other preliminary 
matter that you would like to raise with us? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine.  An oath or affirmations will administered to Mr 
Mabuza. 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 10 of 115 
 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:    My name is Jabulane Albert Mabuza. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections to taking the prescribed oath? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Nope. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your conscience? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the truth; the whole 
truth and nothing but the truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help me 
God. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Help me God. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.  Yes you may proceed Mr Maleka. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Mr Mabuza good morning.   
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Good morning Counsellor.  
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I will be asking you questions but your answers would 
be of interest to the Chairperson.  So I suggest that as you give answers keep his line 
of sight and make sure that you speak with a tone and pace that will be useful for him 
to understand your evidence.  Before I start with the substance of your evidence as 
outlined in your statement I would like us – I would like you to provide us with some 
background of yourself in brief because the position that you occupy at the moment 
would like us to have some appreciation of your background.   
20 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  I do not know how far I must go but … 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Well I would like to provide the highlights of what you 
consider to be the achievements or failures in your life of importance to your office as 
the Chairperson of a state owned entity.  It is a broad question you have been given the 
clean canvass and you can apply the broad strokes on it.   
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 11 of 115 
 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Thank you.  Honourable Chairman I was born in 
a small town outside Mpumalanga called Waterval Boven.  I grew up in that part of the 
world.  I went to matriculate Othlane, dropped out of law school in 1981 at [indistinct].  
Got involved working for the then Bantu Affairs Commissioner.  Continued to drive taxis. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that Kwanda Baza Bantu? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Kwanda Baza Bantu. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Continued to drive taxis. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is how it was known that department ja. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  That department yes Mr Chair.  Drove taxis.  Got 
10 
involved with the black taxi movement on the back of which I was part of the team that 
formed Fabcos the Foundation for African Business and Consumer Services and it was 
in that position that I got to meet what became my boss, my [indistinct] at SAB.  Joined 
the executive team of SAB in 1993.  In 1997 went to the hotel side of SAB and… 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And SAB is South African Breweries? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  South African Breweries correct.  Went onto be 
involved in their hotel and gaming business as it was to be and I became the founding 
chief executive of Tsogo Sun.  It was in this role that I got involved in various business 
organisations some I have since relinquished.  Some I continue to hold.  I am chairman 
of the casino association. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  More or less I am sorry to interrupt you. Just questions 
of timeline.  When did you become the Chief Executive officer of Tsogo Sun? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  I became Chief Executive Officer of Tsogo Sun it 
would be ‘95/’96 and ja since then until 2011/2012 when I retired. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 12 of 115 
 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  And through these business organisations I 
became – been in the tourism business.  Been Chairman of South Africa and Tourism 
for nine years.  Been President of Busa the Business Unit in South Africa for 6.  Been 
now for the last three years President, Chairman of Business Leadership South Africa.  
Served on various boards in – I am chairman of Telkom which I have now announced to 
– for last six years which I… 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes can I be rude and stop you there because you now 
getting to the officers you occupy or occupied of relevance to the commission.  You 
have just mentioned Telkom and that you have been chairperson of that institution.  
When did you become chairperson of Eskom’s board? 
10 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Since November 2012 I was appointed 
November 2012 as a director and chairman of Telkom a position I still hold.  Yesterday 
Telkom board publicly announced that I will be stepping down from that position end of 
May 2019.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can you give us some appreciation as far as you are 
able to do so off the cuff.  The profile of Eskom’s financial – Transnet – Telkom’s 
financial position?  Firstly what is its market cap? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  I think Telkom’s market cap would be 42/43 
billion. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What is its shareholding profile? 
20 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Currently the shareholding of profile of Telkom 
the government would own just below 40% and the Public Investment Corporation 
around 13% or so.  The rest is publicly listed free floating shares. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The chairperson of the commission has already received 
evidence that the chief executive of Telkom is Mr Sipho Maseka, can you confirm that? 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 13 of 115 
 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What is intriguing for me is that of all the state owned 
entities or public entities in which the state has shares there has not been any public 
revelation that Telkom was subjected to attempts of state capture. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Not that I am aware of. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Are you able to explain to us why not or why would that 
not be the case?  If you can of course. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Ja we- in 2012 a new board was reconstituted at 
Telkom.  I was asked to chair that board.  I also had the privilege to assemble that 
board and that board in March 2013 after a process of searching for the CEO we 
10 
appointed Sipho Masego a person that I have known much before and was a student at 
Wits.  I have known him when he was CEO of BP South Africa and he worked at 
Vodacom.  So I appointed SIpho in March 2013 or February 2013.  I must also say that 
when I joined the board on the 12 November 2012 the following hour after my 
appointment the then CEO announced her resignation and in the same vein told me 
that the then CFO was going to leave.  So at the time Telkom was faced with many, 
many issues ranging from some contracts that have gone bad in Nigeria.  Various 
issues with the competition commission.  The terrible relationship between the major 
shareholder and the board.  The share price of Telkom at the time I think was about 
R11.00 so we appointed Sipho 2013.  Sipho went on as it ought to be to put his own 
20 
executive team.  At the time we had about 23 or odd thousand employees.  The mobile 
business was bleeding R100 million every month. Ja the company was financially not in 
a bad – in a good state the government had at various times even considered selling it.  
I think when we arrived there was an offer from Korean Telecoms at the time to buy 
Telkom for R26,00 a share.  Where we at now Telkom’s mobile business has turned 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 14 of 115 
 
around, has become the mainstay.  Sustained, continued to sustain our fixed line 
business.  Telkom has played continues to play in provision of the infrastructure and 
indeed advancing itself into play into the ITC sector in its wider sense with a staff 
compliment of just under 10 000.  Telkom’s share price today would be maybe R63,00, 
it has seen a high of about R85,00.  As I left the Board Meeting yesterday at Telkom I 
left feeling that the world must judge but I think we have done well.  The company is in 
very good hands.  It is in a very good state.  It has got a strong Board.  It has got a 
strong executive leadership one that I am sure will stand against any in, in the world. 
So why I think the, the Board people, the Board members were committed were diligent 
were dedicated wanted to do nothing, but to salvage the company in the manner they 
10 
best know how, followed the law.  Being very robust in ensuring that they hold the 
executive to account and have allowed the executive the space and the authority to do 
what they were employed to do, being very clear and had good relationship with the 
shareholder that there was an understanding that we the Board will run the 
organisation, will employ the CEO, who will report to the Board and who will account to 
the shareholder.  Being very clear that the Board does not deal with customers.  The 
Board does not deal with suppliers.  The Board does not deal with employees.  The 
Board deals with shareholders and we have continued to report to the Board, sought its 
authority, never guesses out executive, executive but held him accountable.  Also told 
him that the one thing we are not going to have I will not be surprised as your 
20 
Chairman, you will always give me timeous, accurate and reliable information on the 
basis of which I will make decisions.  That is how we have worked with Telkom and 
thankfully we have gotten the support from the shareholder.  We have provided the 
shareholder, we have paid dividends, continue to pay dividends to the shareholder and 
Telkom continues to do what it is meant to do and it competes in the, in the, in the 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 15 of 115 
 
economic space. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well did you say that the staff complement now is about 10 000? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Yes, sir.  The staff complement is about 10 000, 
Deputy Chief Justice.  We over time have lost a, a number or our employees.  Not 
something that one is very proud and excited about, but at various stages there has 
had to be cause to be made on appropriately and right sizing the business to meet the 
challenges.  I can also confirm that that has been done within the law.  Done in as 
humane a manner as has been possible and continued to find pathways for those of 
our employees who for whatever the reason have either chosen to voluntarily separate 
with the company and where in those few and far between instances we had to, to act 
10 
on separation on the basis of the Section 189 of the Labour Relations Act, but ja it is 
[indistinct] purpose. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I thought that was quite interesting because I think when you, 
you said when you started as Chair the staff complement was about 23 000.  So, so, so 
it looks like you were able to reduce staff in accordance with I assume the requirements 
of the company and you say that all of that was done within the ambit of the law. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Indeed, indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Mr Maleka. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Can I just conclude the topic of 
Telkom by putting one more question to Mr Mabuza so that we are not left with an 
impression? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Inconsistent with public. 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 16 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Knowledge.  Mr Mabuza you would know that Telkom 
has had to face serious investigations by the Competition Commission arising from 
allegations of abuse of its dominant position in the so called Virtual Private Network 
space and can you tell the Chairman what the [indistinct] of that enquiry was? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  From memory here now you will pardon me 
Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  As Advocate Maleka says Telkom’s dominant 
position at the time seemed to have manifested in how it has dealt with competitors.  
10 
Telkom had its, as an example Telkom would have had its own business called Telkom 
Business that was in the space providing internet services, but also Telkom was 
wholesaling to other companies, other ISPs like your MWEB.  There were various 
accusations that Telkom the wholesaler was treating its own as in Telkom Retail 
differently from companies like MWEB as an example in pricing and indeed on routing 
traffic it would privatise its own and there were also other IT competitive areas for which 
Telkom has been found guilty relating to how it has really gone about in, in, in, in its 
pricing for the, their point of sale technology.  So to this Telkom was, has paid various 
fines.  Telkom has had to comply with certain prescripts from the Competition 
Commission with a certain period.  I can also confirm that Telkom is competing 
20 
competitively with its competitors out there today and when we went on to acquire 
Business Connexion at the time which is now BCX there were certain prescriptions that 
we got from the Competition Commission which we have honoured and served and 
they have all come to pass three years after we acquired the business. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And to be blunt about it Eskom was forced or compelled 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 17 of 115 
 
by the Competition Authorities to pay an accumulative fine in excess of a billion Rand in 
relation to the VPN enquiry.  Can you confirm that? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  I can confirm that. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  In relation to the BCX do you know whether there was 
any finding against Telkom and if so what happened in relation to payment of fines? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  No, in as far as BCX is concerned no and maybe 
a reference point Telkom would be about 100 years.  I think up until 2010 it is about 
eight years ago Telkom as a company has never had to sell anything.  Telkom sat and 
waited for people to place orders looking for Yellow Pages or, or telephone lines and 
they would get it to you as and when they want.  So over time that culture has changed 
10 
to an organisation that knows that consumers and customers owe you nothing.  They 
will vote on their Rand on the basis of the service, the quality and the value they get.  
So Telkom has had to compete, has had to win and to the question that speaks to why I 
would say there has been no incidences relating to our acquisition of BCX of an 
anti-competitive nature. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Chair we have explored more than it is enough the 
Telkom question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I would like to move to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, please do so before Mr Mabuza says I thought I was here for 
Eskom and not Telkom [laughing]. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Mr Mabuza let us get to that question unless there is 
any other aspect of your background you would like to deal with.  Now you indicate that 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 18 of 115 
 
you were appointed to the Board of Eskom in January 2018.  Correct? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can you just explain to the Chairperson how you were 
appointed? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  It might not seem obvious Chairman, but 
positions like this one never applies for.  I was on my way to divorce in my capacity as 
Chairman of Telkom where I serve on various bodies of the World Economic Forum 
related to the ITC space.  It was on 19 January, I think it was a Saturday or a Friday.  I 
got a call firstly from the DG of Finance to tell me I should expect a call from either the 
Deputy President or the Minister of Finance and/or the Minister of Public Enterprises.  
10 
Later that day I got a call from the Minister of Public Enterprises who was Minister 
Lynne Brown.  She was out at a meeting I think in Irene she said and she then on the 
phone said Mr Mabuza, I said Minister Brown.  She said oh did you expect this call?  I 
said no Lynne I have had your number since you were a Minister for Economic Affairs 
on the phone.  So I could see it is you calling.  So she then told me that she has come 
out of a meeting and that the Deputy President has asked her to convey that a decision 
has been to appoint me as Chairman of the Board.  They will be sending me a list of 
other names of people who between then and the next 48 hours would have been 
complete and congratulated me.  I said well, well I am not sure whether I should be 
congratulated.  Then she said oh, I hope you will accept because we have already 
20 
announced this.  So I said well Minister ja, delighted to accept.  I was sitting on the side 
lines as leader of business shouting about the need to, to change the leadership at 
Eskom.  I led a delegation of business to meet President Zuma to articulate this very 
sentiment amongst others that the entire Board of Eskom should be fired and the 
executives should be gotten rid of.  So it then became, it would have been incongruent 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 19 of 115 
 
of me to then say I do not want to serve.  So I then agreed.  Later on that evening I then 
got a call from the then Deputy President who then said congratulations.  I said Deputy 
President I will see you in divorce.  He said no, you are not going to divorce.  You come 
home.  I am going to divorce, because you are coming home.  So I then, the following 
day I got to know that Phakamani Hadebe was appointed as CEO as an Interim CEO.  I 
immediately at that point, because I have been an Executive Chairman of a company 
called Sphere Holdings which has been my investment company.  A company that I 
have put all my pension money from Tsogo Sun invested in the investment holding 
company.  This company is invested [intervenes]. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Sorry to interrupt you and to be rude.  We will get to 
10 
Sphere, your involvement in it. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And whatever concerns might arise from it.  We will get 
to that point.  For now I just want to establish some few issues arising from the process 
relating to your appointment.  I pick up from your evidence up to this point that your 
appointment was publically announced before you even had been approached or 
before you accepted.  Is that a fair reflection of that process? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  [Laughing] I, I, well maybe as I was being told it 
was being announced. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It is, it is a bit difficult to proceed around that answer.  
20 
Can I deal with it in terms of dates?  When did you get the call from then 
Minister Brown? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  I got the call from Minister Brown on 19 January. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  When to your knowledge and I know, but I would like to 
hear from you. 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 20 of 115 
 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Hm. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Was the appointment of a new Board including you 
publically announced in our country? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  On 22 January. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  On 22 January? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Right. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay.  I understand.  Now in relation to that process you 
would appreciate of course that your appointment as the head of the Board and of 
course the appointment of your colleagues who would serve on that Board reflects a 
serious office of responsibility and integrity.  Do you accept that? 
10 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  I, I do. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And in that regard there has to be some level of 
confidence that the processes relating to the appointment in that office are able to deal 
with questions of responsibility and integrity.  You accept that? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  I do yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Against that background of matters that are common 
course between you and me can you explain to the Chairperson whether there has 
been any [indistinct] investigation relating to your appointment about your prior 
business dealings with could or could not have an impact on ethics and possible 
conflict of interest in Eskom?  I can tell you this because the Chairman has taken 
20 
comfort from us that when we were appointed we had to go through scrutiny of some 
sort and thank God several offers have jumped ahead.  So I wander whether that type 
of scrutiny applies in relation to office bearers of a Board such as yourself. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Well our, our, I was not allowed to dwell too much 
in the Sphere point save to say I knew when I was appointed that I am Chairman, an 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 21 of 115 
 
Executive Chairman of a company that owns a company that maintains a third of 
Eskom’s boilers.  So I knew that.  So it was in the context that I was saying I was 
Chairman of Sphere which owns Babcock and Honeywell.  So I immediately phoned the 
Chief Executive of Sphere. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  And told him I have accepted this job and it has 
got implications for you, me, Babcock and Honeywell.  I hope you will appreciate that it 
has not been an easy acceptance given the task and the importance and the 
significance of Eskom.  So I have chosen to be part of that effort to bring the tide back 
so that all shops can float including ours.  Than to sit on the sand trying to push the 
10 
Sphere ship.  So if Sphere finally gets to float so be it, but this is what I have chosen.  
So tomorrow I will send you a letter resigning as Chairman and I will set in motion a 
process to talk to lawyers to find an appropriate way of dealing with the my investment 
in Sphere via a, a blind trust.  Okay, agreed can you then wait for the announcement 
and then on the basis of that when I then got sent the letter of appointment on that 
Sunday attaching a number for me to contact the Minister’s office to complete the 
various forms, probity forms.  Something that I had expected.  Something I was not 
concerned about.  In the work I have done as Chief Executive of Tsogo Sun I have had 
to subject myself to probity every year and I have understood that.  I have also 
understood that coming to a Board with the background that it had it was important that 
20 
one submits oneself to that.  I would not have known whether the people who appointed 
me have in fact done that.  So for my part I was going to make sure that I declared to 
the extent I should, eliminate, manage and avoid any conflict going forward.  So when I 
finally go to that form I completed the form which asks me about who I am, what I am 
doing, what other companies I am involved in, do I know anybody that is involved in 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 22 of 115 
 
something else that there could be a customer or provider to, to Eskom which I have 
declared that I do have those relations and indeed the Sphere relationship in particular 
and this is how I sought to address this.  Now there has been something that there has 
been a bit maybe not unusual, but something that I am not accustomed to.  That you 
get a letter that says you are appointed.  You are one of 13 people.  All of you are the 
team.  You are the captain.  I am not used to that.  I am used to a situation that a 
shareholder or whoever appoints a Board and most of the time at least that which I am 
used to the Chairman becomes very much part of the decision and determination of the 
other members who come onto the Board, but here it was a bit unusual, but it was also 
not in my place.  I had to… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or based, based on the point you are making that what you are used 
to is where the Chairperson will have had an input? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In who else become. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Members, ja, but you say here it happened differently? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  It did.  It had a different. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  And here it also was I think eight of the members 
were being appointed then.  The other four were members that were, were coming from 
20 
the previous Board.  Without casting any aspersions about these particular members 
the Chairman would appreciate that it also started to create a certain problematic 
dynamic in my own head that now when do you start to be the right or you are to be the 
wrong member of the passport.  So it did create that problem, but be that as it may I am 
not aware of any other probity that was done by other people, on other people.  I know 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 23 of 115 
 
of what was done to me and I submitted myself to that and the Minister told me when I 
finally gave her my form she indicated that wow this is the first time I have had a 
Member of the Board of Eskom disclosing and declaring this amount of the external 
involvement.  The only time I have had to know of a conflict is when I sit in Parliament, 
get asked by the opposition about the conflicted member of a Board of a Public 
Enterprise I have led.  So then that is that is that is. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  All I know about the; that probity process 
[intervenes]. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We will get to the issue of your colleague whose probity 
10 
was raised in Parliament, but can I ask you to go to a bundle of documents which is 
marked EXHIBIT U5.  Chair that is the [indistinct] file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You will see the last of the index described document is 
Director’s Declaration of Interest. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  [Intervenes]. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Which is C1? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It begins with page 140 of that bundle. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Ja, I am on it. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It may rise questions of confidentiality, but if it does you 
will guide us.  It is a Director’s Declaration of Interest Manual Form on the, well I, I 
nearly said the letterhead, but on a document which has Eskom’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Emblem or logo. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Logo. 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 24 of 115 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Logo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [Laughing]. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Do you know that document? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Yes, yes I do. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What is it? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  This is my Director’s Declaration of Interest and 
Advocate Maleka there is nothing here that is confidential.  It is a public document now, 
but if to the extent there is something that is confidential one of the things I had to 
accept in taking this job at Eskom as I have gotten to appreciate it more was that I was 
going to gain very little out of this, but I was certain I was going to lose something.  
10 
What I was not sure of what I was going to lose is any and everything between my 
privacy and my life and I am okay with it.  So there is nothing here that, I no longer 
have any privacy having accepted the Chairmanship of Eskom and I am cool with it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  I am grateful for that and there may well come a 
time when that issue arises, but for now I see that the date on that document that is 
page 140 is a revision date of July2018.  From your recollection when did you complete 
this declaration? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  This declaration was completed initially around 
the 26th or so of January 2018. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay.  I will get [intervenes]. 
20 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  But periodically as it is required by the Act, 
Companies Act and it is practice is that as and when there are changes in my interests, 
in my Directorships and these have been happening quite often as I near the end of my 
working life I have had to update my interests. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The declaration in that document relating to Sphere 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 25 of 115 
 
appears on page 142 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And I would like to just take you through some of the 
elementary aspects of it.  The first is if you at page 142 the date of resignation as the 
Executive Chairperson I assume that you were the Executive Chairperson of Sphere? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  When did you resign? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  I resigned on the 23rd, excuse me, of January. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  That would have been approximately five days after your 
appointment? 
10 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  I was notified of my appointment yes around the 
19th, but I was appointed on the 22nd.  I communicated my resignation on Tuesday the 
23rd. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The next line item is the extent of your shareholding in 
Sphere. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  There is both the percentage and the Rand value.  I am 
not going to ask you to deal with it.  It is up to you of course given the ethical corporate 
approach you take between privacy and public office, but the key question is you are 
saying you have instructed lawyers to put that shareholding in a blind trust.  Can I ask 
20 
you when did you do so and when, if at all, was a blind trust established to house this 
shareholding? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Firstly, yes I bought 6 percent of Sphere for R26 
million which I paid for from my after tax money.  I resigned on 23 January.  Once I was 
back in the country I then enlisted the services of that particular department in Standard 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 26 of 115 
 
Bank.  I had actually had my office at Sphere.  I had actually been paid a certain 
stipend at Sphere and I have never been to Sphere since that day.  I have never been 
receiving any information about what is happening in the business at Sphere either 
than the last time I received a dividend.  I have had no course to ask a dividend of what 
relative to what should it have been.  I have left the matter with the Standard Bank Trust 
office in (indistinct) it’s taken a lot longer to finally settle on what type of a structure but I 
have continued to be pliant to that investment myself whilst this structure is being 
processed. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And as a blind trust you don’t control it, do you? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  The trust itself? 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The blind trust, do you or don’t you control it? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  I don’t know, I’m blind to it, seriously Advocate 
Maleka it’s – I’ve only been kept in the know of what is happening about the 
establishment and the formation of the trust, I have not been involved in what the trust 
holding in Sphere has been doing, that’s the pliantness I was personally referring to. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, Chair unless you want some explanation around 
the blind trust I will move on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that’s fine, thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Right.  Mr Mabuza we have established some few facts 
around the process relating to your appointment and the way you have dealt with what 
20 
could have manifested some conflicts of interest.  I would like now to move to your 
statement, and we will get to the background around how this statement got to be given 
to the Commission, but first of all can I confirm that you have had an occasion to read 
this statement before you took the witness box this morning. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Yes I did. 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 27 of 115 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  If you go to U1, which starts with your statement you will 
see that at the top right hand corner there is a numbering which starts with JM and 
thereafter follows the sequence of numbers beginning from 001, do you see that? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Jip. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Please go to 42 of that document. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  JM42? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, you will see that there’s a signature, can you 
confirm that that is the signature? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Yes, that is the signature and I confirm it is my 
signature. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You will also see that there is the signature of someone 
who is a Commissioner of Oaths, do you see that? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Yes I see that is the Commissioner of Oaths in 
front of whom I took this oath when I was signing this statement. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, do you confirm that you are comfortable with the 
contents of this statement, is there any aspect of it that you wish to change or clarify 
before we get to its contents? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  No, I am comfortable with the statement, I don’t 
need to change or clarify anything I do – I would love to for the sake of completion 
Chairman if we can go back to that – my declaration for the sake of completion. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  On page 144 of that document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is U5. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  That’s correct.  One of these if I – one of the two 
questions that this form asks is to declare interest held by persons related and inter-
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 28 of 115 
 
related to you or other associates interest in Eskom Holdings, Eskom subsidiaries, 
Eskom Holdings suppliers, Eskom subsidiary suppliers and/or any other entities dealing 
with the Eskom Group for example if you have an interest in company Y and company 
Y has got interest in company Z and company Z deals with Eskom then you need to 
declare that interest in company Y as well as the details in company Z. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  For the sake of completion I am related to my 
wife by marriage, my wife is related biologically to her siblings, one of which is 
Thembelana, who is in mining, a young man that I was very much part of raising and 
sending to school so I did know he was in mining.  He is invested in Mlwazi and prior to 
10 
this his family, the Langa family and the Mabuza family sought to create a joint venture 
in mining.  The Mabuza interest represented by son Lwazi.  So it was important that I 
disclosed this at the time, so I just thought for the sake of completion as a matter of fact 
I don’t sit in meetings at Eskom that deals with coal for this very point, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  So I am back to you Advocate. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes thank you, Chair it’s important to give you an 
interesting background on how this statement was obtained, because Mr Mabuza talks 
to that issue and it’s vital for you to appreciate how the legal team obtained this 
statement.  Mr Mabuza I’m at JAM001, in paragraph 2, are you there? 
20 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Yes I am. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And there you see in providing a response to the 
Commission Eskom has placed its personnel and resources fully at the disposal of the 
Commission.  In this regard the Commission has interviewed various personnel from 
Eskom and has received statements from those personnel.  You are aware that before 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 29 of 115 
 
Eskom plays its resources and personnel at the disposal of the Commission there was 
a set of questions that the Commission posed to Eskom and invited them to deal with 
them, correct.  Can I ask you to go to Annex A of your statement which begins at page 
47.  It’s on the same file. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Annex A page 47, these are the various 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, are you looking at U1? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  U1 thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Ja, got it. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Please go to page 47. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Annexure A yes I’m there. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Then if you turn to the contents of Annexure A you will 
see that they begin from page 48. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What is that document? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  This document is on A is Tegeta Contracts and 
Acquisition of Optimum Coal Mines by Tegeta, B is TNA which is for the New Age Media 
and then it – this particular page is on Tegeta Contracts and Acquisition of OCM by 
Tegeta. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You will see that the document is divided into various 
columns, the first one is area, we will get to that, and the second column relates to 
issues to consider in the Eskom submission, do you see that?  On page 48. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  On page 48 yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And then the last column is possible Eskom witnesses, 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 30 of 115 
 
do you see that? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Now you will see that the first area that the Commission 
was concerned with related to an understanding of who Tegeta is, do you see that? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:   I can see that. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And then you are given a list of specific questions which 
Eskom was invited to deal with, and the response of Eskom is that a witness who would 
deal with those things is Mr Dan Mashigo. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  That is correct yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair I can confirm that we do have a statement from Mr 
10 
Mashigo who would deal with that question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And the same scheme goes on in page 49, are you 
there? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Yes correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can you confirm that Eskom did indicate who would deal 
with the question of the initial appointment of Brakfontein? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Yes, Dan Mashigo and Kiren Maharaj. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, and then we go on in relation to penalties which we 
will find on page 50, you will see that the Commission raised specific questions from 
20 
5.1 to 5.9, 9 you will get it over the page but Eskom did suggest witnesses who would 
deal with those questions, do you see that? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And they’re given and again Chair I can confirm that we 
do have statements from those witnesses. 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 31 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And so it goes on, and on page 53 you will see that 
there is number 10 which deals with the 1.6billion prepayment or guarantee, do you see 
that? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Again some questions are raised and a witness is 
offered. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Yes, Mr Hal Magar. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Magar and so it goes on, on page 11, sorry page 54 
paragraph 11, Mr Andre Pillay. 
10 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Yes, Mr Andre Pillay who is the Head of Treasury 
at Eskom. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Ja, all of those witnesses have given statements and 
Chair they will testify in regard to those topics, and this is the background on how your 
submission in terms of this statement got to be made, correct? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, now you say on page U12, that is paragraph 2 on 
page 2 of Exhibit U1: 
“In addition Eskom is providing a flash disk with information to the 
Commission that is relevant to matters specifically addressed in this 
20 
submission and is listed as Annexure C.” 
Do you see that? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Yes correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair for your guidance Annexure C is at page 62 to 
page 66. 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 32 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Mr Mabuza I am not going to take you through those 
documents, I can confirm that the Commission has received them and some of them 
the Commission has processed for the purposes of your evidence, correct? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Then before we take the tea adjournment can I also 
draw the attention of the Chair that part and parcel of the information that the 
Commissioner, that Eskom gave to us was through an index which is marked B, and 
your reference it’s right at the top of the second page of your statement. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Correct.  
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And then Exhibit B Chair you will find it at page 58 and 
it’s a document which I would like to take you to, because it raises several questions of 
importance that are not dealt with in your statement.  If you go to page 58 you will see 
Chair that there is Exhibit B and you will see that the heading is Index to Documents 
previously submitted to the Commission by Eskom’s legal team on the 15 th of January 
2019, do you see that? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair this is I suppose an opportune moment to break 
for tea, but when we come back I would like to deal with some of the documents 
reflected on that index. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON: Ja no that’s fine, we will take the tea adjournment and we will resume 
at half past eleven.  The Commission adjourns. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Maleka. 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 33 of 115 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair in the next round of the presentation we are going 
to deal with the reports via a document we have prepared called the Gap Analysis on 
Eskom.  I believe that a copy of that document has been presented to you 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I have got it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I will ask Mr Jac Swarts to present and illuminate some 
of those lines on the monitors so that those concerned may see precisely what our 
analysis in terms of the slides is.  And so Chair as I was saying the analysis begins with 
a presentation of the reports to you and we are grateful to our learned friends Ms 
Norman and Mr Mokoena because they are the ones who took the effort of asking the 
investigators to source and produce and also compile these reports in a format and 
10 
form that is readily accessible and under-stanchion that the files before you have been 
marked on the spine through volumes for easy identification and that in due course 
your files will be marked with a clear descriptive indicator on the spine precisely what 
the contents are. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that will be very helpful ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I have been assured by Ms Norman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  That by resumption of the proceedings after lunch today 
they will be in the form that you had indicated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine, that is fine. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So Chair just before I start with the gap analysis in 
terms of the slides I would like to take you to a report which is in Volume 6.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And if the first page of Volume 6 you will see it is again 
an index and file number 16. 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 34 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Is the report on an enquiry conducted by the National 
Energy Regulator of South Africa NERSA relating to the load shedding and electricity 
supply shortage which occurred on the 12 May 2008.  We take you to this report as a 
starting point not only because of what NERSA did but the repeat of what is happening 
in relation to Eskom regarding load shedding activities.  This report recalls for the first 
time as far as we are aware and we confess our knowledge may be limited that a 
regulator in our country decided to conduct a statutory enquiry in terms of Section 4.2B 
of the Electricity Regular Act relating to the activities of a licensee such as Eskom 
relating to questions of load shedding that had fundamental consequences for the 
10 
country and which raised serious national concerns.  We are not aware of any other 
enquiry which NERSA may have undertaking arising from the repeat of the difficult 
experiences suffered by Eskom in terms of the supply of electricity.  We take you to this 
report for now Chair because when the Chairperson of Eskom testifies we will raise 
issues around questions of load shedding and hopefully he will indicate to you how 
Eskom is busy dealing with those difficult questions.  But the key question which we 
would really ask you to consider for the purposes of the commission is what are the 
other options consumers such as you and I have when these things happen or it is a 
normal consequence that we have to live with as consumers in the face of the powers 
conferred upon the regulator to consider those aspects?  So Chair when – you will see 
20 
that the report begin at page 1976 and there is a table of contents on 1977.  I ask you 
to go to the introductory portion of the report at page 1978 and I ask you to read with 
me the second paragraph from the top.  “In the light of the above the energy regulator 
decided that an enquiry be conducted in terms of Section 4(B)II and 4(B)IV I can ask 
you to strike out that section because I have looked at the Electricity Regulation Act 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 35 of 115 
 
there is no Section of that sort in that Act.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the roman figure that is not there or the whole? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The roman figure IV as far as I am aware the latest 
version of that Act. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Ends with roman figure III. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and it was not there and has since been repealed a bit later or 
something? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  No I have also looked at the previous version of the 
amendment I could not find it but I confess that you know in these sorts of things one is 
10 
wrong.  I can assure you the latest version does not have roman figure IV. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hence for the sake of completeness if you have not had enough time 
somebody can just check whether as at 2008. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was – it was not there. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Into the national electricity – roman figure II of the 
Electricity Regulation Act 4.02.06 into the National Electricity supply shortage and the 
subsequent load shedding by Eskom and other licensees during the period 1 November 
2007 to 31 January 2008.  I ask you to note that the relevant period covered by 
NERSA’s investigation was for more or less a period of a month or slightly more.  But it 
20 
is for that period that NERSA decided that it was going to engage into load shedding 
because of the consequences of it.  And then Chair you will see that in… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that not two months, November to 31 January? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Ja it is about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or actually three? 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 36 of 115 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Well three months. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Three months ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Three months effectively yes.  You are correct it is three 
months.  The purpose of this enquiry is to inform the energy regulator of the reasons for 
the current electricity supply shortage resulting in the national load shedding of the 
electricity and recommended measures to be adopted to mitigate against the electricity 
supply shortage and to reduce the adverse impacts thereof.  The scope of the enquiry 
focuses specifically on events in the period 1 November 2007 to 31 November 2008 
and yes my notes indicate that that is a period of 3 months. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To 31 January I think you said November. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  31 January – 1 November 2007 to 31 January 2008 and 
that is the period of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Paragraph 2 talks about the methodology of the 
investigation.  I am not going to ask you to consider it.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Paragraph 3 gives you some background about Eskom 
and it is a background that I will develop when I ask you to consider the Denton 
Reports but at that stage it was quite clear according to NERSA the regulator that 
Eskom was controlling 92% of the generation of electricity in our country.  And then 
20 
Chair the next part of the report which is important is at page 1981 paragraph 4.  Load 
shedding was experienced during the months of November 2007 to January 2008 the 
high number of load shedding incidents in January attracted national attention.  There 
were five load shedding incidents in November and four in December arising mainly out 
of generation capacity shortages.  In January fourteen incidents occurred due to both 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 37 of 115 
 
energy and capacity constraints.  The high frequency of load shedding in January was 
related to the increasing demand about 3000 megawatts after the December holiday 
period and an increase in the unplanned outage raid as shown in figure 1.  And then 
Chair I skip the rest and ask you to go to paragraph 5.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Measures of an adequate and secure power supply is 
the ability to continuously balance supply of power that is generation and demand for 
power load.  The balance is maintained by controlling the frequency to 50 Herts.  If 
demand exceeds generation the system slows down and the national – and the Eskom 
national control centre instructs power stations to increase generation from available 
10 
plant.  Where there is no more available plant the system will slow down and eventually 
collapse unless the load is reduced.  Chair that gives you some kind of a non-technical 
explanation around how load shedding happens.  Even I as an un-engineer I am able to 
follow the relationship between the demand for electricity and the supply of it and how 
ultimately if there is an imbalance between the two the system if not properly managed 
would give rise to the national collapse and a national blackout.  And Chair I ask you to 
go to page 1982.  Just before the figure 1 there is a paragraph which gives you the 
indication of what was the extent of load shedding.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It is the second number paragraph. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The November and December incidents were mainly 
caused by inadequate generating capacity resulting mainly from generator trips.  The 
more severe load shedding incident of up to 4000 megawatt occurred on numerous 
occasions seventeen days in January as a result of both capacity and energy 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 38 of 115 
 
shortages.  The extent of the capacity and energy constraints and the applicable  
reasons are discussed later in the report.  Then they give them to you Chair in that 
figure beginning from 13 November cutting across through the Y axis up to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is figure 1 with. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The bar charts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you will see that the bar charts are again in all 
these diagrammatic expressions of the horizontal line and the vertical line which we 
10 
were told that the one represents the X axis the other represents the Y axis.  The 
horizontal line gives you the degree of load shedding from the date 13 November 2007 
it goes across to January 31 09.  And then as we look at the vertical line you will see 
the amount of megawatts of electricity that were shed during each month.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you will see that the peak of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see – I see that the – the last vertical line relates to 31 January 
2009. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the one immediately before that in 30 January 2008? 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It should be 30 January 2008. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The last one? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes because that is the period of investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Conducted by NERSA. 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 39 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes I thought so too. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So you are quite correct I think it is 2008. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Thank you.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And Chair for the purposes of completing our attention 
to this figure we merely point out that the peak period of sharing of 4000 megawatts of 
electricity occurred on 24 January 2008 this is where we find 4000 megawatts of 
electricity shared on one day.  The rest is a variation from 1000 up to 3000 but we 
would ask you to note that the worst form of load shedding occurred on 24 January 
2008 and that is when… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I can see that in terms of those vertical bars that is correct but 
10 
I thought you said 4000 it appears to me to be close to 7000, am I – do I misunderstand 
something in this? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  No, no I think the load shedding if you look at it is 
darkness – it a dark. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It is the darkest shaded because if you look at the 
legion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Just below the heading Correlation Between Load 
Shedding and Unplanned Outages. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The darker one is load loss. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Okay so it was just under 4000? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 40 of 115 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Well the report suggest that it is 4000. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe it is 4000. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the red line goes up to 4000, the darker line is just below the 
line for 4000. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And Chair the next is once you have the appreciation of 
what NERSA’s investigation reveals.  The next important question which NERSA had to 
engage with is at page 1985.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  At the top the economic impact of load shedding events 
is not readily available however for generation capacity planning purposes the costs of 
not supplying electricity is deemed to be R75.00 per kilowatts of electricity.  This implies 
that the load shedding in the period cost the South African economy approximately R50 
billion.  There is NERSA’s estimation without reference to scientific research but simply 
an indication of what happened or what happens when the country suffers 
consequences of load shedding and the cost to the economy.  We would like to develop 
that issue later on as soon as we get to the issues relating to Eskom and hopefully 
those who have information will help us in that regard.  Chair I leave the rest and go to 
20 
the findings and recommendations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And that you will find – it is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well there is reference to recommendations on the same page but I 
do not know if that [indistinct]. 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 41 of 115 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  No it is not that one.  It is at page 2015.  I am not going 
to read them to you I merely want you to note where they are to be found. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And then the recommendations follow at page 2017.  
And the sum total of it was a request by NERSA that Eskom should do certain things to 
prioritise corrective measures so as to avoid these consequences.  And some of them 
were directed at specific departments of Eskom like Primary Air Energy.  For instance if 
you go to page 2017 the further investigation and the recommendation reads as 
follows:  “Primary Energy Procurement and management and in particular Coal 
management in Eskom the availability, adequacy and optimum utilisation of Eskom’s 
10 
generation plant in emergency and in view of the midlife of these plants.  These are 
critical areas of operation that affects Eskom which the regulator recommended that 
they should be looked at in order to take corrective measures.”  We will get to the 
Dentons Report because it comes almost seven years after this recommendation by 
NERSA and it raises numbers of questions relating to the operations of Eskom and it 
makes findings at the request of Eskom and present them before Eskom with a view to 
take corrective action.  What follows thereafter is no longer the implementation of the 
observations made by Denton but something else and it is that something else which 
we submit begins to provide a clear indication of the state capture projects.  So that is 
why we started here.  That this report is important in sequence in order to show you 
20 
that questions of load shedding were not new as and when they repeated themselves in 
2015 and as and when they still occur this year.  We have always been on Eskom’s 
radar NERSA’s a regulator it inquired into the reasons, it got the reasons and NERSA 
made recommendations and yet the problems still occur. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well one will hear all the evidence and look at all the reports but it 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 42 of 115 
 
certainly is a matter of concern that when load shedding happened and to go and add 
my recollection is that the executive admitted that it had been warned. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About if I recall correctly eight years earlier. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By the management at Eskom that if certain things were not done 
that is what was going to happen and from my recollection there was an admission that 
not much was done and load shedding happened. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then it is more worrying that notwithstanding that lesson it 
10 
happened again was it 2015 and it is happening again in 2019 and with even more 
intensity and seriousness.  So ja okay alright. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair if it is necessary we will consider that issue and 
seek to present clear undisputed evidence about what happened when that warning 
came to the fore and what happened thereafter.  But anecdotally you are correct.  
There was a clear warning given to the executive authorities of our country at the time 
that they should not luxuriate in the surplus capacity that they found in Eskom when 
they took office.  Because it – let us be clear Eskom has always had capacity which 
was surplus to its requirement and it was for that reason that it extended all sorts of 
benefits to the major consumers of electricity such as the mining industry to procure 
20 
electricity as subsidised rates.  I hope they do not kill me but it was at that level but 
things changed when our country after democracy decided to put Eskom where it ought 
to have been by making sure that each and every household is electrified at reasonable 
costs.  It is at that point in time when the strategic shift of Eskom occurred that what 
was surplus capacity became capacity constraints and at that point the executive was 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 43 of 115 
 
warned and nothing was done.  So Chair to now get back to the gap analysis may I ask 
you to go to page 2 of the slides.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it is – we will hear – we will look at the Denton Report – Dentons 
Report and we will look – hear the witnesses.  One hopes that people who were 
supposed to be taking measures in line with the recommendations of the NERSA report 
and the Denton report were not doing other things when they were supposed to be 
doing that.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, yes.  Chair I am tempted to go to the Dentons 
Report in order to address your concern but I am not too sure whether I should do it 
now or leave it later. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am happy that you do it later. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Oh is Mr Mokoena tempting you? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Can I ask you to go to Volume 2? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you.  Yes I am there. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair we… 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I see Mr Mokoena tempted you successfully.  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I hope it is not a poison pass from him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair you will see that on page 356 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Is the report by Denton dated 2 July 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ys. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The date is important and I would ask you to mark it 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 44 of 115 
 
because at some point the investigators gave us the executive summary of the draft 
preliminary report which is from Dentons on the face of it but it is marked a different 
date which is 5 July 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You do not have it yet.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And we will make it available to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But it raises fundamental concerns around the dates of 
these reports and had happened because there is anecdotal evidence that this report 
10 
became – it mysteriously disappeared. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It would be the latter one.  The latter of the two? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The draft… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh the draft executive summary. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It became what? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We could not get it.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  There was difficulty in sourcing it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes I think some members of Parliament when they ask 
20 
questions in the inquiry they wanted to find the whereabouts of this report and nothing 
by way of a satisfactory explanation was given and for that reason we as the 
investigators make sure that the commission has it and Eskom kindly produced it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But in these versions that we now have. 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 45 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I have asked you to mark the date of 2 July and you will 
see at page 357 going to 359 it is the table of contents.  It is a long report I am not 
going to take you through it I will try as best I can to take you through the key features 
of it.  At page 360 there is an introduction of how Denton got involved.  Paragraph 1.1 
this document constitutes the report of Dentons South Africa in respect of the 
investigation commissioned by Eskom Limited pursuant to a request for proposal 
issued on 8 April 2015 under number – in terms of a resolution adopted by the board or 
directors of Eskom on 11 March 2015.  So that there is no doubt that this investigation 
was commissioned by the haste decision making body in Eskom and that is the board.  
10 
1.2 the investigation commenced on 20 April 2015 a draft report was required to have 
been provided on 20 July 2015 with the final report to follow 31 July 2015.  May I stop 
here and make the following observations?  You will see that the time lines in terms of 
the board’s expectation was that the investigation should immediately commence and it 
should produce a draft report on 20 July and the final report should be presented at 1 
July 2015.  What you have and what we have managed to obtain and we would like to 
confirm with Eskom is why do we not have the final report?  At best we have the draft 
report.  What happened to this mandate of Denton and that is a key feature because as 
a state body having obligations of accountability you follow through the decisions you 
make. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Assume the report would still be tabled to the, before the Board and 
deliberated upon in due course.  I would imagine you would be seeking to ensure that 
or not? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Mr Chairman the, the report if we can just stick to 
that, the report as is. 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 46 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes the actual report, ja. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  That would be submitted.  It would be served. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  To the Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  This will not be the first time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  We deal with elements of what is in that report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  The Matshela Koko matter as an example his 
10 
disciplinary proceedings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Amongst the charges that he was served with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Deals with his amongst others these issues of his 
very contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  And it is now a matter of course that he had since 
resigned barely hours before we had the hearing and there are processes then that 
flows from there.  So most of his disciplinary hearings somewhere somehow are 
20 
relating to the contents of this report.  So I just wanted to say the. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Report as a document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  To formally say report so annexure this. 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 47 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Is served to the Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  That will, will happen but elements of it we have 
been dealing with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And, and dealing with it not as a result of the report but on your own 
in the light of the issues that you thought needed to be dealt with? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  And it happens to coincide with those. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  The remedial actions. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Amongst others that are called for by the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Mr Mabuza just to be fair to you and make sure that 
your evidence on this score is coherent and complete.  You did reflect on some of these 
questions before you came to testify, because I see that the bundle you gave us this 
morning deals with your response to it.  If I may guide you where you will find it and I 
confess I have not read this bundle fully, but when I. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it U5? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It is U5. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  U5, yes.  Well evident led I think we have got to read it like this.  
Maybe you, when you refer to any page make eye contact with Mr Mabuza to see if he 
is able to find so that he is not, he is not able to find.  You can indicate if somebody 
needs to assist.  I do not like a situation where anybody just stands up from the 
audience and goes to the witness while witness is giving evidence. 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 48 of 115 
 
UNKNOWN PERSON:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So let us do it that way, ja.  Okay.  Mr Mabuza you do have U5 now 
that that, that file marked U5? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Yes, I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  What page Mr Maleka you wanted to…? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair I asked Mr Mabuza to go to page 114. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And, and maybe before he does we, we just need to make sure if it, if 
nobody has made sure that Mr Mabuza is aware of which file among the various files 
on his table is U1, U2 or whatever it is marked.  So that he might be able to find them 
without assistance. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He just needs to know which one is marked what. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And where it is marked. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Mr Mabuza you will see that there are lots of files on 
your table, but U5 is a small bundle blue covered file which is from Bowman Attorneys 
and on the face of it, it is marked U5.  Are you, are you there? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Ja, got it. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and then your statement is in U1.  I think you now 
know how to find it. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  I have got my statement.  I am the one who is 
moving it.  Clearly I dropped out of law school too soon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [Laughing]. 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 49 of 115 
 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  I moved this from one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  To the one that I am working on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  The, the lever arch file which contains your statement is the; 
that lever arch file  
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Is U1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We refer to it as U1. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  U1.  I see there, there are two or three other files.  I do not know 
whether Mr Maleka you want to deal with them now or later. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  No not, not now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Not now.  Can I ask you to put aside the rest of the files 
away from you so that you make space for yourself? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  So we are closing 1764? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, we close Volume 6, 1764. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  You now have before you U5? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And we are trying to cohere your response in line with 
20 
that you have provided in writing.  If you go to page 114. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  I am on page 114. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You will see in the middle of the page you deal with 
Report 11 in gap analysis and that is the report we have dealt with? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Correct. 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 50 of 115 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you have provided these responses? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can I confirm purely as a matter of evidence that these 
are the responses you have carefully formulated and have presented before the 
Commission [intervenes]? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Correct. 
[Background noise] 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is not you Mr Maleka and it is not Mr Mabuza. 
[Laughing] 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair any blind sounds coming from all over are difficult 
10 
to deal with.  I am not going to take you through each and every one of them unless 
you prefer to do so.  I am merely going to confirm with you that you stand by those 
responses as an accurate reflection of your answer to the Commission’s request.  
Correct? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Correct, I confirm. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And there is no, any aspect of the response that you 
would wish to highlight for now?  I raise this issue with you because I have not had 
enough time to carefully consider those responses. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Ja, I think in broad, in broad terms Chairman 
these responses do by and large address the bulk of the four buckets I referred to of 
20 
what was being raised.  It may go into rather more detail on breaking down the 5.5 
billion amount of penalties as to what is it that was pre, what is it that was post.  At the 
end it might go further to, to break down on the, the, the issues for instance where the 
accounting authority recognises payments made to Tegeta and Brakfontein Extension 
as I have been extended as irregular explain.  We do explain how that amount of 30.4 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 51 of 115 
 
billion, 27, 37 million, 22 and 30 million have been got.  So either than that suffice to 
say these have been dealt with as I indicated either in our disciplinary processes or 
they are being pursued on a criminal level or they will be followed on, on, on, on civil, 
on civil claims. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Thank you Mr Mabuza.  So if you go back to the 
file containing your statement U1. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you go to page 59. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Yes, I am on page 59. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You will find, Chair we are at page 59 of EXHIBIT U1. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not yet.  You see some of the annexures, you see most it seems of 
the pages are paginated on the right hand corner. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But on some annexures the pagination is on the left hand corner 
which is a little bit obscure. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I am there now. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Ja, I think it is a question of the profile of the document.  
Some of them are presented in landscape format. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Which you are then going to find the paginated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Pagination elsewhere than on the right hand corner. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no, no.  It is, it is, it is okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Again Chair we are trying to do a gap analysis of 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 52 of 115 
 
what is lacking from previous reports, what has emerged and how we think the 
Commission should close the gap. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Mr Mabuza remember we were looking at this document 
in the context of information that you through the legal team of Eskom produced for us.  
The next information that you produced for us which is not dealt with in detail in your 
statement is the guarantee that is referred to in Item 220 on page 59.  Do you see that? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Ja, correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The story of that guarantee will be told in due course.  I 
have taken you through the list of questions and answers which indicate who from 
10 
Eskom’s side will tell that story, but for now and for the purposes of closing the gap as 
far as your Board is concerned you are aware of that guarantee as the Board? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And I suppose you are aware that, let me not ask you a 
leading question.  What is the status of that guarantee?  Do you know what is 
happening about it? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  We; the, the guarantee clearly lapsed long before 
we got in office, but we are aware about the circumstances behind that guarantee.  We 
remain curious about how does a supposed recipient of coal gives guarantee to a 
supplier.  That is the one part.  So we also got access to material and information that 
20 
speaks to; that comes out of the various hearings and disciplinary hearings that outside 
of here we, as an, I can join dots where the guarantee expires and where a prepayment 
kicks in and, and we can surmise as to why, but we remain curious. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Well one of the points that I would like you to deal 
with as the new Board relating to that guarantee is this and it arises from a public 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 53 of 115 
 
explanation that Eskom has not suffered any loss because the guarantee was not used 
nor drawdown’s were made from it by the time it had expired.  Those are some of the 
publically made explanations in relation to that guarantee.  What I want to understand 
from you is has Eskom interrogated firstly whether or not it was required to pay a 
guarantee fee to the bank that maintained that guarantee on behalf or, or for the benefit 
of Tegeta? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  As I indicated I do not think this Board would 
have agreed to provide a guarantee to a supplier.  I also do know that a previous Board 
did authorise that this guarantee be done.  So I can only say I do not know what was in 
that Board’s head to do that.  I would not.  I also think it is, it is incorrect to say Eskom 
10 
has not suffered because the guarantee did lapse.  Eskom has definitely suffered 
reputation at least from the very curiosity that arises from providing a guarantee to a 
supplier, because this was a guarantee by Eskom to a bank.  A bank that Eskom was to 
continue to do business with.  This guarantee was to be flashed to seller ostensibly 
arguing that this supplier using this guarantee now has got away with all financially who 
can acquire whatever the seller was selling.  When the guarantee expired the bank 
would not want to renew the guarantee because matters in the public domain were 
suggesting that there was something improper about the beneficiary of this guarantee 
or otherwise.  So Eskom yes did suffer financially if, if nothing else the amount of 
guarantee fees totally to just around 650 000 or so that it had to pay per quarter to, 
20 
whilst the guarantee was still in place. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Who would have to pay that amount? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Eskom, because Eskom took a decision that we 
are not going to give 1.6 billion to the supplier, but we are prepared to provide the 
supplier with a guarantee.  We are going to get the guarantee from the bank.  The bank 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 54 of 115 
 
gives you the guarantee against a fee which is either payable monthly, yearly or 
quarterly in this case.  The fee that was paid as at the time when this guarantee expired 
was about, about 650 000 give or take. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay.  Thank you for that information.  There appear 
implications arising from your evidence especially the question of the guarantee fee, 
because if Eskom paid that amount then Eskom must have suffered some financial loss 
as a result of paying. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Indeed. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I am not suggesting that would have been lawful of 
unlawful, but if the guarantee itself was not authorised under the legal prescripts then 
10 
that fee itself would not have been lawful and there would be question marks around it.  
From your perspective who in Eskom will be able to give us the finer details of the 
amount of the fees that Eskom paid? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  We will get this from the Financial Community at, 
at, at Eskom. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you Mr Mabuza.  Chair those are the two critical 
issues which we have identified from the index Mr Mabuza gave us, but which were not 
dealt with in his statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And we believe that we have now close the gaps on 
20 
those two issues.  The rest of the issues arise from his statement.  So with your leave I 
will go back to the statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Very well.  You may proceed. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Mr Mabuza [coughing], I am sorry.  All of the discussions 
that we have had so far takes us now to page 3 of your statement and I am looking at 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 55 of 115 
 
page 10, still at paragraph 10 on page 3 and I think you can confirm in regards to that 
paragraph that the 20th is the key date. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you got the right file Mr Mabuza? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Yes, I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Page 3, paragraph 10. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Do you see that? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Ja, I do. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So we can confirm that the date is the 20th not the 19th? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  We can confirm that should it be the 22nd 
10 
[intervenes]? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The 22nd? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  The 22nd. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  It is the, it is the 19th when I got the call. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  The Board was appointed on the 22nd. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And when, do you recall when for the first time did you 
meet as a new Board? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  I got to Eskom on Monday the 22nd with the CEO 
20 
and we would have met I think on the 20-, three days later or so. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  As a Board. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We will then work with that timeline.  I am going to skip 
paragraphs 12 to 14 because you are going to discuss some of those general 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 56 of 115 
 
indications about what your Board had to deal with.  More in detail later on unless you 
want to reflect on them for the purposes of your evidence at this stage. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Chairman with indulgence so that I clear this in 
my own head. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Back to this issue we were discussing of 
guarantees and prepayments and where my curiosity legal or illegal, proper or irregular, 
what is, is worth noting people in office duly authorised people, people with the 
requisite authority to the extent of Board Members, Chairs of Board, Office Bearers, 
Chief Executives, CFOs, Heads of Procurement these are people who had the 
10 
authority.  The authority they did not have is to do things that are illegal or irregular, but 
they had the authority to do things.  So I hope somewhere in the course of the work of 
the Commission we will settle at a point where there is an understanding and an 
appreciation by Office Bearers that you have authority, but you do not have authority to 
do anything including things that are illegal, because these are decisions that were 
taken by duly authorised people in structures with their attendant authorities that goes 
with their office, but what they did do which I call curious and might be regular or legal 
is, it does not mean the Chairman of the Board or he CEO or the CFO or the Head of 
Procurement could not sign this.  So there, there, it is important that hopefully 
somewhere in the work of the, the Commission we will reach a landing where Office 
20 
Bearers particularly in state owned entities as we deal with the, the mandate of your 
Commission Chair that there would be an appreciation of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Basically at least in part what you are talking about is the use 
of one’s authority for the purpose for which one was given that authority and the abuse 
of authority that one may have.  At least in part that is what you are talking about? 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 57 of 115 
 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  That that, that is it Chair, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Then we are grateful for that guidance.  At 
paragraph 16 on page 5 you say that: 
“At the time of the Board’s appointment the company was 
undoubtedly facing one of the most difficult times in the 
organisations 95 year history.” 
Can I ask you to sum up precisely what are those most difficult times that Eskom was 
facing when you took office? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  When we took office as I got to know later that 
10 
the funders of Eskom and Eskom being now a matter of public record there is no 
money.  So it relies on money from lenders and the shareholder.  The funders, it was in 
January 2018 the last money that Eskom could find from the market would have been 
in July 2017.  The funders had actually drawn a line on the ground that we are not 
putting one cent more here under this current leadership of Eskom.  So that that, that 
that has had many implications for, for Eskom.  The first being January 2018 Eskom 
was under terms to release its interim result for the period of ending September 2017.  
The JSE had indicated it would delist Eskom’s bonds if by a certain date they do not 
publish those results.  The auditors would not sign on these results on a going concern 
basis until there was some small gap of R20 billion that had to be provided to address 
20 
the liquidity crunch that the organisation was facing giving rise to the question of going 
concern.  So you do not have your results on the base of which people can give you 
money to see where you stand.  You cannot get your results because audits cannot 
confirm you are a going concern.  You cannot be going as a concern when the funders 
are not prepared to give you any more money.  You are not selling enough or maybe 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 58 of 115 
 
you do sell, but you are not collecting enough revenue.  So that was; then this is an 
organisation that at one stage had a, a better rating, credit rating than the Sovereign. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Hm. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  This is an organisation that at one stage was one 
of the top five in the world of utilities.  So you have to go see this in the context.  
Needless to say this is an organisation whose survival is so systemic in the socio 
economic fabric of our society.  So that was the one issue that it faced.  All what we 
knew about was there was a lot of graft, a lot of malfeasance.  Indeed it was the, the 
main theatre where corruption, state capture was taking place.  So the morale was low.  
People were not too proud to be associated with this organisation.  So here this Board 
10 
comes in.  That is the backdrop.  So we had to do a few things soonest.  The one was 
to get those results which we finally did albeit with the various reportable irregularities.  
Two, there was sufficient I would image confidence in this Board led by this taxi driver 
that whilst they do not know the difference between electricity megawatts or kilowatts 
that they do have is sufficient integrity, ethical standing that they funders could at least 
have confidence that they will not steal our money.  They might not be able to turn a 
turbine, but they will steal our money.  So the funders were with a certain level of 
confidence prepared to give us what we call as our bridge to bond, because we are 
only going to be going out to on a bond fund raising September later in the year, but we 
had this R20 billion cap that we had to fill.  So I and the Chairman of Audits, Sindi 
20 
Mabaso-Koyana.  So they had to go and meet the funders, look them in the eye.  I met 
the Vice President of the World Bank which had met our Deputy President at the time 
and had indicated to him that they will pull the plug on funding Eskom from the World 
Bank and we all know what that ripple effect would have been.  So they, the funders 
against the little credibility we had and believe that we could clean up, stabilise this 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 59 of 115 
 
patient who were prepared to give us the bond.  With these results we went out to raise 
more funds.  We now had a complete Board, had a new Chief Executive and we 
embarked on appointing a permanent Chief Executive and a permanent CFO and went 
onto continue with the, the disciplinary hearing and over time tried to, to address the 
issues on procurement, because Mr Chairman as I got to learn here as I got to learn 
here is that it’s called corruption, the name is corruption but the game is procurement. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Right can I stop you there, I know that you feel so strong 
about it and we will get to it in detail.  To complete contextual matters of background 
you say at the time when you came in, in January 2018, there was a liquidity crises, I 
would like you to give us some figures if you can, if not please point us to who would 
10 
give them to us.  What was the debt burden of Eskom at that point in time, more or less 
to your knowledge? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Without the CFO of Eskom and see it from 
whence it comes Eskom generates give or take about R180billion in revenues, it pays 
about R95billion, spends that on buying its primary energy, spends another R50billion 
on its people’s costs, so at arbitral level Eskom would have about 40/45billion, it’s got a 
debt servicing burden of 50billion, so Eskom must go and borrow, if nothing else 
another R5billion to pay debt. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Right, do you know how much of the government 
guarantees were extended to Eskom when you came into office to back up its debt 
20 
burden to the funders? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Eskom had a guarantee of about R350billion, I 
would say by that time it would have had about 115 or so of unutilised guarantee.  Now 
the way this smart people that spent longer time at school than I did say that you’ve got 
a guarantee of 350, some of that has already been committed and used, some of it is 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 60 of 115 
 
committed but not yet used, so there would have been maybe in round numbers 
R100billion that was not yet used, but the guarantee is quite specific, the guarantee is 
for capital project, for nothing else, not for operating expenses.  So it was as I said 
around 100billion that might not have been used, I could be wrong by 15billion or so, 
but it is irrelevant in Eskom, 15billion is a small number.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  From the reports that we have seen there are different 
funders who have extended different forms of loans to Eskom, is that correct? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Ja, correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  And each and every one of the loan covenants that 
we have looked at has a material default clause or event default clauses.  I suppose 
10 
you are aware of the implications of those clauses. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And Minister Gordhan was here and he told us that all of 
those loan covenants have what he called cross-guarantee, cross-default provisions. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  That if you default on one the rest of the default clauses 
kick on are you aware of that? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Yes I am.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  In the light of your knowledge can you explain to the 
Chairperson what would be the implications of Eskom defaulting on one and not the 
20 
rest of the loan covenants by the funders? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:   Chairman as Advocate Maleka has explained, 
these are not on the cross-default within Eskom, they are cross-default in the 
sovereign, so a breach of any of the covenants within Eskom the fatal effect of it it’s not 
only within Eskom, not that Eskom has got no fatal effect on the economy and on the 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 61 of 115 
 
country all that’s come up for cross-defaults, whether they are sitting in Denel or in SAA 
or we had the Minister of Financer telling us that we’ve got to borrow R1.5billion every 
day even those kind of borrowings come up for having been affected by the cross-
defaults. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in other words a failure on the part of Eskom and indeed on the 
part of any SOE that may have been issued with a guarantee is for all intents and 
purposes quite disastrous for the sovereign. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  For the country. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For the country yes. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Even the guarantees themselves Chairman I 
10 
mean if we said it’s 350 that would be 350 out of maybe 600billion of all guarantees. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Which is about half of the GDP, so the point I’m 
trying to make is it’s – I don’t have the English word, only the Afrikaners have got a nice 
word who can describe it but I can’t say it here, it’s fatal, it’s fatal for the country, not 
only for the economy, for the country. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, so obviously it’s something to be issued really when 
circumstances call for it and once it has been issued it should be honoured, the debt 
has got – the obligations that the SOE concerned must make sure it honours those 
obligations because the country can’t afford a breach of those obligations with the 
20 
consequences that you have just told us for the country. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Yes Mr Chairman but more importantly for people 
that are in charge of running this entity needs to understand and appreciate what 
Advocate Maleka called the responsibility, integrity.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 62 of 115 
 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  They need to understand what turns on the 
decisions and the authorities that they have but for the records to date Eskom has not 
yet defaulted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The one contextual issue that I would like to clear up 
now that we understand the extend of the burden of the debt and the back-up 
guarantees that provide a comfort to the funders.  You talked about the fact that there 
was a liquidity crises in Eskom, my simple understand of the meaning of that term of art 
is that you don’t have money to pay for your debts as and when they fall due, you don’t 
have sufficient money in your bank to plan properly for our business operating 
10 
expenditures, would that be consistent with your understanding? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Ja, as it says the cashier has run dry so no 
liquidity. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, what was the extent of the liquidity crunch at 
Eskom at the point in time when you assumed office, if you are aware.  You have 
mentioned the figure of R2billion, I’m not too sure that was ...(intervention)  
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  It’s twenty. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  R20billion? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  R20billion.  We needed a cash injection of 
R20billion that would take us through to August September which was the time we 
20 
would next be able to go and meet funders, one to report about the past hopefully the 
picture is such that it gives them hope that we will be able, willing and available to pay 
in the future. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you needed five did you say you needed R5billion in order for 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 63 of 115 
 
the auditors to confirm that you were a going concern? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  No Chairman I said the auditors would not sign 
the financial statements. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Oh, okay, no they wouldn’t until they were – if they had 
to sign they would have to say this company should not be relied on as a going 
concern, so don’t trade with them, so we had to produce the results but to produce the 
results we had to demonstrate that there is funds in the company for it to be able to 
trade beyond September 2017, the audit it’s now March or February or so of 2018. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and that’s the R20billion? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  And thus the R20billion was put in yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I thought you mentioned R5billion in connection with being able 
to get the auditors to ...(intervention)  
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Now the R5billion Mr Chairman I raised in the 
context of the gap between what Eskom generates of its own, being R45billion, and the 
R50billion it has to pay to service its debt on an ongoing basis. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  So between the 50 an 45 there’s the five, so they 
must go and borrow from someone else to can pay this one other 45billion creditor. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  There are two points there Mr Mabuza in relation to your 
20 
evidence, the one is the audited financial statements were historical in terms of 
reporting of reporting on the financial condition of Eskom, for the previous year of 
operation, in other words 2016/2017? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And the expression of going concern opinion by the 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 64 of 115 
 
auditors is forward looking? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You agree with that? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  That you do have some money in your kitty to pay for 
your obligations going forward? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, when I look at paragraph 17 on page 6 you do 
mention the amount of R20billion and that’s the issue you have already dealt with, do 
you agree? 
10 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  I do. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay, now you’ve mentioned the question of the 
possible JSE delisting of Eskom bonds, you do deal with that issue in paragraph 18, I 
would like to skip it if you don’t have anything further to say in that regard. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Ja, just to say that because of the periods it’s 
important that we put it in context, the financial years at Eskom runs from – runs to 
March am I right? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Runs from April to March, which therefore means 
the interim is the period ended 31st September 2017  When we got to office in March – 
20 
in February, end of January 2018, we had 60  days before the end of this – that 
particular financial year which would have been March 2018, so the results that were 
not yet released were for the period ended September, and the reason they were not 
released was because there were issues of going concern, but the results for the period 
prior to that which would have been March 201 for the full year of 2016/2017 when they 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 65 of 115 
 
were released, they had qualifications both of the international financial reporting 
statements since and indeed in terms of the PFMA, so this results, the significance of 
getting these results was what has – because auditors when they audit your next term 
they want to know how did you deal with the previous issues that were raised on the 
previous financial so the reason this could not be released issues that were carried 
forward did not seem to have been and in a related manner the discussion we’re having 
about the remedial action was raised in the previous era as it turns out some, if not 
most have not yet been addressed, so the question of the going concern was – has to 
be seen in the context that we had release those results and a month later come to the 
end of the financial year which we would need those results audited so that they can 
10 
take those results to the bond markets, because the timing of when we were going to 
go and raise funds is assumed that you will go in August, you would have had your 
financials audited around May, June of 2018, you would have enough time to do your 
road shows and then go and raise money, but we were still stuck in September 2017, 
except that the calendar was saying it’s March 2018.  So this going concern has to be 
seen in that concern, you are right Advocate Maleka it’s going forward, so we were 
already forward without confirmation that we would get forward. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, I mean we have read the report of Parliament, 
which makes it quite clear that a major issue in relation to the 2017, March 2017 
audited financial statements insofar as the PFMA is concerned related to all manner of 
20 
unauthorised fruitless and wasteful expenditure, which were marked out by the 
auditors, what’s your recollection on the score. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  My recollection is when I first publicly had to 
announce Eskom results, these very results we’re talking about, if I’m not mistaken we 
had indicated to the public that first and foremost we don’t know what we don’t know 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 66 of 115 
 
yet, this is what we’ve seen so far, and I think there as a figure of about R3billion of 
irregular expenses that we reported on for that period, that figure became R19billin six 
months later.  So yes the irregular expenses one could well argue that they have not 
become new irregular expenses that have come about between January 22 and March 
31, they were irregular expenses that have come about over a period longer than that, 
to the extent that in the period preceding this date there were reporting where these 
irregularities were not reported could either that they were just not seen at the time, or 
they were deliberately not reported on. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Right, Mr Mabuza thanks for that additional explanation, 
I am now going to go to paragraph 19 and you give us a list of your colleagues who 
10 
were appointed more or less with you and those who continued with office.  I am going 
to mark out two names, and what I’m going to raise with you in relation to those two 
names is no longer a confidential matter, but is a matter that is now in the public record.  
I raised the question on those two names for a different purpose other than the context 
in which the names emerged for public discussion.  If you go to page 7 you will see that 
there are a list of names and two have been marked with asterisk, do you see that? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:   Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Who are those? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:   The one is Mark Lamberti and the other one is 
George Johannes Sibulela. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Yes and then against those names you give the date 
when the assumed office, we now know that it is more or less around 19 January and 
the next date is when they resigned from office.  As against the name of Mr Mark 
Lamberti you say that he resigned on the 6th of April 2018, do you see that? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Yes correct. 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 67 of 115 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Do you confirm the correctness of the date of 
resignation? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  I do. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright, the net is the name of Mr George Sibulela, same 
date of coming in to office and a different date of exiting by way of resignation.  What is 
the date of resignation? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  He resigned on the 19th of October 2018. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  For the purposes of this enquiry can you please 
deal as brief as you can with the reasons why persons who volunteered to assume 
public office resign months later into that office? 
10 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Chairman firstly the circumstances and the 
reasons leading to their leaving office are not the same.  Mark Lamberti really with 
some very heart that I had to accept his resignation owing to an unrelated matter to his 
office at Eskom, owing to a matter that relates to his position and  how he has been 
found by a court to have ill-treated a black female and overlooked her for appointment 
in her job.  I say this because this has definitely been devastating to Mark the person 
definitely not the person I personally have experienced over the time I have worked 
with him, over many years and indeed he recruited me to be Chairman of the Board of 
the PLSA to be the Chairman of PLSA, I did not appoint him to the Board here, but I 
know what it has done to him, the person, which is really unfortunate.  I accepted and 
20 
respected his decision, which I think was the right one, to leave this public office, given 
the time and the place our society is at on issues of gender and race.  So I respected 
that, I also had to accept his resignation from the Board of PLSA and also accept his 
resignation from the CEO initiative but I remain very hurt by what happened, I am not 
justifying or defending his action but I remain very deeply hurt by it.  So this was the 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 68 of 115 
 
circumstances behind Mark having to leave office. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   May I ask you one or two questions on that score, and 
maybe you are not the right person to deal with the question, but if not someone else 
will have to deal with that question, and I truly respect the relationship you had with Mr 
Lamberti but the risks investigation, the risk processes what I want to understand is 
was the litigation that ultimately gave rise to a judgment against him still continuing 
when he accepted appointment at Eskom as a Board Member, to your knowledge? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Chairman the only time I got to be aware of these 
incidents was at a meeting where the Portfolio Committee of the Department of Public 
Enterprise were on a site visit at Eskom, and its nature that Portfolio Committee is 
10 
made of members from different parties in Parliament.  During question time a Member 
of Parliament, Honourable Chivambo from the EFF, raised this point addressing me, to 
say you are sitting in this Board with people that have got these issues around them to 
which Mark responded to say as you know this matter is in court it is prejudicial to be 
talking about it, I have not yet been found guilty of anything.  If indeed I do get found 
guilty of anything I will be the first to resident, you won’t have to worry about me 
continuing. So that was the only time I even got, as I said this was a matter that was at t 
he company where Mr Lamberti was, and I only got to know about it at the time, not that 
I would have done anything about it had I known, I was not the person that was 
appointing Mr Lametti to the Board, the earlier point that I made that I was invited to a 
20 
Board that had members already been appointed, I was asked to Chair it.  So that’s all I 
– the rest is what I knew after that as I was dealing with it as Chairman of Eskom and 
as I was dealing with his resignation as Chairman of PLSA. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   So I take it from your answer that you became aware 
before he resigned of that litigation. 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 69 of 115 
 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:   That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and the company you are talking about for the 
record is Imperial Holdings? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Holdings, correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Chair it is almost one o’clock, we are going to get to 
another detailed topic. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, we are going to adjourn, we are going to take the lunch 
break and we will resume at two o’clock.  The Commission adjourns. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS   
INQUIRY RESUMES   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Maleka you may proceed. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Mabuza we were at page 7, page 
7 and we were dealing with the – your evidence relating to Mr Lamberti.  I take it that 
you have said what you wanted to say.  We now go to the evidence relating to Mr 
Sebulela.   
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Yes Chairman as I indicated that there are 
reasons for departing the board were not necessarily the same.  Mr Sebulela resigned 
on the 19 October owing to an undeclared interest in one of the tenders on the ICT 
space.  The issue of that tender predates by about five years this board in office.  It has 
been a tender that has been out there for the last five or so years.  It turns out that Mr 
20 
Sebulela also long before he joined the Eskom board he had a relationship of being a 
sub-contractor to one of the bidders in a general arrangement that as and when they 
get jobs anywhere they would sub-contract to him or his company. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What is the name of that bidder? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  The name of the bidder is EOH.  But this 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 70 of 115 
 
relationship predates as I said Mr Sebulela on the board.  So when Mr Sebulela joined 
the board as I have demonstrated in my own declaration this particular relationship was 
not disclosed in a general declaration.  When these bids finally came to the board the 
board through its various committees had reached a point to recommend that they re-
open this process and I would think the committee actually mentioned from a strategic 
point what it would do.  I think the board – the committee recommended to the board 
that instead of taking this one contract and give it to one vendor they were going to give 
it to about six vendors, break these various tender to those six.  One of those six that 
was bidding is the very company UAH.  But prior to this there seemed to have been a 
specific sub-contracting – there was a general one that if we get jobs in this space we 
10 
will work with you.  Then there was a specific one that says we are bidding for this job 
at Eskom we want you to be our sub-contractor.  That is what we finally got to hear from 
the bidder.  Because as I said he did not disclose and declare this as his general – in 
his general declaration.  He did not disclose it as a specific declaration at the start of 
every board meeting.  On the one side the audit and forensic team would send material 
that says we are about to go into a meeting to look at something like this please note 
member so and so either as per your own declaration or on our own findings you are to 
be seen to be an interested person.  And then they cause that to be shared to the 
company secretary and you get told.   So you would be able to know that you are – if 
you had forgotten you would be ably reminded.  So in this particular instance this did 
20 
not happen because it was not disclosed generally and specifically.  Secondly when the 
bidder themselves, the bidders themselves do get to be asked the same questions as 
to do they have anybody in Eskom in whatever position who could be of conflict.  The 
bidder this particular time has disclosed and has mentioned that Mr Sebulela is related 
to them.  So on hearing that the audit and forensic people raised the issue as they raise 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 71 of 115 
 
the issue I then approached him to say there is this matter.  He said no I do not know 
about it and then the decision where this – the decision was taken about the strategic 
approach he was not at that meeting but there was a round robin resolution that was 
being circulated.  He participated in that round robin resolution which means he would 
have seen the material.  He might not have remembered that he was related but he 
therefore participated in the process that he should not have participated in.  So I then 
confronted him after now he has now signed the resolution and said this thing has 
come up again.  He said, no I do not know about this.  I said, but Georgie there is – this 
comes from the bidder why would they want to prejudice themselves by saying they 
have you who would cause them – I do not understand.  He said, no I did not.  So I said 
10 
to him, there is information here about your company and your ID. But I know you I 
know you very well.  He says; well no it is not me maybe they got it from the office.  
Okay I then went back to the team and say, Guys knowing this day of fake news this 
might be fake.  They then produced a document he had signed of this contractual 
arrangement.  He – I then confronted him same and he said, no.  You know what 
Chairman I leave my stamp, my signature stamp somewhere.  This could be one of 
those.  At which point I said to him, well I think you have got bigger problems than this.  
If you have your stamp that you do not know where it is, you do not know who is signing 
on your behalf I would be more worried if I were you.  Anyway this is where we are and 
I think you have got to do the right thing.  He said no leave me let me think about it.  So 
20 
I let him think about it and then unfortunately this thing is now in the public domain.  
These newspapers have got certain deadlines they working on.  This time is now a 
Friday afternoon we cannot hold this any further.  The weekend papers are calling to 
say they are going to print if we – if they do not get a response.  At which point I then 
called him and then I then drafted a resignation for him on a text.  I said I think you now 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 72 of 115 
 
need to resign by returning this sms to me.  By this time I have advised the person who 
has appointed him but Minister I am dealing with this because of time this is how I 
propose we deal with it.  I will draft this when he gets it I will receive it, I will forward it to 
you and if it is okay Minister if I receive it given time can I accept it on your behalf.  The 
Minister said yes you may go ahead.  So of course after a long time he still does not 
feel he should do this but in his words which I appreciated was “in the interest of clean 
corporate governance I will leave.”  So he then sent me that text.  Within seconds of 
course I responded and indicated I do accept your resignation on behalf of the minister 
and the minister will be advised accordingly.  That is what – that is what happened Mr 
Chairman. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you Mr Mabuza.  Questions of process.  Where 
was the weakness in the system at the – which led to this controversy as far as you can 
pick up?  I mean all of you have declared when he took office.  The declarations are 
updated by the audit and risk individuals in Eskom and yet they feel to pick up? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Ja Mr Chairman I thought about this in the 
context of the previous point that it is highly unlikely that the process could pick up 
something that is not available.  So it is up to me who knows – I know who I deal with.  I 
know where interests I have are.  And indeed even outside of issues of conflict of 
interest, excuse me, if I know that I occupy a position like I do at Eskom and there is a 
20 
certain behaviour privately and publicly that is expected of me and that is not yet in the 
public domain that I have already breached that – that example I have already 
assaulted someone and the matter is going through the various processes.  It is not 
everybody who would get to know that I am charged for assault and if they do I will tell 
them the matter is still in court.  Only I know that I have got that matter.  So if I consider 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 73 of 115 
 
my office just outside of the narrow constraints of what my – I need to do I need to at 
least do take one of those people that my reporting office say, you may, you may not be 
aware this thing might or might not come out that I am currently being charged for 
assault I would propose that I be given leave so that I do not affect the good office that I 
occupy.  So those things might not necessarily be there.  So I also – I say the issue of 
declaration and management of conflicts has first and foremost have to start from the 
interested officer.  I have to declare it as I have indicated in my own form.  Anything that 
I have not disclosed here is what has not yet happened or I do not know I am doing.  
The things I know I am doing that are of a commercial nature I have declared up front.  
Whether they are known by someone else or not I have declared.  So in this particular 
10 
instance I do not know how else would the board – the officers have found out if he did 
not declare but because the system is such that even the tenderer must state.  So if the 
tenderer did not disclose we would have known when maybe more damage would have 
been caused.  So it now is back to the individual.  That individual that occupy these 
offices need to be honest, ethical and sincere in their declarations first and foremost.  
So if there is flaw I would argue that maybe George should have declared more.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you I am grateful for that but can I suggest to 
what I conceive to be a weakness in the system beyond the good faith or lack of it on 
the part of an appointee or a candidate for such a responsible office as you hold.  And I 
say so because it is now become clear evidence before the Chairperson that individuals 
20 
are appointed to serious office without any prior background check by those who have 
the power to appoint.  And Chair you now have evidence before you about the issue we 
are dealing on 1.7 or 1.8 relating to Treasury’s appointment of Special Advisors and so 
on.  And the evidence we have so far is that the Minister concerned was appointed on 
the 9th the next day advisors and chief of staff are appointed which suggests that if ever 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 74 of 115 
 
there was an opportunity to do background search it would have taken less than a day.  
So where I would like your comment is this a proper background investigation to 
candidates for appointment would at least established minimum information relating to 
probity questions around the candidates concerned.  Do you agree? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  I do. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And that background investigation ought to be done 
before, at least well before the appointment is made.   
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  I agree. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And in this case in your case the appointment was made 
almost on the same day when it was publicly announced. 
10 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  I agree. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  In the light of all of those matters that you and I agree 
on what would be your recommendation in order to make sure that declarations go 
beyond the good faith disclosures of the candidates for appointment. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Ja as I indicated Chairman earlier about my 
issue of privacy I also do come from a place where for me to have continued to be a 
key employee and chief executive officer at Tsogo Sun I had to always be of acceptable 
probity.  And any and everything that I disclose or did not disclose was available.  I was 
signing as I disclosed to the officers, the gaming boards that you can go to anybody, 
anywhere in the world and take any information about me and should you find any of 
20 
those to suggest that I am not fit nor proper to occupy this office I would know that I am 
putting the license that Tsogo Sun has at risk and Tsogo would be given at least the 
opportunity to remedy that by removing me from office or face the consequences.  So 
this maybe brings me to the point Advocate Maleka referred me when he was talking 
about my declaration to a date of July when we were still talking about when I was 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 75 of 115 
 
appointed.  It is that document under the Annexure, Annexure C Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  That is under Text 6. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  That is U5 Chair.  It is Exhibit U5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja what page was it again? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It starts at page 140. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do remember the reference to July 2018. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Ja – yes I am sorry to do this but I think it is an 
important point to make.  That date is not a date related to my appointment.  That date 
is the date at which this form is being revised in the policy processes of Eskom. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  So I just do not want an impression to be left that 
I joined in January now we have settled on the date whether it is the 19 th or the 20th or 
22nd but only in July did I declare my interest. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I… 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  It is important that we get that one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  No you can take for granted that your evidence is clear 
on this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no I thought I would mention that is was quite clear.  I mean you 
20 
did say you made the disclosure, the declaration I think still in January I think quite 
soon after your appointment but that July 2018 it is also indicated there it is revised so 
you did talk about how it gets updated.  So ja that was – that was clear. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  I am glad that the – Chairman with that.  So to 
Advocate Maleka’s question as we go forward in updated these various probity forms if 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 76 of 115 
 
I may call them that way one of the learnings at least would be that – I guess the very 
least you can do is you have told us everything that is for you to tell us the truth, all the 
truth on this day should we find anything that it is not in line with this we then must 
exercise the particular sanction.  That is the one part.  The other part is we must I do 
not know what else you do to know whether a person has told you everything as in this 
particular instance.  The third point is as Advocate Maleka says here in the case of this 
where the shareholder, the government appoints people to these boards they need to 
spend a little bit more time before they appoint them to be sure and know that the 
person they appointing is the person they want to appoint knowing what they know 
about that person.  There is a lot in the public space about these type of situations that 
10 
I guess they are a bit of an embarrassment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  You are close to ministers.  You have 
mentioned the example of probity investigation in the gambling industry and from what 
you told us you commend that model of prior probity investigation and I leave it to you 
to suggest some such options to avoid these things because they are likely to happen 
unless we address them.   
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Yes to confirm I am close to them by the office I 
occupy. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  The last person of the board that you are leading 
20 
who was forced or called upon to resign because of possible questions of conflict of 
interest is a person you name at paragraph 21 on page 7 of your statement, do you see 
that? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Yes I do. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Give us some sort of contextual appreciation of why that 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 77 of 115 
 
person was called upon to resign? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  This current Minister of Public Enterprise has 
taken a view Chairman that none of his staff, his office is officials should occupy 
positions on state owned boards that they have got to oversight on.  Previous ministers 
had a different take on this.  So Ms Jacky Molisane is an official that has been working 
and continues to work for the Department of Public Enterprise.  Minister Gordhan has – 
has had a preference that he did not think that creates sufficient distance between the 
shareholder and the board.  So he decided that he was going to ask her to resign and 
accordingly she is employed by the Department so she has resigned from the board. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Mr Mabuza unless you have further issues to raise I 
10 
would like now to go to the meat of your evidence and of course you introduce that part 
of your evidence from paragraph 23 and I would like you to reflect on what you were so 
emphatically prepared to talk about through that graphic description that procurement is 
a disguised way of expressing corruption.  I hope that I am not misquoting you? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you maybe.  I do not think he said that.  Well he said 
procurement is the game. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Yes corruption is the name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And then what is the game? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  It has – the game is procurement. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay and… 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  To do corruption.  I said corruption is name, 
procurement is the game. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes to a simple idle mind like me what does that mean 
in lay terms? 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 78 of 115 
 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  What that means is what we see and we call 
corruption is what happens in the procurement of goods and services in the public 
sector.  That is – we talk – we call it corruption but the real deal, the real incident, the 
real happening, the real goings on is what happens in the procurement and we have 
come to see it in a number of manifestations at Eskom. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair you remember we led the evidence of Mr 
Mathabula right early on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Who told you that the total public procurement bill is in 
the order of R800 million as I recall. 
10 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Billion. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Billion.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And that half of it is characterised by a non-compliance 
with the PFMA.  He did not go as far as to suggest that all of that non-compliance 
constitute corruption but it more or less fits in within the scheme of Mr Mabuza’s 
observation that.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I would not want to mis-describe. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  But there is if I may Chairman. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  There is perhaps the need to say this and a 
public office bearers and public people in the public service use this line a lot.  That 
irregular expenditure is not always wasteful, fruitless and corrupt. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 79 of 115 
 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  The irregularity comes out of being irregular 
relative to the prescripts of the Public Finance Management Act.  It might be a narrow 
way of looking at it.  But there is corruption that is over and above irregular expenses 
as per the PFMA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja I am sure there would be bona fide transactions that which 
have got some irregularity but the irregularity has nothing to do with corruption.   
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  That is correct, that is what I am saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is somebody who misunderstood genuinely some requirement or 
thought that the circumstances were such that I genuinely thought that there was no 
need to comply with a particular requirement but it is genuine. 
10 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Agreed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then there are those where everybody knows this is what you 
are supposed to do but they do not do it because it does not suit their purposes and 
that is where you get into corruption. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  I agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Now I am going to get to the details of that topic.  
Because you begin with it from page 18 paragraph 51 of your statement but before I go 
there I just want to confirm that you have dealt with some of the issues you describe in 
the interposing paragraphs before that.  And remember we had finishes what you had 
20 
dealt with up to paragraph 22 on page 7.  I would like to move quite quickly with those 
interposing paragraphs because you have dealt with some of them.  In paragraph – 
sorry in – on page 8 from paragraph 23 you set out in detail what you as a new board 
found when you got in there.  You have dealt with it as far as I am aware and I do not 
think there is a need to repeat it Chair.  And then in paragraph… 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 80 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes he may if there is something that he wants to highlight 
which you – he thinks we have not covered.  Just highlight that otherwise he certainly 
has dealt with some. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.   
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  I have dealt with it thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  And so would be the case from Chapter 3 of your 
statement beginning at page 10 paragraph 29.  You give us the background of Eskom’s 
Corporate Governance and then in paragraph 31 on page 11 going up to 35 on page 12 
you talk about Eskom’s Conflict Of Interest Policy and the declarations that are required 
from members of the board and you have dealt with that topic now quite adequately, do 
10 
you agree? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  I did except to just emphasise that on page 10 
that paragraph 30. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  That when, when you look at that table at the 
bottom of page 10 this table says as it is January for a Board that was appointed in 
January 2018.  By the time I submitted this statement which was, I must get the date 
right now, which was signed on 16 January 2019.  It is almost a year. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  A year. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  This Board Chairman and its various Committees 
20 
has had 61 meetings.  A year does not have 61 weeks.  So this does just speak to an 
abnormally.  I just wanted to, to, to state the amount of time Non-Executive Directors of 
Eskom spent at Eskom and each Board Meeting lasts an average of eight hours.  It is, it 
is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is unusual. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 81 of 115 
 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Four/six Board Meetings a year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Is what. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is normal. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  So the dysfunctionality that the President was 
talking about when he spoke about Eskom is manifest by the Executive, the 
Non-Executives spending more time almost to the point where I do not think this Non-
Executive tab which speaks to they either are overreaching or there is a vacuum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  I just wanted to. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Give you an example of each. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Well it is the nature of your mandate to go and clean up.  
You cannot behave as usual when there is a special task to deal with. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Accept I am not complaining. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  I just want it to be seen in the context of effort 
versus reward. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  No, I am grateful for that and can I [laughing] can I ask 
20 
you to reflect on the table and raise one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or, or well maybe you, you are not complaining about having to 
attend so many meetings, but maybe you are complaining about the situation that has 
brought that about. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  And it is, it is unsustainable Chairman. 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 82 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  There has to come a time when you have got to 
create enough distance from the Executive to be, not be player and referee themselves. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [Indistinct]. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Non-Executives rather. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  One of the unique governing structures of Eskom insofar 
as the interface between the Board and the Senior Executives are concerned is this 
animal called the Board Tender Committee.  I would like to illicit your thoughts on it, 
10 
because we know that in this case allegations of state capture impacted quite heavily 
on what the BTC, the Board Tender Committee, did.  My understanding of the 
delegation of authority of Eskom is that the Board Tender Committee is an organ of the 
Board.  It is the Board operating on a narrow scale of its members and a narrow scale 
of mandate relating to Procurement.  Do you agree with that model of the mandate of 
the BTC? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Firstly the, the, the name of this Committee in as 
far as the Board I lead is a bit of a misnomer.  The Committee of the Board that is 
currently in office does not sit and adjudicate tenders.  One of the mandates that in 
announcing our appointments the Deputy President of the Republic at the time referred 
20 
to was Board Members should desist from being involved in adjudicating tenders.  So it 
is being called the Board Tender Committee.  I have not experienced this Committee 
adjudicating tenders, but I nevertheless did not stop from executing that mandate of 
ensuring that Board Members do not get involved in tenders and also disband this 
Committee.  It does no longer exist at Eskom Governing Structures as we speak today.  
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 83 of 115 
 
The, historically this is what happened at Eskom.  I might get some of my numbers 
incorrect.  These Executives at Eskom either as individuals or attaching to their 
positions they carry big responsibilities as I mentioned in their delegated Schedule of 
Authorities of what they can spend before they go one, one level up.  I got to be aware 
that I might get it wrong.  I will not remember what each of the Heads of various 
divisions as in Generation, Distribution and Finance and/or Transmission their Schedule 
of Authority, but anything that is above 500 million and where I come from 500 million is 
a lot of money.  At Eskom as I indicated they [indistinct] they spend on primary energy 
95 billion.  So 500 million is a level that is, attaches to a certain office or officer or a 
group of officers.  Then the next level was then 750 million.  Above 750 million it must 
10 
go to the, to the tender, the Board Tender Committee but when it comes to the Board 
Tender Committee it is not for the Board Tender Committee to adjudicate tenders.  It is 
to say we have decided that you should procure from Supplier A this various product or 
service at this price.  This we confirm.  This is a strategy on sourcing this particular 
product of service that was approved by a Board at such and such a point and I guess 
what this Committee can do is oversight just to ask the kind of questions and I will give 
you an example of a question I had asked in one of these meetings was, here is this 
individual who has been given an tender to supply I think it was fuel for about a billion, 
some number like that, but clearly because it is outside of the purview of the Executives 
it comes to this Board for oversight.  So now this Board is, committee is submitting it to 
20 
the Board.  Ask the question, guys why did you ask these people to complete in the 
questionnaire previous values of businesses they have run before and I just want to 
see whether they can carry this amount of value in business, okay.  Why did you ask 
them the question when were they established?  Now just so as to establish that they 
have got the requisite experience.  I thought so, I said but now explain this one to me.  
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 84 of 115 
 
You are recommending that we must buy fuel from this supplier who was set up the 
week before you closed for calling for tenders and by their own admission they tell you 
the biggest amount of business they have ever carried is R10 million and you want us 
to say it is okay to give them the 1.5 billion contract.  That is what you want us to do.  
That is the one example.  The other example they present a case to the Board of this is 
what we must approve or whatever amount over 1 billion and then I ask the question, 
where is this person who submitted this document from the office.  No, this person is 
suspended.  What is this person suspended for?  No, this person was involved in 
another matter and, oh so what happened?  No she, we finally got, she confessed that 
she was involved in such and such transgression.  Oh, okay.  So why are you 
10 
suspending her?  So that we can investigate.  So you want to investigate a confession?  
Is that what you want to do?  Well where I come from when you see something like this 
as a matter of course anything that comes from this person I will have to go, the onus 
would be on them to prove that she had not done wrong, because the only thing I know 
they do wrong.  Maybe exceptionally they have managed not to do wrong.  So I am just 
trying to, to, to show you that what this Committee and the Board ought to, would have 
been oversight not to actually say do give, do not give, pay or do not pay.  So what we 
have then now done we then as a, when we finally disbanded this because you had to 
go through a process and to change your governing structures and do what you had to 
do.  It took a bit of time.  Where were finally settled is we do not have a Board Tender 
20 
Committee as we speak. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Since when? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  June, June/July/August but it is the, the, the, the 
last quarter of calendar year 2018.  So what we then did we disbanded the Board 
Tender Committee, no since January this year.  The work we did last year we said from 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 85 of 115 
 
January or from February this year there will be none.  So there has been none.  What 
we have done in its place or another thing that kind, kind of like seemed odd the Chief 
Executive of the Company does not sit in the Board Tender Committee.  Below the 
Board Tender Committee there is the so called ETC which I guess stands for the 
Executive Tender Committee.  The Chief Executive does not sit on that Committee.  So 
the Chief Executive if he was not a Director he would not know what his business is 
buying from whom for what, because Procurement reports through Finance and I am 
passing no judgment whether I saw it wrong, but decisions of buying are thought some 
of them the Chief Executive ought to know and own.  So he would sit in the Board when 
the BTC presents the stuff and Phakamani the CEO he too would hearing of these 
10 
things for the first time which we thought that was not right.  How can we hold him 
accountable as the Commander in Chief here when he does not command this part?  
So we then decided either than disbanded the Board Tender Committee one of the 
things we are going to do we are going to wound up the limits, the levels of what this 
Executive Committee should do.  We are going to up the levels of what the Chief 
Procurement Officer will be.  We will keep the Chief Procurement to report through the 
Finance, but above a certain level the Chair, the Chief Executive will Chair a Committee 
which is a Committee just before it comes to the Board, but when it comes to the Board 
we will then let this be done by the Investment and Finance Committee to just have 
oversight on this as against adjudicating tenders.  So I guess this would be akin to the 
20 
level about the Chief Executive of a Bank who is not a Member of the Credit Committee 
and a level above him that the Board could have two or three independent members 
that have got oversight on these issues that the Chief Executive has taken. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Can I move on? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, you may move on. 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 86 of 115 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  To another topic? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you and I take it that you have now realigned 
your DOA to reflect those changes? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Correctly, yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  From paragraph 31 on page 11 you talk about probity 
questions and the declarations, we have dealt with those matters unless you want us to 
revisit them. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  No. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And they go up to page 18, paragraph 15.  You 
10 
comfortable with where it starts? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Yes, I am.  I am. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  With the essence of your evidence relating to how you 
dealt with allegations of corruption as and when you picked up as the new Board.  You 
start with the topic relating to disciplinary processes taken by the new Board.  Do you 
see that? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And in paragraph 52 you mention names.  We will get to 
some of these names, but my recollection is that you as the new Board were mandated 
or in fact required by the Portfolio Committee which investigated allegations into state 
20 
capture to undertake or take disciplinary actions against Senior Executives of Eskom.  
We have taken the Chairperson in your absence to several of the recommendations by 
the Portfolio Committee that the new Board should take those actions.  We have also 
taken the Chairperson to the Fundudzi Report which recommended disciplinary actions.  
I am not going to go through that ground again.  I am now going to move from the 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 87 of 115 
 
premise that you accept as a matter of statutory and corporate obligations that you 
have; that you had that duty and what you did was to try and fulfil it by instituting 
disciplinary processes.  Is that a fair premise to move on? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  That that is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  This morning you gave us EXHIBIT UM, sorry U5 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I was wondering [laughing] where that one came from, UM. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Sorry, U5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We will get back to your statement, but I would like to 
10 
deal with the contents of EXHIBIT U5 and Mr Mabuza your evidence in this regard will 
converse Part A of EXHIBIT U5 and you will see that Part A has several sections and 
we start from Section 1 to Section 7.  Do you see it? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Ja, correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And subject to the direction of the Chairperson I am 
going to start with them in reverse and it will become clear later on why I do so.  Chair 
you will see that the sequence of the documentation relating to the DC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Begins from Section 2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And it goes on up to Section 7 as I have indicated, but 
with your leave I would like to start with the disciplinary charges as are contained in 
Section 7 from page 107. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, you may proceed.  That is fine. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Are you at page 107 of U5? 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 88 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  It looks like the one he is looking at is a much thicker lever arch file 
than my U5. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can I ask the appoints person from Bowmans to guide 
the Chairperson? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Somebody is going to assist you. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Are you at page 107? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Page 107, almost towards the end of that bundle. 
10 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Thank you.  Yes I am on page 107. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  That letter is from Bowmans.  What is the date of the 
letter? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  The date of the letter is 27 February 2018. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Who is the addressee? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Is the addressee is Mr Sean Maritz. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What does it tell him? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  I beg yours. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What does the letter tell him? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  The letter tells him that he is required to attend a 
20 
disciplinary hearing by an independent Chairman Senior Counsellor Advocate 
Tim [indistinct] on the 8th and 9 March 2018 at a venue to be advised.  He would have 
to face charges as contained in Annexure A and Eskom intends to be legally 
represented in the disciplinary hearing by our [indistinct] Counsel and you are similarly 
permitted to get legal representation should you so wish. 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 89 of 115 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  As at 27 February 2018 what did Mr Maritz do at 
Eskom? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You mean in terms of the position he was occupying? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What position was he occupying if you do know Mr Mabuza? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Yes Mr Chairman.  I indicated earlier that when 
we arrived at Megawatt Park with the incoming Interim CEO Phakamani Hadebe it was 
22 January.  I. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  As the new landlord I had to come and tell the 
10 
tenant 
who 
was 
Mr Sean Maritz 
to 
handover 
keys 
to 
the 
new 
tenant 
Phakamani Hadebe.  Mr Maritz had read about that in the paper.  I had called him from 
Rome to tell him I am coming to release of his tenancy and he should go back to his 
position as Chief Information Officer as we know have a new Interim CEO.  So when I 
got there I did just that. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So I understand that you had to relieve him of the 
tenancy, but what tenancy did he occupy? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  He was Acting Chief, he was what did they call 
them again?  They were rotational, they did some rotational stuff a couple of weeks 
before we were appointed towards the end of the previous calendar year.  He was 
20 
brought in to be the Acting Chief Executive after Mr Johnny Dladla.  So Sean was 
Acting Chief Executive of Eskom at the time when I arrived. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  He was the number one Senior Executive of Eskom in 
an acting capacity? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  At that time he was the big chief. 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 90 of 115 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And as in February he was, of 2018, he had gone back to the 
position of Chief [indistinct]. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Yes.  On the 22nd I formally. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Asked him to go back to his. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Position as chief. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Financial Officer. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Information Officer. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, Information Officer? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Chief Information Officer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The charges that appear from page 108 are asserted 
against him in the context of a specific office and just to guide all of us the preamble of 
it says: 
“It is alleged that in your capacity, in your position as the 
Interim Group Chief Executive you committed serious acts of 
misconduct alternatively gross negligence in terms of the 
Eskom Disciplinary Code which is destructive of the trust 
20 
required for an ongoing employment relationship.” 
And you set out the specific provisions of the Code that deal with that charge.  So let 
me confirm first thing first.  He was charged in his capacity as the Acting Group Chief 
Executive Officer.  Do you see that? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Ja. 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 91 of 115 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you have read these charges before and I would 
like to take you to the components of them.  I begin with charge 1.  Can I ask you to 
read it out please so that we all have the substance if not the text of the charge? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Charge 1: 
“You breached your duties and responsibilities as an Executive 
and/or breach of 2.1, 2.2A and/or 2.29 and/or 2.30 and/or 2.35 
of the Code and/or you conducted yourself in a way that is 
inacceptable in terms of Eskom values and ethics and/or you 
committed financial misconduct under the PFMA and/or 
exposed Eskom to significant financial and reputational risk and 
10 
harm in relation to an asset development finance framework 
agreement between Huarong Energy Africa Proprietary Limited 
and Eskom Holding SOC and a fee letter committing Eskom to 
an immediate payment, excuse me of $21 800 000 or 
approximately R340 million South African fee letter.  In this 
regard it is alleged specifically that you...” 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Stop.  That is lawyers speak.  In essence what did you 
find as the new Board relating to Mr Maritz that gave rise to this charge? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  The time is, is, is, is, is, is of our appointment 
and the time of some of these developments as they are properly covered in the charge 
20 
sheet is, is worth referring to. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  This is January, the 22nd 2018.  As it is normal 
course I am now meeting the old tenant.  I am asking him to handover to the new 
tenant.  We are meeting him in his office and I asked him to take us through all the 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 92 of 115 
 
things that he thinks we should be aware of.  He tells us everything except he does not 
tell us that barely 30 days before we arrived he had signed these documents 
committing to, committing Eskom to this amount.  For us to only know a few weeks later 
that these documents are alive as recent as when we were talking to him.  So we felt 
that it was, was serious enough to suspend him and discipline, subject him to a 
disciplinary hearing. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  The, the, the Chair would be aware the names 
that are mentioned on the list there rather name, there are seven names. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
10 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Mr Maritz became the only person who we 
suspended ourselves when we go to Eskom is Mr Maritz.  The others, the seven when 
we got there they were at various stages of their suspension and so they were not there 
when we got there. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  So he is the only one who when we got there we 
suspended as I said for not having it is a very material point to, would have told the 
incoming Chief Executive that yesterday I have signed committing you to a fee of R340 
million which is part of a one point whatever billion Dollars funding that we have agreed 
to, to take. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Mr Mabuza I mean you are the incoming Chair and 
you are talking to your commander on the ground and he is giving you a report on the 
status of Eskom which you will inherit as the Board.  I would like to illicit some details to 
the extent that you are able to give them to us.  We now know that you were appointed 
on the 20th and you indicated that you immediately went to Telkom, to Eskom to get a 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 93 of 115 
 
report back, to get a report a status report.  You meet Mr Maritz.  More or less when? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  On the 22nd. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  On the 22nd? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  On Monday 22 January. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and he gives you a detail of what was happening.  
What I would like to understand from you is that was it a verbal report or was there any 
written report or did a written report come thereafter? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  No, it was not a written report, we had met him in 
the office and I introduced myself to him, as I said I had called him to tell him I’m 
landing by this time and Phakamani will meet me at the airport, we will drive to Eskom 
10 
together, and as the person at  home we had to first greet him and then tell him what he 
had read in the newspapers as we indicated on the Sunday, but also the issue of the 
impending change of the leadership of Eskom was not something that just suddenly 
happened that week.  Long before I went on holiday in December I chaired a meeting in 
December of the business community where the Minister of Finance then, Malusi 
Gigaba, had asked for the business community to submit names for consideration to 
the Board of Eskom. 
 
So it was a very topical issue that the Board, the leadership would change. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Ja. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:   So the point I’m trying to make is some of his 
20 
actions whether it’s on the 8th of December or the 26th of December 2017 with the then 
Chairman, they both knew that at the very least if they could, unless it’s a matter of life 
and death, they could hold this unless it was as I finally settled that it was let’s get, 
whatever we can get in the basket the supermarket is about to close.  So – and when 
we meet him he tells us everything but this particular matter, which – that was 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 94 of 115 
 
personally that was my major problem about it.  
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Thanks for that detail, so I take it that you were 
with Mr Phakamani when you met Mr Maritz?  
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Correct yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And then he tells you everything but the deal.  Before 
these charges were formally launched by Bowman’s on behalf of Eskom did you have 
an occasion to speak to Mr Maritz about this non-disclosure?  Did you confront him and 
find out why he did not tell you about this important deal? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  If not me personally Parliament would have 
because we had discussed this with Phakamani before we approached the four men 
10 
and told them that this is the problem, this is the seriousness at which we look at this 
thing, and we need to suspend and call him to -  he would have been told, I can’t recall 
whether I was in the same room when he was told that or Phakamani would have told 
him alone. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But you don’t recall? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  I don’t recall, but I know he was told. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright, and you then – sorry I stopped you when you 
were about to deal with the details of the charges on page 108, paragraph 1.1, I would 
like you continue and indicate what were the elements of the factual grounding relating 
to the charge. 
20 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Thank you, just to confirm he did not see these 
charges for the first time on this letter, he was told what was wrong that he was going to 
be suspended, he was told, this followed having been told by Phakamani that. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Give us some sense of what you personally know before 
this letter was sent to him? 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 95 of 115 
 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Well I – once we got to be aware of this which 
was – there’s a commitment by Eskom to take a loan of about 1.5billion Dollars if I’m 
not mistaken from a China based company, this Warong was going to be agent that 
facilitated that for that service of facilitation there was a payment of what I still thought 
was 39million dollars but the numbers here must be more correct than what I think and 
when he was confronted he said – I think I was in the meeting – he said no he did not 
sign the agreement, he signed, he was told by Anoj Singh, the CFO who was on 
suspension I think at the time to sign this, who signed the timesheet, his was to honour 
the details of the timesheet and at certain stages of this there was communication 
between the Chairman, Mr Khoza, and him that kept on asking actually as recent as the 
10 
Thursday before we were appointed to say have you executed the decision of the 
Board to pay these people in which he had not yet, so when he finally did it would 
appear that he did it on the Thursday or the Friday before we were appointed on the 
Sunday, so which made this more problematic for us that you’ve just done this and you 
should have known that you should not, so that was his part in it, but the main 
agreement was not yet signed, which case we suspended him and we him through this 
disciplinary hearing and he was charged and two days were set aside to the 8th and the 
9th for the hearing I think he resigned before the start of March.  
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  March 20? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  The dates set for the hearing was 8 and 9 March 
20 
2018, I think he resigned before the end of February, barely a week after we had 
confronted him with the charges.  Ja, the Bowman letter to him was the 27 th of 
February, I can go and find exactly the date when he resigned but it was definitely 
before the 8th and the 9th of March. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Yes, so he resigns before the commencement of the 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 96 of 115 
 
proceedings. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Of the proceedings yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, what we don’t have in this bundle is any possible 
explanation or response of Mr Maritz to these charges and I assume that for the 
present purposes the Chairperson will rely on what you explained to him from the 
verbal discussions you had with Mr Maritz.   
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Ja, Mr Maritz was suspended on the 31st of 
January 2018 which is nine days since we came in office, charges were presented to 
him as we see in the letter on the 27th of February 2018, his hearing was scheduled to 
sit from the 8th and the 9th of March.  He resigned with immediate effect on the day he 
10 
received this notice, on the 27th of February, it should say 2018 here, not 2017. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair you will hear a lot about Warong on the 1st and the 
4th of March through the evidence which will be presented by my colleague, Ms 
Norman.  Mr Maritz has not responded to these charges, but they reflect fundamental 
questions around State Capture and he is one of those persons who we would ask to 
invoke a three turn power to tell you his versions about these thing.  Mr Mabuza is there 
anything that you want to add in relation to Mr Maritz involvement in Warong? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Except related to him once he was not in our 
employ we could do no more either than handing the matter to the SIU and the Hawks 
for possible criminal charges and for us to then pursue civil claims against him, for his 
20 
acts or omission, that’s relative to him.  We have since received letters of demand from 
Warong which demand we have refused to honour and we told them they are not, we 
don’t owe them anything, they are not entitled to it.  They have threatened, they have – 
we said that’s fine, so that’s where that is.  Recently I think I got a letter from their 
Chairman from China wanting to have coffee at which point I told him no, there is no 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 97 of 115 
 
coffee to be had, Mr Phakamani has told your people that we have no relationship with 
you, there is no need to have coffee with you, to the extent you feel you have got a 
claim please do what you must.  That’s where the matter is at.  So we have not paid the 
39million dollars or the 340million dollars  - Rands, neither did we take the 1.5 if that’s 
the number billion dollars as a loan.  So far we’re waiting for the claim. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Has Warong not declared an arbitration, a dispute 
against you, against Eskom? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  They said they would, they said they would, as I 
said the last communication I remember was from the Chairman of the holding 
company in the China saying let’s – sure this is something we can talk about over 
10 
coffee, I did not think so. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  As a matter of interest what we read in the newspapers 
about Transnet is that its Board had authorised a civil suit against former executives or 
even present executives who had exposed Transnet to all sorts of financial losses.  
From your part what has the Board done in regard to persons who are now beyond its 
reach by reason of termination of employment relationship, so far as the losses Eskom 
may have suffered by reason of their ill-conduct? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Chairman without sounding like we think we’ve 
done better than anybody to the extent they were employees we have tried to 
discipline, when they resigned we could not follow that.  To the extent we could pursue 
20 
criminal charges we have done as in the papers it would become evidence that there 
are case numbers for that, and we have handed that matter to the various law 
enforcement agencies.  We have not yet laid any civil action, which does not mean we 
don’t intend to, we will.  Furthermore we had thought we should prioritise getting the 
money, so we have been able to have vent one billion Rands that we did get back from 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 98 of 115 
 
McKinsey.  We are in the course of getting the other 600million from Trillion, we have 
not paid the 340million dollars here, so ja I think Transnet gives us a good action to 
aspire to and we are committed to do that, but for now if it’s cold comfort we have 
managed to put R1.1billion to be exact in Eskom’s bank accounts, and we will continue 
to use all the various processes to get whatever was stolen from Eskom and we will 
continue when we can’t on the criminal basis pursue civil charges.  This not yet 
finished. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, no thank you very much and we are grateful to hear 
that there are effective civil processes to recover whatever was lost, at least to some 
degree.  Chair I have explored the back-end of the disciplinary processes, I am now 
10 
going to jump to the front-end and the reason why we started at the back-end was 
simply to give a perspective of someone who was in the employ of Eskom at the time 
when the new Board came in, and how the new Board dealt with him, so with your 
leave I would go then back to Section 2 of Part A which begins at page 5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you, you may proceed. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Mr Mabuza what is that document on page 5? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Which page 5? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The very bundle that we are working on, if you page it 
backwards to the front of it, under Section 2. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Page 5 in this number, oh here, got it.  Yes these 
20 
are – is a letter from Bowman’s to Mr Koko laying – putting charges to him. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The date of that letter? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  The date of this letter is the 7th of January, 
February 2018. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright, you will see that the date of that letter comes 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 99 of 115 
 
almost two to three weeks before the charges against Mr Maritz that we have 
previously dealt with, so as matter of sequence I assume that you authorised Bowman 
to initiate disciplinary processes on your behalf against Mr Koko before Mr Maritz? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Correct Mr Chairman and if its – if it helps as 
indicated when we came in there was a list of seven names, of these seven names I 
personally have not met a number of these people.  The one that I met was the A, Mr 
Maritz, who was in office and the other one who is on this list that I have since met was 
Mr Mashigo who got reinstated after being suspended when we had arrived, so I think 
it’s important that I mention most of these people that are here were not at Eskom when 
we arrived.  Mr Koko was not at Eskom when we arrived, owing to a previous 
10 
disciplinary process that he had challenged, the only interaction we were to have with 
Mr Koko was when the Labour Court ordered that he be reinstated and we respected 
the court order and he was reinstated and he was coming back to Eskom, at which 
case I would have met him, so as it is I have never met him, but he was reinstated and 
was supposed to start I guess on the Wednesday or the Monday, or the day he was 
supposed to come back he was in Parliament, so he couldn’t come on that Wednesday, 
he was going to come the following Monday, but by this time we as the Eskom Board 
had taken the view that the disciplinary hearing from which he has been cleared from 
was a sham, but we could not defy a court order.  We decided we were going to place 
charges in front of him and the disciplinary process that is not a sham, and not a spray 
20 
and pray charges, there were other charges that were being spoken of, one of which 
was the Impulse, we chose not to, we picked the four that we thought would stick and 
we presented them to him, and we viewed them serious enough that we did not think it 
was worth him coming to the office and then suspend him, we told him this is serious 
enough that don’t come here, go to the disciplinary hearing on the appointed date, yes, 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 100 of 115 
 
and that date did come and we can get to talk about the charges and I would love to 
talk about those charges. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes I can see that you are getting worked-up, but we will 
get to them.  Mr Mabuza you said that the previous charges were a sham, in what 
sense? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  I don’t know Eskom processes but those charges 
there’s no way they would have stuck, as I said I read in the newspapers that he was 
being bad to appoint  his own, the Chairman to prosecute him, and it was bad when it is 
convenient for him and as it stand out I was not surprised when the charges could not 
stick, but this time we were clear that we are going to take due process, get an 
10 
independent Chairman, describe the charges in a manner that was not ambiguous, very 
laser-pointed, we were not surprised that it turned out the way it did. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, and I see that the letter that we’re dealing with on 
page 5 was addressed to Mr Oscar Gani, who is Mr Gani? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Mr Oscar Gani is the lawyer of record 
representing Mr Koko. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And I see that a number of people were copied, one of 
them is Mr Cassiem, who is Mr Cassiem and why was he copied? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Mr Cassiem was copied I think because he was 
going to be the independent Chairman we would have asked Advocate Cassiem to 
20 
chair this. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright, so it’s not in dispute that Mr Gani got this letter 
together with the charges on behalf of his client. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Let’s deal with the essence of the charges, or if not the 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 101 of 115 
 
text of them, depending on how you want to deal with them, I don’t want to constrain 
you.  They begin on page 6 and I would like you to deal with charge one. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Thank you Chairman, I would love to and I will try 
to be as slow so that I can hear myself.  Charge one: 
“You breached your duties and responsibility as Executive and/or acted in a 
conflict of interest with your position and/or in breach of item 2.35 of the 
Code and/or you conducted yourself in a way that is unacceptable in terms 
of Eskom’s values and ethics and in particular in breach of Clause 3.2.6.2 of 
the Code of Ethics procedure 32 to 757, prohibiting the distribution of 
confidential Eskom documents to any third party in that between at least July 
10 
2015 and November 2015 you distributed from your Eskom email account 
and your personal email account and/or failed to take steps to prevent such 
distribution using your personal email account highly confidential Eskom 
documents including contractual negotiation memoranda, a letter to the 
Minister of Public Enterprises, a financial spreadsheet and minutes of the 
Executive Committee of the Eskom Board to a third party.  This breaches 
Eskom’s policies and procedures and amounts to amongst other things a 
serious breach of fiduciary duties.” 
Before I step off charge one I would, the third tab after this so that I complete my story, 
relates to the same charge it is just better articulated and more detailed under that page 
20 
39, this is the charge to Suzanne Daniels, it is the same charge, but here it is with 
going into a bit of detail, because the same charge. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So both of them are facing ...(intervention)  
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  The same charge. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay. 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 102 of 115 
 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:   The same charge.  So as I was at the point of 
saying: 
“...failed to take steps to prevent distribution using your personal email of 
highly confidential Eskom documents to a third party, including draft 
statements from the Chairperson of Eskom, a draft contractual document 
and 
a 
draft 
letter 
to 
the 
email 
address 
businessmaninfoportalone@zoho.com.  This breaches Eskom policies and 
procedures amongst other things a serious breach of your fiduciary duties to 
Eskom.  Based on information accessed from the server mains of Mr Koko 
and 
information 
in 
the 
public 
domain 
the 
email 
address 
10 
businessmaninfoportalone@zoho.com is likely to be the email address of Mr 
Salim Issa, an associate of the Gupta family and the shareholder in a 
number of companies involved in supplying Eskom goods and services, 
including Tegeta and Trillion.  You also received an implemented input on the 
drafting of an Eskom public statement regarding contracts linked to the 
Gupta family from this person.  This too breaches the Eskom policy and 
procedures amounts amongst other things to a serious breach of your 
fiduciary duties to Eskom.” 
So Eskom believes that businessmaninfoportalone@zoho.com is likely to be the email 
of Mr Salim Issa, and we have provided the Commission with documentation that 
20 
comes out of these various servers to this effect. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair you remember when we addressed you on 
Wednesday we referred to the report of Fundudzi which mentioned this email address. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And we were quite careful not to pin down a specific 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 103 of 115 
 
name as the addressee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, you just mentioned that you – its importance would be apparent 
later, yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, and Eskom’s investigations and the evidence of the 
Chairperson based on the investigation is that that email belongs to a specific individual 
whose name is now mentioned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   We will get to the details.  I may mention that on 
Monday I will give you another bundle of detailed emailed documentation that was 
given to us this morning by the lawyers of Eskom, I have not looked at it, but let’s deal 
10 
with the Chairperson’s knowledge of these matters as arising from the charge sheet 
that we are dealing with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Mr Mabuza before we step off charge one on page 6 
which you have now linked with charged one from page 39 to page 40. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can I ask you some few questions of clarity, because 
the charge talks in general terms as it refers to a number of individuals.  The first thing 
is that it relates to contractual memoranda in a letter to the Minister of Public Enterprise 
and financial spreads and minutes of the Executive Committee of the Board.  Can I 
20 
elicit some details to the extent that you are able to help us on these generalities?  First 
thing first, who was the Minister of Public Enterprises at the time, who is referred to in 
this charge? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  At the time the Minister of Public Enterprise was 
Minister Lynne Brown. 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 104 of 115 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And the negotiating memoranda that you refer to here to 
which negotiations did they relate? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  These negotiations were related in part to 
Tegeta, Optimum Coal.  They were related McKinsey these ones specifically was 
relating to McKinsey.  The public would remember that there was time when there were 
various pulling and pushing within Eskom about to settle, to charge or not to charge 
McKinsey.  So these relate to that and their appointment or otherwise of Trillian linked 
to that as a sub-contractor.  This was predominantly about the McKinsey Trillian 
appointment. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  As far as we were able to pick up from the reports 
10 
we have presented to the Chairperson.  Negotiations with McKinsey relating to the so 
called top engineers project began in April 2015.  Are you able to place some context 
as to whether the memoranda you referring to insofar as they dealt with the 
negotiations? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Not with specific details. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Not specifically.  Alright and then the financial 
spreadsheet and minutes of the executive committee of the board that you referred to 
are you able to just give us a snapshot of – at what point in time did they relate to? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Let me find that. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I am at page 6 of the… 
20 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  I need to find this actual detail.  Thank you.  In – 
on – if I can just go through a few of those points. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Ja give us the page first. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  On page 27. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  27. 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 105 of 115 
 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  I am dealing with paragraph 15. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  15.1 is it – can I proceed?  May I proceed Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may proceed 15.1 you said. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Yes Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.

ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.   
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  So these are the details Mr Chairman relating to 
that charge 1 about the McKinsey Consultants Engineers as we now got to realise and 
a little bit more. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Before we leave the emails one of them that strikes me 
as odd and I may be uninformed is paragraph 15.8.  This talks about load shedding 
review and way forward.  We will obviously look at Annexure SM18.  But insofar as 
context is important to the question that I would like to pose to you is that you would – 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 109 of 115 
 
do you know whether Eskom sometime in April commissioned an entity called Dentons 
to assist it with all the problems it had that led to load shedding.  Do you know about 
that exercise undertaking by the board of Eskom at the time? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  I know of it from public report.  As you would 
recall I was not inside Eskom but yes I have heard about the Dentons, the Bowmans 
Report yes I have heard about it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. We have presented to the Chairperson a copy of 
that Bowman Report and we owe him a summarised executive version of it.  The 
Dentons Report recommended a number of remedial measures arising from its findings 
relating to the problems of load shedding at Eskom.  At the time I wonder whether you 
10 
as a new board have heard on occasion to reflect what are the problems that Eskom is 
encountering which are the primary or contributory causes to load shedding and I ask 
that question in the context of the fact that load shedding did not end in 2008 when it 
was picked up by NERSA in 2015 when Bowman was called upon and commissioned to 
investigate it still persists now?  So my question is have you as a board had occasion to 
reflect on the primary causes of load shedding? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Chairman load shedding is what is currently 
happening and we have experienced it in the term of this board.  Towards the end of 
December last year prior to that we had experienced it at the back of the industrial 
action we have had in June/July.  We have seen it in the last about ten days ago for an 
20 
extended period of about five days.  We started to get involved in dealing with this issue 
of load shedding in the December incidences that occurred wherein the operational 
team was kicked into gear.  We addressed the public and we undertook that we will do 
all we can with what is now famously known as the Nine Point Plan to ensure that we 
do not have load shedding until the 15 January at least and we can come back and 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 110 of 115 
 
take stock now. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.   
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  But maybe at this point I need to and we have 
covered this at some detail earlier that it is important and this not an excuse or 
obfuscation of any nature.  It is important to just remember what were the issues facing 
Eskom at that time when this board was put in office to come and address those issues.  
We have dealt with those issues extensively and they are by and large about liquidity 
going concern financial issues.  So it therefore stands to reason that the problem 
statement being financial issues, ethical issues, clean-up issues it is – that being the 
problem statement the solution had to be find people that would deal with this problem 
10 
that was in hand.  So the Deputy President at the time and the government I think did 
what they had to do to deal with the problem statement at the time.  What we are now 
having is not the problem that we had at the time.  Maybe we should have foreseen it.  
So what that is now calling for is seeing in the public domain comments about the 
competence or the ability or otherwise of people in the leadership of Eskom to deal with 
these operational and technical issues clearly that is not what they – skills they are 
endowed with.  Now knowing what we now know I think we need to saying we need to 
get people of skills either to augment or replace the current the skill set if we agreed 
that the purpose for which the skill set was brought in had been sorted out and if it does 
rematch we will deal with it then and make space for people that have got the skills that 
20 
are required to do so to address issues of an operational nature – of a technical nature.  
And really I do not claim anything more than understanding the mechanics of how an 
engine a differential and a gear box mechanically move wheels of a taxi and how fuel 
and combustion works.  Which I can just assume that that is what happens when you 
put fire to boiled water to generate steam to turn a turbine.  But I do not – I have no

ability about that.  So it does concern us which is why whilst dealing with issues of 
funding of sustainability of the organisation we will have to continue to engage all the 
stakeholders in the financial community but also on the other side we need to now deal 
with the issues of operation, issues of the Eskom plant that is on average 38 years.  
Issues of the non-maintenance of these.  Over the last five years various leadership of 
Eskom have taken the decision to spend half of what they had to spend on 
maintenance.  Now things mechanical they do wear and tear.  These are big 
mechanical things that have had big wears and tears and the effect of them has been 
that much devastating to the economy, the existing economy but the investments that 
the country is trying to attract without the energy to fuel that.  So we have been 
10 
engaging as I said Chairman we are engaging various stakeholders on the one side to 
deal with viability financial staff.  The operation, the people issues but now there are 
these operational mechanical and technical issues and many South Africans have 
responded to the Thuma Mina by raising their hands.  The Engineering Community 
have raised their hands to say we are here.  The Academic Community have raised 
their hands.  Previous employees of Eskom have come forward and say – and the 
minister would have made certain announcement about these to say you need to 
assemble this team send them to the sites to do audits of the state and the condition of 
the plant factually to be able to know the state of the plant given what they were set out 
to produce relative to what they producing which is clearly less and why they are 
20 
producing and what to do to make them produce what they were set up to produce.  
This is both on the old plants the 38 year old plants and then new built plants that it has 
become clear that they are not producing that which they were built to produce for a 
variety of reasons and how to get them to that level both in terms of what actual work 
needs to be done to the equipment and what technical skills need to be done to this 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 112 of 115 
 
equipment and also to get in a little bit more detail to check has it got anything with the 
quality, the quantity or its peoples’ skills or lack thereof.  So these – and I will – most of 
the other people that have responded to Thuma Mina.  I have seen some of the offers 
on tweets that says Eskom must do this this coming weekend.  So we are pulling all 
that together to try and address this to the extent we can and as I said the President 
has appointed a task team.  There is another cabinet committee.  We have heard now 
there is another chief restricting officer so there are a lot of people coming in to help.  
Clearly this problem cannot be solved by Eskom alone.  What I on behalf of the board 
that I lead want to say is to the extent we do not know what this is so that we do not 
understand the problem.  Chances are that we are unlikely to understand the solution 
10 
and to the extent we occupy spaces that can occupied by other South Africans that are 
responding to this Thuma Mina that can do that we are only too happy to do that.  And 
the shareholder knows our interest and commitment to not be obstructive but to be – 
because we do want to have this problem solved once and for all.  And indeed I have 
approached one of the law firms that had advised the government as way back as 2010 
– 2008 about what to do and they have given us the material.  We will send all that into 
the big pot where everybody is trying to find a solution.  And we will take the Dentons 
Report also into that mix. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Chair I see it is already four o’clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I spoke a few days ago maybe including yesterday.  I think 
20 
including yesterday about the fact that we may need to start early or finish later than 
normal in order to make sure that the time that we will lose on Monday afternoon is – 
we find those two hours somewhere. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1.  I do not know whether you might have had a chance to or a 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 113 of 115 
 
member of the legal team may have had a chance to discuss that with Mr Mabuza 
because he will still be giving evidence on Monday and what his attitude might be, his 
availability to start earlier or finish later.  So if not maybe this is the time to talk about 
that because if it suits everybody we could take another hour but obviously there is no 
point in taking another hour today if maybe he is going to finish about lunch time 
tomorrow I mean on Monday. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And therefore we would not need – we would have hours that we 
were not going to use anyway for the hearing. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you would have a better picture of what your estimate is in terms 
of when on Monday we might finish with his evidence and whether or not somebody 
has had a chance to discuss with him the possibility of finishing later or starting earlier. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair we agreed yesterday that today we will finish at 
four. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And Mr Mabuza is here his lawyers know that you did 
request that we should start earlier on Monday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I will prefer that we start earlier. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  On Monday. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Even though I am quite comfortable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  That we finish by lunch time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 114 of 115 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But I have been wrong before.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I think either you or somebody in the legal team was quite 
wrong a few days ago when he had quite a number of hours that we did not use. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But your assessment is that we should finish about lunch time on 
Monday. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But we – you suggest that it might be a good precaution to start 
earlier than ten o’clock on Monday. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes subject to Mr Mabuza’s availability. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes.  Mr Mabuza how is your situation if we were to start at nine 
on Monday would nine or half past nine would that be fine with you? 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  Mr Chairman I am good to go for another hour 
tonight. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  I am good to start an hour earlier on Monday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On Monday.   
MR JABULANE ALBERT MABUZA:  I will just need to juggle my doctor’s appointment 
because I too am a mechanical being.  I need to tell my doctors that I will do – try and 
see them in the afternoon or another date.  I am okay to start as early as is determined. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay no thank you for that.  Okay then we – you said that you 
would prefer that we do not take another hour now but we take it on Monday morning. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  On Monday yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is alright then.  We will adjourn now but on Monday we 
will start at nine. 
22 FEBRUARY 2019 – DAY 54 
 
Page 115 of 115 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and Chair before we adjourn can I ask for your 
permission to hand up copies of the email and associated documents referred to by Mr 
Mabuza. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is fine. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  They have made available to us this morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Two things I have not looked at them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Secondly they have not been paginated in line with the 
commissions closest [indistinct]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But I would like to hand up a copy to you so that you 
familiarise yourself with their contents over the weekend. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We will replace them on Monday when… 
CHAIRPERSON:  They have been paginated. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The appropriate pagination has been done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine.  That is fine thank you.  Zonika.  Thank you.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And Chair that would then conclude today’s proceedings 
subject to your direction. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no thank you.  We will then adjourn and then as I said we will 
resume at nine o’clock on Monday.  The commission adjourns. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 25 FEBRUARY 2019
