PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 03 NOVEMBER 2020 
CHAIRPERSON: 
  
Good 
morning 
Ms 
Hofmeyr, 
good 
morning everybody. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we ready? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  We are indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us start. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  If I can just confirm… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Kwinana you – the oath you took 
yesterday continues to apply today.  You understand that? 
10 
MS KWINANA:  It continues Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  If I can just check that Ms Mbanjwa is 
ready I see that she is still… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Moving some files. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja let her get settled first.  No, no that is 
fine.  No that is fine; that is fine. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Ms Kwinana  would like to move this 
morning to the 30% set aside policy which you referenced 
in your evidence yesterday and which I understand from 
your affidavit in response to the Chairperson’s Regulation 
10.6 Directive is something that you felt strongly about 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 4 of 279 
 
while you were at SAA, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Can you tell us about it – why you felt 
strongly about it; what it was envisaged to do? 
MS KWINANA:  It was intended to empower the black 
people and as we all know that South Africa – black South 
Africans have long been in a disadvantaged position and 
therefore the 30% set aside was intended to at least make 
sure that the gap is being bridged. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
10 
MS KWINANA:  And in fact as I said yesterday the 30% set 
aside was too little considering the demographics of South 
Africa. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So if it had been up to you it would have 
been more than 30%.  
MS KWINANA:  Oh yes definitely. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And I understand from your affidavit that 
you 
made 
particular 
reference 
to 
a 
memorandum 
of 
20 
understanding that was concluded with the Department of 
Trade and Industry.  Can I take you to that?   
MS KWINANA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair that is in Exhibit DD33 and it is 
back in Ms Kwinana’s affidavit which is Exhibit 1 there from 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 5 of 279 
 
page 4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And if you can just tell us about at page 
4 in your paragraph addressing at b which is entitled the 
30% set aside policy adopted by SAA during your tenure on 
the board of SAA.  You explain there the role that the MOU 
played; could you explain that to us today please? 
MS KWINANA:  I would need the copy of the MOU. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I am going to – it is actually the first 
annexure to your affidavit.  But Ms Kwinana you might be 
10 
aware the version that you gave us was a version that was 
unsigned and then we asked if you had a signed version 
and as we understood it from your representative Ms 
Mbanjwa you did not have a signed copy to hand, is that 
right? 
ADV MBANJWA:  That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So we managed to get a signed copy 
from the DTI.  So I would like to just beg leave to hand that 
up if I may?   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair I suggest that we mark it Exhibit 
DD33.22 because that will be the new numbering and then 
if I could also ask if we could just hand one to the legal 
representatives and Ms Kwinana.  Thank you so much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now Ms Kwinana please free to take a 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 6 of 279 
 
moment just to take a look at this.  This you will see on the 
last page of the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one second. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr you were asking me to admit 
this? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As Exhibit DD33.2? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Sorry point 22 apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  22? 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Okay. 
 
The 
memorandum 
of 
understanding between the Department of Trade and 
Industry and the South African Airways … 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair we might want to say signed on 18 
May 2015 because that is the signature date. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is what I was looking for. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Sorry it is on the last page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am looking for the date here. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Signed by – did they sign on the same 
date? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  There is not a date filled in by Ms Myeni. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
But 
there 
is 
actually 
later 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 7 of 279 
 
correspondence that refers to the 18 May. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So I am fairly confident. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I say the memorandum of understanding 
between the Department of Trade and Industry and the 
South African Airways SOC LTD signed by Mr Mzwandile 
Masina Deputy Minister on the 18 May 2015 and signed by 
Ms Dudu Myeni Chairperson of the SA board is admitted as 
Exhibit DD33.22. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair I am indebted.  Ms 
10 
Kwinana have you had a chance to look at this version? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  So if you could just tell us 
what role this memorandum of understanding on your 
version played in the 30% set aside? 
MS KWINANA:  This memorandum if you read in the 
record. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Maybe 
shall 
we 
start 
with 
getting 
clarification whether it is exactly the same as the unsigned 
one that she provided or are there differences? 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  There are some differences yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes material? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright.  No I just wanted to 
know. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 8 of 279 
 
MS KWINANA:  So why do you not give me both of them? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I said where the other was.  It is your 
annexure to your affidavit it is Tab 2 at page 11. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I interrupted while Ms Kwinana was trying 
to answer a question.  I am sorry.  So you can continue Ms 
Kwinana with your answer. 
MS KWINANA:  Chair considering the fact that Ms Hofmeyr 
is saying there are material differences between the two 
can she point it to me those differences so that I can be 
able to respond. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine she will do that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So you see the challenge we had when 
the unsigned version was provided as an annexure to your 
affidavit was that on its face it appeared to be incomplete 
and I will give you an example.  If you go to page 15 of 
your bundle DD33 and you look at Clause 4 there – 4.1.   
ADV MBANJWA:  Sorry the reference again? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Page 15- 15 of Exhibit DD33 which is 
within the memorandum of understanding that Ms Kwinana 
provided to the commission.  Admittedly she confirmed she 
20 
did not have the signed version.  But his version do you 
see on page 15 at Clause 4.1.5 there is a question mark? 
MS KWINANA:  Page 15 4. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  1.5 
MS KWINANA:  Yes 4.1.5. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 9 of 279 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Do you see that there is a question mark 
there? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And then also further down on the page 
you will see at Clause 4.2.6 it is open – it is left blank. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So when the commission received this 
from you our impression was that this was unlikely to be 
the final version.  Would you share that impression? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.  So when I say there are material 
differences there are differences because this I think we 
can all accept is in a less than complete version and then 
the signed version that we were able to obtain is the 
completed version.  Do you see that? 
MS KWINANA:  Hm. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  If you will just say yes. 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  So if I could then return to 
my question.  What role… 
20 
MS KWINANA:  Sorry before you go to the question.  Are 
you saying those are the only differences between this 
signed version and the unsigned version? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes the clauses that seem to have been 
not completed on the version that you provided to the 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 10 of 279 
 
commission are then filled out in the signed version. 
MS KWINANA:  Oh I see those are the two differences? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS KWINANA:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  So if we can return to the 
question.  What role did the MOU in your understanding 
play in the 30% set aside policy? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe do you… 
MS KWINANA:  Then I will stick to the unsigned version 
which I saw.  Can I quickly read it? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh well that is – that is what I wanted to 
find out whether you ever saw the signed one? 
MS KWINANA:  No Chair I will stick to the unsigned 
version that I submitted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but did you or did you never see the 
signed one before? 
MS KWINANA:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it the first time you see it? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  I just wanted to clear that. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Ms Kwinana are you sure that you did not 
signed version because if you are not sure you may want to 
say you are not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But if you are sure please do tell us. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 11 of 279 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You are absolutely sure you did not see 
the signed version? 
MS KWINANA:  I am sure I did not see the signed version. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I am – I am sorry what was that last 
sentence? You – did you… 
MS KWINANA:  Chair I did not see the signed version. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MS KWINANA:  I will stick the unsigned version. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Do you want Ms Hofmeyr to 
repeat the question or you still remember it? 
MS KWINANA:  Can she allow me to read the unsigned 
version first because I was reading the signed version 
Chair?  So can she allow me to read the unsigned version 
and then she repeats the question after I have read the 
unsigned version? 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you would have read the unsigned 
version when you sent – when you attached it to your 
affidavit. 
20 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair I want to read it again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
MS KWINANA:  I want to read it again Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was the question Ms Hofmeyr how the 
MOU influenced her decision or the board’s decision? 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 12 of 279 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  It influenced the 30% set aside policy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Because I understood her affidavit to say 
it did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay have a look then Ms Kwinana. 
MS KWINANA:  Thanks Chair.  In fact Chair all this record 
here from number 1 to number 7. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the unsigned MOU? 
MS KWINANA:  On the unsigned MOU. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Aha what about it? 
10 
MS KWINANA:  Supports the black economic empowerment 
basically. Now as I said in my affidavit the 30% set aside is 
intended to make sure that it bridges the gap between the 
blacks and the whites so to say. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes but I am – I am focussing in on the 
30% 
set 
aside. 
 
Where 
in 
this 
memorandum 
of 
understanding is the 30% set aside identified? 
MS KWINANA:  It is not going to talk about the 30% set 
aside as the others – the other companies implement 51%.  
The others which implement 30%.  The others which 
20 
implement – so basically what this means is the guideline 
and then the implementation therefore the 30% that we 
were talking about at SAA is the implementation of this 
MOU. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Ms Kwinana is it your evidence that when 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 13 of 279 
 
in 
other 
SOE’s 
there 
was 
a 
focus 
on 
providing 
opportunities to bidders or suppliers who were more – 51% 
or more let us call it broadly black owned that was the 
same as the 30% set aside policy that SAA adopted. 
MS KWINANA:  It may not be implemented exactly the 
same but the end result I would think that it is intended to 
achieve the same objectives. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes but the implementation is quite 
important because I – as I understand and it is reflected in 
the name set aside.  The idea and we have had evidence 
10 
on jet fuel and how it played out in jet fuel and we have 
had evidence on how it was playing out in Swiss Port was 
that 30% of contracts would be directed to those who 
qualified for being BEEE partners of the main contractor.  
Have I described it accurately? 
MS KWINANA:  How you intended to implement it if – if we 
were successful in implementing it?  Remember that we 
were not successful in implementing this 30% set aside.  
And therefore if we were successful this is how we would 
like it to be implemented. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS KWINANA:  We would say for instance cleaning has 
been done by a white only company previously and then we 
would say 30% of that cleaning when the tender comes 
30% of that cleaning should be set aside so that black 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 14 of 279 
 
people can participate in the 30% set aside.  That is how 
we intended to implement it - they did not being met with 
resistance. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right.  And it was met with resistance we 
will come to that in a moment.  But do I have your evidence 
to be the MOU itself does not speak to the 30% set aside, 
is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:  The MOU talks about the promotion of 
economic opportunities to previously disadvantaged South 
Africans which basically would be implemented by putting 
10 
aside the 30%. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS KWINANA:  So basically much as it does not talk 
exactly about the 30% Chair but the whole aim is exactly 
the same. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Hm.  But you faced resistance both from 
National Treasury and from the DTI when you tried to 
implement the 30% because they said that would be 
unlawful, did they not? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And part of the reason I suggest that they 
would have said it was unlawful was because of a term of 
the MOU that was signed.  So let me take you to that if I 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 15 of 279 
 
may?  It is the one that we have handed in this morning 
and that has been marked as Exhibit DD33.22.  You see 
those clauses that were not complete on the unsigned 
version that you gave us are completed on the signed 
version and you will find them at Clause 5 which is headed 
Obligations of the Parties. 
MS KWINANA:  Sorry 33? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Ms Kwinana it is the document handed up 
this morning so it will not be in your file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The signed one.  The signed one. 
10 
MS KWINANA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The signed one ja – clause 5. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Find that and you need to find Clause 5 
in that agreement.  Do you have it? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  It begins with Clause 5.1 with the DTI’s 
obligations and then at 5.2 it sets out SAA’s obligations.  
Do you see that? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And if you go over the page to Clause 
20 
5.2.3 could you read for us what is recorded there as 
SAA’s obligations? 
MS KWINANA:   
“Engaged 
with 
suppliers 
who 
have 
expressed an interest in supplying goods 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 16 of 279 
 
and services to SAA within the selected 
product 
categories 
to 
gain 
insight 
into 
challenges experienced and to expedite 
resolution to such challenges.  All such 
engagements 
remains 
subject 
to 
SAA’s 
Supply Chain Management Policy and due 
Procurement Processes.” 
ADV HOFMEYR:    So it is based on that clause that I say 
the DTI and National Treasury regarded the 30% set aside 
as unlawful.  Because what SAA was obliged to do here 
10 
was to comply with Supply Chain Management and due 
procurement process and as I understand the advice that 
SAA received from National Treasury and the DTI this 
section 30% set aside policy would not be in line with 
those requirements.  Is that your understanding as well? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second.  Ms Mbanjwa. 
ADV MBANJWA:  I just wanted – thank you Chair if Ms 
Hofmeyr could also read for the witness paragraph 5.24 of 
20 
the document.  Thank you. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Paragraph 5.2.4 reads: 
“Review existing contracts of SAA in order 
to develop a transformation road maps for 
selected procurement categories” 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 17 of 279 
 
Do you have a comment on that? 
MS KWINANA:  No Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  So we have the same 
understanding of National Treasury’s basis for resisting the 
30% set aside policy.  If 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second Ms Hofmeyr.  Ms Mbanjwa 
with regard to that when you re-examine you could say 
when Ms Hofmeyr read to you this is what she read but 
read this section and then see what the witness has to say.  
So it could easily go into re-examine.  Okay alright.  Let us 
10 
continue. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
So 
we 
– 
both 
have 
the 
same 
understanding that National Treasury and the DTI regarded 
the 
set 
aside 
policy 
as 
unlawful 
because 
it 
was 
inconsistent 
with 
the 
existing 
procurement 
policy 
framework and legislation.  And so I wanted to ask you why 
then did you persist in implementing it or seeking to 
implement it? 
MS KWINANA:  Chair we wrote to National Treasury and 
requested for guidance in respect of this implementation of 
20 
the set aside.  It should still be noted or maybe again be 
noted that we could not implement the 30% set aside.  We 
wrote a letter to National Treasury to say we need 
guidance yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  They responded and said it is unlawful.  
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 18 of 279 
 
So why did you persist in trying to implement it? 
MS KWINANA:  Chair we wrote – we did not implement the 
30% set aside.  We did not implement the 30% set aside.  
We wrote to National Treasury and said we needed 
guidance on how to implement this 30% set aside. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.   
MS KWINANA:  We did not implement the 30% set aside. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
No 
I 
did 
not 
ask 
whether 
you 
implemented it.  I said; after National Treasury said to you 
it is unlawful why did you try to implement it? 
10 
MS KWINANA:  No, no, no we tried to implement it before 
we were reprimanded by National Treasury. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Okay well let us look at that.  Let us got 
to the letter from National Treasury and for that purpose 
you will need to go to Exhibit DD19 – 19[a].    
MS KWINANA:  DD19.  Sorry where do I get DD19? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Oh it is just on your right hand – left 
hand side Ms Kwinana they were put there in anticipation 
this morning.   
MS KWINANA:  19? 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  19 and then where we will need to go in 
19 is page 132.16.  So 132.16.   
MS KWINANA:  132.16. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.  Before we look at the letter I would 
just like to spend a moment on the evidence of Dr Dahwa 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 19 of 279 
 
before this commission.  Did you follow that evidence? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You did.  Dr. Dahwa gave evidence to the 
commission that he had concerns about the unlawfulness 
of the 30% set aside policy.  Were you aware that he had 
those concerns? 
MS KWINANA:  No Chair he did not say that when we were 
trying to implement the 30% set aside. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  He did not … 
MS KWINANA:  The concerns I had the concerns in this 
10 
commission because Dr Dahwa was going with us in 
respect of this whole empowerment and we were not aware 
that he was concerned.  And in fact if he was concerned he 
would tell us why and then correct and guide us so that we 
could successfully implement the 30% set aside. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Well his version before the commission is 
that he had a lengthy engagement with you and Ms Myeni 
on Friday the 2 October in which he made it clear to you 
that he could not in his conscience sign letters that would 
facilitate the 30% set aside.  Are you saying that none of 
20 
that evidence was true? 
MS KWINANA:  That is not true Chair.  Where would be the 
letters – where – the letters that he would sign where 
would they be coming from?  I am not aware of those 
letters that he would sign. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 20 of 279 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Okay because he said in his evidence 
that one of the reasons he was concerned about the set 
aside policy were these very letters that we are going to go 
to. 
 
The 
National 
Treasury 
letter 
and 
the 
BBBEE 
Commissioner ’s letter from the DTI.  You said that you did 
not continue to seek to implement the 30% set aside policy 
after receiving the National Treasury letter and I said to 
you that we would go and see whether that was indeed the 
case.  Because you will see at page 132.16 that is the 
National Treasury letter.  Can you tell us what it is dated? 
10 
MS KWINANA:  Chair before that can I get copies of those 
letters that Dr Dahwa did not want to sign? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well for now you are not being asked 
about them.  Just tell – read the date of that letter and 
then if and when it is important to deal with those letters 
we will take it from there.  Ms Mbanjwa. 
ADV MBANJWA:  Thank you Chair.  Chair I would like us 
to get an undertaking that we would receive those letters.  
I do not want to hold the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Wait those letters might not really be 
20 
important for now.  So let us see if and when they are 
important. 
ADV MBANJWA:  Yes but Chair they go to the probity of 
the evidence of Dr Dahwa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but just wait for now.  The question 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 21 of 279 
 
is about something else.  It is about what date this letter 
is.  Ms Kwinana do you want to – to read the date of that 
letter – that letter from National Treasury. 
MS KWINANA:  The date is 28 September 2015 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That is the date we were focussed on 
yesterday because I said that there was a fateful week at 
the end of September early October 2015.  28 September 
is the date on which the board of SAA met and you made 
that decision to cancel the LSG Sky Chefs award and give 
10 
it to Air Chefs.  Do you recall that? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So that was the Monday of the week.  
This letter comes from National Treasury could you tell us 
who at National Treasury writes this letter? 
MS KWINANA:  Ms Mpshe. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No it is written by somebody from the 
National Treasury who is that? 
MS KWINANA:  Oh Kenneth Brown Chief Procurement 
Officer. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And he is addressing it to? 
MS KWINANA:  To Ms Mpshe. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Who was the acting Chief Executive 
Officer of SAA at the time, correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 22 of 279 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And what I would like to just focus on 
there is it is the response to the letter.  That is the letter 
where you sought guidance, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:  No Chair.  This is not the letter that we 
sought guidance.  In fact how it happened was when we 
were trying to implement the 30% set aside in the 
newspapers Bidvest was complaining that they are forced 
to 30% set aside and so on and so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who was complaining? 
MS KWINANA:  Bidvest. Bidvest. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair.  And then we received the 
letters from National Treasury and from DTI.  And saying 
that they have been informed about this 30% set aside.  
And then we responded as the board.  So basically this is 
not the letter that we responded to.  We responded to as 
the board to Kenneth Brown because he wrote us a letter 
not this one but he wrote us a letter and then we 
responded. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I think you might be confusing this with 
20 
the letter of the BEE Commissioner but we will come back 
to that.  This one says in the 3 – the third paragraph. 
“Decisions that are taken by the board to 
encourage transformation in procurement 
are commendable.  However the SAA board 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 23 of 279 
 
must not operate outside the procurement 
legal framework.  The resolution of the 
board to set aside the 30% in its current 
form is not supported by any procurement 
legal framework and must be stopped with 
immediate effect.” 
Let us just stop there for a moment.  The board had 
already taken by this stage a resolution to implement the 
30% set aside had it not? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.  As I have it that was on around the 
25 August 2015.  Does that accord with your recollection? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 Yes. 
 
So 
you 
decided 
you 
were 
implementing it then there was this issue that was taken up 
and now Treasury as I have it unless you disagree with me 
is writing here to SAA addressed to their Chief Executive – 
Chief – acting Chief Executive Officer saying that  
“The resolution of the board to set aside the 
30% in its current form is not supported by 
20 
any procurement legal framework and must 
be stopped with immediate effect.  You are 
kindly requested to advise the board not to 
take procurement decisions that bring the 
name of SAA and National Treasury into 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 24 of 279 
 
disrepute.” 
And then he concludes by saying: 
“Kindly 
update 
me on the development 
around 
the 
30% 
set 
aside 
of 
key 
procurement transactions.” 
So both Ms Mpshe and Dr Dahwa indicated that this letter 
was brought to the board’s attention and despite that on 
the Friday of that same week there was an interaction with 
Dr Dahwa which we will get into in a moment.  Do you 
confirm that you met with him on Friday the 2 October 
10 
2015? 
MS KWINANA:  I cannot confirm Chair but as I said if you 
can give me the minutes of that meeting with Dr Dahwa I 
may be able to ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   As I understand it, there were no limits.  
He was called up to, I think it was the 6t h floor of the Airways 
Park Building on SMS from you.  Do you recall that? 
MS KWINANA:   An SMS from me? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MS KWINANA:   What did the SMS say? 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   His evidence was that he was called to a 
meeting on the 6t h floor of Airways Park Building.   
MS KWINANA:   What did the SMS say Chair? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, I am telling you his evidence.  His 
evidence is that the meeting – he was called to a meeting on 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 25 of 279 
 
the 6t h floor of Airways Park Building. 
MS KWINANA:   Via an SMS message? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, from you.   
MS KWINANA:   How do I call him by an SMS message? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That is not my question.  I am asking 
whether you sent it?  Whether you have any recollection of 
sending it? 
MS KWINANA:   No, I cannot call him via an SMS message.  
Definitely. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  And his evidence is that he began 
10 
a meeting with you and then you were joined by Ms Myeni.  
Do you recall that? 
MS KWINANA:   No. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So did this meeting take place at all on 
you recollection? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe Ms Hofmeyr ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   Maybe you can give me the minutes of the 
meeting so that I can remember that yes the meeting did 
take place and this is what was discussed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Kwinana, I have said that my 
understanding is that there are not any minutes of that 
meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  I thought maybe if you remind her 
what the issues were that were discussed at the meeting.  
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 26 of 279 
 
That might help her to remember. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If she remembers the meeting. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   H’m.  Well, she certainly has indicated 
already Chair that she did observe the evidence of Dr 
Dahwa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So this was setup there.  But let me do so 
for completeness purposes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And I summarise now.  And for the record, 
it appears in Dr Dahwa’s transcript on the 28t h of June 2019 
and it commences at page 168 of that transcript.  Dr 
Dahwa’s version of that day is broadly the following.   
 
That you sent him an SMS calling him to a meeting on 
the 6t h floor of Airways Park Building.  That you asked him 
how far he had got with implementing the 30% specified 
policy.  You asked in particular about Swissport.   
 
Ms Myeni walked into the meeting at a point and asked 
you for an update and you said that Dr Dahwa was not doing 
20 
enough to implement the strategy.   
 
Ms Myeni then said she wanted to advertise Dr Dahwa’s 
job.  He was then told to go back to his office to draft awards 
for the set aside for Swissport and for Engen.   
 
Swissport was the particular contract that would have 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 27 of 279 
 
involved the entity called Jammicron in the ground handling 
that was to be concluded with Swissport.  And so he went 
and he drafted letters of award but he refused to sign them 
because he said it was against his conscience to do so.   
 
And the chair then suggested that Ms Myeni, that it 
should be drafted for the acting CEO, Ms Mpshe to sign.  At 
that point, Ms Mpshe joined the meeting.   
 
You, Ms Myeni and as Dr Dahwa’s evidence goes, try to 
convince her to sign on the basis of telling her that 
Swissport was in favour of this arrangement.  And she 
10 
refused to sign it and eventually said that she had to leave 
because by now, the meeting was getting late in the day.   
 
And on Dr Dahwa’s version that it started in the morning 
and we were now towards the end of the day.  And his 
evidence is that when Ms Mpshe was leaving, she said the 
following to him.  Well, I am going to quote from Dr Dahwa’s 
transcript. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But he talks about what Ms Mpshe says 
but I will try and make that clear in how I convey it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So Dr Dahwa says this in his evidence 
before the Commission. 
“But before Ms Mpshe left Chair, I need to confirm.  
She said to me in front of the two board members 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 28 of 279 
 
that:  Dr Dahwa, you will be alone in court should 
this thing come back.  And if you know this is wrong, 
you do not do it.   
Ja, she insisted.   
And the chair tried to sweet-talk her and say:  No, 
but you know, if anything is to come back, it will 
come back to me as the chair.   
Then Ms Mpshe still insisted that:  Dr Dahwa, will all 
your qualifications, experience and credentials, you 
will have to answer to this one day and in my view, 
10 
if you content and if you are quite satisfied that it is 
the wrong to do, please do not do it.   
And off she went.” 
 
That was his evidence.  He described the day as 
involving psychological games.  He went on to give evidence 
to the Commission that he was told by Ms Myeni that the 
EFF would be there on the Monday at SAA and that they 
wanted to get rid of people like Dr Dahwa who were anti-
transformation because they – and that they wanted to get 
rid of Zimbabweans.   
20 
 
And he also testified that he – that you, Ms Kwinana, 
said to him that he and Ms Mpshe were going to suffer and 
that he would be disciplined.  So that is his version of what 
happened on that day.  What is your response? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think that is the day where he says the 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 29 of 279 
 
meeting started roundabout ten in the morning. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And by four o’clock the meeting was still 
continuing.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, they were still continuing and went 
on probably to six because that is when Ms Mpshe said she 
had to leave to go home. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So we calculated a total of eight hours on 
his version. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and if I am not mistaken, he said at 
some stage, I think, he was asked to go to his office and he 
cried or something. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   H’m.  He certainly spoke about being 
distressed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is right.  Being distressed.  Maybe 
he did not cry. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But he was very distressed ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...about the demands that he said were 
being made on him by Ms Kwinana and Ms Myeni. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
I 
think, 
ja. 
 That 
is 
the... 
 
Ja.  
Ms Kwinana, do you remember that meeting? 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 30 of 279 
 
MS KWINANA:   I do not remember the meeting at all Chair.  
That is why I was saying.  I am sure for such a long meeting 
that would start at ten o’clock and end at four o’clock, there 
would be minutes that would be approved by the people who 
are in that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana. 
MS KWINANA:   Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   If what Dr Dahwa says you and Ms Myeni 
were doing in that meeting to her, that was wrong.  And if 
you were doing something wrong, you are not going to have 
10 
minutes for that meeting, obviously.  So not every meeting 
has got minutes.  And certainly meetings where illegal things 
are being done, wrong things are being done – people do not 
keep minutes generally. 
MS KWINANA:   Definitely, Chair.  In this meeting I was to 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say you were not there? 
MS KWINANA:   I was not there.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you sure that you have a clear 
recollection that you were not at that meeting or is the 
20 
position that you cannot remember?  Maybe you were in that 
meeting, maybe you were not? 
MS KWINANA:   Definitely, Chair I was not in the meeting.  If 
I was in the meeting, I would remember that event. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So you do not have any recollection of him 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 31 of 279 
 
saying to you that his conscience would let him do that you 
were demanding of him? 
MS KWINANA:   Definitely no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But not...  But as I understand your 
evidence.  You are not saying you cannot recall.  You are 
saying that did not happen because you were not in that 
meeting. 
MS KWINANA:   That did not happen Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And did you ever come to learn that he 
was resisting signing letters of award to facilitate the 30% 
10 
set-aside policy because his conscience would not allow him 
to do that? 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, I do not even understand these 
letters of award that Dr Dahwa is talking about because the 
letter of award would emanate from a due procurement 
process.  So that is why I wanted to see these letters that 
Dr Dahwa is refusing to sign. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Kwinana, they would not emerge from 
a due procurement process because one of the contractors 
that you wanted to implement the 30% set-aside policy, was 
20 
Swissport.   
 
And as we traversed at length yesterday, in 2015 and 
2016 no procurement process was followed at for Swissport.  
So there would be no procurement process.   
 
What there was, on the evidence that we looked at 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 32 of 279 
 
yesterday and to the lead up of this meeting, was the 
decision by the Board of SAA on the 25t h of August to 
implement a 30% set-aside policy.   
 
Communication 
from 
National 
Treasury 
on 
the 
28t h of September 2015 that that must be stopped with 
immediate effect.   
 
A meeting on Friday that week on Dr Dahwa’s version 
where he was pressurised into doing so and implementing it.  
And 
your 
response 
saying that he 
was 
going to be 
disciplined and that he would suffer.   
10 
 
And then thereafter, shortly thereafter, he is disciplined.  
He is removed and he is replaced.  Ms Kwinana, who 
replaced him? 
MS KWINANA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Who replaced Dr Dahwa? 
CHAIRPERSON:   One second.  Ms Mbanjwa. 
MS MBANJWA:   Thank you, Chair.  I just want you to give 
us a chance Chair to re-examine on this point.  The evidence 
leader, 
Ms 
Hofmeyr 
has 
the 
evidence 
of 
yesterday 
incorrectly.  There was a procurement process for Swissport 
20 
but we will leave that for re-examination.  She is wrong on 
evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
MS MBANJWA:   Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you.   
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 33 of 279 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Who replaced Dr Dahwa? 
MS KWINANA:   Lester Peter.  I do not know... acted in his 
position? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, so when Dr Dahwa was suspended 
for the disciplinary charges that were brought against him, 
Ms Lester Peter took his position.  Correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And Mr Lester Peter is the person who 
sent on the 15t h of December, we looked at last – yesterday, 
the 15t h of December 2015 – that Tripartite Agreement that 
10 
was going to be concluded that you said you have not seen 
before, between Swissport/SAA and a yet to be selected BEE 
supplier who was going to get 30% of the contract.  Do you 
remember seeing that for the first time yesterday? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  So where we are at the moment is 
you, as I understand it, could not understand how a letter of 
award could arise in this circumstance.  And I am putting to 
you, that set of facts makes it clear, to me at least, how it 
could arise.  It was a board decision that this policy would be 
20 
implemented and now you were checking up on whether it 
was being implemented.  Do you have a response to that? 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, at SAA, the letter of awards arises 
from a due procurement process.  That is why I am surprised 
about these letters of awards that Dr Dahwa is saying he 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 34 of 279 
 
refused to sign because the award letters would come from a 
due procurement process. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So when Mr Lester Peter sent the draft 
contract facilitating the 30% set-aside policy of the board on 
the 15t h of December 2015, was he acting irregularly? 
MS KWINANA:   Was that signed Chair? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Sorry.  My question ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   Before we can he was acting irregularly or 
not, we need to take the process up to the time he has to 
sign.   
10 
 
Now the process would be:  Was there a tender?  Was it 
advertised?  Was the procurement process followed?  Was 
the award given?  Was the contract awarded?  Was the 
contract signed?   
 
So all of these.  And then – and therefore, we would say, 
if for instance there is a draft that does not talk to that whole 
process, then that is irregular. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   What is your knowledge, Ms Kwinana?  
Did a procurement process proceed, the 15 December 2015 
draft agreement that was sent to Swissport by the acting 
20 
procurement officer of SAA? 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, that agreement, draft agreement I 
saw it for the first time here. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That was not my question.  To your 
knowledge, was there a procurement process followed before 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 35 of 279 
 
that agreement, which I accept your evidence yesterday was 
you saw it for the first time yesterday ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   I do not know.  I do not know Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  But you would have wanted to 
check before any agreement was entered into with Swissport 
because you are concerned to ensure that procurement is 
properly followed.  Is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   So let us go back to your evidence that 
you have no recollection of that meeting.  You say it did not 
10 
happen.  Is that your version? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   You say it was not communicated then or 
since then that Dr Dahwa could not in good conscience do 
what you are asking him to do.  Is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   I am saying Chair.  I definitely was not in 
that meeting. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, my... that was not the question.  Did it 
ever come to your knowledge that Dr Dahwa was saying he 
could not in good conscience do what you were requiring of 
20 
him to do? 
MS KWINANA:   When he was testifying here.  Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Here?  That is the first time it came to 
your knowledge. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 36 of 279 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay let us go to an email that you wrote 
to Ms Myeni a few days after your 2n d of October meeting.  
You will find that in Dr Dahwa’s bundle.  I do not think you 
had that before.  So if we could just have assistance.  That 
is Exhibit BD16 and we will pick it up at page 240.   
MS KWINANA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Two, four, zero. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Let us maybe start at page 239, actually, 
if we may? 
MS KWINANA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   So on Dr Dahwa’s version, the meeting 
that lasted for eight hours or thereabout and he described it 
as having involved psychological games being played with 
him was on Friday, the 2n d of October.  Now what you will 
find on page 239 Ms Kwinana is an email that you sent to 
Ms Myeni on the 12 t h of October 2015.  Do you see that? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you say...  Its subject is complaint 
letter and you say: 
“Dear 
Chairperson. 
 
Please 
find 
my 
letter 
of 
complaint which is self-explanatory for your action.  
Best regards Yakhe Kwinana.” 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 37 of 279 
 
 
And then if you go over the page, is the attachment to 
that email.  Do you see that? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you recall this letter of complaint? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   You do? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Well, the letter of complaint suggests that 
some 
of 
the 
evidence 
you 
have 
given 
this 
morning 
Ms Kwinana is false.  The first thing that indicates that your 
10 
evidence is false is because you begin the letter with Dear 
Chairperson.   
 
May 18, 2015 was a historic day for South African 
Airways 
where 
you 
have 
signed 
the 
memorandum 
of 
understanding on behalf of SAA with the Department of 
Trade 
and 
Industry, 
committing 
SAA 
to 
support 
DTI 
Industrialisation.   
 
Your evidence earlier was that you had not seen 
18 May 2015 MOU.  Do you remember giving that evidence? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You clearly had seen it, had you not? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  So that evidence was false.  What 
you then go on to do is you talk about President Zuma’s 
State of the Nation Address and his reference to 30% set-
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 38 of 279 
 
aside.  And then I would like to pick it up, in the last 
paragraph of that page before the numbering starts because 
this is where you start to lodge your complaints against 
Dr Dahwa. 
MS KWINANA:   H’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You wrote the following: 
“Having noted all this, it is sad for me to seek 
answers from your Chairperson wherein particular, I 
would like to report the following about Dr Masimba 
Dahwa. 
10 
1. 
He lied that the Jet Fuel Tender is inclusive of 
six streams whereas on further enquiry the Jet Fuel 
Tender is just supply of jet fuel.   
2. 
I use the above lies to communicate that this 
tender has six streams to SMME’s to whom the 
board awarded the 15% tender of Jet Fuel.” 
 
So I am just going to pause there.  We did have 
evidence back in June of last year about how there was 
steps to implement the set-aside in the jet fuel context.  I am 
just reminding us that that is where that comes in the 
20 
evidence of the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   She goes...  Ms Kwinana, you go on at 3. 
“3. 
These lies that I communicated to a room with 
more than 60 people has an effect on bringing my 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 39 of 279 
 
name, 
the 
chairperson’s 
name, 
SAA 
and 
the 
governments’ name into disrepute as there are now 
enquiries where service providers want to know the 
way forward in respect of logistics and other 
streams as communicated by myself as per the 
misleading information provided by Dr Dahwa. 
4. 
He also lied and made the chairperson to 
believe that the award letters to tenderers were 
signed whereas there were no letters.” 
 
Those are the award letter that a moment ago you said 
10 
you had no knowledge of and could not exist because 
procurement would have to be followed beforehand.   
 
Paragraph 5: 
“5. 
When asked about the status of the board 
resolutions implementation he lied and said that the 
delays are with Legal.   
I subsequently asked Legal who informed me in the 
presence of Dr Dahwa that they are waiting for 
Dr Dahwa. 
6. 
He travelled with us on Transformational Road 
20 
shows and when we were communicating the board 
decisions, he also clapped hands knowing very well 
that he would not write the award letters which I 
later discovered that he would not write as he said, 
“my conscience does not allow me”.” 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 40 of 279 
 
 
Let me just pause there.  A moment ago Ms Kwinana you 
gave evidence that said that you did not know that that was 
his issue with the award letters and you heard his evidence 
in this Commission.  I put it to you that your evidence earlier 
was false.  What is your response? 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, I had forgotten about this letter that I 
wrote.  In this regard, I have ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Clearly, Ms Kwinana ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   In this letter I detract.  I stand by the letter 
that I wrote. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry?  What?  You stand by? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   The letter. 
MS KWINANA:   By the letter that I wrote. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I do not know what that means. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   What does it mean that you stand by it? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Does that mean ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Because it is a completely different 
version. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Does that mean you now remember the 
20 
meeting that you said you did not attend? 
MS KWINANA:   I still do not think that was the meeting.  I 
think all these things transpired through the road shows, not 
through the meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let me try this.  Previously, at my 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 41 of 279 
 
request, Ms Hofmeyr read Dr Dahwa’s evidence, you know, a 
substantial part to indicate what, according to him, happened 
at that meeting.  The idea behind that was that it could help 
you remember whether you were part of that meeting.  You 
said you definitely were not part of that meeting.   
 
So now Ms Hofmeyr has referred us to a letter or an 
email that you sent to Ms Dudu Myeni in which you refer to 
Dr Dahwa and the award letters.   
 
And of course, his evidence was that he refused to sign 
two award letters.  And here you refer to him having said his 
10 
conscience did not allow him.   
 
Now that seems to – what is written here – seems to tie 
up with what Dr Dahwa says according to the evidence that 
was read by Ms Hofmeyr about a meeting where he says he 
was required by you and Ms Myeni to sign two letters, award 
letters and his conscience would not allow him to do that.  
And he was distressed and so on.   
 
But at least, there are references here which suggests 
that you seemed to or you may have known about some of 
these things.  What do you say? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, I would remember one of...  I do not 
know whether to say the award letter or the agreement.  
Maybe it would not be the award letter.  The reason why I am 
saying it would not be the award letter is because I 
remember very well the one for the Jet Fuel where basically 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 42 of 279 
 
Engen agreed that from the supply that they are giving to 
SAA, they are willing to dispose of 15% of that supplies and 
give it to the smaller companies.   
 
So which means, therefore, that the agreement between 
SAA and Engen where the tender process was followed 
would still continue as it is.   
 
And therefore – that is why I am saying, maybe it is not 
an award, it is an agreement between now Engen and the 
BEE companies.   
 
Then that one, our understanding and Dr Dahwa made 
10 
us to believe that he is going to lead it.  And please 
Ms Hofmeyr, 
understand 
that 
the 
award 
followed 
a 
procurement process from the beginning up to the time that 
Engen was awarded that tender.   
 
And then now, we negotiated with Engen to say:  Can 
you please from the remaining tender, from the remaining 
period that is remaining to the expiry of your contract, can 
you give 15% to these black companies.   
 
In fact, I remember that there were about 60 odd black 
companies that were not knocking on SAA’s doors to get the 
20 
tender.  And therefore, Dr Dahwa ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But does all of this – are you saying all of 
this, to say, you remember the meeting and you did attend it 
or are you saying all of this, to say, you did not attend the 
meeting? 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 43 of 279 
 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair I did not attend the meeting.  It 
was not the meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS KWINANA:   We were doing the road shows throughout 
the country. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh...  H’m. 
MS KWINANA:   And then now we would, in fact, discuss like 
with a hall full of people to say this is how this thing is going 
to happen.  So basically, I would not say there was a 
meeting especially the meeting that Ms Hofmeyr was talking 
10 
about.  So basically, what I was talking about but what was 
Dr Dahwa promised that.   
 
Now that we have negotiated with Engen, Engen now 
can give the 15% out of their own will.  Remember that this 
is about negotiations because the company that has got the 
tender with SAA is Engen and therefore, we cannot enforce 
anything.  That is why we were negotiating with Engen and 
the other companies and Bidvest.   
 
So basically, Dr Masimba Dahwa was supposed to say, 
he does not want to do that.  And in fact, if he says he does 
20 
not want to do that.  Remember that the procurement 
process is not tampered with in this exercise that we are 
doing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr, before – but before that.  Ms 
Mbanjwa. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 44 of 279 
 
MS MBANJWA:   Thank you, Chair.  Chair, I just want to put 
on record that on my own evaluation, I do not believe that 
this letter, this email that has been written by Ms Kwinana is 
a confirmation of the fact that there was that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, Ms Mbanjwa.  That you can deal with 
in re-examination.  Now it is like you are telling the witness 
how to respond to questions on this letter. 
MS MBANJWA:   No, I was going to ask Chair that 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Reserve it for re-examination. 
10 
MS MBANJWA:   Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you do not have to ask for it.  I give – 
I told you, I will allow you to re-examine when the witness 
has – when Ms Hofmeyr has finished.   
 
So you do not have to ask for it each time.  We will give 
you the opportunity.  What I do not know whether it will be 
today or it will have to be some other date, depending on 
when we finish.   
 
Okay.  So you just make a note of all the issues that you 
want to clarify during re-examination. 
20 
MS MBANJWA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Kwinana, I do want to just spend a 
little bit more time on this meeting because, you see, it is 
not a meeting if it has occurred, that I want to suggest to 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 45 of 279 
 
you, could easily be forgotten by the people involved.   
 
And the reason I say that is, if Dr Dahwa’s version is 
correct - and I might add, the part of the meeting where he 
says Ms Mpshe joined him, Ms Mpshe confirms in her 
evidence.  Right.   
 
But that type of meeting that caused such psychological 
distress to one of the participants, is not a meeting that 
people easily forget.   
 
I want to put that to you.  Would you accept that if 
somebody in a meeting experiences severe psychological 
10 
distress by it and it last for eight hours, is not the type of 
meeting that people easily forget having been part of? 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, I would also not forget that meeting. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, right.  That type of meeting would 
be in your memory, would it not? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And your evidence today is, despite 
having seen this email that was days later on the following 
Friday.   You still maintain that you did not attend that 
meeting with him, is that correct? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right and do you also maintain that he 
was not told at that meeting that the EFF were going to be 
coming to SAA that next Monday and that he must be 
fearful because they were there to act against people who 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 46 of 279 
 
were anti-transformation and foreigners, Zimbabweans, like 
him.  Did that not occur? 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, I was not at that meeting. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did that not occur? 
MS KWINANA:   I was not at that meeting, I do not know if 
it did occur or not, I was not at the meeting. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  You see, Dr Dahwa was so 
distressed by that threat that he did not go to work the 
next Monday and instead he wrote an email to his line 
manager, Mr Wolf Meyer.  He copied it to Ms Mpshe, who 
10 
had attended the meeting with you on the 2 n d, the previous 
Friday, and he referenced that meeting and he referenced 
the fact that he was too afraid to come to work.  Does that 
not jog your memory at all? 
MS KWINANA:   Not at all, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, so your evidence today is despite 
your own email on its face referencing the things that he 
said took place in that meeting and a subsequent email, I 
will take you to now, in which he talks about the very threat 
and the fact that he met with two board members the 
20 
previous Friday.  You still maintain to this Commission you 
did not participate in that meeting. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  Let us go to the email.  It is a 
few pages back in the witness bundle of Mr Dahwa which is 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 47 of 279 
 
DD16 and you will pick it up at page 236. 
CHAIRPERSON:   236? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  236, the same one, DD16. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The Dr Dahwa one. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So contemporaneous evidence at the 
time, this email, written at 747 in the morning on Monday 
the 5 October by Dr Dahwa to Mr Wolf Meyer and Ms Thuli 
Mpshe, says the following: 
“Dear Sir, following the meeting between the two 
board members and I on Friday 2 October 2015 I 
10 
was advised that EFF was coming to Airways Park 
today, Monday 5 October to demonstrate.  I was 
advised that they will be demonstrating that there is 
no transformation at SAA because of people like me 
in senior positions as there is no South Africans 
holding such positions in Zimbabwe.  Seeing the 
recent violence against foreign nationals I feel 
endangered. 
 
As 
you 
are 
aware 
of 
these 
demonstrations by EFF and that they are targeting 
“people like me who are non-South Africans yet 
20 
holding senior positions at SAA”?  I do not find it 
safe to proceed to the office this morning against 
the advice I was given by the two board members I 
met on Friday.  I await your advice and direction.” 
Do you still persist that you did not attend that meeting, Ms 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 48 of 279 
 
Kwinana? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I need to put it to you that you have 
been dishonest with this Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, before that.  Ms Kwinana, just 
reflect properly.  Here is a situation where a senior 
member of the management of SAA, Dr Dahwa, has given 
evidence along the lines that Ms Hofmeyr read to you 
earlier on about a meeting where he says you and Ms 
Myeni demanded and pressurised him to sign letters of 
10 
awards that he considered to be wrong, illegal, he said his 
conscience would not allow him – said he was very 
distressed and he says Ms Mpshe came in at some stage at 
the 
meeting 
and 
Ms 
Mpshe 
has 
come 
before 
this 
Commission and under oath confirmed that she came into 
the meeting and you and Ms Myeni were there with Dr 
Dahwa and she has confirmed that part of the meeting that 
happened when she was there.  Now Ms Hofmeyr has 
referred you to an email dated 5 October 2015 from Dr 
Dahwa to his supervisor or whoever, Mr Wolf Meyer. 
20 
Monday - the 5 October was the Monday, the meeting that 
he is talking about he says happened on the Friday, three 
days before that.  So everything is fresh in his mind.  He is 
writing to his senior and he talks about having had a 
meeting with two board members on that Friday.  In the 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 49 of 279 
 
email he does not mention who they are but he has 
mentioned the evidence who they are and he says that you 
told him that the EFF was going to have a demonstration 
against people like him holding senior positions in SAA 
who were anti-transformation and foreigners and why would 
this man fabricate all of this against you?  What did he 
have against you to fabricate all of this because if you 
were not in that meeting, it means he is fabricating all of 
this.  So I just want you to reflect properly whether really 
you are saying – you are sticking to your evidence that you 
10 
were not in that meeting or whether when you reflect 
properly you may have been in that meeting or you were in 
that meeting. 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, there is no way that I will forget 
such a meeting.  I was not in that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So Dr Dahwa is just falsely implicating 
you in what he says you and Ms Myeni did or said to him in 
that meeting? 
MS KWINANA:   He is falsely implicating me, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Ms Mpshe, to the extent that she 
20 
confirms at least some – those things that happened while 
she was at that meeting, she is also falsely implicating 
you? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr, you had asked a question.  
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 50 of 279 
 
I am sorry, I just wanted to give Ms Kwinana really an 
opportunity to reflect and decide whether she sticks with 
her evidence that she was not at this meeting but you 
…[intervenes] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And I was simply going to follow that, 
Chair, by indicating to Ms Kwinana that we will likely argue 
in due course that you have been dishonest in the 
evidence you have given in resisting against all this 
overwhelming evidence pointing to the fact that you were 
there, you nonetheless doggedly insist you were not and 
10 
that that is false and dishonest.  What is your response to 
that? 
MS KWINANA:   I said, Chair, I was not in that meeting.  
So if you want to say what I am saying is false and 
dishonest, it is your own prerogative, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Let us then go – you were very – you 
said you stand by the letter that you wrote on the 9 
October that you have been shown now, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That letter, as I read it, and I want to 
20 
check if we have the same understanding, expresses a 
level of animosity towards Dr Dahwa that I would describe 
as extreme, coming from you.  Do you agree with that 
assessment? 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 51 of 279 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It is not extreme animosity? 
MS KWINANA:   Not at all. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Not at all, okay.  Let us read what he 
said.  Let us go to page 241, it is in the same bundle, we 
are in DD16 and it is just the second page of the letter that 
you wrote to Ms Myeni on the 9 October 2015.  Can I just 
before we go to what you wrote?  You say it does not 
express extreme animosity to Dr Dahwa.  How would you 
describe your feelings to Dr Dahwa at that stage? 
MS KWINANA:   No feelings at all, Chair. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   None at all? 
MS KWINANA:   No. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No.  He was just the head of 
procurement and you were just dealing with him like you 
would deal with any manager, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay, let us see what you said to Ms 
Myeni.  We will pick it up at the bottom of page 241 under 
the bullet points.  You say: 
“From the aforegoing it is clear that there is no 
20 
commitment on the part of Dr Dahwa to the 
resolutions of the Durban Road Show.” 
MS KWINANA:   Sorry, Chair, where is this? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Apologies.  So we are at 241.  You will 
see some bullets sort of two thirds of the way down and I 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 52 of 279 
 
am reading from the paragraph below that, “From the 
aforegoing... 
“From the aforegoing it is clear that there is no 
commitment on the part of Dr Dahwa to the 
resolutions of the Durban Road Show.  No positive 
outcome has eventuated since we went on a road 
show judging by numerous enquiries from would-be 
service providers that have gone unanswered.  The 
situation as it presents itself amply demonstrates 
that Dr Dahwa is hell-bent on sabotaging and 
10 
derailing the transformational agenda of the present 
government in general and that of SAA in particular 
while the SAA board is doing all in its power to 
translate 
government’s 
intent 
of 
economic 
empowerment into concrete reality to extricate the 
African majority from the quagmire of poverty,  Dr 
Dahwa is equally doing his best to keep the same 
people in economic bondage.  He is part of sinister 
retrogressive agenda which is aimed at reversing 
the 
transformation 
agenda 
of 
the 
present 
20 
government. 
 
His 
behaviour 
smacks 
of 
insubordination and conspiracy against the SAA 
board.  His purulent attitude may be located in the 
fact that he does not share the agony of the people 
of South Africa who have emerged from centuries of 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 53 of 279 
 
economic deprivation and his freedom was born of 
struggle.  It is actually ironic that he is sabotaging 
SAA that appointed him to such a senior position 
essentially biting the hands that feeds him.  This 
leaves 
me 
with 
no 
other 
option 
except 
to 
recommend that the strongest possible action be 
taken against him.” 
Ms Kwinana, I put it to you that that is not written about 
somebody in respect of whom you had an indifferent 
attitude as your evidence a few moments ago suggested.  
10 
Do you want to comment on that? 
MS KWINANA:   I still take it, Chair, as indifferent in the 
sense that there will always be some disagreements 
between the junior and his or her senior but that does not 
mean that there is a – what words did you use, animosity?  
No. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So he was just average …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana – I am sorry, Ms Hofmeyr, 
are you saying to me you want me to believe that you had 
no strong feelings against Dr Dahwa when you wrote an 
20 
email in such strong negative terms?  This email is written 
in very strong, negative terms about and against Dr Dahwa, 
you want to tell me that you did not have any strong 
negative feelings towards him? 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, from time to time there will be 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 54 of 279 
 
disagreement between the senior and the junior. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I know that, Ms Kwinana, do not tell 
me that.  My question is are you saying to me that the 
strong words you used here, negative words abut and 
against Dr Dahwa do not reflect that you had strong 
negative against him?  Is that what you want me to 
believe? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Continue, Ms Hofmeyr.  Well, before you 
proceed, let me ask this question.  I mean, Ms Kwinana, 
10 
you say in this paragraph that Ms Hofmeyr read, you are 
saying that while the SAA – you say: 
“From the aforegoing it is clear that there is no 
commitment on the part of Dr Dahwa to the 
resolutions of the Durban Road Show.  No positive 
outcome has eventuated since we went on a road 
show judging by numerous enquiries from would-be 
service providers that have gone unanswered.  The 
situation, as it presents itself, amply demonstrates 
that Dr Dahwa is hell-bent on sabotaging and 
20 
derailing the transformational agenda of the present 
government in general and that of SAA in particular 
while the SAA board is doing all in its power to 
translate 
government’s 
intent 
of 
economic 
empowerment into concrete reality to extricate the 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 55 of 279 
 
African majority from the quagmire of poverty, Dr 
Dahwa is equally doing his best to keep the same 
people…” 
That is the African people. 
“…in economic bondage.” 
This is an African person that you are talking about.  This 
is a person from Zimbabwe, brothers and sisters who have 
suffered under colonialism, who have suffered under the 
white rule.  This is an African person that you are talking 
about, Ms Kwinana.  You are saying while you are trying to 
10 
empower economically black people in South Africa, you 
are saying he is doing his best to keep African people in 
economic bondage.  You say: 
“He is part of sinister retrogressive agenda which is 
aimed at reversing the transformation agenda of the 
present government.  His behaviour…” 
You say. 
“…smacks 
of 
insubordination 
and 
conspiracy 
against the SAA board.” 
You say: 
20 
“His attitude may be located in the fact that he does 
not share the agony of the people of South Africa” 
He is from Zimbabwe, he has suffered just like the African 
people in South Africa.  Shoo.   
Anyway, let us go to page 241 bullet point 3 you say 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 56 of 279 
 
that you recommend that the Chairperson should charge Dr 
Dahwa with- and I go to bullet 3: 
“Refusal 
or 
failure 
to 
carry 
out 
lawful 
and 
reasonable instruction.” 
What are you talking about there? 
MS 
KWINANA: 
 
 
Chair, 
this 
lawful 
and 
reasonable 
instruction would relate in this previous tender that I talked 
about, the jet fuel specifically, where basically we managed 
to negotiate 15% from Engen to be shared by 60-odd black 
fuel suppliers.  So basically what I was saying here, 
10 
refusal or failure to carry out lawful and reasonable 
instructions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who had given this instruction that you 
are talking about to him? 
MS KWINANA:   He was given by the board. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Who 
in 
the 
board 
conveyed 
the 
instruction to him or was he called to a board meeting and 
the board told him the instruction? 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair, as I said, there were road 
shows and in the road shows there would be commitment 
20 
and in those commitments like, for instance, you would go 
and speak to this example, Engen or Shell and then 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I do not want that whole history, Ms 
Kwinana, what I want is – you said here the Chairperson 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 57 of 279 
 
should charge him with a refusal or failure to carry out a 
lawful and reasonable instruction.  I am asking the 
question, who conveyed to him this instruction that you say 
he failed or refused to carry out? 
MS KWINANA:   It is the members of the board, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which members of the board? 
MS KWINANA:   The board takes a collective decision, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MS KWINANA:   The board takes a collective decision, so 
10 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did this all convey this instruction to 
him? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At a meeting? 
MS KWINANA:   No, not in the meeting, in the road shows 
that we were attending. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So there was a road show where all the 
board members were present and they all gave him this 
instruction? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   They may not necessarily be all present 
but most of them would be there and in fact, Chair, when 
these road shows happened, the board members who were 
in the road shows, had a mandate from the other board 
members.  That is why I am saying this instruction 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 58 of 279 
 
basically was from the board because even if it was two or 
three or four board members that attended they would have 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Were you one of those board members? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was Ms Myeni another one? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what was the instruction again?   
Just tell me in clear terms. 
MS KWINANA:   The instruction was that considering that 
10 
the board has gone to negotiate with Engen and Engen has 
agreed from their contract to put aside 15%.  That means if 
they were supplying 100% of the jet fuel, they would supply 
85% and 15% would be supplied by the 60-odd black 
companies.  So basically Engen with their procurement 
process, they had agreed.  So basically what Dr Dahwa 
was supposed to do, Dr Dahwa was supposed to make sure 
that the 15% that has been agreed by Engen – remember 
that other companies did not agree, that is fine, but at 
least those companies that agreed that okay, then we can 
20 
supply 85% and then 15% you can take. 
 
So Dr Dahwa was supposed to carry out that 
mandate, the mandate of going to Engen and say Engen, 
you 
are 
agreed 
on 
85%, 
here 
are 
the 
companies 
…[intervenes] 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 59 of 279 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which law said you could do this, Ms 
Kwinana?  Which law said you could award an entity, a 
business without that entity taking part in a procurement 
process? 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, the procurement process was done 
and then now we negotiated with Engen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no, no, what you have said to 
me is you instructed Dr Dahwa to award a certain entity 
15%. 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of business that was supposed to go to 
another one. 
MS KWINANA:   No, Dr Dahwa would not be in a position 
to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What did you want him to do? 
MS KWINANA:   That is what I am explaining, Chair, I am 
saying …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I am asking what did you instruct him 
to do? 
MS KWINANA:   We wanted Dr Dahwa to carry forward 
20 
from the negotiations that were made with Engen where 
Engen was saying we are giving away 15% so that SAA, 
you can be supplied by black people. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What do you mean carry forward?  What 
was – what in practical terms was he supposed to do? 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 60 of 279 
 
MS KWINANA:   To carry forward, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was he supposed to do? 
MS KWINANA:   What I mean by carrying forward is 
because negotiations had happened with Engen and Engen 
agreed that 15% will be supplied by the black firms, by the 
black companies and therefore, Dr Dahwa needed to make 
sure that the agreement between Engen and the other 
companies do happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was he supposed to do? 
MS KWINANA:   He was supposed to call a meeting, if I 
10 
can be like saying line by line what he was supposed to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He was supposed to call a meeting with 
Engen as a follow-up of what they agreed previously, call a 
meeting with Engen, call a meeting with all the six 
companies, put all of them together in the room and say 
Engen, as you agreed, here are the companies that are 
going to supply 15% of the jet fuel that you are giving 
away. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why did he have to do that? 
MS 
KWINANA: 
 
 
That 
was 
part 
of 
pushing 
the 
20 
transformational agenda from the side of SAA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which law said he could do that? 
MS KWINANA:   Even if there is no law, Chair, but what – 
that 
is 
how 
we 
were 
pushing 
the 
black 
economic 
empowerment in SAA. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 61 of 279 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see, that might be the problem, that 
you do not care whether there is a legal framework within 
which you are acting.  You say even if there is no law we 
will do it, that might be the problem.  Ms Hofmeyr, 
continue. 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, I would actually, if I may, just like 
to pick up on one final point arising from your question.  
You see, what troubles me, Ms Kwinana, you articulate the 
charge as being his failure to follow lawful and reasonable 
instructions in line with the set aside policy but, you see, 
10 
you wrote that letter to Ms Myeni on the 9 October 2015 
and on the 28 September 2015 SAA had been told by 
National Treasury’s Chief Procurement Officer that this 
whole set aside policy was unlawful and had to stop with 
immediate effect.  So how could Dr Dahwa in good 
conscience, if he was concerned about acting lawfully at 
all, ever have acted on that instruction? 
MS KWINANA:   You know, National Treasury here was 
talking about what was supposed to be implemented by 
SAA.  This one that I am talking about, about the 15%, 
20 
remember that it is not supposed to be implemented by 
SAA like the procurement process of SAA because we have 
already negotiated with Engen and therefore, that does not 
have anything to do with the 30% set aside.  The 30% set 
aside 
that 
we 
were 
talking 
about, 
that 
was 
never 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 62 of 279 
 
implemented, is the 30% set aside by SAA.   
Remember that this 15% was not going to be set 
aside by SAA, it was going to be set aside by Engen. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair, we are at eleven and we did start 
earlier this morning.  I wonder if it is convenient to take 
the break now or I am happy to go on, it is entirely up to 
you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think let us take the break at quarter 
past. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, may I have a comfort break, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MS KWINANA:   Comfort break, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Then we will have – when 
the witness says comfort break, we will have a comfort 
break.  Okay, we will just take the tea break.  We will 
resume at quarter past eleven. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
20 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair.  Ms Kwinana, towards 
the end of the first session before our break we were 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 63 of 279 
 
looking 
at 
that 
letter 
that 
you 
had 
written 
to 
the 
Chairperson on the 9 October and in that letter you called 
for Dr Dahwa to be charged with those various charges that 
you had set out.  Do you know what then happened?  Was 
he disciplined? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, he was disciplined, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And did you note from his evidence 
before 
the 
Commission 
that 
in 
the 
process 
of 
his 
disciplining he entered into a settlement with SAA.  Were 
you aware of that? 
10 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And were you aware of his evidence 
where he indicated that pursuant to all of those events he 
ended up losing his house that he had bought with his 
family in order to be able to settle here when he was 
employed as procurement manager? 
MS KWINANA:   I am not aware of that, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And were you also aware of his evidence 
– because I did understand you previously to say that you 
had watched it.  He also gave evidence that he  - as at the 
20 
date of his evidence which was June of last year had great 
difficulty back in Zimbabwe seeking employment.  Were 
you aware of that? 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Kwinana, I picked up on a point 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 64 of 279 
 
earlier which was the point about who was Dr Dahwa 
replaced by and we – you confirmed for us that was Mr 
Lester Peter and I indicated to you one of the first things 
that Lester Peter did was to circulate the 30% set aside 
agreement to Swissport to facilitate the policy there and 
you then have meetings with Swissport in early 2016 about 
that.  Were you not concerned that pushing the 30%  set 
aside line was unlawful and you should not be persisting 
with it by that stage? 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, we did not implement the 30% set 
10 
aside. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
Ms 
Kwinana, 
again 
remember 
I 
absolutely take it for today’s evidence that you were not 
ultimately successful in implementing it.  I am asking about 
when you are in the throes of trying to implement it, that is 
why I said did you not – were you not concerned that you 
were pushing for the implementation of the 30% set aside 
at a time when National Treasury had told you it was 
unlawful? 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, we pushed the 30% set aside 
20 
before the National Treasury said it was unlawful.  When 
National Treasury said it is unlawful then we stopped 
immediately and we said to the National Treasury give us 
guidance.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   You did not stop immediately because on 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 65 of 279 
 
the 15 December 2015 Mr Lester Peter, the person who 
replaced Dr Dahwa, sent an agreement that Swissport was 
required to sign setting aside 30% of that contract.  Your 
comment? 
MS KWINANA:   The 30% set aside by Swissport is not the 
30% set aside by SAA.  We have got nothing to do with the 
30% set aside by Swissport, we are nothing at Swissport of 
– or let me say, I am nothing at Swissport and therefore I 
would not push the 30% set aside to be implemented by 
Swissport.  However, I would push the 30% set aside to be 
10 
implemented by SAA if it was not allowed but I could not 
push it because National Treasury and DTI did not allow 
for us to do that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No but, Ms Kwinana, we looked at that 
agreement yesterday.  It said they must set aside 30% and 
SAA is going to retain the revenue of the 30% and give it 
to the BEE partner of its choice.  How can that not be 
pushing for the implementation of the 30% set aside?  
MS KWINANA:   Chair, the 30% set aside that we are 
talking 
about 
is 
the 
30% 
set 
aside 
that 
would 
be 
20 
implemented by SAA.  If Swissport wanted to push their 
30% set aside, we, as SAA, did not feature anywhere in 
their policies of pushing aside the 30%. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Kwinana, it was a tripartite 
agreement, that means there are three parties to it.  SAA, 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 66 of 279 
 
Swissport and the yet to be named 30% BEE partner that 
SAA was going to select.  Ms Kwinana, how could SAA not 
have been involved in that? 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, I am not going to comment on the 
tripartite agreement that you showed me yesterday, I was 
not aware of that until you showed me yesterday and, 
therefore, I will talk about the SAA trying to push the 30% 
set aside as SAA, not Swissport doing their 30%. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you cannot not comment when you 
said SAA was not involved and Ms Hofmeyr says to you but 
10 
SAA was party to an agreement that sought to put aside 
30% that it wanted to give to another entity that was yet to 
be named.  So do you not agree that if SAA was involved in 
such a party – such an agreement was a party to such an 
agreement, that was involvement by SAA? 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, the tripartite agreement, I was not 
aware of the tripartite agreement and I …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You were not aware of it, as an 
individual? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes and I said yesterday it was my first 
20 
time to see the draft agreement that Adv Hofmeyr showed 
me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you agree that the fact that SAA was 
party to such an agreement means that it was involved in 
setting aside or it sought to set aside that 30%.  All you 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 67 of 279 
 
might say is you were not aware of it but that was 
involvement. 
MS KWINANA:   My knowledge, Chair, of the 30% set 
aside, I have tried to explain it that the 30% set aside that 
SAA was trying to implement was never implemented.  The 
tripartite agreement …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, Ms Hofmeyr has explained more 
than twice that she accepts that the actual implementation 
might not have happened but there were efforts to try and 
implement the 30% set aside and that is what she is talking 
10 
about when she refers to this agreement.  So the question 
is, do you not agree that if SAA was party to such an 
agreement then SAA was involved in attempts to set aside 
– to implement the 30% set aside. 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, I do not – I do not even want to 
comment about the tripartite agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well …[intervenes] 
MS KWINANA:   The agreement that I can talk about is the 
agreement that we would envision where this 30% set 
aside would happen. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana, when you are asked a 
question and you do not answer it or you do not want to 
answer it, it does not speak well of you as a witness.  It is 
the kinds of things that Ms Hofmeyr may in due course rely 
on to say you were evasive as a witness, to say you were 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 68 of 279 
 
dishonest.   
When you were being asked a question and you 
knew the answer but the answer would be inconvenient, 
you would then decide to say I am not commenting instead 
of being honest and say this is the answer, even if it is 
inconvenient, even if it does not put you in a good light but 
because you are an honest person, you give the answer.  
When you say I am not going to comment and you start 
giving an answer to a question that has not been asked, it 
does not say – it does not speak well about you as a 
10 
witness.   
So I am going to ask you the question again.  Would 
you not agree that if SAA was party to such an agreement 
then it was involved in attempts to implement the 30% set 
aside. 
MS KWINANA:   For the sake of progress, Chair, let me 
say yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MS KWINANA:   For the sake of progress, Chair, let me 
say yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You must not say for the sake of 
progress, you must say – give an answer that you honestly 
is the correct answer.  If you say for the sake of progress it 
gives the impression that you do not believe honestly that 
that is the correct answer and I do not – I am not asking 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 69 of 279 
 
you to give me answers that you do not believe to be true, 
all I want for you is honest answers.  If you truly believe 
that that was not involvement or in efforts by SAA to 
implement the 30% set aside you say so. 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, as I said, that tripartite agreement, 
it was the first time for me to see it and therefore for me to 
comment and say it was an effort for the involvement of 
SAA, I really do not think that I would be in a position to 
confidently say so considering that I was not even aware 
that there is a tripartite agreement. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So can I just get clear, if we move away 
from the tripartite agreement, is your evidence that you 
yourself did not take any steps after let us call it late 
September 2015 to advance the 30% set aside policy of 
SAA? 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair, after we received the letter 
from DTI and we responded then we never decide to push 
for the 30% set aside. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I want to be very specific because you 
20 
have answered with “we” and I want to focus particularly on 
you. 
MS KWINANA:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  Did you ever after the National 
Treasury letter of 28 September 2015 try and push the 30% 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 70 of 279 
 
set aside? 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You did not.  You did not hold any 
meetings with Swissport and – let me just back for a 
moment – we discussed the 10 February 2016 encounter 
yesterday but can I just have your evidence as to whether 
you were involved in any other meetings to facilitate a 30% 
set aside between Swissport and a BEE partner for 
Swissport? 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You did not? 
MS KWINANA:   No. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You are absolutely certain about that, 
Ms Kwinana? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, we were talking about Mr Lester 
Peter …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe just to make – just in case the 
transcript does not catch that, that last answer was:  Yes, 
yes, yes.  Is that right? 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana, your last answer was yes. 
MS KWINANA:   I did not have any other meeting with 
Swissport. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not take part in pushing for the 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 71 of 279 
 
30% set aside after National Treasury had sent its letter 
saying the 30% set aside was unlawful. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And no meetings with Swissport and a 
prospective BEE partner, you answer was no, you did not. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   One second, Ms Hofmeyr.  Ms Mbanjwa? 
MS MBANJWA:   Thank you, Chair, I just want clarification 
10 
from Ms Hofmeyr.  Please, if I heard her incorrectly, just 
correct me.  The document which you were referring the 
witness to, is it that Swissport agreement that appears in 
DD19, 132.45? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I am not referring her to any document. 
MS MBANJWA:   No, not now.  I think you were talking 
about a document where you said that there was an 
agreement which you referred her to yesterday. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It is the tripartite agreement. 
MS MBANJWA:   I just want to make sure that I have got 
20 
the same …[intervenes] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Sure, let me find it for you. 
MS MBANJWA:   It is not the – ja, it is a standard ground 
handling. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, it is not that one. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 72 of 279 
 
MS MBANJWA:   Okay, can I please get a reference to 
that?  I will allow her to continue, Chair, I just want to get 
the reference for that.  Thank you for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Should I maybe provide it at the break? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja, that is fine.  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Sorry, it is not at the top of my mind or 
would you like it now? 
MS MBANJWA:   No, it is find after a break, I will just ask 
for the document you are referring to. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Certainly.  Oh sorry, no, I can do it quite 
swiftly, I think I have the right one in front of me.   
MS MBANJWA:   And then the …[intervenes] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You will find it in the Memela – Ms 
Memela’s bundle which is DD25A and you will find it at 
page 291. 
MS MBANJWA:   And then the second thing which I just 
want to confirm, were you saying that in that 30% set aside 
it was said that SAA would choose the BEE partner? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair, really, I mean, I am happy to give 
20 
a reference. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But Ms Mbanjwa must please pay 
attention to the questions that I ask. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Yes. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 73 of 279 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I am not here to clarify for Ms Mbanjwa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MBANJWA:   Chair, can I please respond to that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MBANJWA:   Because it is one of those things which I 
just simply cannot accept.  I have a right if I do not hear a 
question.  I have been instructed by the Chair, whom I 
respect, not to make interruption.  If I do not understand a 
question I have to ask for the question to be repeated.  It 
does not matter, Ms Hofmeyr, how irritated you become, it 
10 
is a right I have.  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just to bring this to finality.  Yes, there 
was a reference that SAA said they were going to choose 
the BEE partner. 
MS MBANJWA:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Okay, let us continue. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  So we were talking about the 
replacement of Mr Lester Peter taking the position of Dr 
Dahwa. 
 
Are 
you 
aware 
that 
Ms 
Mpshe 
was 
also 
disciplined? 
20 
MS KWINANA:    Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And who was she replaced by? 
MS KWINANA:   By Mr Musa Zwane. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And what …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   By Mr who? 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 74 of 279 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Musa Zwane, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Ms Kwinana, please remember to 
look this side as you answer so I can hear.  Okay, Mr Musa 
Zwane, okay, alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And that was towards the end of 2015, is 
that right?  Maybe early 2016 I think it was.  So what 
position did Mr Zwane hold then? 
MS KWINANA:   He was the CEO of South African Airways 
Technical. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Musa Zwane? 
10 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No but he was replacing Ms Mpshe.  Ms 
Mpshe was the Acting CEO of SAA, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So he took her position which is Acting 
CEO of SAA, is that not correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So you referred to SAA Technical. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, she was saying before Mr Zwane 
took Ms Mpshe’s acting position he was CEO of SAA 
20 
Technical. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Sorry, I did misunderstand that.  Can I 
make sure that I understand?  So Mpshe was Acting CEO 
of SAA, right? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 75 of 279 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   At the time that she was in that position 
did Mr Musa Zwane hold a position anywhere? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And what was that? 
MS KWINANA:   He was the CEO of SAAT. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, thank you, Chair.  And then Ms 
Mpshe is suspended for disciplinary processes to run and 
then Mr Musa Zwane takes over her position, is that 
correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So then he becomes acting CEO of SAA, 
is that right? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And who was going to fill the CEO 
position at SAAT albeit on an acting basis? 
MS KWINANA:   The acting position was taken by Mr 
Malola. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Malola-Phiri, yes.  We have heard some 
evidence from him previously and about him.  So towards 
the end of 2015, early 2016, we have got Mr Malola-Phiri 
20 
as Acting CEO of SAA Technical and we have got Mr Musa 
Zwane as Acting CEO of SAA.  Have I got that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Now Mr Musa Zwane was 
the person who signed the Swissport agreement, the 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 76 of 279 
 
Arata(?) one that Ms Mbanjwa was asking about earlier and 
that we saw yesterday.  Do you recall that? 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You do not.  Well, in his position of 
Acting CEO I assume it would not surprise you that he 
would be the signatory to that agreement, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   That is right. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes and that was the agreement that 
was the culmination of the efforts with Swissport to pursue 
the 30% set aside, is that correct? 
10 
MS KWINANA:   I do not know where does the 30% set 
aside feature with him, the Swissport agreement. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You will remember that I took you to two 
clauses yesterday.  I agree with you it does not talk about 
30% because on Mr Kohl’s evidence they would not accept 
that but eventually by March 2016 what they would accept 
are those clauses 8.1 and 8.2 that required them to partner 
with 
51% 
black 
owned 
companies 
in 
certain 
of 
the 
performance under the contract and then you will recall 
that important clause 8.2 which was the one that required 
20 
them to buy the SAAT GPUs.  Do you recall that? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, so that is why I said that is in a 
sense a culmination of as far as the 30% set aside got at 
its implementation.  Do you accept that? 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 77 of 279 
 
MS KWINANA:   I do not know if that was the culmination 
of the 30% set aside.  My knowledge of Swissport on its 
own is that they are BEE compliant, so now if you are 
talking about Swissport and the 30% set aside then that is 
where I am not understanding it.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   They were already BEE compliant, were 
they not? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, that is what he said. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   H’m.  So it would not make sense for 
them additionally to have to part with 30% of their 
10 
revenues to a preselected supplier, would it? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, Ms Mbanjwa? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Oh, sorry. 
MS MBANJWA:   Chair, I am sorry to launch an objection.  
We have paragraph 8.1 and 8.2 here in this page 132.49.  
There is absolutely nothing about the 30% set aside. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is for re-examination, Ms Mbanjwa. 
MS MBANJWA:   That is a wrong question to put to the 
20 
witness. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   The record will show, Chair, that I said 
in exact terms that I was aware it did not refer to the 30% 
and then I went on.  The record will show that.  Let us then 
go – are you aware that three days after Mr Zwane was put 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 78 of 279 
 
into the acting CEO position at SAA after Ms Mpshe had 
left that he signed a Section 54 application to National 
Treasury that Ms Myeni has tried to change the structure of 
the Airbus swap transaction with.  
MS KWINANA:   No, I am not aware of that, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You see, the reason why I am focusing 
just 
a 
little 
bit 
on 
these 
positions 
that 
involved 
replacements 
of 
persons, 
Ms 
Kwinana, 
is 
because 
Commission over the last two years has heard a lot of 
evidence about people who were in state owned entities 
10 
tried to resist efforts of unlawful conduct taking place then 
being required or pushed out by various means and then 
replaced by others who were either more compliant or 
participating in those unlawful efforts.  I would like to ask 
you whether you think that that occurred at all with the 
replacement of Dr Dahwa with Mr Lester Peter and the 
replacement of Ms Mpshe with Mr Musa Zwane. 
MS KWINANA:   Definitely no, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And can I ask you, was there any 
corruption and fraud, to your knowledge, that took place at 
20 
SAA and SAA Technical while you were on the boards? 
MS KWINANA:   Except for the ones that are appearing in 
the Open Water reports.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Not beyond that.  And that, as I recall it, 
was the one you referenced yesterday was the spare parts 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 79 of 279 
 
investigation, is that right? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So on the components tender you say, if 
I understand your evidence, there was no corruption 
involved? 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair, as far as I know. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Not as far as you know.  Thank you.  I 
would like to go to that tender, if we may, that is the 
components tender that ends up being awarded in May of 
2016 to the joint venture of AAR and JM Aviation.  Now 
10 
there are allegations – and we have heard evidence before 
this Commission, so it is even in a sense more than 
allegations at this point, the Commission has received 
evidence 
that 
there 
was 
corruption 
involved 
in 
the 
appointment of JM Aviation and AAR as the ultimately 
successful bidders in that tender.  Are you aware of that 
evidence? 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You are not aware of it.  Can you tell us 
who Ms Cheryl  Jackson is? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   First can I have this evidence where fraud 
and corruption happened? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair, I am certainly going to come to 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana, the question or what you 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 80 of 279 
 
are being asked is to tell us who Ms Jackson is.  Do you 
know her? 
MS KWINANA:   I think it is the director of AAR. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Of AAR. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I cannot hear you. 
MS KWINANA:   Director of AAR. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And who is Ms Kuki Mdlulwa? 
MS KWINANA:   Kuki Mdlulwa was one of the consultants 
of SAA, legal consultants of SAA. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Sorry, I just need to make a 
note there.  Now you I think mentioned yesterday that you 
were aware of the evidence that Ms Sambo gave before the 
Commission, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you received a Rule 3.3 notice in 
advance of her evidence. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And at that point you sent in a response 
that was just a statement, it was not an affidavit.  As I 
20 
understand it, you were not legally represented at that 
point, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay, you said in that statement  - sorry, 
let me go back first because you asked me where are the 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 81 of 279 
 
allegations of corruption and fraud.  Now Ms Sambo’s 
evidence was that in a meeting that you had with her, you 
said to her you wanted to get your hands on three big 
contracts before you left SAA.  Are you aware that she 
gave that evidence? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And she also said that she had a second 
meeting with you at which you introduced her to someone 
whom you called ihashi, that person was Ms Ndlulwa, who 
we just discussed and Ms Sambo’s evidence was that at 
10 
that meeting you said that you were going to demand a 
payment from AAR for yourself, for Ms Memela and Mr 
Zwane.  Do you recall that evidence? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair, just for record purposes that can 
be found in EXHIBIT DD18, page 19, paragraphs 60 and 
64.  We do not need to go there.  Now you did deny those 
allegations in your statement that  you provided to the 
Commission.  I can take you there, if you would like me to, 
but the part of it that I would like to pick up on is you said 
20 
that Ms Sambo is a “pathological liar” and it was she who 
was the ihashi for AAR.  Do you remember saying that in 
your statement? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes, Chair.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Can you just expand on that a bit?  Why 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 82 of 279 
 
is she a psychological (sic) liar and why is it she who was 
the ihashi? 
MS 
KWINANA: 
 
 
The 
reason 
why 
I 
am 
saying 
a 
pathological liar is because all the things that she said 
were untrue or were false.  If you think about it, Chair, Ms 
Sambo was dumped by AAR 2014, if I think, was dumped in 
2014 and then now it is my first time to meet with her.  I 
called a meeting and Ms Sambo is saying Ms Memela said I 
want to be introduced to Ms Cheryl Jackson and then she 
is saying that is in the last quarter of 2015.  My 
10 
understanding of the last quarter in 2015 is October, 
November, December 2015 and now in May, few months 
before that, we went to Chicago.  Our host was Ms Cheryl 
Jackson and then now I go to Ms Sambo and say I need to 
be introduced to Cheryl Jackson.  That is the blatant lie. 
 
Now I call her and then I get to her house and stay 
for about ten minutes and say I want to get my hands on 
this tender and this tender and this tender and then I go 
and then I arrange a meeting.  That is the first time for me 
to meet with her and then I arrange a meeting at Protea 
20 
Hotel and then at Protea Hotel the meeting is between Dr 
Tambi, who is the board member of SAA, myself, Ms Nzuli 
and Ms Sambo.  I say in this meeting I want to lay my 
hands on three contracts I want to get a 100million from 
AER, and the people who are going to benefit for this is 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 83 of 279 
 
myself, Ms Zwane and Ms Memela, now a reasonable 
person would ask a question as to why was Ms Ndluli here, 
why was she there herself, Ms Sambo, why was Dr Thami 
there if I am saying I need this, I will pay, I will get this 
money from AER.    
Now that is blatant lies and Ms Sambo in her 
affidavit she had literally about 40 statements where she is 
saying she cannot remember, she cannot remember, she 
cannot remember, and all of a sudden she remembers that 
in the last quarter of 2015 I wanted to meet with her, so 
10 
basically that is why I am saying Ms Sambo is such a 
pathological liar and in fact I did say she is so spoilt that 
she wants things, she wants to be spoon fed, she doesn’t 
understand the procurement processes.  She doesn’t know 
that if she did not put in the tender, she has zero chances 
of winning the bid and another thing, she knows that she 
was ditched in 2014.   
No, if I wanted to get my hands on the tender, why 
would I go to her for God’s sake how would I go to her and 
say, I want 100million and the reason why I am saying she 
20 
is the one – and in fact, she said when she came to us to 
complain about her relationship with AER which basically, 
was the reason why she called us, I said, let me arrange a 
meeting with Dr Thami because I will be going anyway so if 
you have an issue with SAA Technical then let me arrange 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 84 of 279 
 
a meeting and that was the reason for the meeting, 
basically and then, now – so basically, I really do not know 
why I would literally go to her and knowing that she no 
longer has a relationship with AER and we met with AER in 
May and therefore if I wanted 100million from AER,  I 
would simply go to AER and get that 100million, why would 
I go to her.  That’s why I am saying Ms Sambo is such a 
pathological liar and in fact, she did not even tender in that 
components tender, I don’t know why is she disgruntled 
like that and I understand that she – Ms Memela tried to 
10 
assist her but because she is such a spoilt brat, maybe she 
is used to getting things her way but now, if you don’t even 
put your tender how was she expected to win the tender.  
So, basically, that’s the reason why, basically, I did not 
even put an effort to answer her affidavit because it is 
clear that she is a blatant liar, thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was the meaning that you were 
attaching to the word, “Ihashe”, I think she may have 
explained when she was giving evidence but I’ve forgotten 
but obviously know what the literal meaning of “Ihashe” is, 
20 
so if that is IsiZulu or IsiXhosa, that’s a horse but there 
may have been a particular meaning that it was – that was 
attached to it, what was that? 
MS KWINANA:   What Sibongile said in our meeting when 
she was complaining about AER, she said, her relationship 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 85 of 279 
 
with AER started as early as 2012 and she has been 
running around trying to get AER people, she got them to 
meet the Department – I think the Department of Public 
Enterprises tried to meet with this person and this person 
tried to meet with people at SAA and therefore she has 
been running since 2011 and then now, she is being 
dumped and therefore she has been a runner for all these 
years.  So, basically “Ihashe” is a runner Chair.  So, when 
she was telling me about this, I said, oh – and in fact, I 
said to her, oh that means [5.32 African language] running 
10 
left, right and centre, up and down for them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair.  As I understand Ms 
Sambo’s allegations against you, Ms Kwinana, it’s really 
that you were endeavouring to solicit a bribe from AER, do 
you understand her allegation similarly? 
MS KWINANA:   I understand her allegations but what she 
needed to do, she needed to prove that, I wanted to solicit 
20 
a bribe, that is number one and then number two, she 
needed to tell me, why should I go to her if I wanted to 
solicit a bribe from AER because at that time there was no 
longer a relationship between her and AER and if I wanted 
a bribe at AER, I would have gone to AER and Chair, I 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 86 of 279 
 
hope your investigators did go to AER to check if I did 
solicit that bribe. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Kwinana, my question was just 
whether you understood her evidence in the same way as I 
did, that she was accusing you of having tried to solicit a 
bribe.  I understand you to agree with me, that is her claim 
against you, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   That is her claim. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And I understand your evidence to deny 
that you did not, at any point, solicit a bribe in relation to 
10 
the components tender, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, do you believe  that Ms Memela is 
a pathological liar too? 
MS KWINANA:   I don’t know. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
Okay, 
could 
she 
be, 
from 
your 
interactions with her? 
MS KWINANA:   There was never an indication to me that 
she is lying or not. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You see, she engaged in some 
20 
WhatsApp communications with Ms Sambo in around 2017 
in which she makes reference to your effort to solicit a 
bribe, 
so 
I’d 
like 
to 
take 
you 
to 
those 
WhatsApp 
communications so that we can have your comment on 
them.  You’ll find them in Ms Sambo’s Bundle, now that is 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 87 of 279 
 
DD18 and we open it at page 540.  Well actually could we 
start at 539, just a page earlier?  So, the page is 539 of 
Exhibit 
DD18. 
 
So 
this 
was 
a 
set 
of 
WhatsApp 
communications 
that 
Ms 
Sambo 
provided 
to 
the 
Commission, they start quite a bit earlier in this Bundle but 
the one that I’m interested in is the one that starts right at 
the foot of page 539, it’s the last dated entry there, you’ll 
see it says 2017/10/16 and the time is 21h47.10 and then 
identified as the communicator on the WhatsApp there is, 
Nontsasa SAAT Memela, do you see that Ms Kwinana? 
10 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, so this is a response that Ms 
Memela sends to Ms Sambo referencing an email that she 
got in the morning, I think I’m going to read it all to the 
part that I’m interested in, Chair, just because it’s helpful 
to get context for what’s happening, if I may.  So, what it 
says there is – this is Ms Memela writing to Ms Sambo, she 
says, 
“Sibongile I’m really trying to analyse your email of 
this morning.  I’m not sure what your intentions are 
20 
but let me remind you of something, when you came 
to my office I advised you to write a background of 
what work you did with them and what agreement 
you guys had in place and how you feel they owe 
you for introducing them to South Africa.  I went as 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 88 of 279 
 
far as saying, make sure you breakdown everything 
you did for them and send them an email where you 
copy us so that, base on that, we will intervene and 
schedule a meeting but the email you sent today, 
was intended for something else and it was nothing 
of what we discussed, so I’m really not sure what 
you were trying achieve by that one-liner.  You 
came with your partners for a meeting in 2014 and 
you asked for help, first from the CEO who refused 
to give you the prices for the tender”, 
10 
 
And this is the part I’d like to draw your attention 
to, Ms Memela goes on and says the following, 
“And in 2015 you came to me as a friend and asked 
for information for the short tender which you 
wanted to give to your partner, but looks like you 
ended up not giving it to them, since you wanted 
money upfront, they tendered anyway with your 
company name and that of Ndizane.  You guys 
(yourself, Cookie Ndluli and Chair) were negotiating 
with Cheryl where there was an agreement of what 
20 
amount was going to be paid out to you guys if 
there was success.  Unfortunately, Cheryl changed 
her mind, claiming it was illegal in her country to 
pay out bribes but anyway they didn’t succeed in 
that tender, Air France did”,  
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 89 of 279 
 
 
Do you see that? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So as I read that, and you tell me if you 
read it differently, Ms Memela is talking about an occasion 
in the past where you, Ms Ndluli and Ms Sambo were trying 
to solicit a bribe from  Cheryl Jackson of AER, do you read 
it in the same way as me? 
MS KWINANA:   I read it in the same way Chair, and I 
consider this as nonsense. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Nonsense? 
10 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You say, you never ever solicited a bribe 
in relation to  the components tender, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Definitely. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So why would Ms Memela just make this 
up in her private communications with Ms Sambo? 
MS KWINANA:   I don’t know Chair, and I don’t even know 
the people that she is talking about here, Duduzani and 
okay Bongani, maybe we met at Air France but Duduzani I 
don’t know and I don’t know Rafeeq so I really do not know 
20 
why would she write that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, I’d then like to move to the 
actual tender process for AER, well let’s call it the 
components tender, the ultimately successful on the last 
one, but there’s a lot that happens in between.  Were you 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 90 of 279 
 
aware that there were numerous tenders prior to the last 
one in which they were successful? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, and the final decision-making body 
on those tenders, would have been the Board of SAA 
Technical, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It was a contract valued at – certainly 
more than a billion rand, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So, it would fall within the delegation of 
the Board, is that right? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And on the 9 t h of May, as I have it, that 
final decision was taken on the last of those tenders to 
award it to the joint venture of AER & JM Aviation, do you 
recall that? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Now while some of the other tenders 
that preceded it was still open, you travelled to America to 
20 
visit AER’s offices, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And yesterday – Sorry I sort of hesitate 
in 
asking 
that 
question 
because 
yesterday 
in 
your 
evidence, at a point when we were trying to engage with 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 91 of 279 
 
you about the limits on communications between decision 
makers and bidders, I thought I heard you say, but it was 
okay when you went to America because the tender was 
not open at that stage. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, so can I just get clarity now, when 
you went to America to visit AER, was there a tender open 
in which AER was a bidder? 
MS KWINANA:   I’m not aware of that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You’re not aware of,  so when you said 
10 
yesterday, it wasn’t open, you’re not certain now whether it 
was or it wasn’t? 
MS KWINANA:   But definitely it was the tender between 
AER, that was won by AAR & JM Aviation. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That we would agree on. So, AAR, in the 
– let me just get it right – had bid in the 29 October 2014 
tender, not with JM Aviation and that is the one that was 
still open, if you can believe it, in May of – sorry in – when 
did you go, May of 2015, so it took really some time and it 
was still open.  Do you accept that it was still open when 
20 
you travelled to AAR? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You do, and in that encounter with AAR 
Ms Memela’s evidence was that you went on private jets, 
facilitated by AAR, you had limousine rides from time to 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 92 of 279 
 
time and dined at expensive restaurants.  Do you confirm 
that evidence of Ms Memela’s? 
MS KWINANA:   Ja, I wouldn’t know about the expensive 
restaurants…[intervenes]. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   They might have just been restaurants, 
ordinary. 
MS KWINANA:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay but you don’t deny the private jets 
and the limousines? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, and I want to go back to where we 
were yesterday then, because you’re a member of the 
Board of SAAT that was going to decide that tender that 
was open at the time that you travelled to the US, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And notwithstanding – oh sorry AAR was 
a bidder in that Tender, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   I didn’t – I can’t remember but I would 
think that they would be the bidders. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   They were, I mean, if it’s necessary I’ll 
20 
take you to the letter but let’s – can we proceed on the 
basis that they were? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, so you as the Chairperson of the 
decision-making body go on this trip to the US, interact 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 93 of 279 
 
with a bidder while a tender is still open.  Do you not 
regard that as irregular, Ms Kwinana? 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, if I can quickly tell you about the  
in summary, the summary of the tendering process?  The 
reason why I would not even – the reason why I would not 
even know that there is…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, start your answer with saying 
whether you regard that as irregular, if you say you don’t 
regard it as irregular then you can say why you don’t 
regard it as irregular. 
10 
MS KWINANA:   I don’t regard it as irregular Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MS KWINANA:   The reason why I don’t regard it as 
irregular is because for the Board to know – the only time 
that the Board knows about the tender that is going on, is 
when it is at the final stage, at the final approval.  Only if 
the delegation of authority requires that it be approved at 
the Board and therefore, if there was a tender that was 
going on at the time, we were in Chicago, I would not know 
if there is a tender going on if it hasn’t been brought to the 
20 
Board. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you not think that that is something 
that you should have been advised about? 
MS KWINANA:   No, I don’t think so Chair.  As I said, the 
tendering process starts from identification of the need and 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 94 of 279 
 
then it goes to bid specification and then it goes to bid 
evaluation and all these people are different people, 
maybe, there’s one or two people who are common and 
then there is bid adjudication and then there’s EXCO 
meeting and then there is the Board.  So basically, I don’t 
– at no stage, was I advised that there is now a tender 
going on, until the tender gets to the Board. So, I find it 
quite normal that I wouldn’t know about it until it gets into 
the Board. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Memela, who was the head of 
10 
procurement at the time, joined you on that trip, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So, you don’t regard it as concerning 
that the head of procurement who would have known that 
the tender was open, didn’t alert you to that fact before 
you took this trip? 
MS KWINANA:   No Chair, no, not at all. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And why would she not be required to 
alert you, given that you’re the ultimate decision maker on 
the tender that was open? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   As I said, Chair, there are many processes 
that would go up to there, you may find out that she may 
not even be aware that there was also a tender going 
on…[intervenes]. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   As the head of procurement, she 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 95 of 279 
 
wouldn’t know that? 
MS KWINANA:   Most probably. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   For a contract worth more than a billion 
rand? 
MS KWINANA:   She may not be aware because those 
contract would happen – I’m not sure at what stage would 
she get involved but what I am saying is, at no stage did 
she tell me, with not a single tender that there’s a tender 
going on.  The only time that I would see that there is  a 
tender, is when it gets to the Board. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So you have no knowledge that the 
company of which you are the Chair of the Board, is out on 
tender to try and get component services, you don’t know 
at any point in time until you’re asked to make a decision 
on it, is that your evidence? 
MS KWINANA:   Until I’m asked to make a decision but 
maybe – let me go back to before the bid specification, 
then there would be a Board submission that would say the 
components tender will be up for renewal, it’s expiring on 
this date and then we say, okay, then start with the 
20 
process.  When they start with the process, sometimes 
they would report that six months before the expiry of the 
contract because the tender processes take longer.  So, 
basically when exactly the tender process is starting as 
long as we know in the beginning and then the tender 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 96 of 279 
 
specification and everything and basically that one is just 
for noting to say that there’s a big contract that is going to 
expire but if it doesn’t happen it could have an impact on 
the operations of the business. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So, you are given forewarning when 
tendering will take place on big contracts, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And in relation to this one in particular, 
the one that was advertised in October of 2014 and was 
still open in May of 2015, the Board became quite involved 
10 
in that tender, didn’t they, because you took a decision to 
retract it, at a point, didn’t you? 
MS KWINANA:   Not necessarily, quite involved, the 
retraction also came as a submission to the Board and all 
the reasons by Management which had been stated, until it 
gets to the Board.  So, when you say, quite involved, I tend 
to disagree with you on that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You were involved at the beginning, you 
know it’s going out to tender, and you’re involved when 
you’re asked to take a decision on it, correct? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, so in between it would be fair to 
assume, it’s still open, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So, you did know that it was still open 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 97 of 279 
 
when you went to the US? 
MS KWINANA:   You know Chair, there are so many 
tenders at SAA and SAA Technical and as a result, me, as 
the member of the Board, I do not have a book where I 
write that on this date, there was a notification that a 
tender is coming and then on that date the tender is 
advertised and on that date – no I don’t have that.  If they 
say, we note that the components tender is going to expire 
in the next six months and therefore we will go out to 
tender, we say, yes that is fine. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So, there are just too many tenders open 
at any point to keep your finger on one of them, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Exactly. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Exactly, and – so when you’re going to 
go overseas to the premises …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, Ms Hofmeyr can we take a five-
minute break ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Of course. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then we’ll come back. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us proceed. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 98 of 279 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Ms Kwinana do you accept that being flown 
in private jets and driven around in limousines are benefits 
to receive? 
MS KWINANA:  No Chair.  They are not benefits.  We were 
required to go to AAR as part of the due diligence and which 
has 
happened 
with 
many 
other 
companies 
including 
Lufthansa, including Air France, including Rolls Royce.  Now 
I do not consider that I received any benefit when they 
transported me in a private jet.  I really do not consider that 
as a benefit at all. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So just tell us about the due diligence.  
What were you doing a due diligence on? 
MS KWINANA:  For any company that we intend to work with 
in – at some stage there was a MOU non-binding MOU that 
SAAT had with AAR which basically was intended to take 
SAAT to the next level and therefore any company that we 
enter into as part of the due diligence we need to make sure 
that it is the company that exists; it is the company that is 
saying they are able to do and meet our requirements.  So it 
happens all the time. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And I accept that if you are embarking on a 
partnership with an entity you would like to know quite a bit 
about them.  And is that what the due diligence was 
designed to achieve for SAA Technical? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 99 of 279 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right.  The challenge I have with that is 
that you took the trip before the MOU was entered into and 
while a tender was still open in which AAR was a bidder.  
Now you have said previous there were just too many 
tenders open at any point in time to keep track of them, is 
that correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
Do 
you 
not 
think 
though 
as 
the 
Chairperson of the board of SAAT that was ultimately going 
to make a decision on that tender that it would have been 
10 
required of you to find out; just make sure that before you go 
and visit AAR in the US there is not a tender that is open in 
respect of which you will later be a decision maker? 
MS KWINANA:  We were not going there Chair for the 
purposes of the tender.  We were going there for the 
purposes of the partnership. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And… 
MS KWINANA:  And therefore I did not see any need for me 
in fact it never even rang a bell that I need to go and check 
if there is a tender going on and if AAR has tendered.  No I 
20 
did not and in fact as I am sitting here I really do not see any 
relevance in respect of that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So just to go back to the point that the 
Chair put to you yesterday.  I want to suggest what the 
relevance might be.   
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 100 of 279 
 
You see AAR was competing with other tenderers in 
that very tender that was still open.  And as the Chair put it 
to you yesterday that if you go and have dinner at a 
restaurant with one of the representatives of a bidder and 
one of their competitors sees you there they would be I 
would suggest quite fairly concerned about the fact that the 
decision maker is meeting with the competitor.   
And so I would like to put it to you that similarly if the 
other tenderers found out that you were taking a trip 
overseas aspects of which would be covered – the expenses 
10 
of which would be covered by their competitor bidder they 
would regard that as unfair in the process.  Do you accept 
that that would be unfair? 
MS KWINANA:  That would be unfair if SAA Technical did not 
do that to other tenderers.  SAA Technical had been to Air 
France.  SAA Technical had been to Lufthansa.  SAA 
Technical had been to basically almost all the big suppliers 
of SAA Technical.  So basically that was not abnormal. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But in a particular open tender Ms Kwinana 
I would put it to you that if only one of the bidders gets this 
20 
opportunity to get close to you; to spend days with you while 
you are at their premises; to drive you around in Limousines 
and put you on private jets the other tenderers could fairly 
say but we do not have that access to the decision maker.  
And that is inherently unfair in this process. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 101 of 279 
 
MS KWINANA:  Chair as I said SAA Technical has been to 
all these bidders. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes but Ms Kwinana do you know that they 
went to those other bidders when tenders were open in 
respect of which there were other competitors? 
MS KWINANA:  Then that would be tested Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No do you know?  Do you know whether 
those visits took place at a time when there were open 
tenders in respect of which there were other competitive 
bidders? 
10 
MS KWINANA:  I would not know Chair.  Much as I did not 
know that there was an open tender at that time. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That is the problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you see Ms Kwinana you said that you 
going to AAR would be unfair if you did not do the same to 
others.  And you said you had done the same or the board 
had done the same with others.   
But the two cases cannot be the same unless you say 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
others 
the 
trips 
also 
occurred 
in 
circumstances where there were bidders in a tender that was 
20 
still open.   
So if you do not have that information then you 
cannot use the other trips to the other service providers to 
justify to say it was not unfair to go to AAR at a time when 
the tender was still open.  You – it is one thing to say 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 102 of 279 
 
whether you were aware; you were not aware that they were 
party to a tender that was open. 
MS KWINANA:  I was not aware Chair.  Much as I was not 
aware if there was a tender open where AAR had bidded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if – let us say for argument sake you 
were aware would you agree that it would have been wrong 
to embark on such a trip at a time when the tender was still 
open if you were aware? 
MS KWINANA:  Chair even if I was aware I really would not 
see anything wrong in us undertaking that trip. The reason 
10 
being that there are rigorous processes that need to happen 
for – up to the stage where we get the recommendation and 
therefore that would not affect my decision whether I did go 
there or not.   
And in fact maybe the tender that you were talking 
about as much as we went to AAR – AAR did not win that 
tender because the – they had some deficiencies in terms of 
the tendering processes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No. 
MS KWINANA:  So basically what I am saying is that would 
20 
not impair my independence and thinking. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Kwinana  
MS KWINANA:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you really seriously mean what you are 
telling me? 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 103 of 279 
 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That in your judgment there would have 
been absolutely nothing wrong for you as a member of the 
board that would make a decision on a tender in regard to 
which AAR had put in a bid for you to go on a trip overseas 
to their premises without the knowledge of other bidders and 
let them wine you and dine you over there.  You say there 
would have been nothing wrong with that. 
MS KWINANA:  Chair the procurement processes are so 
rigorous such that… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Shoo. 
MS KWINANA:  Even if I went to Chicago if the bidder does 
not qualify the bidder does not qualify. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think Ms Kwinana quite frankly processes 
that in terms of which people are appointed as board 
members to SOE’s must be reviewed.  If that is what you 
think and you were the – you are a board member, you are a 
chartered accountant you think it would have been – there 
would have completely nothing wrong with that then there is 
something wrong in the appointment process.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Ms Kwinana I want to pick up on a point.  
You recently said that it was okay to be there because AAR 
did not win that tender they ended up not qualifying, correct? 
MS KWINANA:  No Chair.  I am not saying it would be okay 
because AAR did not win that tender. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 104 of 279 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS KWINANA:  I am saying as part of the due diligence we 
had to go there. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Why … 
MS KWINANA:  Whether AAR – whether AAR had bidded or 
not our visit to AAR was not informed by whether AAR had 
bidded or not. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No but you… 
MS KWINANA:  Our visit was informed by the partnership 
agreement that we wanted to enter into at that stage.  So it 
10 
was not informed by the tender.  Even if AAR did not tender 
we would still have to go – to Chicago. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No of course.  If AAR did not tender there 
would have been no problem with you going.  On that Ms 
Kwinana you and I agree completely.  The problem is that 
you go with one of the bidders right.  You are wined and 
dined by them and then they were not disqualified in this 
tender.  Do you remember what happened with this tender? 
MS KWINANA:  I read in the document I may remember the 
– the fact maybe incorrectly but it seems as if there was 
20 
some move to disqualify them. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No I think you might be confusing it.  You 
see because what happens is you go to America; you get 
wined and dined by AAR; you come back and the board 
decides to retract that tender – that tender in respect of 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 105 of 279 
 
which there were other competitors who might have been 
service providers to SAA Technical.  And you decide to 
embark on the MOU with AAR.  So your closeness with AAR 
led to a retraction of a tender in respect of which there were 
competitors to now form a partnership with AAR.  Do you not 
regard that as problematic either? 
MS KWINANA:  Chair it was – it is problematic at all. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right.  And if other competitors thought 
that the fact that you were in the US and being wined and 
dined by one of the bidders led you to cutting them out of 
10 
potential supply to SAA Technical and forging a partnership 
with the entity that had wined and dined you they would not 
have any complaints of unfairness.  Is that your approach? 
MS KWINANA:  I do not know Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not know what your approach is? 
MS KWINANA:  I do not know if they would complain or not. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No I am asking whether if they complained 
they would legitimately do so. 
MS KWINANA:  That would depend Chair.  It – that would be 
20 
proved in the court of law as it has happened with AAR and 
Air France whether it is legitimate or not. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  We will come back to the litigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if you do not get to a court of law it is 
fine. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 106 of 279 
 
MS KWINANA:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you do not get to a court of law it is not 
a problem? 
MS KWINANA:  It is not fine Chair but as SAA Technical at 
the time we considered that was the best decision that we 
did and in fact as I am still sitting here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which decision now? 
MS KWINANA:  The decision to form a partnership with AAR 
because 
the 
process 
– 
the 
partnership 
process 
was 
embarked into and it was agreed that we needed to form a 
10 
partnership hence the back of the MOU. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you get persuaded while you were 
overseas at AAR – being wined and dined by AAR that the 
way to go would be to retract the tender and enter into a 
MOU with AAR?  Is it something you get – got persuaded of 
when you were overseas? 
MS KWINANA:  No Chair.  I cannot be… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or when you came back. 
MS KWINANA:  I cannot be persuaded by wining and dining 
of AAR Chair because… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But at what point did you… 
MS KWINANA:  I was in a position to wine and dine myself if 
I wanted to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At what point did you see this point that 
the right way to go would be to retract the tender and enter 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 107 of 279 
 
into a MOU with AAR?  Was it while you were visiting AAR 
overseas or was it after you had returned? 
MS KWINANA:  Of course the MOU I am – I do not know the 
date but I would think the MOU would be entered after we 
have been there and seen the premises and seen what value 
can they add to SAA Technical 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what you saw on the trip would have 
influenced you to say we must go the MOU route? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So which means it was while you were 
10 
overseas on this trip that you got persuaded that you must 
go the MOU route? 
MS KWINANA:  We did not – we did not get persuaded 
Chair.  The purpose of our trip was to make sure that we 
confirm the resources that they said they had in the paper 
which we liked that this is the company that we can form a 
partnership with.   
So basically our trip there was to make sure to 
confirm what was in the paper.  It was not for them to 
persuade us.  We acted in the best interest of SAA Technical 
20 
to enter into that MOU which expired after six months after 
all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let Ms Hofmeyr ask her next question but 
before 
that 
I 
want 
to 
go 
back 
to 
the 
question 
of 
communication with a bidder while a tender is open.  The 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 108 of 279 
 
basis on which you have now today said there would have 
been nothing wrong for you to go on this trip even if you 
were aware that AAR was one of the bidders in the tender 
that was still open is that the company that is SAA Technical 
had a rigorous procurement process so as I understand it 
you were not going to be influenced by anything because 
there is a rigorous procurement process.   
I do not remember you advancing that as the reason 
yesterday for saying communication between a decision 
maker could take place – communication could take place 
10 
between a decision maker in regard to a tender and a 
director of a company that has put in a bid.  I thought you 
advanced a different basis, am I right – am I right in 
understanding that? 
MS KWINANA:  I may not have remembered Chair what 
basis did I advance.  However I remember me saying that 
there are processes including combined assurance providers 
and 
I 
mentioned 
internal 
audit; 
external 
audit; 
risk 
management and management as a whole which basically 
would also form part of the chain within the procurement 
20 
process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I seem to think that at least at one stage 
the 
basis 
you 
advanced 
was 
that 
as 
long 
as 
the 
communication did not include discussing the tender there 
would be nothing wrong with the decision maker having 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 109 of 279 
 
communication of even having dinner or lunch with the 
director of a company that had put in a bid in regard to a 
tender that was still open.  At least that was either the basis 
you advanced or one of them.  Is that your recollection as 
well? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair and in addition to that there are 
these rigorous processes that I told you about today.  And 
more importantly at SAA there is a cross-functional 
CHAIRPERSON:  Team. 
MS KWINANA:  Team yes which basically is responsible to 
10 
make sure that the process is thorough and in fact you can 
even see their minutes that there was a process that was the 
process that was followed.  So in addition to that cross-
functional team there is also the bid adjudication committee 
and then there is EXCO and all of these people basically are 
the gate keepers of making sure that procurement processes 
are followed to the letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But we saw yesterday from your evidence 
how this board of which you were a member at SAA at least 
you know could override a decision by other people in regard 
20 
to the Air Chefs contract.  You did not even want to look at 
the motivation put up by the acting CEO because you had 
decided you were going to override them; you were going to 
reverse the decision.  That is – that can happen when people 
know they have got power.  They might disregard whatever 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 110 of 279 
 
other people have said. 
MS KWINANA:  Chair I said yesterday the Air Chefs 
retraction of that tender was – the circumstances were 
different. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you do not have to repeat them.  I 
remember the circumstances you gave.  I was just saying but 
whatever you said what was quite clear from your evidence 
was that at least the SAA board of which you were a member 
you know would not hesitate to reverse a decision made by 
other people within the company and in your case would not 
10 
even bother to look at the motivation for the decision that 
they – they would – they wanted to reverse.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
Thank 
you 
Chair. 
 
Ms 
Kwinana 
I 
understood you yesterday to accept in your evidence that as 
a general principle boards of state owned enterprises should 
not get involved in operational matters.  Do you accept that? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That is left to the management of the SOE, 
correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So then can you just help me why it was at 
all necessary for non-executive board members of SAA 
Technical to go on this due diligence trip at all?  Should that 
not have been left to management? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one second before she answers.  Ms 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 111 of 279 
 
Mbanjwa. 
ADV MBANJWA:  Thank you Chair.  It was actually a 
response to what the Chair had put to the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MBANJWA:  And I just want Chair to remind you what 
the evidence of the witness was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MBANJWA:  The evidence of the witness was this.  The 
reason why the Air Chefs tender that is the award to LSG 
was reversed by board was because of application of a 
10 
section in the Public Finance Management act and the fact 
that that is a tender that ought not to have gone out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that is what… 
ADV MBANJWA:  Before …. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what I told her not to remind me 
because I remember what her evidence was. 
ADV MBANJWA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MBANJWA:  So it is – because that is creating the 
impression that they can override.  They do not override they 
20 
apply. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no.  I remembered what evidence 
she gave. 
ADV MBANJWA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr I think you had asked a 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 112 of 279 
 
question? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes I had asked why if board members are 
not supposed to involve themselves in operational matters it 
was necessary for non-executive members of the board to go 
on this trip to do a due diligence.  Should that not have been 
left to management? 
MS KWINANA:  It has been at SAA Technical it has been a 
practice that the board and management who undertake this 
trip and it also did happen at AAR. Both board and 
management did go to this trip. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Why only some board members then? 
MS KWINANA:  Of course it would depend on the meeting 
who would be selected to go and it also would apply with 
management.  Not everybody would go because that would 
mean that all management it depends who is nominated to 
go and represent SAA Technical. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I can understand that for management I 
cannot 
really 
understand 
it 
for 
non-executive 
board 
members.  Why should there – why should some of you have 
the benefit of this and not others? 
20 
MS KWINANA:  Chair it has been – it has been the case.  
People have been nominated in board meetings.  Like for 
instance when SAAT went to Lufthansa and when SAAT went 
to Air France I was a board member at SAA Technical and I 
did not go to these trips.  So it depends who is nominated in 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 113 of 279 
 
a meeting to go. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So you did it because it was a practice, is 
that correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Did you ever look at whether the practice 
made sense? 
MS KWINANA:  For me it made sense because SAA 
Technical is involved in high value contract and therefore 
also as the members of the board then the needed to go.  I 
really did not see anything wrong. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Why would they need to go? 
MS KWINANA:  The previous – the previous – the previous 
chairpersons did go and I also do not see the reason why 
they would not go. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Well because… 
MS KWINANA:  [00:25:32] that they have a fiduciary 
responsibility to make sure that the companies that SAA 
Technical enters into are genuine companies, are the 
companies that have got capacity.  So I really did not see 
anything wrong in the board members going in the previous 
20 
board members going and me remaining behind I really did 
not see anything wrong. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Well let me put to you what might be 
wrong.  You see on your version you went so a due diligence 
could be done. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 114 of 279 
 
MS KWINANA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You have a full management team with no 
doubt the expertise. 
MS KWINANA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  To evaluate the proposed partner. 
MS KWINANA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  They would go; they would do the 
necessary and they would report to you.  Your evidence 
yesterday is that these SOE’s were populated by highly 
qualified people.   
10 
And 
the 
reason 
for 
separation 
Ms 
Kwinana 
is 
precisely because as the ultimate accounting authority you 
must make the final call on these decisions so you do not 
want to be influenced along the way.   
You leave your managers to do operational stuff; to 
do the nitty gritty of the due diligence.  They feed it into you, 
you assess it, you can go back you can say it is not good 
enough but you do not get on a plane and go and be wined 
and dined by somebody who is a bidder in a process.   
Do you accept that that might be a better way to do 
20 
it? 
MS KWINANA:  Chair this has been the practice and I do not 
doubt the intelligence of the people who made those 
decisions including my own intelligence Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Ms Kwinana you enter – you come back 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 115 of 279 
 
right.  You retract the tender and you enter into the MOU.  
And I heard you a moment ago I think say entering into that 
MOU was one of the best decisions that SAA Technical took, 
is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:  That was – that was the best decision that 
SAA Technical entered into the reason being that AAR is 
providing [00:27:44] components in almost all the airlines 
and therefore the reason why SAA Technical has been 
incurring losses or one of the reasons is because we have 
been using the middle man to get to this purpose that AAR is 
10 
supporting.   
So that is why I am saying if and in fact AAR has got 
a network all over the world which SAA Technical would also 
tap into.  So that is why I am saying it was one of the best 
decisions that we made.   
And in fact Chair I said they are – I do not regret a 
single decision that I made when I was a board member at 
SAA and SAA Technical but some of the decisions are 
definitely better than the others and this one was one of 
those. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I just want to be sure that we are on the 
same page.  Because what you have given now as I 
understand your evidence is a justification for choosing AAR 
ultimately to be the components supplier.  But your evidence 
earlier was that deciding to embark on the MOU – the 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 116 of 279 
 
Memorandum of Understanding with AAR was one of the best 
decisions that the board has taken. 
MS KWINANA:  Yes, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Do you stand by that? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Why was it abandoned a month later then? 
MS KWINANA:  It is because the Terms and Conditions was 
that after – I think it was six months it was a six month MOU 
the Terms and Conditions required that after six months if 
nothing – if no relationship happens then it needed to be 
10 
cancelled. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No that would explain why six months later 
it did not continue.  It was reversed a month after it was 
entered into.  How could that be a good decision? 
MS KWINANA:  I may not remember about the reversal a 
month after.  My recollection is that that MOU was a six 
month contract – so it is six months MOU and after six 
months it expired.  So the one month, I really do not 
remember. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay.  But in your mind, even from as 
20 
early as that trip, I understand your evidence to be, you had 
identified AAR as an excellent supplier of component parts.  
Is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you believe that for SAA Technical to 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 117 of 279 
 
partner with AAR would be one of the best things that it 
could do.  Is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  Mr Parsons who was your co-board 
member around this time had some concerns about that 
MOU.  Are you aware of them? 
MS KWINANA:   You know I do not even want to talk about 
Mr Parsons.  The reason being that he was not even 
supposed to be in that board because he was an illegal 
immigrant.  Anyway.  I ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you aware that he had concerns?  
That is the question. 
MS KWINANA:   I am aware that he had concerns and I even 
wrote him a letter, an email to say:  Let us meet so that I can 
hear your concerns.  And to be honest Chair.  That email that 
Barry(?) wrote, I did not even understand what he was 
complaining about.  What I know is that he was very, very 
disgruntled ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja-no, you will not be asked about that 
email as yet.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So you say he was disgruntled that he did 
not get to go on the trip? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Oh.  Alright.  So did you surmise that he 
writes this letter because he did not get on the trip with you 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 118 of 279 
 
to the US? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you have any facts to back that up? 
MS KWINANA:   The reason is that he was doing the 
walkabout with AAR people at SAA Technical and he 
supported this thing, the partnership and he was very 
supportive and he liked it.  And then all of a sudden now he 
turns around and writes that email and subsequently he 
resigned. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So the trip was really something that 
10 
mattered to the board members, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, the trip mattered to the board 
members. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   H’m, h’m.  And he had been excluded.  So 
he felt left out.  Is that your version? 
MS KWINANA:   No, he was part of that meeting that 
decided who should go.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   But he holds some discomfort or 
frustration maybe about the fact that he was not selected, 
correct? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   Everybody in the board meeting needs to 
decide.  It is not only one person who decides.  Everybody 
decides. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, indeed. 
MS KWINANA:   He also had an opportunity of deciding and 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 119 of 279 
 
make a recommendation as to who should go. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, Ms Kwinana it is not about that.  I 
mean, Ms Hofmeyr is really asking – is following up on your 
evidence that he was disgruntled.  Did he ever say:  I want 
to go.  At the board meeting? 
MS KWINANA:   I do not remember him saying he wants to 
go because if he wanted to go, obviously, that would be 
discussed and then a decision would have been made to say:  
Yes, you can go or you cannot go.  With some reasons. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you know of any reason why, if he 
10 
wanted to go, he would not have expressed that wish at the 
board meeting? 
MS KWINANA:   Even at...  I later came to understand 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no.  Ms Kwinana, do you know of 
any reason why, if he wanted to go on the trip, he would not 
have expressed that wish at the meeting? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.  It is because ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the reason that you know? 
MS KWINANA:   I know that he is stays in South Africa at – 
20 
was illegal at the time.  And then therefore it would be 
difficult for him to get out of the country. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So why would he be disgruntled about not 
being nominated to go on a trip of which he could not go 
anyway even if he wanted to?  Where is the logic in that? 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 120 of 279 
 
MS KWINANA:   Well, basically Chair that is the only reason 
why I would think that all of a sudden after the trip he 
resigned.  Otherwise, that would ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, but we talk about ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   It is purely speculation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us talk about your evidence that he 
was disgruntled because he was not allowed to go on the 
trip.  He was not nominated.  If he – on your evidence, he 
knew that he could to go out of the country.  How could he 
be disgruntled about not being nominated?  Because even if 
10 
he had been nominated, he would have been bound to 
decline.  It does not make sense, does it? 
MS KWINANA:   That is the speculation Chair because I, as I 
am sitting here and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But your speculation has no basis.  It 
does not make sense.  You are saying, he could not leave 
the country because he was illegal and he knew it, in the 
country.  And then you say, he was disgruntled because he 
was not nominated to go on the trip.   
 
But if he knew that he was illegal and therefore could 
20 
not get out of the country, logically he could not be 
disgruntled 
about 
something 
that 
he 
could 
not 
take 
advantage of. 
MS KWINANA:   Maybe Chair he was disgruntled because he 
could not go ...[intervenes]  
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 121 of 279 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, is that another speculation? 
MS KWINANA:   ...not being nominated.  But he could not 
go. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that another speculation? 
MS KWINANA:   It is a speculation Chair because I do not 
understand his email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr. 
MS KWINANA:   And ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   You see, his letter is very clear about his 
reasons, right?  His letter, which you will find in your bundle 
10 
Ms Kwinana at DD33, page 22.  So we are at Exhibit DD33, 
page 22. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do I need to go there? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I am just going to read two points that he 
made that I like to pick up on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Because Ms Kwinana has said that she 
does not understand from this letter, as I have it, why he was 
20 
leaving.  Is that your evidence Ms Kwinana? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  He says: 
“Please accept my resignation with immediate effect 
on the Board of Directors of SAA Technical.  I feel 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 122 of 279 
 
like I made a strong contribution to the board, 
finding governance in the business, weep(?) after 
what happened – what appeared years of neglect.   
Unfortunately, the value I can add seems no longer 
wanted as it is quite clearly due to the AAR 
corporations strategic partnership. 
There is clearly a hidden agenda somewhere in this 
relationship and it requires urgent independent 
investigation.” 
 
So if I read that, he is communicating that he is 
10 
concerned that there is something hidden in this relationship 
that SAA Technical is forging with AAR.  Do you understand 
it in the same way? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  What is not clear about that reason? 
MS KWINANA:   What is not clear is that this person was 
very excited about this relationship and he was the person 
who was walking the AAR Team about.  And then now, all of 
a sudden, he writes this letter.  So basically, I just do not 
understand. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Well, he ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But...  Precisely because he has realised 
that there is something hidden that he does not agree with.  
That is why he attitude changes.  That is logic.   
MS KWINANA:   Maybe Chair that is what he should have 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 123 of 279 
 
written that hidden agenda.  He could have said:  I think 
there is a hidden agenda.  A hidden agenda being A, B, C, D 
and E. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, he does do that.  So ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   Oh, he goes further? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   He goes on.  He explains precisely what 
his concerns are.  He talks about the irregular way in which 
the MOU was concluded.  He raised a series of concerns 
about it ...[indistinct]  
MS KWINANA:   [Indistinct]  
10 
[Parties intervening each other and cannot be heard clearly.] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   [Indistinct]  
MS KWINANA:   You take ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana, wait until Ms Hofmeyr has 
finished what she has to say. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Kwinana, I am trying to summarise.  
We can read every word of this letter if it is necessary.  It 
was in your bundle.  So I assume you have taken some time 
to look at it beforehand.  I am summarising now but if you 
would like to go through it yourself, you must let us know.   
20 
 
He, in essence, says the following.  He had reservations 
about the conclusion of the MOU.  He raises the concern 
about when it was entered into because there were certain 
time periods that was supposed to run and it was unclear 
when it was entered into.   
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 124 of 279 
 
 
That appears in much more detail before this letter but 
here he is summarising it.  And then importantly.  In the 
penultimate as paragraph on page 23, he says: 
“My other specific concern is the identification and 
selection of the BBBEE partners, if any, for the 
proposed jointed venture, a process that needs to 
be highly transparent in a business that already has 
an uncompetitive cost base. 
The 
MOU received includes 
an implementation 
timetable that suggests this process may already be 
10 
significantly advanced and there is no visibility of 
this to either the SAA Technical or SAA boards or 
National Treasury.” 
 
He concludes: 
“I hope the company shares my concerns and 
appreciate that I have no confidence in the integrity 
of the SAA Technical Board and my membership of 
that board has become a reputational matter and it 
is a simple decision to submit my resignation.” 
 
What would you not understand about that Ms Kwinana? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   I still do not understand when he talks 
about the identification and the selection of the BEE 
partners.  I also do not understand the MOU, what is not 
clear about the MOU.   
 
And another thing.  For him being a board member, he 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 125 of 279 
 
should have raised these issues in a meeting.  And then now, 
he just resigns without raising the issues and get them 
properly attended to.   
 
So basically, I really do not understand.  And if, for 
instance, he is talking about the AAR and the identification 
and the selection of the BEE partners and he referred to all 
other companies.   
 
We do not – of course, we have got a list of the BEE 
companies that would want to do business with SAA.  But 
now, the selection of the BEE partners also do follow a 
10 
rigorous process to be included in the database of the 
BEE’s.   
 
So basically, if Mr Parsons had a problem with that, he 
was a board member.  He had the platform to raise his 
issues and make sure that they are properly communicated.   
 
As I said, I needed to have a meeting with him and then 
we decide what needs to happen.  And instead of us 
meeting, he just resigned.  So basically, I do not understand 
a person at his level who has the platform to put together 
what his concerns are, he is unable to do that and he simply 
20 
resigns. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  It is about lunchtime.  But Mbanjwa

ADV HOFMEYR:   I think so, I might have even heard two, 
but it might have been five past.  We can try and take 
steps to contact them.  I think we might have a cell phone

INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
MS 
KWINANA: 
 
 
Sorry 
Chair 
I 
have 
to 
apologise 
unreservedly, I thought it is quarter past two, so we were 
informed by Mr Kirkland to say it is actually five past two, 
our sincere apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay alright, just pay attention more 
next time when we say what time we are coming back.  
10 
MS KWINANA:   Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay, alright.  Let us continue. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair.   Ms Kwinana I 
indicated that we are going to be focusing on the AAR 
contract and what we’ve done in the evidence so far is that 
we have looked at the trip that some members of the Board 
and management of SAA Technical took to the US we have 
looked at the MOU and the concerns that your Co-Board 
member Mr Parson’s had about that MOU.  I would now like 
to get to get to the actual final tender that was awarded to 
20 
the joint venture of AAR and JM Aviation.  Are you aware 
that that was advertised at the end of 2015 I think the date 
was the 8 t h of December 2015.   
CHAIRPERSON:    Just repeat the answers so it can be 
recorded.   
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 128 of 279 
 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you did tell me previously that you 
had watched some of Ms Memela’s evidence but not all of 
it.  Is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Were you aware of the part in which she 
was taken to the requirements in the RFB for this tender 
that prohibited communications with anyone other than the 
project manager? 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You were not aware of that? 
MS KWINANA:   No.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay so I would like to take you to that 
today because what we have traversed with Ms Memela is 
that she had received communication from JM Aviation the 
joint venture partner of AAR while the bids were open and 
she was asked to comment on the bid submission of JM 
Aviation as well as to give input on their JV agreement and 
what we showed her was that that was in breach of the 
RFB, of the bid so I would like to take you to it.  You will - 
20 
would find it in actually Mr Human’s bundle which is DD22 
and it is the mini files for Mr Human.  So this is DD22E and 
you will need to pick it up at page 2052, two thousand and 
fifty-two.  So the page is 2052, two zero five two and just 
for the record where everyone is turning up that page I do 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 129 of 279 
 
not suggest that we go there just so that you know that the 
bid, the request for bid commences in Exhibit DD22E 2043 
but what I am wanting us to look at is 2052.   
So that is within the request for bid and it includes 
a Clause 1.6 on that page.  Do you see that Ms Kwinana?     
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   And what that says is Clause 1.6.1: 
“All queries or information relating to this document 
or surrounding the bid must be addressed to the 
project manager as stipulated on page 1 of this RFB 
10 
in writing.” 
And then Clause 1.6.2: 
“Any queries addressed to individuals other than as 
stipulated where the verbal telephonic and written 
or in any other form will eliminate the bidder from 
this process.” 
Do you see that?     
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   So it was put to Ms Memela that her 
communications with Ms Sekulu who was representing JM 
20 
Aviation at the time that the bid was open were in breach 
of that clause.  So you agree that those communications 
would have been in breach of that clause? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   So now I am drawing your attention 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 130 of 279 
 
because you did not see Ms Memela's evidence on this 
previously, that JM Aviation and AAR could never have 
been awarded this tender.  Do you accept that?   
MS KWINANA:   I do not want to say I accept or I do not 
accept but as I said if the procurement processes were not 
followed or were flawed in one way or another then 
necessary steps would have been taken.     
ADV HOFMEYR:   Well no what this says at clause 1.6.2 is 
that if you address any queries to anyone other than the 
project manager you are eliminated from this process.  
10 
What possible steps could then have been taken?  
MS KWINANA:   Maybe Chair you see when you get me to 
read only this and then the tender process as it is starts 
from the beginning up to the end and then now you are 
telling me about the people who communicated. I do not 
want to comment about the people who communicated 
because I do not know what they were communicating 
about and I do not know if they communicated specifically 
with this.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay so that is why I assisted with just a 
20 
summary of the evidence that was presented.  Would you 
like me to take you to the communications between JM 
Aviation and Ms Memela? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, so let us go to the Sambu Bundle 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 131 of 279 
 
that is DD18 and we will need to go to page 339. 
CHAIRPERSON:    I think somebody will assist you Ms 
Kwinana you can sit down somebody must get the file for 
you.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, we do have assistance thank you so 
much.  So we’re looking for DD18, one eight and we going 
to begin at page 339.  
CHAIRPERSON:    It was with her just now I think it must 
the one on top of the others it must be one of those, ja.    
ADV HOFMEYR:   So 339 is the page.  Okay so Ms 
10 
Kwinana what you see here is midway down the page do 
you see that there is a from Khosi Sekulu date 14 January 
2016 at four in the afternoon to Nomsasa Memela at an 
ICloud email address and the subject is: 
“RE: Joint Venture Draft Agreement.” 
Do you see that?        
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   So this is the communication between 
Ms Sekulu, what was Ms Sekulu’s status at JM Aviation?  
MS KWINANA:   A director.  
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, so director of JM Aviation’s sends 
to Ms Memela who was the Head of Procurement at SAAT 
the joint venture draft agreement that was going to be 
entered into between JM Aviation and AAR and she says: 
“Hi cousin this is the first draft of the JV so far.  
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 132 of 279 
 
Jules did a quick review and noticed the following 
and 
then 
point 
1 
relates 
to 
the 
agreed 
participation.” 
So JM Aviation was going to 5% and AAR 95% then Clause 
6 said: 
“Participation interest the same JM Aviation, 5% 
AAR, 95%.” 
And then over the page: 
“As per the collaboration agreement JMS to receive 
5% of any amounts received by AAR from SAAT, this 
10 
is linked to revenue not profits.  For example, if 
SAAT remits a 100 000 US Dollars to AAR then JM 
is to receive five million US Dollars, sorry 5 000 US 
Dollars.” 
Did I say millions earlier I might have, sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:    I did not hear.                
ADV HOFMEYR:    
“100 000,00 US dollars then JM Aviation gets 5 000 
US dollars.  The way the participation interest 
clause is written and states that JM will receive 5% 
20 
of the profits this is not correct. We need to 
determine what will 5% of revenue equate to as a 
parentage ownership of the joint venture for JM, 
please let me know if there is anything that we 
might have overlooked?” 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 133 of 279 
 
So this is a communication between a bidder and a Head of 
Procurement who confirmed in her evidence fairly that she 
was 
not 
the 
project 
manager 
with 
whom 
the 
only 
communications could take place asking for her input on 
the way that they were structuring the JV agreement and 
the look through the JM Aviation would have to all revenue 
generated by AAR.  The second communication you will 
find at page 367.  Now 367 is an email of the same day 
again you must go halfway down it is from Ms Sekulu 
again, 14 t h of January 2016 now it is thirteen minutes past 
10 
eight in the evening to Ms Memela at her iCloud address.  
It says: 
“Subject forward RE: South Africa Draft Proposal. 
Hi Cuz, so here is the latest proposal let me know if 
it is acceptable thanks.” 
And then if you turn over two pages you will see there at 
page 369 what was attached and that is the then draft of 
the AAR, JM Aviation bid.  So now having seen those 
documents are you then satisfied that JM Aviation and AAR 
should have been eliminated from his process?            
20 
MS KWINANA:   I do not want to say yes or no that would 
also depend on the role that Ms Memela would play in 
respect of the joint venture.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   No it does not, do you remember we saw 
the clause.  The clause says: 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 134 of 279 
 
“Any queries addressed to individuals other than as 
stipulated i.e. the project manager where the verbal 
telephonic and written or in any other form will 
eliminate the bidder from this process.” 
Ms Kwinana? 
CHAIRPERSON:    Well I am sorry Ms Hofmeyr, let us just 
go back to that page where that clause is just to make sure 
you know what you are clear about what clause Ms 
Hofmeyr is talking about at page 205 of DD22E.      
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    DD22E at page 2052.  Have you got it? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON: Ja, Clause 1.6 this is communication 
surrounding the RFB clause 1.6.1: 
“All queries or information relating to this document 
or surrounding the bid must be addressed to the 
project manager as stipulated on page 1 of this RFB 
in writing.” 
1.6.2: 
“Any queries addressed to individuals other than as 
20 
stipulated whether verbal, telephonic and written or 
in any other form will eliminate the bidder from this 
process.” 
Do you understand that?    
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.  
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 135 of 279 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now my understanding of this clause 
1.6.2 is that if any bidder communicates in any way about 
the 
bid 
other 
than 
through 
the 
project 
manager, 
communicates with other people in the company that bidder 
is 
eliminated, 
no 
discussion, 
that 
is 
it. 
 
Is 
your 
understanding the same or is it different?     
MS KWINANA:   My understanding is the same in respect 
of this 1.6.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes.  
MS KWINANA:   However as I said yesterday there are 
10 
many circumstances surrounding that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   There are many circumstances that 
what? 
MS KWINANA:   Surrounding that and some time yesterday 
I spoke about a situation where sometimes it is impractical. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But hang on, excuse me, this is a rule 
put into a bid, isn’t it? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you see that it doesn’t provide for 
any exceptions, do you see that? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So there are now exceptions provided 
for, so how are you going to create your own exceptions to 
the role, because if anybody thinks there are difficulties 
with the rule then they must use internal processes to say 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 136 of 279 
 
we mustn’t have such a rule, we must change it, isn’t it? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair.. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you can’t have a situation where the 
rule has no exceptions and anybody is free to make their 
own exceptions then the rule will not work, you accept 
that? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay, thank you.  Ms Mbanjwa? 
MS MBANJWA:   Thank you Chair, if I can take Chair back 
to 2052, the clause that has just been read, Clause 1.6.2, 
10 
that clause has a heading, “communication surrounding the 
RFB”. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well what you – immediately you say 
that it seems to me something that you should reserve for 
re-examination because it seems you want a certain 
qualification or meaning to be attached to it which you can 
do at re-examination. 
MS MBANJWA:   No Chair, I don’t want to be obstructive 
but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But you see ...[intervenes]  
20 
MS MBANJWA:   ...[indistinct – talking over one another] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on Ms Mbanjwa, you see the 
danger of doing that now is that it will look like you are 
giving a tip to the witness ...[intervenes]  
MS MBANJWA:   No, I wanted ...[intervenes]  
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 137 of 279 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if you reserve it for later then 
nobody will think they that you are trying to give a tip to 
the witness. 
MS MBANJWA:   No Chair, I know I am not giving a tip to 
the witness, actually the question is addressed to Ms 
Hofmeyr, what I want Ms Hofmeyr to do, because she has 
referred us to this other bundle, that is bundle BD18, which 
is of a JV, so I want now Ms Hofmeyr to show us what kind 
of communication is mentioned in the RFB under which the 
day before. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no please leave Ms Hofmeyr to do 
her job as she sees fit you will come in at re-examination 
and either exploit whatever you believe is a witness on 
how she did the job but leave that for re-examination.   Ms  
Hofmeyr? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair, so Ms Kwinana I 
understand your evidence to be that you and the Chair 
agree on your understanding of that clause, that there is 
no exceptions, that the bidder will be eliminated from the 
process and I actually do want to add clause 1.6.3 because 
20 
I think if there was any debate, which I don’t think there 
can be, 1.6.3 concludes the point because it says: 
“no discussions will be entered into surrounding 
elimination 
through 
non-compliance 
in 
Clause 
1.6.1.” 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 138 of 279 
 
So I would say what was already clear in 1.6.2 is 
emphasize again in 1.6. we are not even going to debate 
the issue if you communicate you will be eliminated.  Now 
Ms Kwinana if you as a Board member, the Chair of SAAT 
had had this brought to your attention when you decided to 
award this joint venture to AAR and JM Aviation would you 
have said they have been eliminated, I cannot award this 
to JM Aviation and AAR. 
MS KWINANA:   What the management would bring to the 
Board they would bring say a recommendation or the 
10 
cancellation of the tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please raise your voice. 
MS KWINANA:   Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS KWINANA:   So what I am saying Chair what would 
come to the Board would be a recommendation from 
management, from the CEO and is executives to say there 
are flaws in respect of this tender, and therefore we 
recommend that the tender be cancelled and then they 
would state whatever the reasons that they put to cancel 
20 
the tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana I am sorry please you – 
there is no need to give a long answer to this, the question 
that Ms Hofmeyr is putting to you is if you knew this rule 
as it reads, and you told me what your understanding is of 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 139 of 279 
 
it, and it is the same as my understanding, if you knew this 
rule and you knew what had happened with regard to this 
communication, would you have taken the attitude that 
therefore this bidder had been eliminated or would you not 
have done it? 
MS KWINANA:  Chair how basically we decide I wouldn’t 
just say eliminate the tender, even if I knew I would take it 
to the Board and get the circumstances surrounding that 
before 
the 
Board 
decides 
that 
the 
tender 
must 
be 
cancelled. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I mean you have agreed that this rule 
does 
not 
make 
provision 
for 
exceptions, 
so 
what 
circumstances would you look for? 
MS KWINANA:   How we decided Chair at the Board even 
if I knew this information there is no ways that I would go 
in the passage and say this bidder is eliminated even if I 
knew about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no it is not about the passage, it is 
about in your own mind what would you understand the 
effect of a breach of this rule to be, would you accept that 
20 
the effect was that this bidder was eliminated or would you 
say the bidder was not eliminated even though the bidder 
had acted in breach of this rule?   Now that on your own 
once you know that this is the rule, this is what it says, 
there are no exceptions that it provides for, this bidder has 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 140 of 279 
 
acted in breach of this rule? 
MS KWINANA:   Chair I wouldn’t be in a position to do that 
on my own. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You would have to take a view, I mean 
that’s what Ms Hofmeyr wants to establish from you, what 
is the view that you would have, would it be that a breach 
of this role means the bidder is eliminated or would you 
start saying well there must be some exceptions or would 
you say no it is not eliminated because when you meet as 
a board you must have thought about issues and taken a 
10 
view yourself. 
MS KWINANA:   Of course Chair looking on the face of it 
before considering the reasons why and circumstances, on 
the face of it I would be of the view that the bidder should 
be eliminated, however as I said I would not be in a 
position to say eliminate on my own, I would gather some 
evidence and find out what happened, and whether indeed 
that should be eliminated and in fact that would be decided 
not by me only as the Chairperson but also all the 
members of the Board. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well you know Ms Hofmeyr drew your 
attention to Clause 1.6.3 and I think she is right in saying 
if you look at that clause if there was any doubt that 
anybody had about the meaning of Clause 1.6.2 that doubt 
is removed when you get to Clause 1.6.3 because it is – 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 141 of 279 
 
the message is clear, a breach of this rule is so serious 
that the company will not entertain any discussions with 
the bidder about the elimination.  If you are eliminated 
because you have acted in breach of this rule there will be 
no discussions, you are cut off, that’s how serious the 
company took this issue of communication between a 
bidder and officials other than the project manager.  This 
says we have one person to talk to, or communicate with 
about the bid, this is the project manager.   So you cannot 
say you do not have anybody to talk to, but if you then go 
10 
and communicate with somebody else you are in breach of 
this, you have been told this, you know about it because it 
is included here, there will be no discussions, you are 
eliminated.   
 
Now do you have any doubt that that is how 
emphatic the message underlying this clause is? 
MS KWINANA:  No Chair I have not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have no doubt, okay alright.  Thank 
you.  Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But then Ms Kwinana in fairness to you I 
20 
don’t 
really 
understand 
your 
resistance 
to 
saying 
absolutely, if this came to my attention as the Chair of the 
SAA Technical Board that a bidder was being proposed to 
the Board to be confirmed for this contract that ought to 
have been eliminated, you wouldn’t resolutely say there is 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 142 of 279 
 
no way that they can be awarded this tender.  Why do you 
resist saying clearly they should have been eliminated, 
they should not have got this tender. 
MS KWINANA:   I am not resisting Chair but I am 
emphasizing 
the 
collective 
Board 
decision 
because 
definitely I wouldn’t say this is eliminated, that is why I am 
saying we would take it to the Board and decide as a 
collective so basically that is not how we decide, I don’t 
decide alone Chair in the Board. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   In ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But Ms Kwinana I have told you what Ms 
Hofmeyr is looking for is your own judgment of what is 
permitted and what is not permitted if there are rules that 
say A, B, C, D, you might not be the person in a particular 
case to make the decision but you can have a view and in 
this case when you are Chairperson of a Board you are the 
leader and you should show the way, you should be clear 
about what the rules are, you should be clear about how 
the rules must be enforced, compliance with the rules, so if 
you say it is the collective, the collective might have to 
20 
take a decision if the power to make a decision is given to 
the collective but that does not mean you cannot or should 
not have your own view of what is permitted, and what is 
not permitted in terms of the rules, do you understand? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 143 of 279 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright.  Ms Mbanjwa? 
MS MBANJWA:   Chair I know you are going to be 
frustrated but I still feel the question that is put to the 
witness is incorrect because we were not referred to 
something in the RFB that says communication between 
two bidders about a JV is a violation of the provision of 
that RV. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes I am going to say again Ms Mbanjwa 
when you re-examine you can get that clarified.  Ms 
Hofmeyr? 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  So can I then take it to be 
your evidence that Ms Kwinana you accept that AAR and 
JM Aviation should not have been awarded this tender 
because they should have been eliminated?  
MS KWINANA:   As I said Chair I would not say they 
should 
have 
been 
eliminated 
or 
not, 
because 
the 
circumstances surrounding that my lawyer wants to clarify 
something and we are unable to do that, and therefore 
what you are saying to me you are saying I must agree that 
I should have said that and therefore I will not do that 
20 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on Ms Hofmeyr.   You see Ms 
Mbanjwa this is what I was talking about, that when the 
witness is still being asked questions and you raise the 
issues that you raise this is what is going to happen, now 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 144 of 279 
 
she is saying because her lawyer is raising a certain issue 
she is not going to answer that.  It does not do her any 
good. She should be seen to be giving her evidence without 
assistance from anybody.  You see.  But if you do that it 
gives rise to that perception even if you might not intend it 
that way yourself.  Okay Ms Hofmeyr what was your answer 
Ms Kwinana?  You said you would – you will not give an 
answer or what was your answer? 
MS KWINANA:  I was saying Chair I would not with certainty 
say they should have been eliminated or not because as I 
10 
said before that would depend on the circumstances and I 
have seen these clauses.  But now they needed to be read 
together with the whole bid and together with what was 
discussed here.  And therefore there needs to be some 
alignment between what is discussed here and also with the 
RFP. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
I 
am 
not 
in 
any 
doubt 
that 
the 
communication with Ms Memela and Ms Sokhulu was about 
the bid. Are you in any doubt about that? 
MS KWINANA:  It is – the communication is about the JV 
20 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The agreement? 
MS KWINANA:  The communication. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes relates to the draft agreement. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  [inaudible] 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 145 of 279 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That relates to… 
ADV HOFMEYR:  It is the draft agreement is the first email.  
The second email attaches the bid – the bid and says is it 
acceptable.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That is what the second email says. 
MS KWINANA:  Okay this one is – this one is the JV and 
then where is the email that attaches the bid? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  367.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
10 
MS KWINANA:  Oh okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have moved – we moved from the… 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Apologies we did Chair.  So we are in 
DD18 at 367. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At DD20? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No DD18. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  At 367. 
CHAIRPERSON:  367. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes because remember there were two 
20 
communications on the 14 January.  I took you to the first 
email that is at four o’clock in the afternoon.  There was a 
moment of some humour in Ms Memela’s evidence because 
she had indicated that she would use her non-SAAT email 
address for communications after hours and then I asked her 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 146 of 279 
 
is 4:00 pm after hours.  That is why that one stays in my 
memory quite clearly.  And then there is the later on at 8:00 
pm where it is now no longer the JV it is the bid proposal 
which you see attached at 369 and it is asking Ms Sokhulu 
who addresses Ms Memela as Cuz. 
“Here is the latest proposal please let me 
know if it is acceptable.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I was told Cuz in an abbreviation for 
cousin. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  What I have just said might distract you 
from what you were looking for.  I think what you were 
looking for was the communication whether it was about the 
bid or not.  I think Ms Hofmeyr has referred you to page 368 
communication – is it 368 or 36? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  367 is where it starts Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is where it starts. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That is the email, correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And then if you go to 369 that is the bid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KWINANA:    Hm Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So now you have established – we have 
established Ms Kwinana that it was a question about whether 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 147 of 279 
 
the bid proposal was acceptable and do you then accept that 
JV Aviation and AAR should have eliminated? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And then they should not have been 
awarded this tender, correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right.  So you do not anymore.  You began 
yesterday and this morning to say you stand by all of these 
decisions.  I take it that you do not stand by this one 
anymore? 
10 
MS KWINANA:  I do not stand by which one?  The award? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  The one in terms of which they got… 
MS KWINANA:  The award? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes when they had breached the tender 
rules and should have been eliminated. 
MS KWINANA:  When they breached the tender rules yes 
Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That is the one that they finally got on the 
9 May when the board met and gave them the tender for five 
years with AAR and JM Aviation.  It is in that process that 
20 
they should have been eliminated.  Do you accept that? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  So we – and in fairness to you 
given that concession we do not need to spend time on the 
way in which the decision was motivated at the time because 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 148 of 279 
 
this information was not brought to your attention at the 
time, was it? 
MS KWINANA:  No Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Do you regard it as an obligation on Ms 
Memela to have disclosed it to the board that she had 
received this communication while the bid was still open 
from one of the bidders? 
MS KWINANA:  I think Ms Memela of course if she received 
it she would have not even disclosed it to the board but 
eliminate.  So basically it would not even come to the board. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That is true and actually that is an 
important point because earlier you said what would happen 
if 
this 
was 
discovered 
is 
that 
there 
would 
be 
a 
recommendation that came to the board to cancel the tender.  
I want to suggest to you that is by no means what would 
happen.  You do not cancel the tender you just eliminate the 
bidder who has breached the rules and you let the remaining 
bidders stay in the process, do you not? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.  So that is what should have 
20 
happened.  It should not even have been before the board to 
approve AAR and JM Aviation should it? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 And 
it 
was 
Ms 
Memela 
who 
held 
information that she did not disclose to anyone which if she 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 149 of 279 
 
had disclosed it would have eliminated JV of AAR and JM 
Aviation, correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And if for whatever reason she thought that 
AAR should not be eliminated because of the breach of this 
rule at least she should have disclosed to say there has 
been this communication this is what the rule says but I take 
the following view.  She should not have just not eliminated 
them and not have disclosed to some higher authority, is it 
10 
not? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And Ms Kwinana in the process that did 
lead up to the board’s decision on the 9 May 2016 you 
received submissions from the then acting CEO of SAAT Mr 
Malola Phiri, correct? 
MS KWINANA:  In respect of the tenderers? 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
Yes. 
 
Because 
he 
made 
the 
recommendation 
to 
the 
board. 
 
Remember 
they 
were 
20 
recommending Air France and at the board meeting on the 9 
May you and your fellow board members decided not to go 
with management’s recommendation and you went for the 
joint venture of JM Aviation and AAR, do you recall that? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 150 of 279 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And all I am clarifying is the person who 
makes that submission to you was the then acting CEO Mr 
Malola Phiri, correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Now I want to just move to 
your communications at this time.  Because during this time 
you were having a number of telephone conversations with 
the Mr Ndzeku were you not? 
MS KWINANA:  I would not – I would not know until you 
show me and that is very possible. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  It is possible.  So while a tender is open in 
respect of which JM Aviation and AAR are joint bidders you 
were having communications with the director of JM Aviation, 
is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Are you not concerned that that would not 
be appropriate in the circumstances? 
MS KWINANA:  Chair I really would not be concerned.  The 
reason being that as I told you about the processes and as I 
told you about the fact that basically the only time that we 
20 
know is when the documentation is in front of us.  And I also 
told you that there are many tenders at SAA Technical 
including SAA and I do not have a record where I would say 
the tender is starting now and then the tender is ending 
there.  So with me not being involved in the tender process I 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 151 of 279 
 
would communicate freely with Mr Ndzeku without knowing 
that there is a tender that is going on or without registering 
that there is a tender going on.   
ADV HOFMEYR:  Well remember I asked you about Mr 
Phiri’s submissions to the board.  In your own affidavit you 
explain that there were some earlier submissions where 
Lufthansa was first and then you asked them to go back and 
then there were later submissions and then what came was 
Air France.  Do  you recall saying that in your affidavit? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes and in fact I was state – I also stated 
10 
the reason why they were taken back. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Correct. 
MS KWINANA:  Is because there was a disagreement 
between management in front of the board where the – the 
CFO was in disagreement in terms of I think the bid – the 
process basically.  And then I said you cannot fight in front 
of us.  Go back and make sure that you come with the same 
voice.  So basically they did go back and came with the 
same voice and the process continued. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes but that means you knew when you 
20 
were speaking to Mr Ndzeku that he was a bidder in this 
open tender because you had already had that interaction 
where you had asked him to go back where they were 
privileging Lufthansa over AAR and Air France.  They came 
back to you again.  In all of that time you knew full well Ms 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 152 of 279 
 
Kwinana that JM Aviation was a bidder. 
MS KWINANA:  The date when we told them to go back and 
when they came back I do not think there was much 
difference that is point number 1.  Point number 2 Mr Ndzeku 
is not operational and I do not even think that he had even 
an input into this.   
Hence I said yesterday basically in fact I made a 
practical example where I – like if a person goes to the 
shopping centre and then you come across a person maybe 
you would even know that there is a tender here and maybe 
10 
the person does not know that there is a tender there.   
So basically my interaction with Mr Ndzeku was not 
in any way about the tender that was – that was happening 
there. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That is a different answer to the one you 
gave earlier.  The earlier answer was it was okay for you to 
communicate with Mr Ndzeku because at the time you were 
communicating with him you did not know JM Aviation was a 
bidder.  I am now showing you how that cannot factually be 
so.  So your answer is now as I understand it that is okay for 
20 
you to have been communicating with him because you were 
not talking about the bid, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:  That is also what I said yesterday Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No I am saying how it differs from the 
evidence you have just given now.  I am not suggesting you 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 153 of 279 
 
did not say that yesterday.  What I would then like to 
understand is how do you know he was not operational at JM 
Aviation?  I thought you were not talking to him about 
anything specific to JM Aviation? 
MS KWINANA: Of course. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Of course so how do you know he was not 
operational? 
MS KWINANA:  That is exactly the reason because if he was 
operational at JM he would basically talk about JM.  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Ms Kwinana. 
10 
MS KWINANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Kwinana. 
MS KWINANA:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you sure that is the – that is the 
answer you are giving? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KWINANA:  And in fact – in fact that is the answer I can 
give you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The reason why you know that he was not 
20 
operational is because he was not talking to you about 
operational matters? 
MS KWINANA:  Of course.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Kwinana you even 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 154 of 279 
 
spoke to Mr Ndzeku the day before the board took the 
decision, do you remember that? 
MS KWINANA:  No Chair I do not remember. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You spoke to him at twelve minutes past 
seven in the evening.  You do not have a memory of that? 
MS KWINANA:  No Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No.  Okay.  Do you want me to take you to 
the cell phone records that show that or will you accept that 
that took place? 
MS KWINANA:  I will accept it Chair. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Right then I would like to 
move to – well in fairness to you do you accept that it would 
be high – it was highly irregular for you the chairperson of 
the board of SAA Technical to have numerous conversations 
with the director of a bidder while the bid was open in 
advance of you taking the decision to award it to him and his 
joint venture partner. 
MS KWINANA:  Chair I do not take it as irregular.  We were 
not talking about the bid and it fact also my talking about the 
bid would end in the board room.  And I do not think Mr 
20 
Ndzeku would talk about the bid anyway.  And as I told you 
that we were talking about the whole lot of things and 
therefore you cannot assume that when we are talking at ten 
past seven in the morning or whatever time we are talking 
about the bid. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 155 of 279 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  We have only your word for that do we not 
Ms Kwinana? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  What about that rule that we talked about 
earlier on would it not have applied to you? 
MS KWINANA:  Chair we are not – we were not talking about 
the RSB yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes so in your view how would the 
rule be policed by the company if people who are going to be 
10 
making decisions could have telephone conversations with 
whichever bidder they wanted to talk to even the day before 
the decision is taken.  How would the company police this to 
make sure that there is that people within the company 
whether board members or managers to make sure that they 
do not discuss matters relating to bids with bidders.  How 
would they police it?  Who is there to police – police you and 
Mr Ndzeku when the day before the – you decide the bid you 
are having a telephone conversation in the evening. 
MS KWINANA:  Chair I said earlier – yesterday Mr Ndzeku is 
20 
involved in many other businesses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that does not tell me how … 
MS KWINANA:  And in fact… 
CHAIRPERSON:  How the company would police this.  Then 
my question is if the position was that as a decision maker if 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 156 of 279 
 
you are going to make a decision tomorrow on a bid the 
evening before you could phone one of the bidders and have 
an hour long conversation with them, it is fine as long as you 
do not talk about the bid.  How will the company know that 
during that hour long conversation you did not talk about the 
bid? 
MS KWINANA:  Maybe how the company would know would 
tape the conversation for instance and bring it to the 
attention of the relevant authorities.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if you – if you do not phone it – if you 
10 
do not talk on the phone but you phone each other to make 
an appointment and meet at a restaurant and enjoy wine and 
dinner for two hours and then talk about the bid how will the 
company know you – you talked about the bid?  You do that 
the day before you make a decision on the bid and this 
person comes from a company that has put in a bid for this.  
How will the company enforce this? 
MS KWINANA:  Chair.  I would not know about the controls 
surrounding that.  But it also would depend on the integrity 
of the people involved. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it would just depend on the people.  
Once you say depends on the integrity of the people it also 
means it depends on the lack of integrity on those you do not 
have integrity. 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair … 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 157 of 279 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And therefore the rule cannot be enforced 
because everyone – I mean if you did talk about it or any 
official or board member who talked about the bid with a 
bidder would not admit that they talked about it because they 
would know that then they would have acted in breach of the 
– of the rule and that bidder would be eliminated.  So they 
would not admit it.   
So in the end the rule would not be enforceable 
which is why you might have a situation where the company 
says they must just be an absolute prohibition.  No 
10 
communication whatsoever.  Because if we are going to say 
you may have communication but do not talk about the bid 
we will never be able to enforce that rule.   
So the best thing is to say no communication 
whatsoever between somebody who has decision making 
powers on a particular tender and anyone of the bidders 
while the bid – the tender is open.  You understand that? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Then I would just like to deal with the 
20 
signing of the agreement.  The agreement between SAA on 
the one hand and AAR and JM Aviation on the other.  Were 
you involved in that signing? 
MS KWINANA:  No Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You were not?  You do not remember a 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 158 of 279 
 
meeting at which you asked for the couriered copy of the 
agreement to go and be fetched? 
MS KWINANA:  The only thing Chair I remember regarding 
the contract – or maybe say regarding the agreement is that 
I went to SAAT after I received a letter from the chairperson 
of SAA and also received a letter from National Treasury 
saying they want – oh and then also I think the newspapers 
we also had to respond to the newspapers about this tender.  
And then I went to SAA and then SAA Technical and then I 
said that was the acting CFO – I said … 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Who was that sorry? 
MS KWINANA:  Arson Malola Phiri. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  He was the acting CEO. 
MS KWINANA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Sorry you said CFO so I just wanted to 
check. You were speaking to Mr Malolo Phiri is that right? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Acting CEO continue please. 
MS KWINANA:  Yes.  And then I said to them I received this 
letter which we needed to respond to.  Can they please make 
20 
sure that all the files, everything is taken to National 
Treasury because also the chairperson of the board was 
saying I think she received the letter from National Treasury 
and therefore the files were required at National Treasury. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So that is the only meeting you recall is 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 159 of 279 
 
that right?  You do not recall being involved in a meeting 
when the signing of the contract took place? 
MS KWINANA:  Definitely not. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Definitely not. 
MS KWINANA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You – Ms Kwinana you always say it with 
such conviction so I just want to check again.  You have no 
recollection of being in that meeting when it was signed? 
MS KWINANA:  No Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No.  So if Ms Malola Phiri had given an 
10 
affidavit to this commission in which he had set out in detail 
your presence at that meeting and what you said in it and 
your role in it would you say he is made that up? 
MS KWINANA:  Let me see what he is saying Chair? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Certainly.  You will find that in DD25[c].  
So that is also Ms Memela’s bundle and it is Exhibit DD25[c] 
and we will go to page DD25[c] at page 790.   
MS KWINANA:  Page 791? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Well the one I want to start at is 790 but I 
do just want to orientate you. So this is an affidavit that Mr 
20 
Arson Malola Phiri provided to the state capture commission.  
It commences in DD25[c] at page 773 but we are going to 
pick it up at page 790.   Chair I just want to ensure that Ms 
Mbanjwa has the file and its… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no that it is fine. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 160 of 279 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Comfortable.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Ms Mbanjwa we are at page 790 within Mr 
Phiri’s affidavit and I would like to start at the bottom at 
paragraph 105.  Right so what Mr Phiri says in this 
paragraph and some of the following ones.  I am just going 
to highlight a few features.  He says:  Well let us start at 
104. 
“I 
cannot 
recall 
who 
brought 
me 
the 
execution version of the contract for my 
10 
signature but I vaguely remember that the 
chairperson 
had 
called 
an 
impromptu 
unscheduled meeting at the SAAT board 
room which included Ms Memela.  I cannot 
recall further details.  However as far as I 
can recall Ms Kwinana expressed with a firm 
voice that she would not leave the board 
room until the AAR contract was signed.  Mr 
Memela then indicated that the contract was 
at the time in the process of being sent to 
20 
her by courier for SAAT’s signature.  It was 
at this point that Ms Memela gave an 
instruction to Ms – Ms Kwinana gave an 
instruction to Ms Memela to get the airway 
bill AWB number from AAR to track the parcel 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 161 of 279 
 
– the contract.  Ms Memela then obtained the 
AWB number and subsequently traced the 
parcel to a warehouse in Johannesburg.” 
Can I just stop there.  Is this helping with your memory?  Do 
you recall this interaction? 
MS KWINANA:  No Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  
“Ms Kwinana’s driver was then requested to 
collect the parcel/contract whilst we were all 
waiting in the board room for the driver to 
10 
arrive. 
Ms 
Kwinana 
requested 
that 
we 
respond comprehensively to the complaints 
raised staff and labour unions against SAAT 
management. 
 
The 
complaints 
were 
addressed 
directly 
to 
the 
SAA 
board 
chairperson 
Ms 
Dudu 
Myeni 
for 
her 
intervention.” 
That is the part that you have just told us you do remember 
is that right? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair but it was not the complaint raised 
20 
by staff and labour unions.  I cannot remember well but the – 
the letter was coming from SAA Chairperson. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS KWINANA:  And from National Treasury. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right, right.  So that part you remember 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 162 of 279 
 
but you have no recollection of saying we are not leaving 
this room in a firm voice until this contract is signed.  
Getting Ms Memela to go and track it.  Getting drivers to go 
and pick it up.  You have no memory of that? 
MS KWINANA:  My understanding Chair was that the 
contract was already signed when I went there.  And hence I 
was saying make sure that the files that the National 
Treasury wants are in place and then we take them together 
with the contract. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You see Mr Malola Phiri’s version is that 
10 
you played a much more active role in that meeting.  If you 
go to paragraph 108 this is when the driver comes back with 
the contract or the parcel.   
“The contract delivered was already signed by AAR’s 
President.  Ms Kwinana then requested that I sign the 
contract as it was signed by the President of AAR so it 
would be in alignment with the contract – that the 
contract be signed by the acting CEO on the SAAT side.  
At this point I requested Ms Memela to go through the 
contract and sign it, given that she was leading the team 
20 
that negotiated the contract.  Ms Kwinana also went to 
the contract and was happy for me to sign.   
It was on Ms Memela’s and Ms Kwinana’s go-ahead that 
I signed the contract.” 
And then he attaches a copy of the signed contract to his 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 163 of 279 
 
affidavit.  And then, if we just go on to 110.   
“As far as I recall, Ms Kwinana wanted the contract 
signed as a matter of urgency in order to ensure the 
SAAT could access costs saving within a matter of 
weeks. 
However, her behaviour at the meeting was, she says, 
over the top, bordering on being aggressive.” 
Do 
you 
deny 
his 
account 
of 
this 
meeting 
and 
your 
involvement in assisting that the contract be signed? 
MS KWINANA:   I would not insist that the contract be 
10 
signed because according to my recollection, when I got 
there to say we need to respond to this and we need to take 
the files to National Treasury because they want to audit 
them, then the contract was already signed.   
 
Of course, maybe I may have been aggressive in the 
sense that when the National Treasury wants something, 
National Treasury, basically, is our finance department and 
therefore, there is no way that when they say, we want this 
information, I can take it lightly.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But why were you even getting involved in 
20 
those things Ms Kwinana?  That is for management. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.  That is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Why would you ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   That is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   There was a CEO or acting CEO or SAA 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 164 of 279 
 
Technical.  Why were you getting involved in which contract 
is being couriered from where? 
MS KWINANA:   No ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
The 
driver 
must 
go 
and 
fetch 
it 
...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair I was not involved in that.  The 
reason why I went to SAAT is because I received a letter 
from the chairperson of the SAA addressed to me and 
received a letter from Mr Tjitamano(?) of National Treasury, 
saying that they want to audit, basically, the process.   
10 
 
And therefore, I had to SAAT and instruct management 
that this is what is required.  Of course, I would not – I do 
not even know where the contract is filed.  I am not involved, 
as I said before.   
 
But I would have to give direction and make sure that all 
the information that National Treasury wants is submitted to 
National Treasury.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair.  Ms Kwinana, I do want 
to pick up on a point that the Chair has just highlighted with 
20 
you and that is this question of the degree of your 
involvement in matters going on at SAAT and at SAA, quite 
frankly, in relation to procurement.   
 
Because you have previously given evidence, both 
yesterday and you confirmed it today again.  And I was really 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 165 of 279 
 
quite specific to be clear that I understood your evidence.   
 
You 
confirmed 
that 
other 
than 
that 
10 
February 
encounter in 2016 with Swissport, you did not have any other 
meetings.  You did not involve yourself in that contract 
process.  That was to be left for management.  Correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  You see, I was reminded by my 
faithful team that there is an email suggesting something to 
the contrary.  So we took efforts to have it copied over the 
lunch break.  I would like to ask an opportunity to hand it up.  
10 
I am well-aware that Ms Mbanjwa and Ms Kwinana may not 
have seen it recently.  So they must please take the time 
they wish to consider it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   And Chair, if we could enter it as Exhibit 
33.23?   
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that Exhibit BB...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   DB33. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Point? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Twenty-three. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Twenty-three.  Is this a few emails or one 
email? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It is actually just two emails. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It is an email – you will see at the bottom 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 166 of 279 
 
of the first page from Ms Kwinana to Mr Peter and then it is 
Mr Peter’s response.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  The document containing an email 
from Ms Yakhe Kwinana dated 20 January 2016 to Mr Lester 
Peter, as well as an email from Mr Lester Peter to 
Ms Yakhe Kwinana which consists of three pages is admitted 
and it will be marked as Exhibit BB(?)33.23. 
DOCUMENTS OF EMAIL BETWEEN MS YAKHE KWINANA 
AND MR LESTER PETER IS ADMITTED AND MARKED AS 
EXHIBIT BD33.23 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So Ms Kwinana, it starts at the bottom of 
the page with an email that you sent to Mr Peter on, as I 
have it there, the 20t h of January 2016 at 19:37 in the 
evening.  Have you had a chance to consider it? 
MS KWINANA:   Let me read it Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes-no, that is fine.   
MS KWINANA:   Ai, Chair I just do not remember this. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   H’m.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   What is appears to be Ms Kwinana is an 
email 
that 
you 
sent 
to 
Mr 
Lester 
Peter 
on 
the 
20t h of January 2016 
and 
the 
subject 
is, 
meeting 
with 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 167 of 279 
 
Swissport.   
 
And you address it:  Dear A: CPO.  Which I take to be 
Acting Chief Procurement Officer.  But remember, he has 
now replaced Dr Dahwa.  And you say: 
“Yesterday 
I 
had 
a 
meeting 
with 
one 
of 
the 
shareholders 
of 
Swissport, 
Mr 
Vuyo 
Ndzeku, 
Mr Peter Cole (CEO/CFO of Swissport), Mr Daluxolo 
Peter, a BEE partner of Swissport. 
The purpose of the meeting was that the BEE 
partner was concerned about the status of the 
10 
contract.”   
 
And 
then 
you 
go 
over 
and 
you 
summarised 
the 
resolutions of those discussion that you had and you say: 
“I promise that I would get back to them after 
consulting as to what happened and if what they are 
suggesting is possible or not.” 
 
So you have no recollection of this, do you? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Apology Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think it might be convenient if you just 
20 
read that first page. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Read the whole ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, for the benefit of those who are 
listening. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Of course. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 168 of 279 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I do occasionally forget about them, with 
respect. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  [laughing] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Alright.  So what happened is.  You talk 
about the meeting.  You say that the BEE partner was 
concerned about the status of the contract and then you go 
on and you say: 
10 
“This is the summary or resolutions of yesterday’s 
discussions.   
1. 
Swissport wants the current contract, which 
includes ground power unit, crew transportation and 
ground handling.  The first two items are not part of 
the approved tender that needs to be signed. 
2. 
Peter said in the event that the first two items 
cannot be added, they will pull out but there will be 
no business motivation to continue with ground 
handling only.  They will pull out of this contact.   
20 
I promised that I will get back to them after 
consulting as to what happened and if what they 
are suggesting is possible or not.  Thank you.  
Yakhe Kwinana.” 
 
Do you not have any memory of this email? 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 169 of 279 
 
MS KWINANA:   Not at all Chair.  And the other thing that is 
strange here is that...  Okay I do not know what email is 
Yakhe Kwinana to. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It is the one you often get emailed on at...  
I can show you lots of...  There is a yakhekwinana2 and a 
Yakhe.  I will find one of the emails. 
MS KWINANA:   Oh, that is the SAA email. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Let me find it for you.  Well...  No, hang 
on.  I think...  No, I think it is your personal one because if 
you go up to the response from Mr Peter to you, you will see 
10 
yakhekwinana2, it seems to be yakhe@kwinana.co.za.   
 
I have certainly seen that before, I can tell you, in some 
of the emails that you were sent.  I think you were often sent 
emails.   
 
That is your Fly SAA one and at your yakhekwinana one 
which comes up as yakhekwinana2.  I can try and look for 
some of that if that would help you?  But does that resolve it 
for you? 
MS KWINANA:   I still do not remember this Chair.  And 
secondly, I do not know why the footer would be SAA.   
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, let me explain why.  Because, you 
see, it is Mr Lester Peter’s email at the top which is 
flysaa.com.  So it takes his footer because it is actually his 
email in which he responds to you that contains your email, 
right?   
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 170 of 279 
 
 
So it is his flysaa.com email that contains the footer.  It 
is your yakhekwinana email in the middle.  But we now, as I 
understand how these things come up because we have seen 
many of them in our two years.  But that is aside.  Are you 
suggesting this is fabricated? 
MS KWINANA:   I think so Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You think it is fabricated? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana, you may be well-advised to 
just reflect before you can say it is fabricated.  To make sure 
that you do not say it is fabricated unless you ...[intervenes]  
10 
MS KWINANA:   I am saying Chair.  I think it is fabricated. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You think it is fabricated? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Okay Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Oh, thank you.  Am I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you have an idea who may have 
fabricated it, Ms Kwinana? 
MS KWINANA:   No, I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not know.  Okay alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Because if it is not fabricated, then it is 
20 
inconsistent with quite a bit of evidence you have given at 
this Commission, is it not? 
MS KWINANA:   If it is not fabricated, it is inconsistent.  
What does that mean? 
CHAIRPERSON:   If it is authentic that you did send such an 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 171 of 279 
 
email.  That is what she means.  If you ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   If I did send such an email? 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you did send such an email, she says it 
would mean that it is not – it is inconsistent with a lot of 
evidence you have given.  That is what she is saying to you.  
If you did send it. 
MS KWINANA:   Oh, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you accept that? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you accept that? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  And I would just like to highlight 
what those are.  First of all, you indicated to us yesterday 
that Mr Daluxolo Peter, to your understanding, was part of 
Swissport.   
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   This makes it clear, he was not part of 
Swissport.  He was the BEE partner who was going to join 
Swissport in relation to the Swissport agreement on its 
terms.  That is what it says, correct? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   My understanding of Mr Daluxolo Peter’s 
involvement and in fact, the way he was introduced to us, I 
was thinking that he was part of Swissport.  How he would 
be part of Swissport, basically, I would not interrogate them 
as to how are they – how is he related to Swissport but they 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 172 of 279 
 
had always been together. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, but your own email draws a distinction 
between Swissport representatives and Mr Peter.  Your own 
emails says:  The shareholder of Swissport was Mr Vuyo 
Ndzeku.  The CEO/CFO of Swissport was Mr Peter Cole.  
And Mr Daluxolo Peter was there as the BEE partner of 
Swissport.  So that is separate on your own description of 
them, if this is an authentic email.  Do you accept that? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, if this is an authentic email. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  So that is why your testimony 
10 
yesterday would have been false.  The second respect in 
which your testimony yesterday and repeated again this 
morning would have been false is. 
 
Because you repeatedly said you had no other meetings 
with Swissport in relation to this contract baring the 
encounter on the 10t h of February.  Again, if this is authentic, 
that means that evidence was false, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  And it also shows a level of 
involvement in finalising this contract that you previous 
20 
accepted should not be a level of involvement from a 
member of the Board of SAA, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Finalising which contract?  Are you talking 
about ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   The Swissport contract. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 173 of 279 
 
MS KWINANA:   The Swissport contract? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   H’m.  In respect of which Jammicron, 
which is the entity that Mr Daluxolo Peter was representing, 
was going to be the BEE partner. 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, I am not aware of the contract.  As I 
said, I do not get involved in signing the contracts.  We did 
talk about the Tripartite Contract which basically I was not 
party to.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   H’m. 
MS KWINANA:   We did talk about the Swissport contract 
10 
which basically does not have anything to do with me. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, but this email says you are involved 
in the contract because if this email is authentic, you had a 
meeting with the BEE partner of Swissport, Swissport 
representatives at which the BEE partner was – and I am 
quoting “concerned about the status of the contract”.  So 
here, you are getting involved in the contract.  Do you 
accept that if this is authentic? 
MS KWINANA:   If this is authentic. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You accept that? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Right.  I would then like to 
know Ms Kwinana.  Oh, no sorry.  Before we move on.  I do 
want to put to you in fairness for your opportunity to 
respond.  What we would likely submit, in due course, is the 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 174 of 279 
 
overwhelming impression created by your evidence thus far.  
The first is that AAR and JM Aviation were unfairly favoured 
in the tender processes that your board at SAA Technical 
decided.  Do you accept that that is so? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you accept that they had access to you 
and to Ms Mamela when no other bidder had that access? 
MS KWINANA:   No. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You do not?  And why not? 
MS KWINANA:   As I said, we went to AAR, Chicago and 
10 
also other bidders had been visited by the ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Apologies.  I take that point.  I should 
have been more precise.   
CHAIRPERSON:   She is talking about the bidders in this 
tender. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MS KWINANA:   In which tender? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   The last tender that was awarded to AAR 
and JM Aviation.  In that process, from December of 2015 to 
your decision on the 9t h of May 2016.  JM Aviation and AAR 
20 
had access to you and Ms Mamela when no other bidder did. 
MS KWINANA:   JM Aviation because of this...  I mean 
...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   JM Aviation ...[intervenes]  
[Parties intervening each other and cannot be heard clearly.] 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 175 of 279 
 
MS KWINANA:   ...you are talking about Swissport now. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, we are on AAR and JM Aviation. 
MS KWINANA:   You are now...  So we are no longer talking 
about this? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.   
MS KWINANA:   Oh, okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Remember, I said we went to that. 
MS KWINANA:   H’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Because of something that you have said 
in the evidence and I was reminded about the email.  In 
10 
fairness to you Ms Kwinana, let us put that aside. 
MS KWINANA:   Okay.  So we are going back to AAR now? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   We are focussing on AAR and JM Aviation. 
MS KWINANA:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.   
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I said to you.  Do you accept – because 
we will likely submit in due course – that AAR and JM 
Aviation had access to you and to Ms Mamela when that final 
tender was open in circumstances where no other bidder had 
20 
that access to either of you? 
MS KWINANA:   I said Chair...  Sorry, Mr Ndzeku and I 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, just start afresh.  I did not hear 
everything. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 176 of 279 
 
MS KWINANA:   I said Chair.  Mr Ndzeku and I had 
numerous things that we were talking about and I said 
Mr Ndzeku was not involved in operations.  And I said 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, hang on.  Remember, the question is 
simply that, he had access to you that no other bidders who 
were bidding for that tender had with you. 
MS KWINANA:   This policy Chair that we did read was 
saying communication in respect of this RFP. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, please do not...  For now, do not think 
10 
about the rule because the question did not make any 
reference to the rule.  The proposition is simply this or the 
question is.  Do you accept that JM Aviation and Swissport 
had access to you ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Sorry, and AAR Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I am sorry.  And AAR.  I am going to 
confuse...  And AAR had access to you and Ms Mamela that 
no other bidder in that tender during that time had with you 
and Ms Mamela. 
MS KWINANA:   I do not ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Factually.  Factually. 
MS KWINANA:   I do not agree Chair in respect of me.  The 
reason being that, as I said before, Mr Ndzeku and I, we 
have got many companies outside SAA and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Because 
she 
does 
not talk 
about 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 177 of 279 
 
companies.  It simply says, do you agree, do you accept that 
during that time, JM Aviation and AAR had access to you that 
no other bidder who had put in a bid in regard to that tender 
had with you, factually? 
MS KWINANA:   I do not agree Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They did not have access to you 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They did not speak to you? 
MS KWINANA:   Mr Ndzeku spoke to me, not in his capacity 
as JM Aviation. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KWINANA:   And as I was saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So, in whatever capacity, he did 
speak to you?  Is that right? 
MS KWINANA:   Maybe Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Whatever the capacity was. 
MS KWINANA:   Maybe Chair...  Maybe Chair, you...  Maybe 
you may ask and say beyond Ndzeku(?) instead of saying JM 
Aviation.  Because in my interaction with Mr Ndzeku 
...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MS KWINANA:   It was definitely was not in regards 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Okay so your problem with 
regard to the access that happened between yourself and 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 178 of 279 
 
Mr Ndzeku is where we say JM Aviation?  But if we say 
Mr Ndzeku had access to you, factually that you accept? 
MS KWINANA:   I accept. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And that AAR wined and dined you and 
other members of the board and management while the 
tender was still open.  Do you accept that? 
MS KWINANA:   I think we are going back Chair to what we 
discussed before. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   We are.  And in fairness to you, I have to 
10 
put to you what we are likely to make submissions in due 
course.  It is going ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   You know Chair.  This dining and wining and 
the effect on tender.  I really do not see any significance in 
respect of that.  And in fact, as I said, this has been the 
tendency for the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Ms Kwinana ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   ...or the practise. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana, we discussed that earlier on.  
At this stage, it would help if you simply answer the question 
20 
whether factually that is so, namely, did AAR wine you and 
dine you while the tender was open?  Is that factually true? 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, I do not like the term of being wined 
and dined as if ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Just use another one.  
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 179 of 279 
 
[laughing]  What terms would we use?  [laughing] 
MS KWINANA:   I mean, it seems as if we...  I am a hungry 
person and I am happy that I am being dined all day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]   
MS KWINANA:   All alone. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  How would you put it in terms of 
what happened? 
MS KWINANA:   Maybe if you can say Chair, we visited AAR. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KWINANA:   That would be better. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Now, I would like to ask 
whether...  You accepted moments ago that they were 
unfairly favoured in this process.  And I want to know 
whether you received any benefit from either of them as a 
consequence of that unfair favouring? 
MS KWINANA:   No, I did not receive any benefit.  And in 
fact, you said we were driven in, as you were saying, in 
private jet.  And I do not consider that as a benefit. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  Would you consider receipt of 
20 
money as a benefit? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   H’m. 
MS KWINANA:   Depending what the purpose of the money.  
If, for instance, the money is given to me for me to spoil 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 180 of 279 
 
myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MS KWINANA:   Then that would be fine, I would take it as a 
benefit. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   When would it not be a benefit? 
MS KWINANA:   But remember that the amount that Zano 
Spark received were not for my benefit.  The amounts that 
Zano Spark received are still for the benefit of Mr Ndzeku 
and his wife who did not know that he... she... he...  she was 
the wife at the time.  But be that as it may.  It would not 
10 
make any difference.  But the monies that Zano Spark 
received are for the forex trading. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.   
MS KWINANA:   So they are not for my benefit.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay let us move to the forex trading and 
Zano Spark then.  Tell me a little bit about Zano Spark.  
When was it established? 
MS KWINANA:   It was established in 2016. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   What month? 
MS KWINANA:   Together with three other companies that 
20 
are established in 2016. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  What month?  Do you recall? 
MS KWINANA:   Maybe February.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   It was February, according to the records. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 181 of 279 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So you established it and you started with 
your daughter, Ms Goniwe.  Is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   You were the two directors when it was 
established in February 2016.  Is that right? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   I understand she is no longer a director.  
You are now the sole director.  Is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Why have Zano Spark not responded to 
10 
the summons that it received from this Commission many 
weeks ago? 
MS KWINANA:   We responded to the summons. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, when you respond to a summons, you 
either have to produce the documents or you have to provide 
an affidavit, explaining why the documents cannot be 
produced.  Why have you done neither of those two things? 
MS KWINANA:   We do not have the documents Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You would have been – and you have been 
told many times, you needed to say that on affidavit.  Is that 
20 
now your evidence? 
MS KWINANA:   I said that on the email Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, you did not.  I can take you to it in a 
moment.  But is your evidence now, you confirm under oath, 
none of the documents that was summonsed, do you have? 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 182 of 279 
 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  We can move on then.  What was 
Zano Spark going to be doing?  You have mentioned forex 
trading. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Was that it? 
MS KWINANA:   And other investments. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And other investments. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But predominantly forex trading, correct? 
10 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Because that is what Mr Ndzeku said your 
daughter conveyed to him when she approached him about 
investing in forex trading, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  Were you aware that she was 
contacting him to do that? 
MS KWINANA:   Who was contacting? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Your daughter, Ms Goniwe was contacting 
Mr Ndzeku about investing in forex trading. 
20 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, she told me. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   She told you? 
MS KWINANA:   H’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So that would have been 2016, sometime 
after February 2016, correct? 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 183 of 279 
 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair.  Before that.  That was before 
that.  They met – she said they met before that.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Before that? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But the company was only established in 
February 2016, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It was established at the time that the bid 
is open for the Components Tender because February 2016 
is still before you decided in May 2016, correct? 
10 
MS KWINANA:   Zano Spark has got nothing to do with 
Components Tender. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   We will see if that is so in a while Ms 
Kwinana. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But your evidence is that Zano Spark was 
established to do forex trading predominantly and some 
other investments.  Is that right? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   What other investments? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   Any investment basically.  Sometimes 
property.  Sometimes venture capital. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.   
MS KWINANA:   H’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And that are investments for third parties.  
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 184 of 279 
 
Is that right?  Not yourselves? 
MS KWINANA:   What not for ourselves? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   For yourselves but also for third parties.  
Is that right? 
MS KWINANA:   Third parties.  Not members of the public.  
But the people like the – the people that we know. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   The people that you know like Mr Ndzeku? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay.  With whom you have no personal 
relationship, correct? 
10 
MS KWINANA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you said previously you did not know 
Ms Hendricks was his wife.  Is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   When did you first learn that she was? 
MS KWINANA:   When Mr Ndzeku was testifying here.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   I want to spend a bit of time on forex 
trading because I have to confess, I find it a little bit 
confusing.  What does it mean to go long on a currency pair? 
MS KWINANA:   That means you are buying stuff. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   What? 
MS KWINANA:   You are buying the pair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Which pair? 
MS KWINANA:   Whatever.  There are many forex currency 
pairs.  There is US, DJPY, US ...[indistinct] and there is 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 185 of 279 
 
Nasdaq and the whole lot of other pairs.  In fact, I think 
there are more than 400 pairs that you can trade. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But when you go long on a pair, what do 
you are doing in respect of each part of the pair?  Do you 
know? 
MS KWINANA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Because a pair is two currencies. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So how do you go long on a pair? 
MS KWINANA:   When you say you are going long on 
US/DJPY that means you are buying U/?DJPY  When you are 
going short, that means you are selling US/DJPY. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  And that is the sort of work that 
Zano Spark does, is that right? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, through me. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Through you? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  Where do you do that trading? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   On my computer. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   On your...  But you need a platform for 
that.  What platforms do you use? 
MS KWINANA:   IC Markets. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I beg your pardon? 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 186 of 279 
 
MS KWINANA:   IC Markets. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   IC Markets - so let me just get it right.  
You would receive money in Zano Spark, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then you would go onto this IC 
Market’s platform and then you yourself, Ms Kwinana, then 
trades on the forex currency pairs, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, thank you.  And what is the bid 
price? 
10 
MS KWINANA:   It depends, it fluctuates all the time.  It 
depends. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I am drawing the distinction between bid 
and ask price.  What is the difference between a bid price 
and an ask price? 
MS KWINANA:   It is like the buy and the sell. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  And tell me, when Zano 
Spark started operating how big was its client base? 
MS KWINANA:   Much as that we registered Zano Spark in 
2016 I started to trade in 2014. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, but I am asking about Zano Spark’s 
client base.  How big was it? 
MS KWINANA:   How big was it when? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   When it started in February 2016. 
MS KWINANA:   Of course when we started in 2016 the 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 187 of 279 
 
clients that we had I think it was about maybe eight clients. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Eight clients in 2016? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And so they would invest monies, 
correct?  And then you would go onto this platform and 
trade for them, is that right? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So you were receiving money from third 
parties and you were trading on a platform for that 
purpose, is that right? 
10 
MS 
KWINANA: 
 
 
I 
also 
do 
not 
like 
this 
term 
of 
…[intervenes] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Sorry, I do not mean the public 
generally. 
MS KWINANA:   Because I do not go out and market and 
put it on advert. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You take the money of a select few. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you traded for them, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Are you aware that you need a licence to 
do that? 
MS KWINANA:   No, I do not need a licence. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 188 of 279 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You do not?  Why do you not need a 
licence? 
MS KWINANA:   It is because according to FSCA there are 
specific companies which are mentioned there that require 
a licence.  For example, I may not mention all of them but 
obviously the bank requires the licence, the insurance 
companies and insurance brokers and FSCA has stated 
those and Zano Spark is not one of them. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, they have certainly stated that Zano 
Spark does not have any licence but is it not a financial 
10 
service …[intervenes] 
MS KWINANA:   Yes because we do not need a licence. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, they do not say because it does not 
need a licence, they say it does not have one and then 
they tell us in the affidavit that you have seen and we can 
now go to, which is in your bundle DD33 at page 323.   
MS KWINANA:   323? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  Do you have that? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   This is an affidavit you have seen 
20 
before, have you, Ms Kwinana? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you have considered it. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So what this is, is an affidavit provided 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 189 of 279 
 
by Felicity Mpho Mbaso of the FSCA, the Financial 
Services Conduct Authority in which, first of all, the 
authority was asked to confirm whether there is any licence 
that has been issued either to Zano Spark, to Ms Goniwe 
or to yourself and they confirm that there is no licence.  
You confirm that too, do you not? 
MS KWINANA:   I confirm that there is no licence and I do 
not need a licence to do forex trading, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   They go on and they explain at page 324 
the purpose of the affidavit and that is to deal with the 
10 
various ways in which licensing is required that might 
involve forex trading, right?  So at 4.1 they say they are 
going to explain the person to enter into financial services 
– to render financial services to clients in a foreign 
currency denominated investment instrument including a 
foreign currency deposit and in securities and instruments 
including 
derivative 
instruments 
are 
required 
to 
be 
authorised under the Financial Advisory and Intermediary 
Services Act.  We will call that the FAIS for short.  They 
also said that they are going to deal with the requirements 
20 
for approval by the conduct authority of a clearing firm for 
foreign forex service provider and the requirements to be 
authorised as an over the counter derivative provider which 
is – summarises ODP. 
 
And then in quite a complex affidavit they tell us the 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 190 of 279 
 
licensing regime for each of those.  Is it your evidence that 
you are none of those? 
MS KWINANA:   I am none of those. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, so you take money from clients, 
correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You invest them in forex trading. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And your evidence is you do not need a 
licence to do that. 
10 
MS KWINANA:   Not at all. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Why not? 
MS KWINANA:   It is because forex trading, Chair, does 
not fall under the FSCA Act.  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Where does it fall under? 
MS KWINANA:   And as I said before, I said this 
terminology of the third parties, I do not like it because I 
do not at the time, I say to the people close to me, I say to 
them or my colleagues or my business partners, I say to 
them this is what I do and then if they want, they say 
20 
please invest for us.  So basically I do not need a licence. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So if I understand your evidence, 
provided you do not advertise that you are going to be 
doing it you do not require a licence, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   I do not and solicit money from the 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 191 of 279 
 
people.  If people come to me because they know that I do 
forex trading and they say I have got this money can you 
do trading for me? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   How did they know that you do this 
trading? 
MS KWINANA:   You also now know, Chair, that I am doing 
forex trading, for instance.  You can …[intervenes] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did you have conversations with them, is 
that right? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, exactly. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Like Mr Ndzeku. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, so when your daughter approached 
him and said we have started doing business and we are 
going to do forex trading, that was not soliciting his 
custom? 
MS KWINANA:   It is because Mr Ndzeku, when Lunga 
introduced herself, Mr Ndzeku got excited and said he was 
a friend of his late father and therefore he did not solicit 
money, they were together in Cape Town, she did not go 
20 
there to solicit money.  When they were talking, what are 
you doing?  Lunga told him what he is doing and then he 
got interested and said when I have money then maybe you 
can also trade for me. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you put them in touch, did you?  
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 192 of 279 
 
You put your daughter Ms Goniwe in touch with Mr 
Ndzeku? 
MS KWINANA:   No. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, that happened independently? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  So how did you end up doing the 
trading for him yourself on the platform? 
MS KWINANA:   It is because when I am the one who is 
doing forex trading, Lunga does not – she does some 
limited forex trading.  I would say I am almost fulltime in 
10 
forex trading, so that is why the money would come to me 
and then I put it in my credit card and then I pay IC Market 
or I pay Altcoin Traders, Skrill or Luno or IC Markets 
through my credit card. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So IC Markets is one but Altcoin and 
others are others, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Where you trade the deposits that you 
have received from your clients, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Are there any limitations on those 
platforms that you cannot be trading for other people? 
MS KWINANA:   You know, when I open an account there, I 
do not open an account using the names of other people, I 
will open an account using my name.  I open different 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 193 of 279 
 
accounts using my name, yes.  And then now when there is 
time then I would deposit the money in Zano Spark or take 
the money from Zano Spark depending on which direction it 
is going. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, but as I understand your evidence, 
clients – close clients, eight of them, are putting money in 
Zano Spark so that you can trade it for them on these 
platforms, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay.  Do you know if those platform put 
10 
limitations on your trading other people’s money? 
MS KWINANA:   The limitations, Chair, when I have got 
this money in my account, that company takes it as my 
account, they do not know whose money it is because it 
goes into my account.  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes but are you not limited by the terms 
and conditions of those platforms to only trade your own 
money, not a third party’s money? 
MS KWINANA:   No, I have never seen …[intervenes] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You have never seen that.  So if I later 
20 
show you the terms and conditions that place that limit, 
then would you be a bit concerned that you have been 
trading money on these platforms in circumstances where 
you are not permitted to do so? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 194 of 279 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Alright.  Okay, right, so we established 
Zano Spark in February of 2016 and you open bank 
accounts for Zano Spark, as I have it, on the 15 March 
2016.  Does that accord with your recollection? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  And opening balance in – there 
are a number of Zano Spark accounts so I have to remind 
myself but I think it is in the business account, was R500.  
Do you remember that? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Super.  So let us see what happens, at 
that time you told me you have about eight clients and now 
we are going to see in the bank account what happens with 
the money that you received, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay.  Let us go to the bank account 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr, I think we must take a short 
break. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Certainly. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are we all agreed that we can continue 
at least until quarter to six?  Ms Mbanjwa, is that fine with 
you?  Yes.  Ms Kwinana? 
MS KWINANA:   That is fine, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  It is about four minutes to 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 195 of 279 
 
four, let us take the break before Ms Hofmeyr moves onto 
something else, ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, indeed, Chair.  And till what 
time? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us say we will come back at ten past 
four, is that alright? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Certainly, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let’s continue. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair.  Ms Kwinana when Mr 
Ndzeku gave evidence at the Commission and in his 
affidavit that he provided to the Commission he spoke 
about being approached by your daughter, Ms Goniwe.  He 
put that approach in 2016.  I understood your evidence 
earlier to suggest it was earlier than that? 
MS KWINANA:   That was my impression Chair, but if he 
says they met in 2016 I wouldn’t object to that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  He also said when she told 
20 
him that she had this company that did forex trading he 
was attracted by that investment because it would enable 
him to hedge against the falling rand.  Were you aware that 
that was his interest? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair.  
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 196 of 279 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So did she communicate that to you? 
MS KWINANA:   She communicated it to me. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, so as I understand him he was 
interested in the forex trading and he was going to now use 
Zano Spark in order to do that forex trading, is that right? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay, now you mentioned your eight 
clients, or thereabouts when Zano Spark was established, 
for privacy reasons I am not going to ask you now to 
identify those eight people but I would like to ask that after 
10 
today you just provide an affidavit to the Commission 
identifying who those clients were so that we can be in 
touch 
with 
them 
about 
their 
understanding 
of 
the 
arrangement.   Are you comfortable doing that? 
MS KWINANA:   I am not comfortable Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You see the reason why I need to ask 
that is because when we summonsed you Ms Kwinana the 
summons was for really any scrap of paper that existed 
that could show us the investment statements that went to 
your clients, the contracts that you concluded with them, 
20 
updates on their investments and you have told us today 
not a single document exists, so there is no record that we 
can summons to legitimise and give credence to what you 
are telling us the arrangement was today, so our only 
option then is just to contact the people who you say are 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 197 of 279 
 
your clients and on behalf of whom you do forex trading.  
So that is the reason for it, you can consult with your 
lawyer afterwards and come back to us with your attitude 
to that.  Thank you. 
 
We also asked Mr Ndzeku for a single scrap of 
paper related to this forex investment that he did with you.  
Chair you might recall he initially in his response to the 
summons said they didn’t exist. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  In evidence he changed, he said they did 
10 
exist, he needed ten days, I said wouldn’t it be quicker, he 
said ten days, well he gave evidence on the 26 t h of August 
it 
is 
now 
the 
3 r d 
of 
November, 
despite 
repeated 
engagements with Mr Ndzeku he seems to have released 
his former lawyers, they are no longer a point of contact 
for us, he is not yet notified us of the lawyers he has 
replaced them with but there has been no document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He has not furnished any document? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Not a document no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADF HOFMEYR:   Despite repeated requests. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But when he gave evidence he was – 
when he gave his oral evidence I think he was adamant 
that there was some documents. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Indeed. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 198 of 279 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Receipts I think. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, yes, no actually as I recall it he 
said there were annual investment statements that  he 
received. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And there was a little debate about how 
he gets them off the emails, I remember thinking it would 
be quite quick and him resisting that and saying he needed 
at least ten days so you initially gave him ten days, there 
is then repeated engagements.   So that is strange Mr 
10 
Ndzeku 
thought 
that 
he 
had 
got 
annual 
investment 
statements 
out 
of 
your 
company 
who 
has 
no 
such 
statements, do you agree that that is strange? 
MS KWINANA:   No that is not strange Chair, I have been 
giving him the annual statements. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, so why didn’t you produce those 
when you were summoned to produce them? 
MS KWINANA:   Who was summoned, me? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Now Zano Spark, Zano Spark is the 
entity with which he is doing the trading. 
20 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, the reason being that the server as I 
think I said in my affidavit was confiscated, however 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry in December what  happened? 
MS KWINANA:   I have been sending him the statements 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 199 of 279 
 
he has got the statements for December 2016, statements 
for December 2017 or December 2018, I think also 
December 2019, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the question was why didn’t you 
provide those to the Commission in response to the 
summons? 
MS KWINANA:   I no longer have them Chair because the 
server, my server, Kwinana and Associates server which 
basically 
we 
were 
also 
using 
for 
Zano 
Spark, 
was 
confiscated by the service provider for non-payment, I said 
10 
that in the affidavit, however when it was confiscated we 
already had printed the statements to Mr Ndzeku. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How long ago was it when it was 
confiscated? 
MS KWINANA:   That was I think in February this year 
Chair, more or less. 
CHAIRPERSON:   February this year? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And that was because Kwinana and 
20 
Associates went under, is that right? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So Kwinana and Associates went under 
in February of this year? 
MS KWINANA:   No I think before that, before that, but the 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 200 of 279 
 
computer was still there until it was confiscated. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Who is your service provider? 
MS KWINANA:   Onero. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Could you spell that for me? 
MS KWINANA:   O-n-e-r-o. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So Onero is your service provider and it 
confiscated – what exactly did it confiscate? 
MS KWINANA:   Our server, they were the service provider 
for the server. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   For the server for Kwinana & Associates. 
10 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That went under before that? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So why would they continue to maintain 
a server for a company that has gone under? 
MS KWINANA:   I don’t know but they went to physically 
take it in February, so why did they remain not taking it I 
don’t know. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I don’t understand, you see if Kwinana 
and Associates went under how did they continue to pay 
20 
for the services? 
MS KWINANA:   That is why had to take it for non-
payment. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No I don’t understand it, but maybe I am 
not being clear.   Kwinana and Associates went under some 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 201 of 279 
 
appreciable time back, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can you just give an estimate of when 
that might be? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ja when was that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   More or less which month, would that be 
2019? 
MS KWINANA:   I think Chair there is a document 
somewhere here in the bundle to be exact. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh but what is our recollection so that 
10 
we can see whether there is need to go to the bundles. 
MS KWINANA:  I think maybe 2018. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe 2018? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, I think that might be good 
enough. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So I think it was about August 2018, 
does that jog your memory? 
MS KWINANA:   Ja, it does. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay so Kwinana and Associates goes 
20 
under in August of 2018 and it has a service provider on 
their own correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So it stops operating in August of 2018, 
is that right? 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 202 of 279 
 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So how did the service continue to be 
provided after that? 
MS KWINANA:   It continued to be provided on a credit 
basis hence they only took it with such a huge liability in 
February. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So you went on credit from August of 
2018? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
Who 
went 
on 
credit 
because 
I 
10 
understand that Kwinana & Associates went under. 
MS KWINANA:   They continued Chair, they did not 
physically close off the server. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right. 
MS KWINANA:   They continued. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you were using it for Zano Spark’s 
business, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Is that right? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Zano Spark has not gone under, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So why didn’t Zano Spark keep paying? 
MS KWINANA:   It is because the contract was with 
Kwinana and Associates. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 203 of 279 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No that with respect Ms Kwinana this is 
a server critical to your business, right? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay, so Kwinana and Associates is out 
of the picture in August of 2018. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You need the server to operate your 
business as Zano Spark? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Why  doesn’t Zano Spark pay for the 
10 
service? 
MS KWINANA:   Because they had to pay for the huge 
arrears which they could not afford. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Zano Spark couldn’t afford? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes to pay for the arrears for Kwinana & 
Associates. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you were the director of Kwinana & 
Associates and you and your daughter are the directors of 
Zano Spark? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So you decided in your Zano Spark 
directorships not to make good the bill that Kwinana & 
Associates owed to your service provider, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Not because we did not want to make 
good but there was a huge liability in respect of the server 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 204 of 279 
 
which basically Zano Spark could not carry. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, why could Zano Spark not carry 
it? 
MS KWINANA:   It is because Zano Spark has not made 
money. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, it hasn’t made money, we will come 
back to that.  So you need a server to operate your 
business at Zano Spark, you are using the Kwinana & 
Associates business server since August of 2018, you don’t 
pay for it all and then it gets taken away from you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And remember to face this side Ms 
Kwinana. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It gets taken away from you in February 
of this year, correct, for non-payment? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So that just scraps any electronic 
records of all of these annual statements you provided to 
Mr Ndzeku correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Not really Chair, I would still in December 
2020 I would still be in a position to create another 
20 
statement. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, I wouldn’t like anything to be 
created now, I would like to go back to the ones that you 
say you have in hard copy, why have those not been 
furnished to the Commission? 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 205 of 279 
 
MS KWINANA:   When I printed them Chair I gave them to 
Mr Ndzeku, I didn’t know that the ones that I have kept in 
my server one day I would not have access to them. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Oh sorry, so they are not in your 
possession? 
MS KWINANA:   No Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Oh I understand, so why would you give 
him hard copies, when did you give him these hard copies? 
MS KWINANA:   On an annual basis every January. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You would go and take him a hard copy? 
10 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Why didn’t you email it? 
MS KWINANA:   Because I felt that it is – because of the 
confidentiality I do not know if the email is safe enough. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You see Ms Kwinana Mr Ndzeku’s 
evidence before this Commission is he received those on 
email. 
MS KWINANA:   Then that is his evidence, I sent them, I 
print them and send them. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No you don’t send them you take them 
20 
as I understand your evidence. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
Because 
you 
are 
afraid 
that 
confidentiality of those documents requires you to hand 
deliver them to Mr Ndzeku, is that correct? 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 206 of 279 
 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   So you have been to his home, is that 
correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Closer to the mic. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Where do you deliver them in January 
every year? 
MS KWINANA:  I would call and find out where he is and 
then go and drop them, maybe in a meeting, maybe at 
airport, or – ja basically. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that what you did with all the other 
10 
clients?   You said when Zano Spark started you said about 
eight clients. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair, that’s what I do ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that what you did with all of them? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did you hand deliver all the confidential 
documents relating to SAA and SAA Technical when you 
were a Board member? 
MS KWINANA:   Hand deliver them where? 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   To whoever you were communicating 
with. 
MS KWINANA:   No SAA has got a company secretariat 
that does that, and Zano Spark does not have company 
secretariat. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 207 of 279 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, so when you were at SAA and you 
were communicating with people, co board members, 
management about confidential matters, you were happy to 
do so on email, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   That is their policy Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, but when you are investing some 
money in forex trading for your associates, I want to call 
them associates because you are resisting saying it is 
members of the public, your associates, you won’t email 
them is that right? 
10 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How is it different?  Why is – why are 
considerations of confidentiality such that you feel you 
need to deliver these statements personally to your clients, 
but when it is confidential matters relating to SAA you find 
no problem in emailing people with whom you must be in 
touch about such information? 
MS KWINANA:   It depends Chair on the company policy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KWINANA:   If SAA required that the documents must 
20 
be hand delivered, based on ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   SAA? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, oh, yes Chair, so I am saying it 
depends on the company policy.  At Zano Spark we decided 
that we are not going to email because the email do get 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 208 of 279 
 
hacked left, right and centre, and therefore our policy was 
that we are not going to email.  So SAA I never received 
something that says things must not be emailed, so 
basically SAA policy would be different in terms of 
delivering of confidential information from Zano Spark. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So you communicated to Mr Ndzeku 
these confidentiality concerns did you? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Can you provide us with this policy of 
Zano Spark? 
10 
MS KWINANA:   Ja, I can do that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You can do that, mmm.   That would be 
useful, I wonder if you could email it to us, would you do 
that? 
MS KWINANA:   No I would have to hand deliver it chair 
because that is our policy.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Could you make an exception on this 
occasion? 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
But 
there 
cannot 
be 
anything 
confidential about our policy. 
20 
MS KWINANA:   No, but ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   You share it with your clients. 
MS KWINANA:   But Chair even the fact that we do not 
email statements but we hand deliver it to them, basically 
it is confidentiality itself, so if you want the policy Ms 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 209 of 279 
 
Hofmeyr, I will not email it to you, I will print and deliver it 
to you. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, we would like it on email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you have told us publically what the 
policy says so there is nothing confidential about it.  
MS KWINANA:   But at least Chair I will not be willing to 
put it down and email it. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No Ms Kwinana can I explain why we 
want it on email?  We would like it on email because if you 
email it to us we can do a Metadata analysis on it and we 
10 
can determine when that document was created, because I 
need to put it to you that your evidence thus far, I will 
likely argue in due course is dishonest.   Mr Ndzeku came 
here, he said, initially he said he had not documents, but 
then when he is finally pushed he says he gets them 
annually on email.  You have come here today and you tell 
us that some server related to an old company whose debts 
you didn’t want to take over has been confiscated in 
February of this year and so you don’t have any record of 
anything with your clients, but rest assured you printed out 
20 
hand delivered documents of annual statements to hand 
deliver them. 
 
Ms Kwinana I put to you that is nothing short of 
preposterous. What is your comment? 
MS KWINANA:   I am saying Chair I will not be in a 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 210 of 279 
 
position to email it to you, anyway the policy that you are 
looking for I would have to create it because it has gone 
with the server, but I know what it entails because I am the 
one who put it in 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ja. 
MS KWINANA:   But anyway I am not going to email it to 
you because that will be breach of our policy. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Sure, okay Ms Kwinana.   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS HOFMEYR:  Right, let us then move to Mr Ndzeku and 
10 
your understanding of his investment, because he was 
approached by your daughter in 2016, he is told he can 
hedge against the Rand and he can do so through her 
company Zano Spark in respect of which she is doing forex 
trading, correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right so then there is no contract I 
assume that gets drawn up for that, is there? 
MS KWINANA:   There is no contract Chair but in the 
investment statement itself ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   The one you hand delivered? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes? 
MS KWINANA:   There is some form of I would say the 
contract so to say. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 211 of 279 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   What does it say? 
MS KWINANA:   It is talking about the return on 
investments and it calculates the illustrative returns on an 
annual basis and it also has got a capital amount invested, 
the rate of returns and the total amount and it also has the 
terms and conditions. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I am going to come back to your terms 
and conditions.  Just tell me how was Mr Ndzeku’s 
investment doing?  He starts investing in 2016, how is it 
done? 
10 
MS KWINANA:   You know with forex trading Chair today 
you are doing well, today you make 10%, the following you 
make 1%, the other day you lose 2%, you lose 5%, so 
basically it is fluctuation. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Fluctuation, so you trading that money 
since you received it in the account, is that right? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So on an annual basis let us talk about 
the one you hand delivered in January 2017, how was he 
looking at that point with his investment overall.  I 
20 
understand the daily fluctuations but overall was he up or 
was he down? 
MS KWINANA:   I would say it is a little bit up, it is not 
that good but it is a little bit up, it is not as my projection. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   What is your mandate from Mr Ndzeku? 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 212 of 279 
 
MS KWINANA:   My mandate is to invest the money and 
give it to him with the profit after five years. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, my question is you get different 
types 
of 
mandate, 
are 
you 
aware 
of 
that? 
 
 
Full 
discretionary, non-full discretionary mandates, do you know 
that? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, because that is what financial 
service providers are required to be very clear about, so 
that they don’t just do their own thing with other people’s 
10 
money correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So did you have a full discretionary 
mandate, or something less than that? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair a full discretionary mandate. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Full discretionary mandate, so you just 
went onto your platforms whenever you saw fit and you 
traded his money, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Why did he place that level of trust in 
20 
you? 
MS KWINANA:   He is not the only one who is putting a 
level of trust in me. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No I understand that, that is why we are 
going to get the names of the other eight clients, but just 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 213 of 279 
 
tell me about him, why did he put that level of trust in you? 
MS KWINANA:   I don’t know, maybe he would be the one 
to answer that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So you never communicated, because if 
I understood your evidence previously all you had was a 
professional relationship with him in which you discussed 
on occasion transformation issues and BEE initiatives, 
right.   How does he then have the confidence in you, not a 
financial service provider because you have got no license, 
right, to put millions of Rands with you, with a full 
10 
discretionary mandate? 
MS KWINANA:   Why he is trusting me Chair I wouldn’t 
know, maybe he would be the best person to answer that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, so ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is there something you said to him that 
you think may have given him that level of confidence that 
make him give you that wide discretion as to what to – how 
to – what to do with his money? 
MS KWINANA:   I don’t know Chair but what I can confirm 
is that for him to give me that level of confidence that 
20 
means he has seen something in me that maybe he trusted 
me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So I understood you to say that the 
arrangement was full discretionary mandate for a period of 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 214 of 279 
 
five years is that right? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   We are close to the end of that five 
years, how is his investment looking at the moment? 
MS KWINANA:   We are not close to the end of five years 
Chair, he did not put the money five years ago, he has 
been putting money as and when he feels that he’s got 
some bit of money to invest, so which means therefore 
each investment has got it’s lifespan. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Alright, so there is a new five years for 
10 
each deposit that he makes? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Correct, so it would be important to 
know the date on which the first deposit is made, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes because then you track the five 
years, so let’s take the first one which occurred in June of 
2016, that’s the one I was thinking of when I said it is quite 
soon, it will be June of next year.  Tell me how his 
investment is doing on that? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   The first one for Ndzeku is August Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   August next year? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No it is not, it is June. 
MS KWINANA:   I have got August Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You have got August, okay let’s take 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 215 of 279 
 
August, just tell me how that investment is doing? 
MS KWINANA:   As I said Chair it is not performing as well 
as I wanted to but it is doing fairly well. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No I want some greater clarity there, 
what was the August investment amount? 
MS KWINANA:   I think that was 600, R600 000. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   R605 000 to be exact, right, how much 
has been lost on that? 
MS KWINANA:   No money has been lost. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No money has been lost, has he made a 
10 
bit? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Has he always made something? 
MS KWINANA:   No. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Which ones did he lose on? 
MS KWINANA:   No Chair you know how forex trading 
works if like for instance as we are sitting here there is 
trading that is going on and therefore I wouldn’t with 
confidence say now we are sitting at this much, forex 
trading happens 24 hours a day as I am sitting here. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But you had to decide when to buy and 
sell don’t you? 
MS KWINANA:    Yes Chair.  Yes, but what happens as I 
am sitting here there are pending orders, there are running 
orders, so basically as I am sitting here I have put in the 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 216 of 279 
 
pending orders, that means when the price is at this then 
the trade must sell, when the price is like this the trade 
must buy, that is one.  And then two, then you put the stock 
losses and take profits, so basically I may be sitting here 
with that investment and I would say maybe the last time I 
checked it, it was about R700 000, ja R700 000 for 
instance.  I can go back to the platform and find out that it 
is R1million or I can go back and find out that after all it is 
R400 000, so basically in forex trading, unlike when you 
are putting money in the bank, when you are putting money 
10 
in the bank you say it is going to earn 5% per annum, then 
you know that if you have put in 500 5% is – if you had put 
in 100 5% is R5 and therefore you know that at the end of 
the year you have 105, but it doesn’t work like that with 
forex trading.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Much more volatile is that right? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MS KWINANA:   So basically it is difficult to say how has it 
performed or not, how you look at it is when you say this is 
20 
the end of five years now and at the end of five years this 
investment is this month then that is when you – when we 
draw it and you close that account then that is when you 
decide whether you have made profit or loss, because it 
depends on like a second basis basically because it 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 217 of 279 
 
changes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I can understand that, so it is a highly 
volatile market to be investing in, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It can move, as you say as you sit here 
today things might have dropped considerably or raised 
considerably correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And so you really only in a position to 
assess the investment at the end of the five years, is that 
correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair.  
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
What 
were 
you 
putting 
in 
your 
investment statements that you had hand delivered to Mr 
Ndzeku every year then? 
MS KWINANA:   I am putting in the illustrative figures. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ja, so give me the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, you are putting in?  Face this 
20 
side please, ja, you’re putting in? 
MS KWINANA:   Illustrative figures. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And what are those? 
MS KWINANA:   I don’t remember them now as I am sitting 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 218 of 279 
 
here Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But what I asked you to do was just tell 
me now like you told him each January how his investment 
was doing, how his investment is doing and I understood 
you to say you can’t do that because it is too volatile, and 
you can only estimate it – well you can only determine it at 
the end of the five years, so can’t you do it for me now, 
you said that five – the 600 that was invested in August 
made a little bit.  I wanted to know which of them he had lost 
on as you sit here today. 
10 
MS KWINANA:  When I checked Chair it had made a little 
bit.  I do not know now how much it is and therefore I will not 
be able to tell you.  And I will also not be able to tell you the 
illustrative one until I have a look at the statement. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes, yes.  And that is because his money 
is invested in platforms in respect of which there is a lot of 
movement at any point, is that right? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So you need to stop it at a point to get a 
proper sense of whether he is up or down, correct? 
20 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And that happens at the five years, 
correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right.  Let me just go back one step which 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 219 of 279 
 
is that – this volatility suggests to me it is a very risky 
investment, correct? 
MS KWINANA:  It is – it is Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS KWINANA:  It is high risk – it is high rewards. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Do you remember what the FSCA said in 
its affidavit about the concerns it had about parties engaging 
in these platforms and not being told about the levels of 
risk? 
MS KWINANA:  Of course Chair you cannot not tell the 
10 
person about the level of risk.  
ADV HOFMEYR:  It is also… 
MS KWINANA:  And in fact … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry you cannot? 
MS KWINANA:  You cannot not tell the person about the 
level of risk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KWINANA:  Because it is high risk and in fact I would 
tell my clients most of my clients are the members of my 
family.  I would tell them that you need to put the money 
20 
there that you will not commit suicide when… 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you lost the bond. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes if you lose it and in fact that is exactly 
– that is exactly how I put it.  And in fact that is also what I 
said to Mr Ndzeku and Ms Hendricks to say this is volatile, it 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 220 of 279 
 
is high risk, it is high returns.  And what Mr Ndzeku said, he 
said both of them they are prepared to take the risk.  The 
reason why they are prepared to take the risk is that – and 
they know that I do not need a licence to do that.  They said 
the reason why they are prepared to take the risk is because 
even with formalised businesses which have – which would 
have the licence like for instance he made an example of 
Steinhoff where people had invested in it thinking that it is a 
good investment and their monies were wiped off.  He made 
an example of the Enron who went under and it was a 
10 
[00:03:03] company.  So basically he knew exactly what he 
was going through.  We are not saying his money is lost.  We 
are saying in the – if they can lose that money they know 
exactly because we told them the risks of volatility including 
my own money.  I have lost money in forex trading.  I have 
gained money in forex trading but I never lost my mind 
because that is the risk I know and that is the risk I was 
prepared to take. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So this was what 2016 when you had this 
discussion with Mr Ndzeku. 
20 
MS KWINANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he was referring to Steinhoff? 
MS KWINANA:  He was referring to I think that was 2016 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 221 of 279 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Just the server is 
interesting me.  You said it was confiscated in February this 
year, is that right? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Have you taken steps to get a new server 
for your business? 
MS KWINANA:  No not yet. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No not yet.  Why not? 
10 
MS KWINANA:  It is because basically with the platform that 
we are using a very reliable platform there has not been that 
much need for a server unlike with the – with the audit firm 
where basically you need to keep the files for a period of five 
years others for a period of seven years.  And therefore the 
server basically is not that important for the type of the 
business that you are in. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So you just left the confiscation when it 
happened in February of 2020 correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And if Anero [?] had just contacted the 
commission and told us that it did not confiscate your server 
in February of 2020 would you say that Anero is giving us a 
false piece of information now? 
MS KWINANA:  It may not necessarily be February it could 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 222 of 279 
 
be February but if they say they confiscated the server on 
this date I would agree with them.  But if they said they 
never confiscated the server then I would not agree with 
them. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But what would you say February 2020? 
MS KWINANA:  That is what I – that is what I think. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Oh okay.  But you accept you might be 
wrong about that? 
MS KWINANA:  I might be wrong about that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Okay let us then go to what actually 
10 
happens in the Zano Spark bank account. Right.  You open it 
with R500.00 okay.  Then you get a first payment into and we 
need to go to DD26 at page 189 for that.  DD26 is Ms 
Ndzeku’s bundle.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Will somebody – oh ja okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Oh apologies [a] and it is page I said 189.  
Oh sorry no, no it is not 189.  Let me get that right.  No we 
need to go to the JM Aviation – sorry the Zano Spark bank 
account.  I do apologise.  Let us start there.  That is 104.  
Apologies.  Okay so you had about eight clients as I 
20 
understand it when the business starts in February 2016, is 
that correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Okay.  So we start with the opening bank 
statement which is dated 15 March 2016 to 15 April 2016, do 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 223 of 279 
 
you see that? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  At page 104.  And if you turn over the page 
you will see there is the credit of R500.00 that is what you 
have confirmed was deposited initially in the account, 
correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Ye Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Okay.  Then if you track it forward we will 
see the receipts from your other clients, is that right?  
Because you said to us we do not have Mr Ndzeku investing 
10 
until August, is that right? 
MS KWINANA:  Chair there will not be the receipts from 
other clients here.  How the forex trading platform operates 
you put the money into the platform. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Closer to the microphone.  Come closer to 
the microphone. 
MS KWINANA:  You put the money in the platform.  You do 
not put it in the bank Chair.  You put the money in the 
trading platform and therefore you will not see the money 
here.  And therefore you will not see the clients here.  So 
20 
basically that is how it works. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Oh I see.  So – sorry so I misunderstood.  
So you do not see the client’s money in this bank account, 
right? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 224 of 279 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You just put it onto the platform, is that 
correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That is you, you do that? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right.  How do you get the money from the 
client to put on the platform? 
MS KWINANA:  It depends Chair on the arrangements.  As I 
said some of them would be put through my credit card and 
then I pay IC markets directly.  Some of them would be put in 
10 
my personal account and then I put it in IC markets or I put 
in Altcoin Trader or I put it in Luno. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS KWINANA:  Some of them would directly put it in – in 
Luno and Altcoin Trader.  Others would open the platforms 
accounts and then give me the logging details to trade for 
them.  So basically it depends on the level of the 
involvement that the investor wants. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So they would not be depositing it in Zano 
Spark’s account they would either as I understand your 
20 
evidence I do not know pay you somehow into your personal 
account so you can put it through your credit card, is that 
right? 
MS KWINANA:  That is one of them. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That is one way.  The other way is that 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 225 of 279 
 
they do it directly onto the platform but give you login details 
so you can trade for them, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Is there any other way than those two 
because I have heard you reference credit card and I have 
heard you reference directly onto the platform. 
MS KWINANA:  There is also direct payment into Altcoin 
Trader or Screams of Luno. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right but what – what is clear and you 
must forgive me for misunderstanding this.  I thought we 
10 
would see the deposits into the Zano Spark account but that 
is not how it happens, correct? 
MS KWINANA:  No Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right.  It happens…  
MS KWINANA:  And in fact even their profits you – you will 
not see them here. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right.  Right.  They live somewhere else. 
MS KWINANA:    Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Correct. 
MS KWINANA:  Yes. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So the money does not come in here.  You 
do not see the profits here because there is another 
arrangement, correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And it is going to be your personal account 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 226 of 279 
 
or your credit card or then directly onto the platform, 
correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well ... 
MS KWINANA:  And also just from – and also into Altcoin 
Trader which basically is like the Bitcoin bank account. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes exactly.  We will come to Altcoin 
shortly do not worry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I wanted to say I think I must give up 
10 
Ms Hofmeyr.  Ms Kwinana likes looking at you more than 
looking at me. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Oh sorry Chair. 
MS KWINANA:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Since yesterday I have been saying she 
must look this side.  She might… 
ADV HOFMEYR:  We are terribly engaged.  She is very 
engaged. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She is much more interested in you. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I do – I will try and remind Ms Kwinana. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  She is giving me her back. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So it is terrible. 
MS KWINANA:  Apologies. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Terrible.  I always say to witnesses try and 
as you have done turn the chair so that it reminds you 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 227 of 279 
 
actually to whom your evidence is given.  But nonetheless.  
Okay so we will not see it Zano Spark that is not how it is 
done.  It comes directly to you, credit card or your personal 
account, correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Okay so that is why I should not be 
surprised that this bank account starts on the 15 March and 
there is just nothing coming into it despite the fact that you 
have your clients, is that right? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And it goes from March to April and I still 
see no movement, correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Ja.  And then we get from March to – sorry 
April to May still no movement.  There is literally R501,37 in 
this account.  No movement but you doing a lot of forex 
trading for your other clients.  And then we do however see 
R2.5 million come into the account. 
MS KWINANA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  At page 111.  Why is R2.5 million suddenly 
20 
coming into the account if that is not the way your forex 
trading is done? 
MS KWINANA:  I said Chair that is one of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No you did not. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 228 of 279 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms Hofmeyr you said 111? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the amount did you say. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  2.5 million 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay there I can see it okay alright.  Thank 
you. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You see Ms Kwinana has just said it was 
one of the ways and I was just going to stop her and say no 
that was not your evidence a moment ago.  You see I was so 
careful about that evidence.  I repeated it about three times.   
10 
I have to confess I bored myself in doing so.  But it was so 
important for me to get absolutely clear from you Ms 
Kwinana you as you give evidence under oath in this 
commission how this forex trading happens for your clients.  
So three times I said to you we will not see it in the Zano 
Spark account we will see it in your personal account 
through your credit card or directly onto the platform.  But 
now you have presented with a page that shows a R2.5 
million coming into the account and you are now about to 
change your version.  So tell us what your version has now 
20 
become please? 
MS KWINANA:  I am not changing my version Chair.  I am 
saying I counted the ways in which to fund the platform. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No I asked you how the forex trading took 
place. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 229 of 279 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry just repeat. 
MS KWINANA:  I counted the ways in which to fund the 
platform.  I said firstly you fund it through your credit card 
and then the credit card what would happen I would get 
money from my personal account and put it in the credit card 
and fund that is directly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is your – this is business money? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you put into your personal credit 
card? 
10 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair.  It happens like that.  Yes.  And 
then I put it in my personal account and then I put it in my 
credit card account and then it goes to IC Markets.  That – 
basically – so that is when you fund directly into IC Markets.  
And then – and then I said you can all – you can also take 
this money from the account and pay it into Altcoin Traders. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From which account? 
MS KWINANA:  From Zano Spark or from any account even 
my personal account I do that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So Ms Kwinana if I can say the record will 
20 
show you were absolutely clear that you did not take the 
money from the Zano Spark account but please continue. 
MS KWINANA:  No Chair I have been saying I have 
calculated the ways in which the money reaches the 
platform. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 230 of 279 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No my question to you was how this forex 
trading take place and I specifically emphasised how do you 
get the money with which to trade?  And the record will show 
that to you.  But let us not detain ourselves.  Let us have 
your version. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry let her finish how she was 
explaining.  Just finish how you were explaining Ms Kwinana. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  I was saying I was 
telling the evidence leader how would the money get into the 
platform.  This is how it happens.  There are many ways in 
10 
which the money gets into the platform.  It is not one way.  I 
counted Scream, I counted Altcoin Trader, I counted Luno.  
So basically those ones and in fact also then I can get 
money from wherever.  I can get money from my credit card, 
I can get money from my personal account, I can get money 
from the business account.  The main aim is for the money to 
be in the platform. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I wonder how quickly they could 
rewind to your questions and the answers – how quick that 
would be? 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I am not sure Chair.  You what might be 
useful. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Is we could possibly continue a bit and we 
could actually do that tomorrow morning because it is … 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 231 of 279 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Would that be convenient because then we 
can certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is fine ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So let us leave that for a moment.  Let us 
now focus at page 111. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, I am sorry. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Mbanjwa. 
ADV MBANJWA:  Thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you are not available tomorrow. 
ADV MBANJWA:  Because where I understand it.  Yes I do 
not want to mislead the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
ADV MBANJWA:  The way I understand it we – we were set 
down we were scheduled for two days. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MBANJWA:  Yes that was just a reminder.  Thank you 
20 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  Ja I think the contemplation 
was that we could finish – we would finish today but certainly 
I was also thinking obviously depending on your availability 
tomorrow morning that maybe before we start with the next 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 232 of 279 
 
witness if we do not finish this evening we could continue for 
hopefully finish before lunch.  But if you are not available I 
think other arrangements will have to be made.   
ADV MBANJWA:  No thank you Chair I regret Chair but I 
have already stayed with appointments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
ADV MBANJWA:  And I think I also have a client not 
tomorrow but the [00:19:02]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine.  I think it should be easy to 
schedule for an evening session one of the days. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair we will no doubt 
communicate with Ms Mbanjwa after today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So if we are at pages 111 tell us about this 
R2.5 million? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry maybe in the light of that we 
might have to… 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Leave a bit. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Play it – this sometime before we leave 
while ... 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Well can I ask that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Everything is fresh with everybody’s… 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Fresh.  Maybe what we do is we just find 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 233 of 279 
 
out whether it is feasible at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And I can be just given a note if somebody 
will look into that.  And then I can judge it as we … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is right. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Just to not lose … 
CHAIRPERSON:  At some stage ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Time at this point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So we are at page 111 and there is this 
10 
deposit of R2.5 million.  So what is that? 
MS KWINANA:  That is the forex trading investment from Ms 
Hendricks. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And who is Ms Hendricks? 
MS KWINANA:  Ms Hendricks at the time I knew her to be Mr 
Ndzeku’s colleague. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  His colleague. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
MS KWINANA:  I knew her to be Mr Ndzeku’s colleague. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And so was this an investment for Mr 
Ndzeku? 
MS KWINANA:  She did not say so that is why also the 
statement – the investment statement is saying it is for her. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  For her? 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 234 of 279 
 
MS KWINANA:  Yes 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right.  It is not for Mr Ndzeku. 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No.  So you have a separate arrangement 
with her, correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And what is the mandate there? 
MS KWINANA:  It is the same because she wanted to invest 
in forex trading. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So did you – how did she come to learn of 
10 
this available trading? 
MS KWINANA:  I was thinking that she got it from Mr Ndzeku 
because that is Mr Ndzeku who knows what we are doing.  
So when Lumka told me that Ms Hendricks has put in the 
money and Ms Hendricks is Mr Ndzeku’s colleague it came to 
my mind that she heard it from him. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes so did you have communications with 
her about what the investment involved? 
MS KWINANA:  The communication between Ms Hendricks 
and Zano Spark is through Lumka. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Your daughter Ms Goniwe. 
MS KWINANA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Is that right? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So she told her all about the risks? 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 235 of 279 
 
MS KWINANA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes she knows. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And she communicated to Ms Goniwe that 
is Ms Hendricks communicated to Ms Goniwe that it was her 
money that she was investing, correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So she needed a separate contract and 
arrangement, correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Do you know that Mr Ndzeku’s evidence 
was that she was investing for him? 
MS KWINANA:  That should be their arrangement. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No it is not their arrangement because it is 
very important that you know who your client is.  You see 
and that is why this is such regulated field.  You are going 
onto highly volatile platforms on your own evidence.  You 
have got a full discretionary mandate and this is R2.5 million 
from her.  So it is absolutely critical that you know who the 
client is, who you receiving instructions from, who you 
20 
contracting 
with. 
 
Did 
you 
do 
any 
know 
your 
client 
investigations that are required under FIKA before these 
arrangements were set up? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You did? 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 236 of 279 
 
MS KWINANA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So you have got FIKA documents for Ms 
Hendricks? 
MS KWINANA:  I have got FIKA documents Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And so she was your client, did you 
understand that? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.  And there is some other arrangement 
that happened between her and Mr Ndzeku. 
MS KWINANA:  But I am not party to 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.  But she came to you because of Mr 
Ndzeku, correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes I think so. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No you have just given evidence that said 
you inferred that when Ms Goniwe said she had been in 
touch and indicated that she got that from Mr Ndzeku.  Did I 
have your evidence correct? 
MS KWINANA:  That is what Lumka said. 
MS KWINANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I think she was not stating it as a fact. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She was saying she was thinking so, is 
that right? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that what you are saying Ms Kwinana or 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 237 of 279 
 
were you stating it as a fact that she heard from Mr Ndzeku 
about your services? 
MS KWINANA:  Who Lumka? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hendricks? 
MS KWINANA:  Oh Ms Hendricks? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KWINANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You – she told you that she heard from him 
or you just … 
MS KWINANA:  No – Lumka told me – Lumka told me that 
10 
Ms Hendricks who is a colleague of Mr Ndzeku has 
deposited the money that she wants to be invested in forex 
trading. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but the question is, how did she know 
about your services?  Did you think that Ms – she had heard 
about you from Mr Ndzeku or did she tell you or your 
daughter that she heard about your services from Mr 
Ndzeku? 
MS KWINANA:  My daughter told me that Ms Hendricks – 
that is why she knew that it was Mr Ndzeku’s colleague 
20 
because Ms Hendricks said she heard from Mr Ndzeku. 
MS KWINANA:  Okay alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I understood from you evidence earlier you 
quite keen to emphasise that you do not provide these 
services to the public generally, correct? 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 238 of 279 
 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  It is people with whom you have a 
particular association, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So Ms Hendricks have you ever met her? 
MS KWINANA:  If she is a colleague of Vuyo and she called 
my daughter and my daughter told me and we did do they 
know your client I really do not take her as the member of 
the public. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I see.  So it is… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  The question was have you ever met her? 
MS KWINANA:  Me I never met her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Who met her? 
MS KWINANA:  Lumka. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And it was then her association with Mr 
Ndzeku that made you comfortable to take her on as a client, 
is that right? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Okay.  So she deposits R2.5 million that is 
20 
on the 1 July we saw that at page 111. 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And the next – so nothing else is 
happening in the bank account.  The next thing that happens 
is if you go to page 113 she deposits another amount of 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 239 of 279 
 
R600 000.00, correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And that is now taking the balance up to 
R3.1 is that right? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And now what trading are you doing for her 
pursuant to your contract? 
MS KWINANA:  Is the same thing Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So you need to now invest on the platforms 
in order to do the trading, correct? 
10 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And how do you do that if no money is 
being taken from the account? 
MS 
KWINANA: 
 
You 
will 
notice 
that 
somewhere 
in 
subsequent months the money is taken from here.  The 
reason being that when the money comes in I just would not 
put it in the platform because also as I said the trading is 
volatile and sometimes like for instance with US Diza in 20 – 
in 2017 December 2017 one dollar was R11.47 cents and 
about a few two or three months ago the – one dollar was 
20 
R19.40 or even R19.90 something.  So basically when you 
get money for forex trading you do not just put it in in the – 
for trading because you need to wait for the right moment to 
strike.  So basically that is the reason why you will find that 
sometimes the money sits for months or weeks and then 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 240 of 279 
 
sometimes the money is put it – is put in the platform or 
something. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So when was the right moment to strike for 
Ms Hendricks? 
MS KWINANA:  I would have to check it in the platform 
Chair.  I would not say I put the money on this date.  I 
definitely would not say that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No but just whereabouts.  She starts 
investing because she is interested in forex trading on the 1 
July 2016 when was it the right time to invest? 
10 
MS KWINANA:  Chair I need to put – I need to check when 
did I start to invest that in forex trading. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But you are investing for other clients at 
the time, were you not? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.  So why was it the time for them but 
not the time for her? 
MS KWINANA:  When you enter the trade Chair it depends 
on the market at the time.  So the fact that in other clients I 
had put in maybe let us say for example I use the simple pair 
20 
like US to JPY for instance.  And US Disa which is well 
known in South Africa.  So if I decide that I will put your 
money in US Disa I will put somebody else’s money in gold.  
I will somebody else’s money in Nasdaq.  I will put somebody 
else’s money in AUDJPY for instance and therefore it 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 241 of 279 
 
depends when the market is right for that particular pair.  
And in fact I would not put everybody’s money in one pair, 
for instance.  So basically, when you say, when was it the 
right time for Ms Hendricks to put it there?  It is difficult for 
me to say this, is when I put it...  Because another thing.  I 
do not have Ms Hendricks as the client only.  So it would be 
difficult.   
 
I would say, for instance, I put it in October and only to 
find out that I am not telling the truth because the money 
that I put it in October is for another client.  So I do not know 
10 
when did I put Ms Hendricks’ money,  I would have to check 
the platform. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So is your evidence that at any point in 
time you are not aware of whose clients’ money you are 
dealing with? 
MS KWINANA:   I am aware of whose moneys I am dealing 
with but I do not know when did I enter the market for that 
particular client until I check the platform. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Why would that be so?  Ms Hendricks 
gives you R 3.1 million by the end of July.  How do you not 
20 
know when you started investing her money in forex trading? 
MS KWINANA:   I am not saying Chair I do not know.  I am 
saying, as I am sitting here, I do not know and I do am not 
going to tell you when did I invest the money. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So at some point, how would you earmark 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 242 of 279 
 
what has been invested for Ms Hendricks? 
MS KWINANA:   How would I earmark...? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, how do you know which is 
Ms Hendricks’ money and not Mr Ndzeku’s money? 
MS KWINANA:   The platform has got account numbers. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   H’m. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   H’m. 
MS KWINANA:   So know that this one, this account number 
belongs to this client. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  So...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it correct...  I am sorry Ms Hofmeyr.  
Would it be correct that you say you would work on the 
principle that once a client has given you his or her money, 
you need to invest it at the earliest opportunity?  So as soon 
as possible?  You should avoid delays? 
MS KWINANA:   Not with forex trading Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS KWINANA:   But with the bank because you would be 
losing some interest. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KWINANA:   That is different. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KWINANA:   But with forex trading ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 243 of 279 
 
MS KWINANA:   ...you need to wait for the right moment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you have to watch how the markets 
are doing? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So at some point, the money comes out of 
this account? 
MS KWINANA:   H’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And goes into a platform for Ms Hendricks, 
correct? 
10 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay and she will have her own account 
number.  Is that right? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   And I understand you to say, what you 
cannot do today is tell me when that is, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Could you tell me approximately, like a 
year? 
 
You 
know, 
you 
have 
only 
got 
eight 
clients.  
Ms Hendricks...  You held it for a year or two or three.  Can 
20 
you give me any indication like that? 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair.  No, I would not. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   H’m.  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us talk about saying that you would 
not necessarily have to invest it as soon as possible after 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 244 of 279 
 
the client has given you the money.  I wonder to what extent 
that is important or that is a valid point because as I 
understand it, if you are talking about five years.   
 
During that five years, that money is going to be subject 
to the volatility of the markets.  It can go down.  It can go 
up.  So why does it matter whether you...   
 
If you get the money now, from today from the client, 
whether you deposit it tomorrow or next week? Because in 
the end, during that five year period anything can happen.  
So why should you not deposit it immediately? 
10 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, how the forex trading analyses 
happens.  As I made an example of US/ZAR(?).  When I said 
in December 2017, one Dollar was R 11,47.  And I think in 
October, September, October this year, one Dollar was 
R 19,47 or R 19,80.   
 
So basically, what I would do, depending on the strategy 
that I am taking and if I feel I take a long-term strategy, then 
I would say, let me wait in this example of US/ZAR.   
 
I would say...  I knew that the Rand... the Dollar at some 
stage was R 19,80.  And then now as it is, the Dollar is 
20 
R 16,40.  Somewhere there, these days.   
 
And then I knew that in 2017 it was R 11,47.  So I can 
decide to say, I will only invest – I will only put the trading 
when it is – when the Rand is...   
 
Now I know that it is going down because it is coming 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 245 of 279 
 
from R 19,00 but I know that it is still going to go up and test 
the market.   
 
And therefore, I can decide that I put a pending order 
where the Dollar is R 19,50 and then maybe put, also 
depending order to buy when the Dollar – when one Dollar is 
R 11,47.   
 
Because I know, even if it is after three years, it is going 
to go down to R 11,00 and test the draft(?) and it will also 
test the highest.   
 
So, basically, if it is now sitting at R 16,00 I can decide 
10 
that I will not do anything until it is there where I will – I 
know that I will earn the biggest money.   
 
So basically, that is why am saying.  Unlike when you 
put money in the bank. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS KWINANA:   When you put money in the bank, you know 
that you will earn 10% per annum. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS KWINANA:   So the sooner you get that money and put it 
in the bank, the better. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS KWINANA:   But it does not happen like that with forex 
trading. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KWINANA:   So that is why they say forex trading 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 246 of 279 
 
requires a lot of patience.  You cannot just come in 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no, no.  That is fine.  
Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair.  So you received the 
R 2,5 million from Ms Hendricks and you have received the 
600 and...  Is it 600 first? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you cannot tell us now when you 
invested it first on the platform, correct? 
10 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   But it would...  Just help me with the 
mechanics.  It would need to be taken out of the account to 
facilitate it being invested on the platform.  Is that right? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   So if we could see when it was taken out 
of the account, it would then go onto the platform, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay.  So maybe the bank account will 
help us with that because she puts in two point five.  She 
20 
puts in six hundred-and-five.  We then have a total – if you 
go to page 117 – of about three point seven.  Then there is 
another credit.  And Ms Kwinana, just...  Nothing else is 
happening in this account, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 247 of 279 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  There is Ms Hendricks.  Two 
payments.  Sorry, then there is another – there is one with a 
description JM Aviation.  So now what happened?  Why is JM 
Aviation suddenly depositing money? 
MS KWINANA:   JM Aviation...  That was when Mr Ndzeku 
started to do the investment.  And he required exactly the 
same because he said – he promised me as that, as and 
when he has money he is going to invest.  So now, that is 
when he started to do his first investment. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  So despite his evidence that he 
10 
was investing earlier, is that right? 
MS KWINANA:   Pardon? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   His evidence was that he was investing 
earlier just through Ms Hendricks. 
MS KWINANA:   Oh. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But you do not know that? 
MS KWINANA:   I do not know that.  And as a result, I have 
been sending statements to Ms Hendricks. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Like hand delivering? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  Okay so then JM Aviation puts 
R 605 000,00.  Why was JM Aviation depositing if its 
agreement was with Mr Ndzeku? 
MS KWINANA:   He said to me, JM Aviation is paying him for 
is directorship. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 248 of 279 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then JM Aviation pays another amount 
at page 117 of R 600 000,00.  And then there is – that money 
is taken out of the account.  Right? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So that would then be, as I understood 
your evidence earlier, when it is invested.  Is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  So by that stage, you have got just 
Ms Hendricks and Mr Ndzeku’s money in this account. 
MS KWINANA:   H’m. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then you take it out and you invest it 
on the platforms, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   No, I did not take it out and invest it in the 
platform.  I took it out and invested it elsewhere whilst I was 
waiting for the market because now I am thinking that if the 
money is sitting here and there is an opportunity.  I also do 
like maybe property speculation.  Like, for instance, I go to 
auctions and then if there is a property that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not mean you took their money 
which they wanted you to invest in A and you took it and 
20 
invest in B?  You do not do that, do you? 
MS KWINANA:   No.  Remember Chair that they gave the 
confidence to say I can invest it in forex trading. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KWINANA:   And...  Yes, Chair.   
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 249 of 279 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But they did not say you can invest it 
...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair.  They said I can invest it in forex 
trading and in any investment that I deem necessary as long 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, is that what they said?  They added 
that as well? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not say that before. 
MS KWINANA:   That is also in their statements Chair. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Oh ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But you did not say that before. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No. 
MS KWINANA:   Oh, then let us add that Chair because 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
But 
also, 
you 
were 
talking 
about 
Mr Ndzeku.  You never said that you had that discussion with 
Ms Hendricks, did you? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No. 
MS KWINANA:   I had that discussion Chair. And in fact, with 
20 
all my client ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   With ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   And in fact Chair, with all my clients. 
CHAIRPERSON:   With Ms Hendricks? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, with...  I never met with Ms Hendricks 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 250 of 279 
 
but they know because the statement that we have is that we 
can invest in forex trading and in any other thing that we 
deem fit.  And in fact ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana, you said you had a 
discussion with them. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   This is what they said.  And you never 
said that about Mr Ndzeku before.  It is new.  If that is – if 
you are including Mr Ndzeku on – in that, in terms of such a 
discussion, that is new.  You did not say it before you...   
10 
 
Whatever you said, you said in regard to Mr Ndzeku with 
whom you had a discussion.  With whom you had a lot of 
interactions.  But not with Ms Hendricks as far as I 
remember. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, not with Ms Hendricks.  I never met 
with Ms Hendricks. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And you never had such a discussion 
with her? 
MS KWINANA:   I never had such a discussion with 
Ms Hendricks. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KWINANA:   However, Lunga knows that we invest in 
forex trading.  We invest property speculation.  We invest in 
venture capital.  Like, for instance, if a person has got a 
tender that he is unable to finance.  If we have money, we do 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 251 of 279 
 
that.  And then...  So basically, we invested in anything.  And 
in fact ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But Ms Hendricks never gave you that 
mandate in terms of your own evidence.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   H’m. 
MS KWINANA:   Okay.  The evidence, therefore, Chair 
should include the fact that with all our clients, they gave us 
or they are confident in us.  And then they gave us the 
leeway to say:  Invest in whatever you feel like investing in.  
But our main aim ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing] 
MS KWINANA:   Our main aim is the investment in forex 
trading, followed by the investment in properties. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right. 
MS KWINANA:   So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, it is just a problem with that.  Is that 
Mr Ndzeku’s evidence under oath before this Commission is 
that he wanted to hedge against the falling Rand and that is 
why he wanted investment in forex.  You do not hedge 
20 
against the falling Rand by buying properties.   
 
Ms Kwinana, the only basis that Mr Ndzeku, a supplier to 
SAA Technical at the time that he starts paying money into 
your account – his reason or doing so is that he wanted to 
trade in forex so that he could hedge against the falling 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 252 of 279 
 
Rand.   
 
You are now telling me that he entered into a contract 
with you that said you could invest in whatever you wanted 
including property that would stay in Rands.  Is that your 
version? 
MS KWINANA:   Let me repeat Chair.  My client gives me 
money ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Is your hand up or have you 
been covered? 
MS MBANJWA:   It is still up Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Yes? 
MS MBANJWA:   Yes, thank you Chair.  I just wanted to refer 
to a question that Ms Hofmeyr...  I agree with you Chair, 
when that question was asked, it was not concerning 
...[indistinct] [voice of speaker trails off and cannot be heard 
clearly.]   
 
But I just want to remind.  There was a question that 
Ms Hofmeyr asked the witness.  (S)he said, what was the 
nature of your mandate?   
 
And then she said she had a full discretionary mandate, 
20 
which according to my instruction, mean that because 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.  Do not say what it means.   
MS MBANJWA:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because you will now be ...[intervenes]  
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 253 of 279 
 
MS MBANJWA:   Assisting the client. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Assisting the witness. 
MS MBANJWA:   And before that, before that question.  The 
witness has said that she was investing in a number of 
things and then Ms Hofmeyr has said but the main thing was 
forex.  I am just putting a reminder to that.  Thank you, 
Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Indeed.  The record will show precisely 
the evidence that Ms Kwinana has given earlier today. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And what I am putting to you now is, your 
own description of what you were entitled to do with 
Mr Ndzeku’s 
money 
is 
inconsistent 
with 
Mr Ndzeku’s 
evidence to this Commission of why he gave you money.  Do 
you have a response to that? 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, I will stick to my evidence.  I will let 
Mr Ndzeku stick to his evidence.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   So what did you do with that R 4,3 million 
that was taken out of the account that we just saw? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   Not with the four point three Chair.  I added 
some money.  I think maybe a million.  And paid it over to the 
lawyers to buy the property that was, I think that was on 
auction. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Well, let us just stop.  Remember, four 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 254 of 279 
 
point three only comes from Ms Hendricks and JM Aviation. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Correct.  You said you added it to some 
money.  Is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   I added some money, yes.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Where did that other money come from? 
MS KWINANA:   Hmm.  I think...  Let me...  It came from 
Kwinana & Associates.  Ja.  Most probably from Kwinana and 
Associates. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It did not come from a supplier to SAA 
10 
Technical? 
MS KWINANA:   No. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You are certain about that? 
MS KWINANA:   Hundred percent. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay.  So you take four point three out.  
The you add some money, right? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Which did not come from a supplier to 
SAA Technical. 
MS KWINANA:   No. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It came from Kwinana & Associates, is 
that right? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, I think so. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay.  This is 2016, about September.  
And then you take those two amounts and you buy a 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 255 of 279 
 
property.  Is that what happened? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   And that was consistent with your mandate 
with Mr Ndzeku and Ms Hendricks.  Is that your version? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   What happened with that property that you 
bought? 
MS KWINANA:   I sold it and put back the money into Zano 
Spark. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
In 
whose 
name 
was 
the 
property 
10 
registered once it had been purchased? 
MS KWINANA:   I would not remember Chair.  But what we 
do to manage the risk.  If, for instance, you buy a property.  
You buy a property in another entity and then another 
property in another entity.   
 
So basically, the reason being that you want to – that is 
part of the risk management.  And therefore, the property will 
not be...   
 
And another thing.  These properties are for speculation 
purposes.  So the property is not going to stay long anyway.  
20 
So the registration of that property, basically, would be – 
would not be that material in terms of what you want to do.   
 
But I understand, maybe with you who is not speculating 
in properties, you would want to your property to be 
registered in your name.   
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 256 of 279 
 
 
But because we do not keep these properties for a long 
time.  And most of the times, you even tender for this 
property on auction.  And then, before it gets even 
registered, you have already sold it to the other person.   
 
So which means that the ownership has not even taken 
hands between you who have invested because it is has 
moved from one old owner to the new old owner.  So 
basically, that is how property speculation goes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So you brought property on auction?  Is 
that what you said? 
10 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   With the money? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes.  It is either Chair on auction or...  
Basically, that would either be on auction or would be 
dilapidated properties or maybe I would be phoned by the 
agent to say here is a person who is selling her property 
because (s)he needs money.   
 
Now, so the person is selling it at a good price because 
he wants to sell now.  So basically, it depends on when and 
how you get the property.   
20 
 
So sometimes it would be on auction.  Sometimes it 
would be on distressed property.  Sometimes it would be 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So you cannot remember which one it was 
with this particular property? 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 257 of 279 
 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KWINANA:   But I have since sold it and put back the 
money in Zano Spark.  And then from Zano Spark, when the 
market was right, I had to take it into the forex trading.   
CHAIRPERSON:   That property was never registered in the 
name of Kwinana & Associates? 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ja ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   Kwinana & Associates never ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Zano Spark, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Because that is the company we are 
now... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but it was a combination of money 
from Kwinana & Associates, is it not?  And money from Zano 
Spark. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes.  And money from Zano Spark. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it was not registered in the name of 
either? 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 258 of 279 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Was it ever registered...  And it was 
not registered in your name? 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And nor in your daughter’s name? 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair.  I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That there was no change in the 
ownership?  There was no transfer of ownership? 
MS KWINANA:   Ja, there was. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS KWINANA:   There was the transfer of ownership but 
10 
what I know – what I can still remember is that, it was not in 
the name of the two companies.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Was it in the name of another entity of 
your choice? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair it could be in another entity of 
my choice because I also manage many properties Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you used money that you took from the 
account of Zano ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   Spark. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...Spark.  And money from Kwinana & 
20 
Associates. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
And 
then 
bought 
this 
property 
...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   And speculate in forex. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 259 of 279 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  And then the property was registered 
in the name of some other entity ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...that you choice? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Was 
it 
an 
entity 
in 
which 
you 
...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   Yes ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...you had an interest? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, that would be an entity that I 
10 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That you had an interest? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would you have been the sole director or 
shareholder or member or would there have been others? 
MS KWINANA:   I think Chair it was not just – in a name of a 
trust but I do not know what is the name of the trust.  I would 
have to check that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you got many trusts which you – 
yourself? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And if it was...  Just a follow-up.  If it was 
a trust, there would be beneficiaries of that trust, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 260 of 279 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And the beneficiaries...  Because this is 
not your money, as I understand it. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   The beneficiaries of the trust would then 
appropriately 
be 
Ms Hendricks, 
Mr Ndzeku 
and 
maybe 
Kwinana & Associates.  Correct? 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair.  Because this is for speculative 
purposes.  That is why I am saying, I can register it in any 
name.  sometimes I even do not have to register it because 
it will exchange hands ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but a trust has to be registered, is it 
not?  And a trust will...  It is a requirement that there should 
be beneficiaries, is it not?  It is a legal requirement. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   The trust that you, in whose name this 
property was registered, who were the beneficiaries? 
MS KWINANA:   I would have to check that Chair which trust 
was that but definitely ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Was it a family trust? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.  But Chair, for the purposes of 
20 
speculation, it does not have to be registered.  And I can 
even buy a shell(?) company ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The trust you are talking about, you say 
was not registered? 
MS KWINANA:   No, the trust would be registered. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 261 of 279 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And you said the property was 
registered in the name of that trust? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes.  And then was also, when we sold it, 
when the time was right ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KWINANA:   ...it was registered in somebody else. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Well, if it went into...  If it was 
registered in the trust of a – in the name of a trust and then 
it was later then taken out, it would be interesting to know 
whether it was now a donation by the trust to somebody or 
10 
whether it was sold.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It might be quite a complicated thing. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How did it ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   It is not complicated. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How did it get removed from the trust?  
Was it...  Did the trust sell it?  Because once it was in the 
name of the trust, it was owned by the trust. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   H’m. 
20 
MS KWINANA:   Yes.  Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So how did it...  Was it sold to somebody 
or donated to somebody? 
MS KWINANA:   It is a simple accounting transaction Chair.  
When the trust ...[intervenes]  
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 262 of 279 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, before there is an accounting, there 
is a legal requirement. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you register a property in the name of a 
trust ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...that trust own that property. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   If now the trust is going to seize to be the 
owner of that property ...[intervenes]  
10 
MS KWINANA:   Then the trust ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   There is a legal transaction.  Either you 
sell the property or you donate the property.  I do not know if 
there is something else.  There is counsel looking.  You can 
advise me. [laughing] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I am stuck in sale and donate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]  So do you know if it was sold 
or donated? 
MS KWINANA:   Sold. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sold? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, when the trust...  That is why I am 
saying, it is simple when you put it in accounting terms.  
Because when the property is bought by the trust, the 
property gets registered in the name of a trust.  And then 
when the property is sold, the property is deregistered.   
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 263 of 279 
 
 
So basically, the accounting transaction there would be 
when the property gets into the trust, then you get that 
property.  Then you credit a creditor.  In this case 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing] 
MS KWINANA:   In this case, a creditor would be Zano Spark 
and Kwinana & Associates.  And then...  Yes.  And then now, 
when the property is sold, then you credit the property, you 
get the bank.  And then with the bank, you pay Zano Spark.  
You pay Kwinana & Associates and ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   You pay VAT, you pay all the taxes, 
transfers ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   You pay transfers.  Yes, all of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   If this was mister ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sure the purchase and sale 
agreement ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   Indeed, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That can be...   
MS KWINANA:   H’m. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, you see.  None of this you provided 
to the Commission before today.  Did you, Ms Kwinana? 
MS 
KWINANA: 
  Did 
you 
not get it from 
Mbanjwa 
Incorporated? 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 264 of 279 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, certainly not. 
MS KWINANA:   Did your investigator not get it from 
Mbanjwa?  I think they did get it from Mbanjwa Incorporated. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   The purchase of this property with the four 
point three million? 
MS KWINANA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, we have never until this moment in 
your evidence been told by you that you took the four point 
three million that Ms Hendricks and Mr Ndzeku invested with 
Zano Spark to buy a property.  You have never told us that.   
10 
MS KWINANA:   But I thought your investigation was 
following money and that is what exactly you were supposed 
to learn. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, no.  You were required to tell this 
Commission everything you know about the payments made.  
I will read you the directive from the Chairperson of this 
Commission.  The payments made to Aviation, Ms Hendricks 
or Mr Ndzeku to you in your personal capacity or to Zano 
Spark Ltd during the time that you served as a board 
member of SAA and SAA Technical and since then.  That is 
20 
a directive from the Chairperson of this Commission that 
asked you to tell him everything you know about that.   
You gave us four paragraphs, right?  One of those 
paragraphs I will tell you now is inconsistent with your 
evidence today – well, your revised evidence.  One of 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 265 of 279 
 
those paragraphs in your affidavit to this Commission in 
response to the Chairperson’s directive is: 
“The payments made by Ms Hendricks to Zano 
Spark was for investment purposes through forex 
trading.” 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, that is how you started.  Then your 
evidence moved to include property investment, other 
investments but here you say it is investment through forex 
trading.  So on your own version you could not take any of 
10 
her 3.1 million and put it in property, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   But money is in forex trading as we speak, 
that is why I am saying …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no, no, Ms Kwinana, do not run 
away from the question.  Ms Hofmeyr is saying to you, you 
have now told me that the money that Ms Hendricks gave 
you, you could use by investing it in property, it was not 
just forex trading only but she says in your affidavit you 
only talked about forex trading, you did not mention 
property, investment in property and she is therefore 
20 
saying what you said in the affidavit is inconsistent with 
what you are saying now.  What do you say about that? 
MS KWINANA:   Or maybe, Chair, what I should have said, 
therefore, is to say the money received from Ms Hendricks 
was ultimately invested in forex trading. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 266 of 279 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr?  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair, we are very close to the end.  I 
wonder if I can indicate why the balance of the 4.3 million 
that made up the additional million came from a supplier 
from SAA Technical and then we can… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It will be fairly quick. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay.  The way that we need to do that, 
Ms Kwinana, is – remember we saw in the Zano Spark 
10 
account that 4.3 or thereabouts went out.  Do you 
remember seeing that? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay.  So that, let me just get this right, 
actually does not go to you it goes to another account of 
Zano Spark.  Were you aware of that? 
MS KWINANA:   I cannot remember, Chair, maybe it is 
fine. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay, why did it have to go – it went to 
the business account, so it went from the main Zano Spark 
20 
account to a Gold business account and then to you.  Why 
did it need to go through those accounts? 
MS KWINANA:   I would have to check that, Chair, why 
would it have to go from one account to another. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It does not make sense, does it? 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 267 of 279 
 
MS KWINANA:   And in fact for me, if it goes from Zano 
Spark account to another Zano Spark account, really to me 
it is immaterial because it is two Zano Spark accounts. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right but on the same day it went to 
you, I am just querying why do you need to route it through 
two accounts? 
MS KWINANA:   I am sure there was some reason for that 
but considering that they were both Zano Spark accounts, 
for me it is really immaterial. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  Then let us just go to your 
10 
bundle, which is DD33, and there at page 67 …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which bundle is that? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   DD33, Chair, it is Ms Kwinana’s main 
bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS KWINANA:   Page? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   67.  That is a copy of – oh, sorry, Ms 
Kwinana, do you have it? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That is a copy of your own personal 
20 
bank account, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you see at the bottom of page 67 
you get a total of 5 234 400, is that right? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 268 of 279 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That is the one that comes from the 
Zano Spark business account. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay.  So then we need – because, 
remember, we only had 4.3 from Mr Ndzeku and Ms 
Hendricks but there is more here. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And I understood to be that is – what 
makes up the balance is something that came from 
Kwinana and Associates, correct? 
10 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  Okay but let us see actually where 
it came from.  So for that we need to go to page 78.  Okay, 
so what happens is now - there are so many bank 
accounts, it is very confusing.  Now we are in – let us start 
at 77, the Zano Spark savings account.  Okay.   
Business 
account, 
current 
account, 
savings 
account.  We are in the savings account, again not much 
movement, it seems it has a zero opening balance, do you 
see at page 78? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  And then do you see there is a 
payment on the 15 July that says loan and 29 July that 
says loan, do you see that? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 269 of 279 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So it is R700 000 loan and R119 000 
loan.  What were those loans for? 
MS KWINANA:   I would have to check, Chair, what were 
these loans for and where do they come from. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So you do not know about a loan of 
R819 000 that came into the company of which you and 
your daughter were the sole directors in July of 2016? 
MS KWINANA:   As I am sitting here, Chair, I do not 
remember it but definitely I would have to check the bank 
statements and see where it came from. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did you ever receive a loan from a 
supplier to SAA Technical? 
MS KWINANA:   A loan from a supplier from SAA 
Technical? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ja. 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, you could not really, could you, I 
mean you were the Chair of the board of SAA Technical, 
imagine a supplier is giving you a loan.  That would be 
highly irregular, would it not? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I would be even more irregular, I put to 
you, if a supplier was paying you money with no strings 
attached, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 270 of 279 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So those two amounts came into the 
savings account from an entity called Janicap(?).  Do you 
know what Janicap is? 
MS KWINANA:   Janiparts(?) belongs to Ms Ndileka 
Nobaxa.  Okay, what Ms Nobaxa did, she was also one of 
the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you just want to give the spelling for 
the name and the surname? 
MS KWINANA:   Ndileka N-d-i-l-e-k-a.  The surname is N-
o-b-a-x-a. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, I remember, Chair, Ndileka got an 
RFQ, she told me that she got an RFQ from SAA Technical 
and she wanted my …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And RFQ, request for quotation? 
MS KWINANA:   Quotation, yes.  And then now she got – 
she was awarded this RFQ and then she did not have 
money to finance this RFQ and I also did not have money – 
she came to me, we go together at church, and then she 
came to me to borrow the money.  She said she wanted 
20 
700 000.  There was an urgent supply.   
I did not have the money but what I said to her, I 
said there is a potential investor who indicated to me that 
he is also interested in forex trading and then I can – she 
must speak to him and then if it is my recommendation I 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 271 of 279 
 
will do that and she spoke to Mr Kolisi of BMK and then Mr 
Kolisi – of course, Ndileka …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   BMK, are those attorneys?  Is it a firm of 
attorneys? 
MS KWINANA:   BMK or BKM.  BMK, I think it is BMK. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, it is a firm of attorneys. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes.  So Ms Nobaxa called the CEO or MD 
of BMK, Mbuleli Kolisi, because it is Kolisi who indicated 
that he will have money to invest and then Ms Nobaxa 
10 
called and said she is referred to me, she has got this 
tender that she needed to service and therefore – and then 
Mr Kolisi called me and said do I know this person and 
then I said yes, I know, and then he said can I trust her 
and then  - because she seemed to be desperate because 
now when you got a tender and you are unable to service 
it, you will not get that opportunity .   
So Mr Kolisi gave her the 700 and then now when it 
was due for payment and in fact Ms Nobaxa I think when 
she called it was – maybe I think beginning of July.  When 
20 
she called me and said I do not have money, then she can 
go there.   
And then I said to Mr Kolisi if you can please assist, 
I trust her, she is – we go together in church and therefore 
she is not going to run away.  I also know where she lives 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 272 of 279 
 
and therefore she is not going to run away.  And then I said 
why do you not say – you send it to me, you are interested 
in investing and there is some money that you can invest, 
so you can give him that money and then Mr Kolisi gave 
her the money and then when the money was due for 
payment and in fact this money was paid on the 15 July, I 
think it did not even take 10 days or 15 days.   
Then Mr Kolisi said you need to pay that money for 
the investment and therefore, that is – and then now that is 
the 700, when you – this 700 basically, that is the money 
10 
that Mr Kolisi also invested and then now the 119, Mr Kolisi 
said I will give you the money plus interest.  So basically 
when Ms Nobaxa paid this money to me, it was on the 
instructions of Mr Kolisi because Ms Nobaxa had borrowed 
the money from him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the 119 000?  You said something 
about it? 
MS KWINANA:   The 119 is interest because he said I 
cannot just give out the money without an interest, so I am 
going  - in fact he also told me that he is going to charge – 
20 
he said he wanted to charge 30% and then I said oh 
shame, she is an emerging person, why do you not charge 
say 10% and then they reached a compromise of 17%.  So 
basically the 119 is the 17%. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So who actually paid the money into this 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 273 of 279 
 
account?  Who paid 700 000 into this account? 
MS KWINANA:   That is Ndileka. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say on the instructions of Mr Kolisi? 
MS KWINANA:   On the instruction of Mr Kolisi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And who paid R119 000? 
MS KWINANA:   That is also Ndileka paying interest on the 
700.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair, we are at five to six.  This is new 
to me so it is probably an appropriate time for us to take 
10 
the adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   We can investigate further and Ms 
Kwinana will be returning at some point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Subject to whatever further 
investigation may need to be done, I had in mind that I was 
going to check with all concerned whether there is a 
chance that we could have Ms Kwinana return for an 
evening session sometime this week but I say that fully 
aware that Ms Hofmeyr, you will have been standing the 
20 
whole day, so if you say no, it would be difficult, it is fine, 
but I also say that knowing that Ms Mbanjwa said tomorrow 
she is busy, so but it would be on the basis that it would be 
after or maybe five.  But we could look at next week but I 
would not like us to go too far, if possible.  What do you 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 274 of 279 
 
think, Ms Hofmeyr?  Maybe this week might be difficult? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It may be difficult but I am just 
wondering if we could get as sense of Ms Mbanjwa and Ms 
Kwinana’s availability for the remainder of the week, even 
maybe in the day.  I am not certain how long the evidence 
of the next witness would take so it may be possible that 
we could slot them in on …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Friday. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Friday or even Thursday.  My challenge 
is availability after this week is extremely difficult. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, it will difficult, ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So it would be helpful… 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you would prefer this week as well? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I do think so, yes.  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Yes, Ms Mbanjwa, how is your 
situation for the rest of the week? 
MS MBANJWA:   Chair, please, I do not want to be taken 
as being a bad person here, I have got a matter in court 
and then I am also drafting an application for leave to 
appeal and my days are running out.  So this week during 
20 
the day is totally out for me but I know that I need to 
accommodate the Commission.  So I can maybe look – I do 
not know on a Friday, is Friday evening bad for the 
Commission? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I can sit – we can have – from my side 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 275 of 279 
 
we can have an evening session on Friday. 
MS MBANJWA:   I think then that evening would help and I 
really do not – I am not prepared, of course subject to the 
Chairperson.  I am not being rude but I do not want to be 
told that we should come here and then after the other 
witness because I believe that the witness is Dudu Myeni.  
And then I wait for her to be finished because I must put it 
on record, Chair, I was very bitter about the last time I was 
asked to come here when Ms Memela was testifying. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MS MBANJWA:   Because what happened is we were told, 
even when we were on the way, that we must rush, we 
must be here at nine and we rushed, we were here at nine.  
Then when we were on our way we were told that please, 
do not miss nine o’clock.  We arrive here, then the first 
thing I say to Ms Hofmeyr because I see there is a witness 
there.  I said but were we being pressurised when it is 
known that there is another witness? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MBANJWA:   because this is not correct.  And then all 
20 
that Ms Hofmeyr said, I said I will complain to the Chair.  
She said go make your complaint and not even an apology.  
And then, as you know, Chair, we sat here the whole day 
and I did not receive an apology and that is not the way we 
normally get treated even by Justice of the High Court.   
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 276 of 279 
 
If there is a problem with time – and I am just an 
attorney, I am not an important person, but there is always 
an apology to say sorry about the issue of time, I cannot 
accommodate you, those who [indistinct – far from mic]  So 
during Ms Myeni I am really not prepared.  In the evening, 
because I know it is my duty to cooperate with the 
Commission, I am prepared to avail myself.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, no, no, that is fine.  I think that 
it is important that if at all possible we should do it in the 
evening.  How is Friday evening for you, Ms Hofmeyr? 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That should be fine, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That should be fine.  Okay, should we - 
Ms Kwinana, is that fine with you? 
MS KWINANA:   Can we do it on weekend, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MS KWINANA:   Can we do it on weekend, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are not available on Friday evening? 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you would be available on Saturday 
if we were to sit on Saturday? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
MS MBANJWA:   I would also be available, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You would also be available? 
MS MBANJWA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr?  I do not know about my 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 277 of 279 
 
own situation but I will just check …[intervenes] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, I do not actually either.  I am going 
to have to possibly just make an enquiry.  The weekend will 
be difficult for me, I can see if I can move certain things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What about Thursday evening this week, 
Ms Mbanjwa?  Is that difficult for you? 
MS MBANJWA:   It is difficult, Chair, because what I 
intended to do – I need to file the application for leave to 
appeal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, so you wanted to work on that? 
10 
MS MBANJWA:   I was hoping – it is a pity because I just 
had 
two 
urgent 
applications 
[inaudible 
– 
speaking 
simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, that is fine.  That is fine.  Ms 
Kwinana, if Saturday is going to be difficult – I said I am 
not sure about my own situation about Saturday but I 
appreciate that everybody is trying to see how we can 
accommodate one another.  Is your Friday evening – would 
there be any chance that you might be able to move things 
on  Friday evening? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   It is not possible, Chair, on Friday.  I can 
also avail myself on Sundays. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You can avail yourself anytime during 
the weekend? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 278 of 279 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, that is appreciated. 
MS MBANJWA:   And what we can also just say, Chair, 
because I think there is a lady – I think she is Ms 
Chennell, though I do not normally look at what – but if 
they send me a message, we can arrange anything next 
week in the evening, we will really try because we know we 
need to finish. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I know you were saying, Ms Hofmeyr, 
you know that beyond this week it is going to be difficult 
for you, is it completely impossible or you could work on 
10 
something? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It is a bit more impossible than the 
weekend, so I think I would be better placed to move 
things around on the weekend if your position was such, 
Chair, that we could take a Saturday morning slot. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But I will make plans.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So if the weekend is not convenient for 
you, Chair, then I will see what I can do next week. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Well, I think that – because I am 
also keen that we try and finalise, I think that I will try and 
make a plan about Saturday.  Maybe let us work on the 
basis that let us continue on Saturday morning. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And at what time, Chair, would be 
03 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 297 
 
Page 279 of 279 
 
convenient? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it fine if we start at half past nine? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Certainly from my side. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would that be fine? 
MS MBANJWA:   It is fine with me, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana? 
MS KWINANA:   It is fine, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It will be fine.  Okay, let us say we will 
continue in this venue on Saturday, this coming Saturday 
at half past nine. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  So we are going to 
adjourn for the day but otherwise we are adjourning Ms 
Kwinana’s evidence to Saturday at half past nine. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   We are indebted, thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.
