ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Mr Mahlobo you have before you 
and you will be assisted through the documentation by one 
of the commission investigators your own affidavit which 
appears in Bundle SSA2 at page 737.  It is Exhibit YY13 in 
Divider 3.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Well I am okay.  You can proceed 
20 
because I have got my affidavit. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes I would… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is Bundle SSA bundle 1 which is has 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 6 of 261 
 
got Exhibit YY1 and then there is SSA bundle 2.  I think it 
is Bundle 2 that – in which we find Mr Maholobo’s affidavit. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  In that affidavit it will be part of 
Exhibit YY13. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If you would go please Mr Mahlobo 
to page 737 of SSA02.   
CHAIRPERSON:  753? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  737. 
CHAIRPERSON:  737. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Is there an investigator of the 
commission with you Sir? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Yes they are here – they are 
around. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright well they should assist you 
20 
then please in putting that document before you.  You have 
it before you? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  No I do have it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You do have it?  Sorry I did not 
hear that. 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 7 of 261 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes he says he does have it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  No he does have it. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Yes I. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you.  Do you recognise the 
document at page 737?  Is that your affidavit? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  That document was filed by my 
attorneys. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes and if you go to page… 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Through the Secretariat of the 
State Capture Commission. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Do you – if you go to page 
758 is that your signature there? 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the signature above the word 
Deponent – there are two signatures. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  The signature there it is my 
signature. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  And you are you satisfied. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  That is my signature. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That as far as you are concerned 
the contents of this affidavit are true and correct? 
20 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Yes, yes, yes Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You have before you three files Mr 
Mahlobo the one file we have just referred to is Exhibit 
YY2 or Bundle YY2.  You are also have and you will be 
shown excerpts from that file in due course – not the whole 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 8 of 261 
 
file Exhibit YY1 and then there is a third folder which forms 
parts of Exhibit YY13 and will be incorporated into the 
bundle in due course of additional redacted affidavits and 
transcripts.  We will deal with those piecemeal in due 
course. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  I do. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Now a matter we should clear up at 
the outset is there an classified material in your affidavit 
and I refer in particular to certain passages dealing with 
operational directives – paragraphs 19.1 and 19.2.  I raise 
10 
this just… 
MINISTER 
MAHLOBO: 
 
There 
is 
no 
matter 
that 
is 
classified. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 Alright 
so 
those 
operational 
directives in paragraph 19.1 and 10.2 are not classified?  
We may refer to them and in due course put (speaking over 
one another). 
MINISTER 
MAHLOBO: 
 
Those 
paragraphs 
– 
those 
paragraphs are not classified because – because they do 
not give you the actual contents that you will find in the 
20 
directives.  Remember the law you cannot publish them in 
a gazette. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Well you have placed them 
in the affidavit.  Your evidence is they are not classified 
nevertheless we will take the precaution of checking that 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 9 of 261 
 
further before anything is put up on the public website but 
for the moment our understanding is that you may testified 
to those and we will get there in due course.   
 
Before we get to the contents of your affidavit just 
to place your own position in its context.  I understand that 
between 2005 and 2008 Minister Kasrils was the Minister 
of State Security is that what you recollect? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Well I do not understand you to say 
I must put it in my own context.  Is there going to be an 
opportunity through you Chair where one would be able to 
10 
make some few remarks and then – so that we can deal 
with the issues that were part of the summons that they 
issued to me through your office? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well  
1. If you have a written statement that you would like to 
read out before we proceed with your evidence I 
would need to see it first to see whether it does not 
implicate anybody who would complain that somebody 
gave 
evidence 
about 
them 
that 
implicates 
them 
without Rule 3.3 Notices being given to them.  If – so 
20 
I will not allow it until I have seen it.  You know.   
So If I know that I have not been given at least I am not 
aware that I have been given anything.  So it may be that if 
you have it as something that I can look at during the 
break and at some stage before you end your evidence you 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 10 of 261 
 
might then get that opportunity. 
 
If you do not have a statement that you want to 
read out but you have remarks to make it becomes more of 
a challenge because we do not know what you are going to 
say until you say it. 
 
But I see you seem to have some document – do 
you have a statement that you wanted to read? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Well Your Excellence Chair I want 
to make short remarks and we will find a way to transmit 
them. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  But I assure you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Because I have taken an oath. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Not only this oath. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  And I am very sensitive to matters 
of intelligence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  I will not mention people’s names. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  But it is a short remark. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is a – yes.  But you say it is in the form 
of a document? 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 11 of 261 
 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  You say it is in the form of a document? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Yes I have a small two pager 
document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  But not – not this thing that I am 
going to say that there are outside some of the offending 
remarks on my affidavit but I wanted to place something 
just for your reference. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  If – if… 
10 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Without wasting time because I 
know the commission is running out of time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  But I can assure you I will not 
divulge any information, any name, any information that 
can tend to give a name of any person. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Or – both an organisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  That the 00:13:06 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay if you are not going to... 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  I am very cognisant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you are not going to mention anybody’s  
name or organisation or entity in – by way of implicating 
them Mr Pretorius what is your attitude.  I think I could 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 12 of 261 
 
allow it if he gives me that assurance? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I am not sure what the Minister 
wants to say so I would not be able to – if it is a matter of 
controversy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Then – whether names are given or 
not is not an issue that requires an answer we would prefer 
to see it in writing so that we could prepare a proper… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to be sure. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Proper answer;. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Mr Mahlobo  I see there is no signal. 
MINISTER 
MAHLOBO: 
 
Chairperson 
(speaking 
in 
vernacular) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  I can hear you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you can hear me? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Chairperson I do not want us to 
take – Ja I can hear you Chair.  I do not want us to take 
long. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  I have made an undertaking and I 
am not going to break the undertaking and if I break any 
undertaking you are empowered to call me into order 
00:14:36. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – but you say you assure me … 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 13 of 261 
 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  It is a small.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will not implicate anybody and you 
will not mention anybody’s name or entity, is that correct? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Definitely no – Definitely I will not 
do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay do you need two minutes, three 
minutes, how much do you need?  Five minutes? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Give me three minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Three minutes.  Okay I will allow you. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Thank – thank you very much. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Three minutes ja.  Okay. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Your Excellence Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  We do not seem to at the 
moment… 
CHAIRPERSON:  We do not see you at the moment. 
MINISTER 
MAHLOBO: 
 
Chair 
– 
Your 
Excellency 
Chairperson.  Pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am saying we do not have your picture 
on the screen. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  I can proceed Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the moment but if you can proceed it 
is fine.  Oh – oh you do not appear in one screen but you 
appear in another one.  You can proceed ja. 
MINISTER 
MAHLOBO: 
 
Well 
thank 
you 
very 
much 
Chairperson and to Mr Pretorius and the other colleagues 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 14 of 261 
 
from the commission.   
 
Firstly we just want to – to thank you including my 
legal team to thank you that you have invited us here to 
come and assist the commission and – because one has a 
responsibility to do so but it is going to be important that 
before we go to certain issues (inaudible) this thing by the 
decision of my movement which is the ANC it is 00:16:27 
irrespective of the positions seated by the President we 
are going to cooperate with the commission. 
 
Well Chairperson there are certain difficulties that I 
10 
will indicate through Mr Pretorius when we engage some of 
the challenges 
we experience about – administrative 
challenges in the commission when it came to issues that 
we needed to come to deal with it here but I want to 
indicate that I have made the time – I have given – you 
could see that even in the information submitted here 
today there is even information that is not even on the 
Rule 3.3 Notices but may – in as much as it might be that 
particular case I will not be in a position to shy away from 
responding to these issues. 
20 
 
On record I need to indicate that Chair I have 
looked at all the documents that are given and I want to 
indicate that I will try to help as much as possible 
especially because as a person who was a – a member of 
the Executive – National Executives I took an oath.  And 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 15 of 261 
 
there are certain issues that I will be able to divulge to the 
commission to the best of my ability.   
 
There will also be certain limitations Chair where 
matters would seem to be able to indirect or direct – do 
you want me to divulge secrets that are entrusted to me.  I 
am very conscious of that Chair because I had an 
opportunity to be assisted while I was in employ to be 
properly trained on matters of intelligence and I was very 
fortunate that I have gone to Europe, East Asia including in 
Africa.  I have a fair idea on how intelligence operates so 
10 
that by my own appearance here I should not actually 
compromise 
the 
work 
of 
the 
commission 
but 
also 
unintentionally break the law. 
 
But at the very same time also ensuring that the 
terms of the law around issues of national security and 
national intelligence are protected deal with the issues 
Chair that even an appearance of the person like me today 
will not only draw interests here at home but will also even 
draw an interest abroad. 
 
Despite some of the issues that my legal team 
20 
00:19:15 with your team but I am saying I am here to 
account to the best of my ability.  You have my full support 
but if there are issues that I am uncomfortable with during 
the course of the engagement I would request your 
indulgence to indicate so so that we are within the 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 16 of 261 
 
parameters on how intelligence works and how the laws of 
the country but without trying to hide matters that bothers 
to criminality. 
 
Those are the words that I wanted to convey to Your 
Excellence – team – Chair to be on record and I hope I 
have managed to keep my trueness not to divulge any 
names or bodies or institutions or methodology that can 
compromise matters of national security. 
 
Thank you very much [?]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No thank you very much Mr Mahlobo we – 
10 
you certainly kept your promise in that regard.  Thank you 
for that.  I just want to assure you that the commission 
also appreciates the sensitivity of matters relating to 
intelligence and that as the commission hears evidence it 
is alive to the intricacies of intelligence.    
 
Obviously the commission will also not want to be in 
breach of any law itself nor will it want any witness to be in 
breach of – of the law and certainly matters of criminality 
should not be swept under the carpet so that – that is quite 
important. 
20 
 
But I also want to mention to you because you did 
say that you noticed that there are some documents that 
might not have been included in the Rule 3.3 Notice to you 
that you may be asked about and you indicated that you 
would do your best to assist and deal with them. 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 17 of 261 
 
 
I just want to assure you that the commission 
remains very committed to fairness to everybody and we – 
we will keep on trying to make sure that there is fairness to 
you as well. 
 
Where there are serious challenges articulate them, 
we will look at them and where decisions need to be taken 
they will be taken but certainly there is no intention to 
ambush you or to ambush any witness so there will be an 
attempt to try and make sure that there is no unfairness to 
you. 
10 
 
Where it is necessary that you get more time in 
order to deal with certain issues that can be explored 
within the constraints of the commission in terms of time.  
But thank you very much.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV ADONISI:  Chair sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ADONISI:  I just – can I just take this opportunity to 
clear something out on – on some grammatical errors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ADONISI:  Which I had hoped my client would 
20 
address when he was addressing… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV ADONISI:  The – or making his opening remarks.  
Chair I know an affidavit would have to be amended by a 
supplementary. 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 18 of 261 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ADONISI:  However we have noted that this of the 
limited time work that we had to compile. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV ADONISI:  Necessary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ADONISI:  And there were some grammatical errors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ADONISI:  And there were also some incorrect 
mentioning of a name. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ADONISI:  In particular of a witness that has given a 
Rule 3.3 Notice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV ADONISI:  And there has been an accepted to your 
name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV ADONISI:  For record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ADONISI:  May I also with the permission and 
20 
indulgence of my colleague direct you to page 15.  Sorry 
paragraph 50 of the affidavit on YY15 (inaudible) has 
already been placed on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Paragraph 15? 
ADV ADONISI:  Paragraph 50. 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 19 of 261 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  50. 
ADV ADONISI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of Mr Mahlobo’s affidavit? 
ADV ADONISI:  That is correct Chair.   Chair you will note 
that there are names relating to 3.3 Notices in there.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh those names should not have been 
mentioned is that right? 
ADV ADONISI:  No these are pseudo names - some of 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh they are – these are pseudo names? 
10 
ADV ADONISI:  Some are indeed the name of a – I think 
just one or two they are the names – the real names of the 
witness and they – these are not protected witnesses – one 
has 00:24:54.  But an incorrect name of a pseudo name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV ADONISI:  Originally it was in the 3.3 Notice used as 
Sharon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV ADONISI:  However with the proceedings that of 
yesterday it was accepted that Sharon should be 00:25:00 
20 
replaced with – so that my – my client can also note that – 
ja because he was not made aware of these particulars.  
So it is that Chair that I wanted to really bring other than 
the grammatical errors that will be progressively amended 
Chair with your permission with the witness himself.  
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 20 of 261 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  No thank you.   
ADV ADONISI:  And – yes Chair otherwise I do not want to 
really bother the Chair and with the time constraints … 
CHAIRPERSON:  With small things ja. 
ADV ADONISI:  Ja with the other administrative (speaking 
over one another). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine. 
ADV ADONISI:  Thank you Chair. 
ADV VUMBI:  Chair with your permission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV VUMBI:   Chair we represent Dorothy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VUMBI: And we do note the submissions and we 
accept same to proceed accordingly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Do you want just to place 
yourself on record – you might have done so previously. 
ADV VUMBI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you maybe do so again. 
ADV VUMBI: Chair it is Advocate Vumbi I am on instruction 
on brief from P G Matseka Attorneys. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  
ADV VUMBI:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius I wonder whether maybe 
during the break there should be a redaction or something 
on this paragraph or  
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 21 of 261 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We will do so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I am just – I am just concerned as that 
– as long as it remains here you know one is not 
compatible. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We will do that Chair. 
ADV VUMBI:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  You heard already Mr 
Pretorius confer – got Mr Mahlobo to confirm that this is 
10 
his affidavit.  Do you – are you asking me to admit it as an 
Exhibit?  His affidavit? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  He has done so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  We did not admit it as an Exhibit as 
yet.  Do you want me to admit it as an Exhibit? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes please Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What exhibit should it be? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Exhibit YY13. 
CHAIRPERSON:  YY13. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The page is 737. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  SSA2 and following. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes the affidavit of Mbangiseni David 
Mahlobo which starts at page 737 of SSA Bundle 2 will be 
admitted as an exhibit and will be marked as Exhibit YY13.  
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 22 of 261 
 
Okay alright.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Perhaps – may I proceed Chair?  
Perhaps Mr Mahlobo we can go back to the timeline and 
just by way of introduction to this series of questions I can 
just explain to the Chair and to yourself that your ministry 
took place in the context of a series of events that not only 
preceded but followed your occupancy of the ministry of 
State Security and in order to understand the context of 
the evidence that you will give and the time during which 
you occupied the ministry it is necessary to put this 
10 
timeline on record. 
 
So if you would just bear with us for the moment.  
2005 to 2008 Minister Kastrils was the Minister of State 
Security, you recall that? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  I recall. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Then from 2000 – sorry had you 
finished? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  (Inaudible) the Minister that I will 
not – I did not know that he was the Minister to the 
particular 00:29:33.

CHAIRPERSON:  One second Mr Pretorius.  This screen 
here or the technicians is it not possible to make sure it 
works?  Somebody maybe could it - if they can attend to it 
without us adjourning.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, the sound from the remote 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 23 of 261 
 
facility is not ideal as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So it is maybe necessary to ask 
Mr Mahlobo to repeat some answers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Also, the technicians could look at 
the sound. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Perhaps we could clear that up in 
the next five minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If we are granted a short 
10 
adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It will save time in the long run. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, we will take a short 
adjournment to give the technicians time to deal with this 
matters.  We hope five minutes will be enough.  We 
adjourn.

INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Pretorius. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair.  We have 
attempted to improve the signal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The screen is now operational. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 24 of 261 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But I must say that it may be that 
during the course of evidence, the signal deteriorates 
again and we might have to make some other arrangement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But for the present...  Mr Mahlobo, 
can you hear me? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mahlobo, can you hear us? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Chairperson, I can hear you.  But 
if Mr Pretorius can try to manage when he is standing 
10 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   That every time when he put...  
Can you hear me, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   We can hear you. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I am making a request through 
you, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   That Mr Pretorius need to help me 
so that he does not get ...[indistinct].  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   That he tries to speak to the mic, 
even if he tries to refer to his notes but he must not lose 
the mic because when he loses the mic ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You cannot hear him. 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 25 of 261 
 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Understood Mr Mahlobo.  I will do 
my best. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   But...  You know, I was just saying 
to the question of the ...[indistinct] or on the mic.  He must 
not lose the mic. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja-no, no.   
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He will try.  Ja.  Okay alright. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  And if there is anything 
that is unclear in any question that I ask, please, do not 
hesitate, Mr Mahlobo, to ask me to repeat the question.  Is 
that in order? 
MINISTER 
MAHLOBO: 
 
 
I 
will 
definitely 
do 
that 
Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Mr Mahlobo.  To 
continue the timeline then, between 2008 and 2014, 
Minister Cwele was the Minister of State Security.  We 
heard evidence in related to State Security that occurred 
20 
during that period.   
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Yes, and I guess the time that you 
give is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And then you occupied the position 
of Minister of State Security during the period 2014 to 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 26 of 261 
 
2017.  Is that correct?  That is in accordance with your 
statement. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Let us put it accurately.  So on 
25 May 2014 until to the 16 t h of October 2017.  I want 
those dates to be on record, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  We will get to your affidavit 
where they are, indeed on record and that detail.  And 
then, after your period of ministry, the position was 
occupied by Minister Bongo between 2017 and 2019.  Is 
that correct? 
10 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We have a message on screen that 
your internet connection is unstable.  Did you hear the 
question? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   No, I could not hear the question.  
You said the next minister after me ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Was Minister Bongo ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   It was - it was Mr Bongani Bongo. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, 2017 to 2019? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   No, that is not correct.  It cannot 
20 
be 2019. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think it was Ms Letsatsi-Duba in 2018 
or – if I am not mistaken.   
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Just get the records correct.  It 
should have been 2018, around February because there 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 27 of 261 
 
was a Cabinet, a reshuffling(?) that happened on the 
26 t h of February 2018.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Thank you for that 
correction.  In any event, you were followed in the ministry 
by Minister Bongo.  Is that correct? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  And between 2005 and 2010, 
Mr Arthur Fraser was the DDG of Operations in the SSA.  
Am I correct in that regard, as far as you recall? 
MINISTER 
MAHLOBO: 
 
 
What... 
 
I 
never 
checked 
10 
Chairperson who was in the employ in the Intelligence 
Services before I got into office. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I will not go to that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And then, I can just put it to you 
for your comment if you wish.  In January 2010, our 
investigators 
tell 
us 
that Arthur 
Fraser 
resigned 
his 
position.  Do you know of that? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   It will be presumptuous of me 
Chair to comment on a matter I do not have details. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  And then in September – 
we will come to the point of the questions in due course – 
but in September 2016, was he appointed by you as 
Director General of SSA? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   No, it is very clear Chairperson.  
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 28 of 261 
 
In terms of the Constitution and the Intelligence Law, the 
appointing authority in terms of the head of the service or 
the Director-General is by the President of the Republic 
who was national – who was the Head of the National 
Executive or the Commander in Chief, in terms of law.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  May I rephrase it then?  
Whilst you were Minister of State Security, Arthur Fraser 
was appointed as Director General.  Would that be more 
accurate, as far as you are concerned? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   It would be partially correct.  You 
10 
need to add and say Arthur Fraser was appointed for His 
Excellency, the President of the Republic as the Director 
General.  That becomes complete statement. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Thank you.  Before you 
took office, approximately, from 2008 to 2010 there existed 
a principle agent network often referred to as Pan 1.  Were 
you aware of that fact when you took office? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Except media reports that I cannot 
speak about. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  But whether through media 
20 
reports or otherwise, you were aware of the existence of 
the principle agent network? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I am aware in terms of those 
media reports of the allegations of the existence of that 
programme. 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 29 of 261 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Well, we know and we are 
told by our investigators that Pan 1 was investigated 
internally within the State Security Agency and a report 
was 
made 
to 
Minister 
Cwele, 
approximately, 
in 
November 2010.  Do you know of that? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   No, I only know when my – the 
time I became a Minister when I received the report from 
the office of the Inspector-General. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   But there is an indication that 
10 
there was a request by former minister to investigate the 
programme in terms of the law where the Inspector General 
must investigate any matter that is either referred to by His 
Excellence the President of the Republic or by the Minister 
or by the ...[indistinct] Committee of Intelligence or by the 
party. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  Our investigations also 
inform us that at least two persons were implicated in the 
report made to Minister Cwele in serious wrongdoing and 
those two persons were Mr Arthur Fraser and a Mr Engel, 
20 
e-n-g-e-l.  Are you aware of those facts or were you aware 
of those facts when you took office? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Mr Pretorius, let me help you.  I 
do not want to speculate.  I do not have a... [break in 
transmission] 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 30 of 261 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think he is frozen. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   ...somewhat mislead the panel on 
a document that is not in front of me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   But when you want to discuss... 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
I 
am 
sorry 
Minister 
Mahlobo 
...[intervenes]  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Yes, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  While you were speaking, 
your picture froze and I do not whether, when it froze, you 
10 
were speaking but we could not hear you or whether you 
were not speaking.  I think you might have to repeat what 
you were saying. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I hope I am not... [speaking 
vernacular] Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Well, I see that when I just ask 
you to repeat, the screen goes black, Mr Mahlobo.  So let 
us try again.  Just say what you said again. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, sorry.  It ...[intervenes]  
20 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I am saying to Mr Pretorius, 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   If you can hear me Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, we can hear you. 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 31 of 261 
 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Chairperson, I am saying for your 
record, Chairperson.  What Mr Pretorius is proposing, as in 
the report, I am not in a position to say yes or no because 
that report by the Inspector-General is not in front of me as 
we speak right now.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   But I will be able to assist 
Mr Pretorius because I could see... [speaking vernacular] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Yes, I will be able to speak at the 
10 
time to say when you received the 10.4, what did you do?  
That is where I will help Mr Pretorius but the other issues 
are [speaking vernacular].  I might not assist him that 
much because I do not want to mislead you and I do not 
want to mislead the counsel.  But as I am saying, I will not 
say who was actually been said to have done a wrongdoing 
or no wrongdoing without refreshing my mind.  Remember, 
Chair, I held Intelligence as a Minister.  It is nearly four 
years ago now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Well ...[intervenes]  
20 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   But I will help him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Well, Mr Mahlobo, you are not the 
first witness to include their mother tongue when they are 
testifying in English.  Others have done so, but it does 
create some challenges because we do not have an 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 32 of 261 
 
interpreter at hand.  So do your best to make sure that you 
speak English. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I will refrain from using my 
language. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think.  Mr Pretorius, for what it is 
worth.  When Minister Mahlobo referred to use isiZulu to 
say... [speaking vernacular].  I think that means, you were 
laying a foundation for questions to come later. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Indeed, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So he was saying, he will not be able to 
assist you while you lay the foundation but he will assist 
you when you ask him directly on certain issues later.  
Minister Mahlobo, is that what you meant? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   You are absolutely correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Well, let us move above 
ground level then immediately Mr Mahlobo.  When you took 
office or before you took office or after you took office, 
20 
were you briefed on the Pan 1 Report? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Well, Chairperson, I will be weary 
to use the word Pan 1, what, what, what.  But what I want 
to place it on record.  In as much as I do not have the 
documents here right now...  [break in transmission – 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 33 of 261 
 
speaker unclear] ...the then Minister in 2014 – in 2014 or 
from the 25 t h(?) of May, I was ...[indistinct] that my 
predecessor did the handover.  In other words, to brief me 
of issues.   
 
But I must also qualify.  The issues I needed to 
know and once I am in Intelligence, there are things that 
you need to know and there are things that they will not 
give it to you because they are governed by the rules of 
confidentiality or secrecy.  The issue of Pan was one of 
those 
that 
was 
brought 
to 
my 
attention 
and 
I 
was 
10 
...[indistinct] but.. [interruption in transmission] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hey, this technology is really giving us 
problems today. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   ...in the office.  They are able to 
give me the reports.  I can hear you, Chair.  Can you hear 
me?  
CHAIRPERSON:   We can hear you but your picture froze 
for a few seconds earlier and we could not hear. 
MINISTER 
MAHLOBO: 
 
 
I 
will 
repeat 
... 
[speaking 
vernacular] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   [Indistinct] captured the one about 
handover? 
CHAIRPERSON:   We did, but I think Mr Pretorius has a 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 34 of 261 
 
suggestion. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  Well, one suggestion might 
be we persuade Minister Mahlobo to attend the hearing in 
person. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If that is possible.  We will take all 
the necessary steps. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The other possibility is to ensure 
that the place from which Mr Mahlobo gives evidence has 
10 
an adequate internet connection with the venue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I say so, because the detail and 
the 
wording 
of 
questions 
and 
answers 
may 
become 
relevant and one cannot have a situation where we do not 
hear an answer or an answer is not properly on record or 
there is some misunderstanding in communication. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is very important that this 
evidence be accurately and thoroughly recorded. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you not too far from where we are 
Mr Mahlobo?  Is there a chance that we could adjourn and 
you could come to the venue and give evidence in person 
in order to avoid these technical problems? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I am in Pretoria, Chair. 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 35 of 261 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, from Pretoria to here should take 
about, what, an hour or so?  We would be prepared to 
adjourn and – for that time, because these technical 
problems are just becoming more and more intolerable.  
Would that be fine with you? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Yes, Chairperson, because I do 
not 
have 
another 
time 
to 
deal 
with 
these 
matters 
including... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   ...[indistinct] reason.  But I do not 
10 
want it to be an obstructing to your work.  You can – the 
guys that you sent here from the team because they are 
from the Security Services.  Let us be fair(?).  Oh, I must 
be careful... [speaking vernacular] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  You are not allowed to break 
the law Mr Mahlobo. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   [Speaking vernacular] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]   
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What, quarter to twelve? 
20 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Let us...  I want to finish today. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   [Indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So what, half-past eleven? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Chair, ja, half-past eleven let us 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 36 of 261 
 
resume. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  No, that is fine.   
MINISTER 
MAHLOBO: 
 
 
Okay 
but 
...[intervenes] 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you very much.  Okay thank 
you.  You can get onto the road.  That is fine.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  
ADV ADONISI:   Okay.  No, no Chair.  There were two 
options provided but I think it seems like there is 
concerns(?) as with the witness ...[indistinct]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]   
ADV ADONISI:   Because the reason why he agreed like(?) 
it(?) was true but I heard my colleague saying there are 
precautions that will be taken. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV ADONISI:   And ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I have already informed my 
...[indistinct] 
comrade(?) 
...[indistinct] 
[break 
in 
transmission – speaker not clear.] 
ADV ADONISI:   Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay ...[intervenes]  
ADV ADONISI:   So I think there is no big(?) issue(?) 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   It is an obligation. 
ADV ADONISI:   Otherwise...  Because I was going to 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 37 of 261 
 
suggest of the second option of him relocating into his 
house, closer to his – his, probably, route because that – 
the second option my colleague proposed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh ...[intervenes]  
ADV ADONISI:   But it seems ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just wait for the first one, ja. 
ADV ADONISI:   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV ADONISI:   If my client is comfortable ...[indistinct] 
...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, he is – I think he is comfortable.  
Because we do not want to try another one and find that 
one is also problematic. 
ADV ADONISI:   Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So if he can come here straightaway, 
that is much more helpful.   
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Chair ...[indistinct] 
ADV ADONISI:   [laughs]   
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.   
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   [Indistinct]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but I think you can get onto the 
road, Mr Mahlobo.  We will adjourn just now.  Your counsel 
was 
just 
mentioning 
– 
was 
talking 
about 
the 
other 
alternative but we – I think we agreed that the best thing is 
for you to get onto the road and be here at half-past 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 38 of 261 
 
eleven. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I will be there at quarter to twelve. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I should be there before quarter to 
twelve. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Okay alright. 
ADV ADONISI:   Chair, I am being rejected by my 
colleague ...[indistinct] to ask you indulgence to address 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who is that? 
10 
ADV ADONISI:   He will place himself on record. 
ADV ADONISI:   Chair, I did not place myself on record 
because we did not anticipate that we will be heard today.  
I am – the name is Raplane(?) Goredira(?) [phonetically] 
from Goredira Diamond(?) Incorporated [00:20:56].  I 
represented Dr Fraser, Graham Engel and a number of 
people.  And from the last question, it appears that some 
of my clients may be implicated.   
 
For the record, we have not received any notice 
with regards to today’s proceedings and we just need to 
20 
place that on record.  And for that matter, to the extent that 
I am here and maybe perceived that we condone the failure 
to comply with the rules, I will be leaving now.   
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine.  We are going to adjourn.  
Mr Mahlobo says he will be here before quarter to twelve.  
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 39 of 261 
 
We adjourn. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have arrived, Mr Mahlobo. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   [Speaking in the vernacular] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  Mr Pretorius, are you ready? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We were dealing with the PAN 
10 
report …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you proceed, must just mention 
that it is “mtiyane” [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   This is what the [indistinct] have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Mr Mahlobo, we were dealing 
before the break with the PAM report and let me just stress 
that I am aware of the fact that you would have no direct 
20 
knowledge of whether or not any particular person was 
actually engaged in the activities set out in that report.  So 
the purpose of the questions are simply to ask you what 
you knew about the existence of the report and its 
contents.  The report itself is a classified document, the 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 40 of 261 
 
PAN 1 report is classified document.  The Commission has 
sought declassification of a summary of that report and we 
are awaiting the outcome of that request but the question 
is, were you briefed in relation to the PAN report when you 
took office or at the time you took office? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Well, thank you very much, Chair, 
our Deputy Chief Justice [speaking in vernacular] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you got it right this time. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   [speaking in vernacular] to Mr 
Pretorius.  Well, Chair, and you, I will respond, Mr 
10 
Pretorius, but with a small indulgence that I will try to help 
you and the Commission as far as matters I know and 
especially during the term where I was involved but at the 
very same time, the incident that happened, while were 
virtually, I think I should place it on record I have no 
intention in terms of access to information and documents 
whether governed by the Information Security Act, which is 
still valid, but including the issues of oversight because 
they were [indistinct] today as every component of doing 
oversight.  Well, I had the discomfort, Chair, when there 
20 
were certain names of people that were being mentioned 
because as a person who was a minister and the oath of 
office, I cannot disclose names indirectly or directly and 
secrets placed on me but I have a responsibility to 
account.  The Oversight Act is very clear that at no stage 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 41 of 261 
 
shall I divulge any information, any methodology including 
any organ that might inadvertently reveal names.  I was a 
little bit uncomfortable when certain names of people were 
being mentioned and unfortunately, the signal failed us but 
I want it to be on record so that I do not – I do not want to 
be seen as a person who is very conscious about 
intelligence matters, as if I allowed myself to implicate 
individuals but then I can respond to what Honourable 
Pretorius is saying while I am having those safeguards.  I 
thought I should just put that important point. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, that is fine.  I assume that when 
you talk about names that were mentioned you are not 
talking today, you are talking about sometime in the past. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Your Excellency, what happened, 
Adv Pretorius started quoting certain things that are in the 
PAN report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not remember that. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Let me help you, uBaba Zondo, I 
will help you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.

two 
names 
he 
mentioned, that that report had an adverse finding on two 
individuals.  The names were mentioned here and it is my 
responsibility to help the Commission that I do not want 
your 
Commission, 
Chair, 
that 
sometimes 
it 
gets 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 42 of 261 
 
unwarranted attacks and I must be very conscious in 
assisting you that we do not do that.  There were two 
names. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   And I will not be able to repeat 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, you cannot. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Because I will be complicit, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   But now I am happy that Pretorius 
10 
is 
indicated 
the 
report 
is 
classified 
and 
is 
sorting 
declassification, then I will respond to him now so that in 
as far as I was concerned, without getting into the body of 
the report, I want to place it on record.  Mr Pretorius, when 
I became a minister I received the report officially and that 
report, 
when 
I 
received, 
it 
had 
a 
number 
of 
recommendations and those recommendations were acted 
upon and there were remedial actions that had to be taken.  
Those remedial action had to be referred to the accounting 
office for execution and on an ongoing basis because 
20 
reports of IDU(?) there are also reports that we must report 
it to parliament to the Joint Standing Committee on 
Intelligence. 
 
They 
had 
a 
sight 
of 
what 
the 
recommendations were, they were shared and on an 
ongoing basis we reported on the progress made.  At this 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 43 of 261 
 
stage I will not be able to say how far did they implement.  
I do not have the document here. 
 
And secondly, while I was at home I made a 
reference to say I do not know this numbering, PAN 1, but I 
know in the media statements that another political party 
has made the request again to the IG to further investigate 
and 
I 
have 
not 
heard 
now 
whether 
that 
particular 
investigation has been concluded.  But on record, I did 
have a sight of the report.  I acted on the report, there 
were certain remedial actions that were to continuously 
10 
report to by the accounting officer to me as an executing 
authority and the same we reported to parliament.  That is 
how I can help you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What we know then is that there 
was a report, a PAN report, that you were briefed on the 
report or given a copy of the report and you took certain 
steps.   
We know two things and these may be clarified 
once we – and if we obtain declassification of the summary 
of the report and there is absolutely no reason why we 
20 
should not obtain declassification and the view of the legal 
team but we will take those steps further. 
 
What 
we 
know 
is 
that 
there 
have 
been 
no 
prosecutions arising out of the PAN 1 report, correct? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Well… 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 44 of 261 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That is not classified input. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   No, you see what you are doing, 
Mr Pretorius, you are making an error.  You want us 
indirectly to start to divulge the contents of the report.  
Remember, the content of the report in terms of law, check 
your Information Security Act and check your Oversight 
Act.  I cannot sit here and start to speculate.  I am saying 
to you, at my level I received a report, it had remedial 
actions, it had recommendations, remedial actions and 
what I did was to say those remedial actions must be acted 
10 
on by management under the guidance of the accounting 
officer.  That is the action I took. 
 
Secondly, we brief parliament through the Joint 
Standing Committee on Intelligence which is a mechanism 
as the breach in terms of the constitution in terms of 
Chapter 11, Section 210, that there must be a monitoring 
mechanism, a multiparty committee will be in place, that 
multiparty committee to assist the Commission, check the 
records of that committee inasmuch as there are certain 
classified if you want to further investigate whether action 
20 
was taken or not but there are remedial actions to say 
please do the following, the very same issue that I will 
insist when it comes to matters of an audit report.  The 
audit report, you have to have a duty to ensure that after 
AG issued it, like they have issued it in the past, remedial 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 45 of 261 
 
actions are produced and you start to implement the plan.  
That is how far I could be able to help you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Mr Mahlobo, you have told us at 
some length what was done pursuant to your receipt of the 
report.  I do not understand why you cannot say what was 
not done. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Well, you want me to actually 
place me in an untenuous[sic] situation. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I just, Mr Mahlobo …[intervenes] 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   No, no, no, let me finish, Mr 
10 
Pretorius, let me finish please our respective …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No, sure.  My apologies. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Please do not put words – I am 
saying to you, I do not remember the things that are said in 
the report because I do not have the possession of the 
report and I will not want [indistinct] to speculate.  I am 
saying, in as far as the broad thrust, what should an 
executing authority do?  And I have responded now to say 
what did I do and if there was incomplete implementation 
of the remedial action, is another matter. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I was going to ask you whether 
part of your concern is that answering the question 
whether there were prosecutions following your instruction 
for the implementation of the remedial action whether that 
might lead to you indirectly disclosing that remedial action 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 46 of 261 
 
may have been recommended, whether that might be part 
of your concern. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Chairperson, you have captured it 
correctly.  I remember one specific recommendation in that 
report but if you push that line indirectly, I am going to 
have to disclose what this action is while Mr Pretorius has 
not had this report being declassified.  I do not want this 
recommendation and in terms of the oath of office I took 
both as a Minister but also in terms of the law.   
You 
know 
Intelligence, 
Mr 
Pretorius, 
what 
is 
10 
different?  There are certain things you say in a particular 
way and when you say them, right now, when I am 
speaking right now, I can tell you we are being watched all 
over the world and there are certain things that will  
actually indirectly confirm some of the things, but if this 
report is here, uBaba [indistinct] …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it has been declassified. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I am very, very clear, I remember 
that one recommendation but I am not going to put it here 
on record and behave as if I am a novice when it comes to 
20 
intelligence matters.  I might not have the right word but I 
just use the word novice but I am very conscious. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe let me ask this question and in 
part it might or might not assist, Mr Pretorius.  You gave 
instructions for the implementation of the remedial action, 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 47 of 261 
 
is that correct? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Yes, definitely correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the person whose duty it was to 
make sure that your instruction was carried out was the 
accounting office, is that right? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you at any stage get to know 
whether your instruction was carried out? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   The accounting office provided 
reports on the implementation of the agreed remedial 
10 
action proposed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Equally, those remedial actions 
from time to time, we apprise the Joint Standing Committee 
on Intelligence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   The reason why we have to do 
this, Baba Zondo, it was a matter of public interest. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   And it continued to be so. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   But when we come here, I want to 
assist to the best of my ability so that you can be able to 
see the truth from this other smoke but the manner the 
question is couched, very conscious class I am going to be 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 48 of 261 
 
starting to say there was this recommendation, there was 
this recommendation and nothing actually – that is the 
bearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja.  No look, I think you can accept that 
both from Mr Pretorius’ point of view and from my point of 
view, we certainly do not want you to act in breach of the 
law, it is just going to be an attempt on your part and on 
his part and on my part …[intervenes] 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   That is why I [indistinct] that is 
why I came in quickly the manner I came. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Because if you look [indistinct] at 
this, that [indistinct] no good, accuses you around the 
political shenanigans and noise outside.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   When you finalise your report 
everybody is satisfied we went through a process that was 
fair and just so that at least we do not play to sound. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Every time I see a particular point 
20 
that might made us to do and disturb you will pardon me, I 
will highlight it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  I thought you might be able to 
say, without talking about details, I thought you might be 
able to say look, I am aware that my instruction was 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 49 of 261 
 
carried out or I am aware that in some respects my 
instruction was carried out but in some respects it might 
not have been without talking about in what respects. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Well, Chair, I can put it on record, 
certain aspects of the remedial action were implemented. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   And it was an ongoing thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   And hence now, Mr Pretorius, we 
have this thing coded PAN 1, that is why those who are 
10 
there now must complete the work.  It is not about my 
performance assessment here to say at what stage did we 
do that but the most important thing, actions were taken, 
continuously reports were provided and there were certain 
individuals that were not happy about certain things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   That is why they requested, which 
is a public knowledge, they requested the office of the 
Inspector General please reinvestigate some of these 
aspects. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Because they were not happy with 
certain aspects of the first report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   And this is how far I could be able 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 50 of 261 
 
to assist you, volunteer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Who was the accounting officer you 
refer to? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Well, at the time the accounting 
officer, Ms Kudjoe. Ambassador Kudjoe was the accounting 
officer when I became the minister and then there was 
others after she left, on acting capacity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe you can just provide the spelling 
for her surname? 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   K-u-d-j-o-e. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Ja, 
okay, 
alright, 
just 
for 
the 
transcribers. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   And I want to hope that by 
mentioning the name under your protection I am not 
breaking the law.  I am saying it reservedly because 
accounting officers, they are generally known. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, they are generally known. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is only operatives that require 
names to be concealed. 
20 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Pardon? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The law only requires the names of 
operatives, not officials, as we understand it. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   No, it is …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So accounting officers, ministers, 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 51 of 261 
 
they names need not be kept secret. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   No, no, no, that is why I said it, Mr 
Pretorius, let us not have a problem.  I have said I am 
mentioning it because it is a generally known thing but 
immediately it starts to deal with operational matters, even 
if it is a DG, whether it is a DDG, I am not allowing, it is 
operational.  I know the law, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So what you are saying is, if the DG – if 
you are asked about a particular matter that relates to 
intelligence in an operational way, if it was done by a DG 
10 
or DDG even though generally a DG is known but in 
relation to that particular project you would not be allowed 
to mention the name.  That is what you are saying. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   It is definitely so and… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MINISTER 
MAHLOBO: 
 
 
But 
where 
it 
is 
general 
information, it has nothing to do with …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Operations. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   No, no, let us not use operations. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, those are too wide. 
20 
MINISTER 
MAHLOBO: 
 
 
Because 
those 
are 
wrong 
intelligence words. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   If it has everything to do, Chair, 
with counterintelligence.  
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 52 of 261 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   You know, sometimes these words 
are used wrongly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   And I want to do within the 
intelligence nomenclature so that that nomenclature is a 
nomenclature in law. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine.  Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Just two things then arising out of 
these exchanges, Mr Mahlobo, the first is that Arthur 
10 
Fraser was appointed in 2016, correct? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I would not recall when – which 
date he was appointed, but indeed he was appointed as a 
DG and I do not have the dates here. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And, as I understand your 
evidence, that the responsibility for that appointment would 
have been that of the President at the time, former 
President. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   The law if very clear how 
accounting officers and also in terms of the intelligence 
20 
legislation that the appointing authority is the head of the 
National Executive, which is the President. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And leaving aside the report, the 
contents of the report, the contents of the summary of the 
report, what recommendations were implemented and what 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 53 of 261 
 
recommendations were not implemented?  Our information 
is that there have been no prosecutions arising out of the 
conduct of the SSA dealt with them. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Well, I did make my reservation, 
Chair, you are doing a [indistinct] again.  Now indirectly 
you want me to get into those remedial actions. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you do not want to answer, that 
is fine, I need to place it on record. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   No, no, no, Mr Pretorius, please, 
let us help uBaba Zondo.  You own the questions, I own the 
10 
answers and if you want to probe, I am saying to you now 
this question is placing me to start to confirm matters that 
are in the remedial action, and I will not do that, 
…[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I understand your answer, I do not 
agree with your answer but we can make submissions to 
the Chair …[intervenes] 
MINISTER MAHLOBO: But it is my answer. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is my turn please, Mr Mahlobo.  I 
understand your answer, I do not agree with your answer 
20 
whether or not there have been prosecutions is a matter of 
public record and should remain a matter of public record.  
But let us move on. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Chairperson, you will help us.  
Well, if Mr Pretorius decides to make opinions that has 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 54 of 261 
 
insinuation will you be able that you start to get into that?  
I do not have intentions to do that because right now he is 
making indirectly a judgment that what I am saying I am 
wrong and I do not want to be starting challenging him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I am saying immediately you raise 
the matter of prosecutions and it is your call ultimately 
when you finalise your report, I am saying is the same first 
thing that I was asked but in a different way.  Let us not try 
to 
actually 
stick 
to 
that 
direction 
because 
I 
have 
10 
responded. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Let us leave it where it is.  Mr 
Pretorius said he is happy to proceed.  Let us leave it 
where it is.  Ja, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In your affidavit, Mr Mahlobo, you 
deal with certain procedural matters.  I would just like to 
place certain things on record which should not be 
controversial.  In January 2021, six Rule 3.3 notices were 
forwarded to you, in fact on the 19 January.  Are you able 
to confirm that? 
20 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Which paragraph are you referring 
to? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No, I am putting facts on our 
records to you. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   No, no, no, remember I have given 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 55 of 261 
 
you my affidavit …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, well, I am asking you a 
question, Mr Mahlobo, I am asking you if you confirm that 
six 3.3 notices were sent to you.  If you do not know, just 
say so. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Mr Pretorius, please, let us help 
the process, do not do this.  I am saying this matter is in 
my affidavit, help me and refer me to paragraph because 
you are starting to mention a date now.  What if I give a 
wrong date and I start to mislead the judge?  I do not want 
10 
to do that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But, Mr Mahlobo, you are perfectly 
entitled when I ask a question to say let me refer to my 
affidavit, it is your affidavit and we will be very patient.  If 
the information is in your affidavit we can place it on 
record.  If it is not I would still like to ask the question. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   No, it is fine, where you refer to 
dates, if they are not in my affidavit you will give me the 
source, then I will respond.  Chair, I do not want to confirm 
the date, I want to confirm that I did receive a notice. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you cannot remember whether this 
would have been January 2021 this year or last year 
towards the end – that you cannot remember. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   No, they were received this year. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They were received this year. 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 56 of 261 
 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   And the records in the Commission 
and secretariat including my legal team here …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That can be checked. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   They have the specific dates. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, I am putting this to you, if I 
may, what appears from the records and my instructions, I 
think, are not controversial, that you did receive 3.3 
notices.  When you first received them there were no 
documents annexed, they still had to go through 
a 
declassification process but my instructions are that that 
10 
the declassified documents were sent to you some weeks 
later on the 8 February that were annexed to the 3.3 
notices ultimately. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe let us do this.  In paragraph 
4 – I think paragraphs 4 and 5 of your affidavit, Mr 
Mahlobo.  In paragraph 4 you say: 
“During the period that the State Security Agency 
evidence was led in January 2021 and following the 
Section 3.3 notices that were issued to me, I 
immediately informed my legal representatives to 
20 
interact with the legal team of the State Capture 
Commission where in they made a claim that I 
intended 
to 
cooperate 
with 
the 
State 
Capture 
Commission and to also apply to cross-examine 
some of the witnesses whose statements implicated 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 57 of 261 
 
me 
in 
acts 
of 
wrongdoing 
and 
furnish 
the 
Commission with an affidavit.” 
Certainly what does seem to – it does seem that it might 
have been in January or soon thereafter that you received 
3.3 notices there.  You do not put it directly like that.  And 
paragraph 5 says: 
“Several letters were issues shortly after I was 
served with the Section 3.3 notices wherein I 
requested to be furnished with the witnesses’ 
statements, the annexures referred to them and the 
10 
documents in possession of the State Capture 
Commission and the SSA as far as they related to 
me.” 
It does not look like you do state when you received them 
but you have said that it was this year when you received 
them.  I think what remains, you remember whether it was 
six 3.3 notices or you do not remember that detail. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Well, Chair, in my affidavit it is 
self-explanatory on record I did receive the notices and 
when the notices were received they were referred to my 
20 
legal team and my legal team, that is here now, they 
started interacting with the secretariat of your office – the 
secretary of the Commission and it is clearly that we 
received 
the 
notices 
but 
there 
were 
documents 
we 
requested 
from 
the 
Commission 
and 
there 
are 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 58 of 261 
 
correspondence to that effect on administrative matters 
that I do not want to get into it because I want to get to the 
substance. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Mr Mahlobo …[intervenes] 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   And – I was still concluding, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   And I am on record that these 
documents were not furnished until these documents, most 
of them, we got them last night but which was an issue that 
I said, that there are some administrative challenges 
10 
attached to them but that does not preclude me to engage 
on the matters that are raised in the notices but I want to 
confirm that notices were received and maybe they were 
received.  Others, they were received in the course of the 
proceedings. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Mr Mahlobo, it is incumbent upon 
me to put to you the record of what documents were sent 
to you and your attorney and I wish to do so in order to 
deal with the allegations you make in the paragraphs in 
your affidavit.  If you do not know the answer to the 
20 
question that is fine, I just to place them on record and you 
can make whatever comments you choose because there 
are certain allegations in here which are incorrect and they 
need to be corrected.  This is your statement, it is on oath 
and I am entitled and it is incumbent upon me to deal with 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 59 of 261 
 
it, in fairness to you and in fairness to the Commission.  
So I am going to ask you against that background if you 
can confirm or not confirm or whether you have any 
knowledge of what the record is.  Six 33 Notices were sent 
to you January 2021. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Yes, I did receive the notices. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, in February, in fact on the 8 t h 
of February those notices were resent, this time with the 
declassified annexures attached.  You know that would not 
...[intervenes]  
10 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:    No, I will not recall that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, that is fine.   On the 25 t h of 
February 2021, a request for an affidavit, together with a 
bundle of new declassified documents were sent to your 
attorney, do you know of that? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   That’s not true. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, I’ll call the evidence if 
necessary. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   No, no, no Mr Pretorius allow me 
to respond, you see, I was not going to put something 
20 
here.  One of the things…[indistinct] that I tried to do there 
have 
been 
frustrations 
both 
by 
the 
Commission’s 
secretariat not you in furnishing my attorneys documents 
and the – ultimately even SSA refused official requests 
there has been too many letters and if Mr Pretorius wants 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 60 of 261 
 
to deal with administrative issues around paperwork, I’m 
not in a best place to help him, my attorneys here can be 
able to respond because I don’t want us to spend the 
whole day dealing with administrative issues.  I said 
despite all these administrative challenges that have 
happened, including  receiving 305 pages yesterday in the 
…[indistinct] after seven when there were discussions that 
these documents are going to be delivered by 5 o’clock 
both to my house and ordinarily I would not be at my house 
now but my attorney requested me to do so for documents 
10 
to be delivered, they were not delivered, they were actually 
even brought electronically in the afternoon but that’s now 
why I’m here, to argue documents.  the issue is to say, do I 
know this document, if I know I’ll say so I’ll deal with the 
allegation placed on it.  If now, I’m going to be fighting 
over dates I’m not competent to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Pretorius I suggest that we  do 
the following.  To the extent that, in relation to the 
exchange of documents there are some things that Mr 
Mahlobo’s affidavit that do not accord with the legal team’s 
20 
understanding.  Can we have an arrangement in terms of 
which discussion, maybe during the lunch break can be had 
between yourself and Mr Mahlobo’s legal team so that, if 
possible, later on you can just place on record something 
that’s kind of agreed to say, that’s the position, if it’s not 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 61 of 261 
 
agreed we can then take it from there…[intervenes]. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, there is one important thing, 
Mr 
Mahlobo 
has 
gone 
on 
oath 
to 
say 
that 
certain 
documents were received only in the past two weeks.  That 
is incorrect as a matter of record, it’s stated on oath and 
its incumbent upon me to put what we will argue in due 
course, is incorrect. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Just one issue I want to put to him 
now. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Ja 
then 
you 
are 
done 
with 
the…[intervenes]. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, yes. 
ADV ADONISI:   Chair,[indistinct] I’ve …[indistinct] and I 
equally 
reserve 
my 
obligation 
and 
duty 
as 
a 
legal 
representative and I’ve been referred by my client, seeking 
protection from you.  You have also suggested to my 
learned colleague as to how to deal best with the 
administrative issue but you would have heard from my 
client, he’s tried several times, for hours now to avoid to 
20 
engage on the administrative issues and we get to the crux 
and the trust of the issues but it cannot also be correct as 
it has been put forward as a matter of correcting what is an 
incorrect version from my side but there’s two sides of the 
coin which you’ve given guidance and directive and I 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 62 of 261 
 
would, respectfully accept that we deal with it off the 
record to not indulge in administrative issues as my client 
has said.  So, however, my colleague would want to deal 
with it because there are a lot of things that I could have 
stood up and spoken about that we’re unhappy that we can 
record as prejudice but as my client has said, we have 
tried to come here, relatively on the short notices griping 
and being dragged but as an obligation and a duty we owe 
to the citizens, we have done so grudgingly but we are 
here, we are trying to help you.  So, can we progressively 
10 
o to the thrust of the issues instead of – as you have 
suggested Chair. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Chair can – with your permission, 
Chair, that you indulge me, I’m happy that you have made 
the suggestion and my legal representative is correct, I’m 
amenable to that, I’m not going to be discussing details 
here, even in my affidavit, I am not accusing that this 
document, this document, it’s a broad general statement 
that I’ve made and the last point on a..[indistinct] Chair, I 
even insisted when there were certain things happening 
20 
that, you know what, I want to deal with these matters 
there was even a suggestion to postpone for Monday and I 
refused, I refused.  I’m here today to say, even if you go 
long haul, I want to deal with these issues because some 
of them, they impact on my reputation and I’m happy that 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 63 of 261 
 
the administrative issues where there’s an issue what, 
those talk among themselves as you directed, we correct 
what we need to correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Pretorius my inclination is this, one, 
what I have understood from Mr Mahlobo and his legal 
team is that they’re not taking the point that, because, on 
Mr Mahlobo’s version they didn’t receive certain documents 
timeously, they don’t want to continue.  My understanding 
is that Mr Mahlobo’s position is, I will try and deal with all 
issues that I can deal with, even in regard to documents 
10 
that I might have received late but where I am unable to, I 
will say so.  So, my inclination is that there needs to be 
that discussion that I talked about and at a later stage a 
decision – you can indicate to me whether you do want to 
place certain things on record and that will be fine, but it 
seems to me that that discussion should precede that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, Chair, I would appreciate the 
opportunity to address you on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja do that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In paragraph six Mr Mahlobo 
20 
makes a statement on oath to the effect that certain 
documents were only given to him with the 10(6) notice 
recently.  Now, I understand that between an attorney and 
a client the communications may not be such as all the 
matters are within Mr Mahlobo’s knowledge, but this is a 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 64 of 261 
 
statement on oath.  All I want to put on record, is that 
those documents which he complains were sent to him late, 
were, in fact, sent in February, that’s all I want to put. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Chair, I want to respond, I’ve not 
said in my affidavit which document.  That administrative 
issue, as you have guided us, the lawyers must work on it 
but I am putting it on record because I received those 
documents, it’s not an opinion and I don’t want any 
aspersions 
to 
be 
cast 
on 
my 
legal 
team, 
let 
them…[indistinct] but we’re here on the serious matters 
10 
and they can be able to do that because the statement in 
my affidavit it says, some, then they will deal with 
that…[indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright, my ruling is that there 
should be that discussion and at a later stage if the 
Commission’s legal team wants to place anything on 
record, we can take it from there at that stage.  So – did I 
summarise your position correctly that even with regard to 
documents that you may have received, on your version, 
late, you are here, you are prepared to answer as far as 
20 
you can? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   And [speaking in vernacular], I’m 
even prepared to answer, even, documents that are not 
here as far as I can help you.  I don’t want an impression 
that I never assisted.  I’ve instruction from my party and 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 65 of 261 
 
my President to cooperate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Those issues, if there are going to 
be limitations because of documentation on a particular 
point when you deal with substance, I will advise you and 
you make a determination. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let’s move on then Mr Mahlobo if 
we may.  Paragraph nine of your affidavit – and I’m going 
to deal with certain issues in your affidavit, if I go too far, 
10 
in other words if I leave out something that you wish to 
emphasise please stop me and deal with it but your 
affidavit is a matter of record, it is before the Chair, and 
I’m going to ask you certain questions on the contents of 
your affidavit, then I’m going to put further documents to 
you but you’re free to say, but you’re now on paragraph 
nine, in paragraph eight I want to say x, y and z. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   It’s very helpful. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Good, in paragraph nine you say, 
“I participated in the high level review panel on the 
20 
SSA by giving testimony on activities and the 
conducts of the SSA”, 
 
The question I’d like to ask you, do you have any 
record of your evidence? 
MINISTER 
MAHLOBO: 
 
 
Well, 
the 
record 
of 
my 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 66 of 261 
 
participation will be with the panel itself, I never recorded 
myself but there the secretariat had his own record, I 
participated. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, no, my question is somewhat 
different, we’ve…[intervenes]. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I don’t have the record. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do you have your own notes, do 
you have your own prepared statement? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I don’t have them here. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Here, do you have it at all? 
10 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   No, I don’t have. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   At all? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Yes, they never asked me for an 
affidavit, their methodology, I was interviewed but I’m on 
record on the interview they made and did the best ways to 
provide you with that report and remember the President 
actually, ultimately released the report in as much as it 
was a redacted version. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   As your attorney pointed out, there 
are certain typographical errors, but I don’t think we need 
20 
to 
deal 
with 
them 
they’re 
quite 
obvious 
typographical…[intervenes]. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Yes, the spelling of the names, 
thank you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   There has been evidence by Dr 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 67 of 261 
 
Moshomade and others in relation to the status of the 
white paper and the constitutional requirements, you deal 
with those in paragraph 12. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Well, I don’t only deal with the 
matters of the status of law, I start to deal with the status 
of the constitutionality because constitutionality was a 
serious mater raised here and on record it must be started 
from 10/11 and you can proceed there Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, if you wish to raise anything 
in relation to the legislation outlined by you in paragraph 
10 
11, please do so but…[intervenes] 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Well, I just want to place on one 
or two matters [speaking in vernacular] that witnesses 
came here, and they created an impression that only two 
legislation matters and it’s only the constitution and the 
white pages and that impression is wrong, and I want to 
put it on record.  Intelligence, because of our past and 
where we come from and the abuses and politicisation and 
so forth that were used as an instrument that some of us 
got exposed to as a young person, including yourself and 
20 
others, in South Africa, is highly regulated and the 
constitution is very clear, that there will be national 
legislation and I’ve started to assist the Commission.  
These are some of the national legislation as required by 
the acts of Parliament, Chair that govern this environment 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 68 of 261 
 
and on page 12 where, honourable Pretorius, you’re trying 
to refer to, in the doctrine of legislation making in South 
Africa you either produce a green paper or you produce a 
white paper.  Those documents, they are not equating to 
national legislation, but they relate to strategic intent, 
policy aspects but ultimately, ultimately, it’s the law passed 
by Parliament and assented by the head of the national 
Executive.  The assertion that was made about the status 
of the white paper, to say, not correct on record. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, we can look at the detail of 
10 
what was said in that regard, several witnesses gave 
evidence in relation to the contents of the white paper.  Be 
that as it may, can I move…[intervenes]. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   But can I just come in Chair, you’ll 
help me, Mr Pretorius because I don’t want to interject. 
Let’s not throw opinions in passing let’s deal what is the 
law.  The white paper is not the law. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, he’s responding, Mr Mahlobo to 
what you said, you said certain witnesses came here and 
gave the impression that the white paper is law, I think, 
20 
that’s what you said. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I take the point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja his response is, we’ll look at whether 
that’s what those witnesses said, ja, but that’s how, at 
least, I understood you. 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 69 of 261 
 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   We’re on the same page. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And indeed, I don’t think there’s 
any disagreement that the most important expression of the 
law is in the constitution. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Definitely. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I’d like to move on to paragraph 16 
to deal, very briefly, with what you found when you came 
10 
into office in 2014. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Paragraph 16? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 16 yes. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Okay, I’m there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It says in paragraph 2 – or you say 
in paragraph 16 line 2, 
“There was no proper accounting structure in place, 
mainly because of the nature of the operation of the 
Intelligence community”, 
 
Would you explain that please? 
20 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Well, this is a broad statement, I 
will not give specifics because here there are certain 
things that, it’s important, that one explain his role.  When 
you come into an institution you do what your colleagues – 
an institutional planning in military score recon just assess 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 70 of 261 
 
and very importantly there were matters that were very 
problematic and somewhere we deal with them, some of 
these things you see in the notices about behaviour this, 
accounting this, these are some of the issues that I’m 
referring to, just to give all the same way or the same word 
[speaking in vernacular] used, what do you call it, laying 
the foundation, insisting on laying the foundation but these 
are the systematic issues that come over time and here I’d 
want to be in a position that, after this foundation is laid by 
16, started to respond to the question, what did you do 
10 
because enterprising was giving, really nothing was done, 
probably you aided the worsening of the situation that’s 
why you’ll see how this affidavit is couched but this is an 
affidavit of my own subjective assessment, either informed 
by audit reports, informed by other things, I’m putting it on 
record as my foundation for engagement and also dealing 
with some of these issues, Pretorius, you remember these 
issues where people think about politicisation and all this, 
we’ll deal with them later on but these issues, they actually 
proceed even that time I was.  I never found a ship that 
20 
was floating there were things that were working and there 
were things that were worrying. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In fact, I’m sure that, with your 
experience, 
Mr 
Mahlobo, 
the 
Chair 
would 
be 
very 
interested 
in 
your 
understanding 
on 
what 
remedial 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 71 of 261 
 
measures might or might not be required, we’ll come to 
that. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe I could say, Mr Mahlobo, I think 
Mr Pretorius wanted to establish whether you are able to 
say, in relation to that sentence, you are able to say, for 
example, there was no structure that assisted with this 
type of accountability, there was no structure that assisted 
with this type of situation and this – the absence of that 
structure created these types of problems.  I was thinking 
10 
maybe he had…[intervenes]. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I want to do that but little bit 
cautious. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Because some of these matters, I 
will deal with them later on, on the specifics on the 
affidavit but generally there were witnesses. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   And very serious one and some of 
them systematic. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   And they don’t even start at the 
time of 2014, May, they start as far back as 1995. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   When these Intelligence Services 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 72 of 261 
 
were established but till we start to engage on the meat we 
will engage, but the environment was there having its 
difficulties, there were things that were working and there 
were things that were not working, and I had to tighten up 
certain things.  Well, it will be a matter whether my efforts 
were the best I could or not, but we’ll then demonstrate it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let’s move then to paragraph 17 
where you say, 
“I inherited an agency that was greatly divided and 
10 
characterised 
by 
mistrust 
and 
allegations 
of 
political interference”. 
 
The notion of political interference in the affairs of 
the State Security Agency has, to an extent been dealt with 
by previous witnesses, it would assist us if you gave us 
your understanding of what is not proper by way of political 
interference, what are you referring to there? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Well, if I’m referring to issues of 
political interference you will have to be able to make a 
reference to the constitution.  The constitution is very clear 
20 
as our supreme law that when we speak on chapter 11 
around security services, there are guiding principles, how 
they must do certain things and there are certain things 
they must not do and over years, there are certain things 
about political issues, political meddling or being security 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 73 of 261 
 
services used as an instrument to advance certain interest, 
whether factional, whether – whatever is that but it’s very 
important that I must insist what the law says, those are 
the principles.  This matter of political interference or 
political issues around how state institutions are being 
used, not a  new phenomenon.  As far back as the 
challenges of my movement of which I know that the 
leadership is coming here in the next few days to engage 
with you, those allegations were made at that time and 
they continue to be made at the time the other person 
10 
came in and they continue to be made even today, that’s 
the environment.  Whether the merits and demerits, it’s a 
different matter but it’s a matter which is called common 
cause, that’s what I in that institution and that’s what 
continues to be and it’s one of the matters that, even going 
forward, I will do and show that those guiding principles I 
referred to under Section 199 of the constitution, we do our 
best of our abilities that they are safeguarded and where 
there are witnesses we started to say, is it a witness in 
law, witness in policy, witness in leadership or witness in 
20 
terms of consequence management, that’s what I’m placing 
it on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I understand you to be saying, and I just 
want you to confirm that my understanding is correct, I 
understand you to be saying, when you took office as 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 74 of 261 
 
Minister of State Security you found, among other things, 
that there were allegations of political interference in 
matters relating to your portfolio, you understood that they 
were not new, they had been there for a long time you go 
back 
to 
1995 
and 
you 
say 
allegations 
of 
political 
interference have continued, continued during your term in 
office, they continue even today.  Is my understanding, 
what I say correct? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Maybe, Chairperson, you are 
correct.  Let’s, maybe, probably before you look at 
10 
allegation of political interference, there Security Agents 
because on how we arrive at the democratic dispensation.  
There were people that were brought together, they never 
saw eye to eye.  They did things to each other that are 
terrible but we’re to forge a unity, prosperous in a 
democratic South Africa.  They were brought together, they 
had issues of prejudice, there are issues of how they felt 
among themselves, those issues never dissipated on one 
thing.  Even today the people that work for the Apartheid 
Security Forces was there in Security Forces and their 
20 
orientation and their side, and there are people that are 
coming from formal liberation movements in terms of 
[speaking in vernacular] they are there, and they are 
trained in a particular way.  You know how you see when 
there are problems in intelligence, you rent people they 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 75 of 261 
 
come and do peddling, peddling [speaking in vernacular], it 
creates certain stories, we’ll come and deal with them.  
One of the stories they created about judges and create 
about people that they’re spies and yet you look in sutu, 
even yourself they will say things about you also and you’ll 
find people leaking documents, you know the law is very 
clear how information must be mandated, and it continues 
to happen today.  There are certain things and practices 
because on how we concluded our matters, they continue 
to be bedevil this and all of us, we should be party with a 
10 
solution to help.  There are very good men and women 
there but there are also men and women whose conduct 
and whose orientation, actually is not taking the country 
forward but we’ll deal with that but it’s very important 
because people who came here [speaking in vernacular] 
they never gave an opportunity to explain how Intelligence 
is, how does it come from and so forth even they too, I can 
tell you, they are political animals, political players, and as 
an Intelligence person that has been trained, I can read 
what their end game but I’m not going to do that because 
20 
we have – but it’s important to say, let’s not be selective 
on how far our challenges are so when you make a 
recommendation, probably far reaching reforms are going 
to be required to do that but just read a page – it’s not 
page, paragraph 17 in context because most of you that 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 76 of 261 
 
are here, we’re not Intelligence people, we’ve been on the 
ground, we know how it works and so forth, you interpret 
the law, thank you Mr Pretorius. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, so, I understand you refer to 
common cause and matters of principle.  It to be a matter 
of principle, as far as you’re concerned that the State 
Security Agency shouldn’t interfere in party politics of 
factional politics within parties. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   You are correct, but let’s qualify it, 
10 
Mr Pretorius, as long as those parties, they don’t do 
anything against the law, the intelligence is everywhere 
including even in my own bedroom.  I can have a spy in my 
bedroom or in my home.  It is everywhere.  It is not that – is 
support the security of the state and its people and it will be 
there.  In intelligence it is very simple. They say that you 
must just know that someone – always note that someone is 
listening or someone is watching.  Well I always know that 
God is watching but that is … 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We assumed that for the last two 
20 
years and I think correctly. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  No, no it is true.  When we will talk 
about some – some funny things that are even happening 
now about my team how intelligence is being used to certain 
things that we must say no to because unlawful things must 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 77 of 261 
 
not happen and 00:00:53. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  In the last sentence of paragraph 17 
you say you made it your duty and mission to steer the 
agency 
towards 
a 
new 
direction 
of 
transparency 
and 
accountability.  Can we deal with that at the end of your 
testimony as to … 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Thank you very much (speaking over 
one another) 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Because the Chair will have to make 
some recommendations about the evidence he has heard. 
10 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Well we will gladly share what is our 
thought about how we can improve certain things.  I know 
His Excellency our President says certain things must be 
done they are there to support him.  But my views will not be 
the 00:01:34 for all the challengers but I have a view to 
make. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We go to paragraph 19.2 towards the 
end of the paragraph you are talking about the operational 
directive that you refer to there and you say:   
“This directive would explain why I would not 
20 
have direct access to operations, the nature 
of the operations, the members involved in 
that particular operation and the persons or 
the person who conceived agreed those 
operations has they were conducted on a 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 78 of 261 
 
need to know basis.” 
 
What I would like to ask is the position of the Minister 
in the SSA and whether that Minister should be involved in or 
have knowledge of operational activities? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Let us probably with your indulgence 
Chair I am referring to matters of directives or regulations 
they are provided for in the law.  I might not be quoting the 
right one now here but the law is very clear about the powers 
of 
the 
Minister 
especially 
in 
the 
National 
Strategy 
Intelligence Act it has got to be amended over time and 
10 
again and equally there is this law called the General 
Intelligence Amendment Laws and it also – even the 
Intelligence Oversight Act it says in the cause of our duties 
to implement the law – the National Legislation we might do 
regulations.  Sometimes the regulations are in form of 
directives or guiding… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I hear you battle when you are facing this 
side. 
MINISTER 
MAHLOBO: 
 
My 
apologies 
(speaking 
in 
vernacular).  I am saying on the basis of law the powers of 
20 
the Minister are very defined but for intelligence to work we 
must create rules.  This document called Operational 
Directives is one of the rules that is very important and 
policy making is the responsibility of the executing authority 
which is the Minster. 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 79 of 261 
 
 
This is one of the important issues that for all the 
issues that are relevant to counter intelligence I do not want 
us to use these words Special Operations because this work 
is about counter intelligence. 
 
There had to be rules because there were problems – 
the problems were there the first thing you do as a Minister – 
hey what do we do let us strengthen the law or let us 
strengthen the regulation. 
 
These two that I am mentioning here Mr Pretorius are 
not the only two – there are a number of them – they are 
10 
called Operational Directives and I think certain elements 
have to do with HR and certain elements have to do with a 
covert operation and so forth and I am placing it on record 
because the witnesses that came here they created an 
impression we worked willy nilly and these ones I am putting 
there.   
 
Not only this Baba 00:05:04 there was even things 
and Mr Pretorius called – which is part of the regulation or 
guideline is even called Ministerial Payment Directive.  
Those are the most important things that we were to put in 
20 
place. 
 
And some of them they were there before I must be 
able to say I must not create an impression they were not 
there.  They were there and every time, every year the AG 
requires that policies must be updated – there is even a 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 80 of 261 
 
review period.  One of the thing I signed in 2015 – remember 
I came in the middle of the financial year.   
 
One of the things that immediately the financial year 
ended so that you can start 2015/2016 well was to ensure 
that regulation on how we do our work is (inaudible). 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You say however and I understand 
that it is difficult to make absolute statements and general 
statements sometimes lead to misunderstandings but you do 
say here  
“This directive would explain why I would not 
10 
have direct access to operations, the nature 
of the operations, the members involved in 
that particular operation and the person who 
conceived 
that 
operation 
as 
they 
were 
conducted on a need to know basis.” 
 
Now arising out of that and arising out of the 
evidence that other witnesses have given as a general 
principle is it correct or incorrect that a Minister should not 
be involved directly in operational activities? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Well let me answer some of these 
20 
allegations while we are here.   
1. There is no law – there is no law and these people 
were here they could not tell you Bab Zondo which law 
says the Minister may or may not use.  There is no law.  
I will come to this directive but there is no law Mr 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 81 of 261 
 
Pretorius that 00:07:13. 
In my case I was not involved that is my answer – I was not 
involved but there was no law bearing me not to do that.  But 
do you know that people who are … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just before you proceed Mr Mahlobo Mr 
Pretorius is going to tell me if I misunderstood his question.  
He was asking whether you agree or you do not agree that a 
Minister should not be involved in those matters.  Now 
should not might mean you should not because it would be 
unlawful to do so but should not might mean that although it 
10 
might be lawful maybe for other reasons such as ethics and 
other things it might not be… 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  No I would want to help you Bab 
Zondo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Because we have witnesses who 
come 
here 
and 
they 
do 
not 
share 
how 
intelligence 
environment works.  I will respond – my answer is very clear 
the allegations they are making that I was involved in 
operation I deny it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  I am on record.  But I want to assist 
this commission and remember we are not being watched 
here Baba we are also watched internationally.  Even other 
foreign internal agencies right now that are here at home 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 82 of 261 
 
and abroad they are watching and let us not actually create 
some stupidity of ourselves.   
There is something that I want to put it on record.  
There is no law that says Ministers or the Minister – let me 
use the word – the Minister or the President must be 
involved or not involved.  There is no law.   
 
But let me just assist you and say do you know that 
when you run counter intelligence in the course of your 
national interests there are people that get to be recruited to 
assist you to push your national agenda or national interest.  
10 
They are not on the same level.   
 
Even the biggest intelligence organisation whether it 
is the Russians, whether it is the Chinese, whether it is the 
British Military Intelligence, whether it is the CIA even 
Presidents you can recruit a President. 
 
Other countries in terms of intelligence work they 
actually get Presidents that they want and interfere in other 
countries things where another – would you think that a 
President can be managed by June, would you think that a 
general in a country will be managed by June?  The levels 
20 
are 
not 
the 
same. 
Who 
then 
becomes 
everybody 
in 
intelligence is a recruiter.   
Some they come themselves to be recruited.  We 
must be able to demystify certain things that have happened 
here.  There is no law but depending on how aggressively 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 83 of 261 
 
you push your national interests using intelligence because 
intelligence is not something that is new is actually centuries 
and centuries ago you will know.  For an example if tribes 
are not supposed to fight you will get your daughter to marry 
on the other side. 
 
It still happens today.  Even other countries they get 
their certain citizens to go and get to be married in other 
countries.  You do not know whether we are – we are 
actually staying with a spy or not. 
 
But I thought I should be able to say this thing 
10 
because if I do not say it an impression will be created that 
intelligence which is information very important to make 
decisions can only be gotten to people of certain levels. 
 
But my answer I might have been long winded I never 
ran operations but equally so there is no law that says you 
can do this or you cannot do that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I understand your answer Mr Mahlobo 
one thing I would like to place on record because this theme 
has emerged in evidence before is that certainly we will 
submit to the Chair that the standards which should apply 
20 
and be adhered to I – our own state security agents should 
be established by our own policies and our own constitution 
and if those are more strict and higher standards than other 
countries so be it but the standards are our own standards 
not those of other countries. 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 84 of 261 
 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Let me just assist you Mr – that is an 
opinion they made.  That standard they could not tell you 
where is it.  There is nothing in law.  I am very conversant 
with the legislation that govern intelligence it is an opinion. 
 
Probably going forward you might want to discuss the 
question why should be the role of politicians?  But also do 
not discuss the role of politician without understanding what 
is intelligence when everybody can become a recruiter as 
long as you advance your national interests and national 
security. 
10 
 
And this is not a new doctrine.  Intelligence is a trade 
craft.  It has its own ways of working.  There are views that 
traditionally even big democracies even today they are still 
grappling with it because the more we will practice these 
things we find certain weaknesses.  So everywhere you will 
find it.  Even ourselves are not unique for dealing with that 
but this thing of a standard there is no standard here written. 
 
These guidelines – these guidelines or directives are 
a policy in terms of law that [00:13:25] and they are very 
clear what could be done, what do you do with this one?  
20 
Probably 
they 
are 
not 
adequate 
depending 
on 
our 
experiences that is what I would say.  But it cannot be a 
matter of fact if these standards were there they will have 
been part of the documents I will have been furnished. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Let us go to paragraph 32.  I know it 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 85 of 261 
 
is a great leap forward. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can keep your mic on Mr Mahlobo at 
all times. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  No just (speaking in vernacular). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  (Speaking in vernacular).  I do not 
want to discuss methodologies.  When it is my time just 
indulge with me you will – when it is my time to respond I will 
make it on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You made a promise earlier on you 
10 
remember not to revert to your mother tongue.  You have 
forgotten that.  You want to just say that again for – so that 
everybody knows what you were saying. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  It is a chat between a father and a 
son.  I do not think it is material Chair.  The Chair was 
asking me to keep the mic on.  I told him that I have a 
preference I – for certain security rules into repeat. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you we learning – secure 
along. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  No I am here to support and help. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr Mahlobo I guess I should ask you 
whether I should keep mine on.  
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 86 of 261 
 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  You see Baba Zondo it is very 
simple.  I can – I can do profiling how you speak, how you 
breath, how you do certain things and we have people now 
watching you there.  Remember this thing is not on a closed 
session. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MINISTER 
MAHLOBO: 
 
Someone 
is 
taking 
notes 
somewhere. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I guess they take notes when I cough. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Note it is one o’clock Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Even when I cough or sneeze.  Yes Mr 
Pretorius.  I see it is one o’clock.  Because of the problems 
of technology we have lost quite some time this morning.  I 
wonder whether we should take less than an hour for our 
lunch or whether we should stick to an hour.  So I am just 
checking so that I do not impose. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   May you Chair with the break and 
with your indulgence and the permission of Mr Pretorius just 
push for another hour then we take a break. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  I am here to help. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  I want us to conclude (speaking over 
one another). 
CHAIRPERSON:  So your suggestion is maybe let us 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 87 of 261 
 
continue and then take the lunch break a little – a little later. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Ja let us push for an hour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And make some progress. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  And then we are trying to make up 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Mr Pretorius what do you think? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I am happy as long as it is 
convenient to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no I – I do not have a problem. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I know that one has arrangements 
10 
sometimes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I know that you might have 
arrangements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Over the lunch breaks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no – yes sometimes I do but I think it is 
fine.  Maybe not for an hour as such but maybe – let us see 
how far we are at half past one. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then maybe we can go up to quarter to 
two. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  I am comfortable Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And I think your Counsel is fine as 
well with that. 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 88 of 261 
 
ADV ADONISI:   I am Chair thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright let us continue. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Let us go to paragraph 32 of your 
statement.  I just have one question to ask in relation to the 
contents of that paragraph where you say that: 
“During 
2014 
the 
country 
experienced 
unprecedented levels of sharper political 
contestation 
characterised 
by 
subversive 
activities within and outside of Parliament all 
these 
factors 
and 
challenges 
economic 
10 
weakness 
seen 
in 
2014 
had 
serious 
implications for National Security and the 
stability of South Africa.” 
All I want to ask in this context and on the basis of 
this statement Mr Mahlobo is activities which undermine or 
negatively influence the economy of the country are those 
activities which may fall within the mandate of the SSA? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Well thank you very much Chair.  
This does fall within the mandate Chair of intelligence 
services and you will find even a better answer – I do not 
20 
have the notes here for you Advocate Pretorius a definition 
of 
national 
security. 
 
It 
is 
in 
the 
National 
Strategic 
Intelligence Act.   
It is very broad – very broad it compasses economy, 
environment – it encompasses everything and people they 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 89 of 261 
 
have views – different views even today that broad definition 
is a problem.  There are those views but I am not going to 
start to express a view but it is there in law what it covers.  
 
That is why Mr Pretorius there is something that is 
very important that you will see when we start to deal with 
something which is called National Intelligence Estimate 
which is paragraph 84.  Because National Intelligence 
Estimate on the basis of law whether – how National Security 
– National interest is defined and all these other things.   
 
The country is required by law that it must have a 
10 
security assessment.  That security assessment the law 
place it correctly that it is the responsibility of all the 
intelligence services.  There are three of them.  They come 
together in a structure called the National Intelligence 
Coordinating Committee and it is established by law – it has 
a code name. 
 
They do a threat security threat assessment then 
from there they look at all the issues as defined as part of 
the broader trust of the National – the National Security 
including National Strategic Intelligence.  What is National 
20 
Strategic Intelligence?  It is there. 
 
Then they have pillars.  At a particular point I 
decided to share with you and the commission what were 
these areas of the National Intelligence Estimate? 
 
So 
that 
when 
government 
started 
to 
actually 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 90 of 261 
 
discharge its responsibility in terms of the law – the 
constitution but also in terms of the governing party 
manifesto that those that have won elections. They produce 
a 
strategic 
document 
called 
medium 
term 
strategy 
framework.  What are these risks?  What are these 
opportunities?  That information it looks at the totality of the 
state.  State I do not mean the executive – the state – our 
nation both from domestic threats and foreign threats then 
you produce this important document and every time we 
must start to work.  We must start to respond to these risk 
10 
assessment tool.   
 
But later on we will get into that.  That is why on 34 it 
says: 
“The NIE was always linked to National 
Security Intelligence as required by the law.  
On the basis of the security risk and threat 
assessment the Intelligence Services embark 
on counter intelligence.  Counter Intelligence 
is very important.  What are the things that 
needs to be done there?  Covert collections, 
20 
domestic and foreign intelligence operations 
in line with national security and national 
interest’s imperatives.” 
 
I wrote this because there is a view that other people 
came and share here.  That a number of counter intelligence 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 91 of 261 
 
activities that were done they were done outside the law and 
we have to be able to dismiss that with the contempt it 
deserved because the law – and when you do an assessment 
you break it down.  Fortunately I am a former Accounting 
Officer – I worked in Government as an HOD – I know these 
administrations.   
 
You start to link.  How does it link to the medium term 
strategy framework?  How does it link into the strategic 
plan?  How does it link to the NIE?  And all these things that 
have been done or they think that are allegedly that they 
10 
were being done.   
 
The question must be asked was it within these risk 
assessment provisions by law?  This provision Chair it must 
be considered by the executive – National Executive.  Not 
something for you there.  Help them – you go in there – you 
present to Cabinet.  That thing had died before I became a 
Minister.   
 
There was a time where there was allowed – were – 
the executive by law could have considered this important 
risk assessment too.  I worked with the people that were 
20 
supposed to do for the first time as a security cluster we 
actually reintroduce it, further it – we can be able to say but 
really why did you do this, why did you do this?  I did this 
because this was linked to this, this was linked to this and 
anything that is not linked to that you can be able to say but 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 92 of 261 
 
this is an out lie.  Then you can explain your actions. 
 
I might have been long Mr Pretorius but it is 
important that we assist each other when we come here. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  In paragraph 36 then you refer to the 
particular threats to the authority of the state that you 
foreshadowed in your discussion of the National Intelligence 
Estimate – the NIE.  I just want to ask you in terms of 
paragraph 36 sub-paragraph 4 you deal with threats to the 
economy of the Republic and specifically mentioned under 
that head is the concept of corruption. 
10 
 
Corruption 
too 
would 
be 
a 
matter 
that 
might 
legitimately draw the attention of a security agency in South 
Africa.  Is that correct? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Before I respond to that I need with 
your permission Chair there is something here probably I will 
need – okay.  No, no, no I have got it right now.  You know 
your light is not good here.  On 36… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh the lighting is not good there. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  (speaking in the vernacular).  No I 
am going to come to this corruption issue now.  The NIE I 
20 
have decided to say what were these pillars of the NIE?  And 
I want to put them on record so that we also demystify that 
certain thing that happened might have not been informed by 
policy position. 
 
The threats that we faced as a country they were 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 93 of 261 
 
classified into five areas and these five areas Chair without 
actually disclosing the NIE because the NIE is not a public 
document.  But this one Chair I am taking liberty that when I 
appeared in Parliament in the Joint Standing Committee on 
Intelligence presenting my strategy plan, they approving the 
budget including what you call it – policy and budget 
statement.  You know those budget books.  These things say 
– Mr Pretorius on all my speeches I have referred them to – 
the pillars.   
 
The first four pillars they are referring to issues that 
10 
are domestically in terms of domestic strategic intelligence 
and the last pillar are referring to intel – foreign matters. 
 
On the first pillar Chair there is a – there was a – our 
security architecture as a country it looks to the threats to 
the authority of the state.  It has certain elements in that 
document.  Violent community protests, violent industrial 
actions, violent in the transport sector, violent protests in the 
education sector, viper security, activities of private security 
industry and protective security. 
 
There is something very interesting Chair that you 
20 
need to be able to note on the first one.  There is always an 
adjective that has been used before community protests. 
 
Remember protests are allowed but could you see 
that there is always a qualification violent, violent, violent 
because the constitution allowed people the right to express 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 94 of 261 
 
freely, they can march, petition but immediately they do this 
qualification it borders on matters of the law. 
 
Because I do not want at a particular point in time the 
men and women who worked so hard to produce what we call 
NIE without as if they were not conscious just of the issues 
of the Bill of Rights. 
 
The second matter the threat was to the territorially 
integrity of the Republic.  We control and the management of 
border security.  Illegal migration.  We are not saying 
migration is a problem we are using also the right word 
10 
illegal and anti-foreign 00:28:48.  These things 00:28:52 by 
discriminating people.  Then there is a threat to the well-
being and safety of South Africans.  Those are the issues of 
want.  The water, your food, your energy security, terrorism 
and 
extremism. 
 
Right 
now 
you 
have 
challenges 
in 
Mozambique.  The problems of gangsterism and narcotics 
and then there is a threat super economy of the Republic. 
 
Corruption is the biggest matter that you raise here.  
Illicit of mining of precious material.  That was the 
intelligence report and assessment.  Theft of ferocious and 
20 
non-ferocious material including wild life poaching.  Those 
are the issues that we looked at.  Those are the domestic 
matters. 
 
Then there are foreign matters.  Threats arising 
from abroad which are security challenges on foreign terrain, 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 95 of 261 
 
00:29:55 contacts and African Continent and putting these 
things.  We never acted without a tool for certain things to 
be done because a number of things, Mr Pretorius, will 
come in later on.  This will create an impression by these 
people who were here that some of these operations, they 
happened with no basis, either in law, either in policy.   
 
Well, Mr Pretorius, I agree with you.  Corruption 
is our enemy.  Our enemy, not only here, but even the 
whole world and it must be fault in its different forms and 
hence the own creation of these, the Commission itself, to 
10 
deal with these issues.  I thought I should raise these 
issues there, Your Excellency, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   [Microphone not switched on.] 
ADV ADONISI:   Your mic.  You have lost us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  You then go into some 
detail in paragraph 37 and you deal in more detail with the 
threats that you summarised in paragraph 36.  Now it may 
be that later on in your evidence these threats are the 
context of certain projects that I would like to put to you 
20 
that emerges from the evidence and documentation that we 
have.   
 
But if we could go to – and a matter of interest 
to, certain the evidence leaders, there is a statement in the 
second sentence of paragraph 37.1, where you say: 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 96 of 261 
 
“Foreign Intelligence Services were aligned 
with negative domestic forces to destabilise 
the state’s ability to govern the country...” 
 
The negative domestic forces you talk about 
there, what are they?  Political parties, non-governmental 
organisations?  What are those forces? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Well, it is not a specific statement 
but let us be on record.  Not everybody is a friend to South 
Africa.  We do have enemies.  That is how Intelligence 
works.  We do have enemies and we live in a world where 
10 
we do not have enemies, we live in a different world.   
 
Even our own friends – you know, there are 
those countries where we share certain things.  These 
countries, they will never hesitate, even if they are a 
friend, on matters of pursuing their national interest 
including 
even 
issues 
of 
dominance 
or 
economic 
advantage. 
 
We use Intelligence to do these things.  Some of 
these people, Chair, they live here.  Some, they are 
declared here in South Africa.  We know that this country 
20 
have 
these 
people 
but 
in 
the 
covert 
world 
and 
counterintelligence, there are people that you will never 
see and you must never see them. 
 
When you catch them, they are in trouble but 
sometimes they do a slipup, you catch them, sometimes 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 97 of 261 
 
you do not catch them.  The duty for Intelligence is to 
influence, to get information so that you can make 
decisions.  You can have an advantage and a covert world 
gives you an advantage to recruit certain people of 
influence to advance a particular cause. 
 
Very alive that there are these other foreign 
intelligence in countries.  South Africa is not a small 
country.  Very strategic in terms of its location and of 
resources and others and influence and leadership, both 
here at home and abroad.   
10 
 
They must work on certain people so that these 
people 
knowingly 
and 
unknowingly, 
for 
wittingly 
and 
unwittingly, they must pursue their national objective.  This 
is what is happening and nobody, and I repeat, nobody is 
immune from being recruited.   
 
They can even recruit a minister, they can 
recruit a president, they can recruit a judge, they can 
recruit a parliamentarian.  You can recruit, as long as you 
know what kind of information and influence you need and 
that is how, Pretorius, you should look at these things. 
20 
 
How will you actually get an advantage if, really, 
you do not know these people in the influence of power?  
You would find them anywhere.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We will come to the detail in due 
course, Mr Mahlobo, but the concern that under the 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 98 of 261 
 
absolute statement here, all manner of activities may be 
justified but look at the statement that you make here.   
“The Foreign Intelligent Services were aligned 
with negative domestic forces to destabilise 
the state’s ability to govern the country...” 
 
Not to gain economic advantage for their own 
country but clearly to destabilise the state’s ability to 
govern the country.  Now that may seem legitimate.  And 
my question is, what are those domestic forces?  Are they 
trade unions or NGO’s? 
10 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Let us help you.  Let us help you.  
Firstly, understand the doctrine.  It is not about matters of 
economy.  I am not referring in this sentence to the 
economy.  On our matters of government.  You know, 
countries, Chair, even today there are countries and 
governments that have collapsed because of operations of 
other intelligence services.   
 
Governments have been removed.  It is not a 
hearsay.  It is not a story.  Governments have been 
installed, leaders have been installed so that people can 
20 
get an advantage on all matters.  Immediately, your 
question started to say I must lead(?) [00:07:01]  Why 
would I actually start to divulge an information or a 
methodology for a body(?) [00:07:08] because that is not 
the ...[indistinct] where I am starting to be able to call 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 99 of 261 
 
certain people as a threat.   
 
When 
you 
go 
to 
the 
projects, 
the 
counterintelligence activities – let us cross the bridge that 
is there.  Let us not actually try, with this statement, to 
insulate(?).  I am just giving you how the world of 
intelligence works.  We do it ourselves.  But I will never 
tell you which country wanted an advantage in the interest 
of national security or national objectives.   
 
Let us not single out certain sectors.  They can 
be 
in 
any 
sector 
but 
as 
long 
they 
are 
becoming 
10 
perceptible(?) and they are becoming a target that they 
can wittingly or unwittingly, knowingly or unknowingly 
become a target and they start to work for other people 
without knowing.  The others they know.  It is money.  You 
know, to sell information is money.   
 
That is why, either they come to say:  Hey, you 
know what?  So and so is saying this about you.  Or 
someone can actually even walk to you house and say so 
and so is like, there would – there are these that balance 
and checks that you need to do but let us put it on record 
20 
how our intelligence doctrine works.  Foreign interferences 
by other countries is a matter we got.  That is why we even 
have an intelligence when I was there.   
 
There was a branch responsible for Foreign 
Intelligence.  But because of relationships we do, do you 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 100 of 261 
 
know that in embassies all over the world, including them, 
these are the parties.  They even sent in their own 
intelligence officers here but they must be clever so that 
they do not do things that undermine us but in certain 
instances, they run their own covert work, then start 
working here in this country(?).   
 
And then when we find them, we find them.  
Sometimes we do not find them.  Then they call it an 
intelligence failure.  This is the environment we live in.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, let me put the question in a 
10 
different way, if you are not willing to categorise these 
domestic forces.  Are these domestic forces in the private 
sector, the public sector or both? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   It can be any citizen, it can be any 
organisation, both in the public and private sector.  We are 
all vulnerable in one way or the other to get and protect, to 
be used, whether we know or we do not know to push 
certain things or interest we do not know.  I have – 
Mr Pretorius have – I do not know.  We never had time to 
have tea or coffee.  Probably, one day we will have one.   
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Maybe stronger. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   We will have one.  You know, even 
businesspeople, you know, business – there are serious 
issues of intelligence.  Intelligence is information.  Do you 
know there is the biggest problem, even in private sector, 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 101 of 261 
 
called 
issues 
of 
espionage 
where 
companies 
wanted 
advantage?   
 
You know it is a doggy-dog situation.  They want 
to have a competitive advantage.  Why you were put in an 
IP, your Intelligence Property laws?  Because you want to 
protect certain things.  This is the reality we live in.   
 
Therefore, the answer, all of us, there is a 
possibility and a threat that we could be recruited, either 
we wish to or sometimes we do not wish to.  I cannot say 
who is a spy and who is not a spy, whether my wife is a 
10 
spy or not.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No, understood.  In paragraph 
37.3.  This may become important later.  You deal with 
violent industrial action and under that head, you talk of an 
assessment report which revealed that labour provides 
another platform to be used 
by 
Foreign Intelligence 
Services to destabilise our economy and pursue their 
agendas.   
 
Now if one is talking about violent industrial 
action, one is no doubt talking also about trade unions, not 
20 
so?  Is that what you mean by labour? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Well, we are not ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Organised ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   You are narrowing it if you say 
industrial trade unions.  If you speak about industrial 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 102 of 261 
 
action, it can be people who are organised or not 
organised but they employed in a particular sector or 
industry.  They started to get involved in certain things.   
 
Remember 
the 
architecture. 
 
Very 
clear.  
Immediately exercising their rights for petition and protest 
and deal with the issues at the workplace.  Immediately 
they do their qualification, they acted violent.  It will be a 
matter of national security and it cannot be ignored. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess that your answer is that your 
reference to labour in that sentence includes both trade 
10 
unions or activities where trade unions are involved and 
activities where trade unions are not involved? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   [Indistinct] Labour by clear 
definition, I am speaking about workers working wherever 
they are working. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   We can try to put the languages 
somehow but I am using labour the way the word labour is 
known without any specificity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you see, as I understand it.  Quite 
20 
often when the word labour is used, it may be understood 
to include unions and sometimes not to include it. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I fully agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   As long as it is so broad like you 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 103 of 261 
 
are saying it, Baba. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   It cannot be narrowed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja-no, no that is fine. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Because I am always cognisant 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   ...what is our security architecture 
and framework. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
10 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   It looks like in this particular area 
– and it is a fact – this particular area at a particular point 
and time ...[indistinct].  Remember the problems that were 
there, they are common cause and we look at the live – or 
maybe let me use this word that I never use.   
 
You know, risk assessment is also having the 
gravy.  High-risk, low-risk and medium – low-risk and 
medium.  I am jumping.  I should have included medium in 
there.  But that is how it looks.  It is so scientific but it is 
on the basis of data. 
20 
 
We do not act without data.  And the data – we 
have a process.  It is the ability to evaluate.  You know, 
evaluation is an important issue.  Well, there they use the 
word analyse.  Sometime the data will be accurate, 
sometime the data will be indicating as probably.  The 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 104 of 261 
 
probability.  And sometimes the data is false. 
 
But later on, we will deal with certain people who 
give us information and give us false information or they 
give you a hybrid of information, lies and truths.  And if 
you 
do 
not 
have 
the 
right 
instrument 
to 
do 
data 
verification.  But I will not go to the methodology. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Because the law does not allow 
me to go to a methodology.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   But evaluation and analyses, an 
important aspect in the doctrine. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  And then in paragraph 37.4 
to 37.6, you highlight several other threats, violence in the 
transport sector, violent protest and in the education 
section and cyber security threats.  I do not have any 
questions.  The statements, they are quite clear, and the 
next topic would be funding of the operation of SSA which 
perhaps we can deal with after the break, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes-no, that is fine.  Let us take the 
20 
lunch break now.  Let us – let me see whether we agree to 
take less than an hour and if so, shall we talk about 30-
minutes or 45-minutes? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   30-minutes, I agree to. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
You 
are 
happy 
with 
30-minutes, 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 105 of 261 
 
Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am in your hands, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Maybe 40-minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   40? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   [Indistinct]  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Okay alright.  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Are you providing me lunch 
[speaking vernacular] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  We are, unfortunately, not 
10 
providing your with lunch Mr Mahlobo. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   [laughs]  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or maybe I should not say that because 
I do not know everything that happens.  So it may well be 
that witnesses are provided ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER 
MAHLOBO: 
 
 
No, 
no, 
no. 
 
... 
special 
arrangements... [speaking vernacular] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   [speaking vernacular] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]   
20 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   [laughs]   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Let us ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   No, no.  It is fine.  My team will 
find ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is fine.  We are at twenty-seven 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 106 of 261 
 
minutes to two.  Shall we, let us resume at twenty past 
two? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES: 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let us continue.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Mahlobo, may 
we go to paragraph 38 of your affidavit.  You describe a 
process there in paragraph 38 which is the basis of how we 
10 
understand the operations to be in accordance with 
existing evidence.  If I may read it, it reads: 
 
“Once a need for a certain project had been 
identified 
a 
project 
manager 
would 
be 
appointed and the project would be given a 
covert name.  These covert projects were 
pursued 
by 
the 
chief 
directorate 
special 
operations.  A submission would then need to 
be prepared, which included a project plan and 
a project budget for the proposed project.  The 
20 
final approval of projects of this nature were at 
the discretion of the accounting officer, the 
DG.  Covert operations were more operational 
and as a minister I was not involved on the 
day to day operations of the agency.  What I 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 107 of 261 
 
knew and what came to my attention was what 
I needed to know and that goes for everyone in 
the SSA and the government.” 
 
As I understand it whether as a matter of practice, 
principle, law the minister as far as you were concerned, 
and certainly between 2014 and 2017 was not involved in 
the day to day operations of the agency.  Is that correct?   
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  That is correct.  
ADV PRETORIUS:  You say that: 
 
“In as much as I was not involved in the day to 
10 
day operations of the agency I remained 
accountable as minister SSA to parliament.  
The CDSO ...” 
 
That is the chief directorate special operations 
projects and operations: 
 
“Often ran over budget due to operational 
challenges and I intervened by reviewing and 
strengthening policies, systems and internal 
controls.” 
 
You may deal with those later when you speak to 
20 
the Chair about operational improvements that could be 
affected.  Then you say in paragraph 40: 
 
“The official records of the secret services do 
not reflect the true nature of the operations 
and projects run by CDSO as these were 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 108 of 261 
 
covert.  Even the names given to these 
operations, did not necessarily mean that the 
operation ...”   
 
And it reads: 
 
“Is accrued after its name.” 
 
The true nature of these operations was only known 
to the project manager and the team which is commonly 
referred to as assets.  Once again information about these 
projects would only be provided, only to those who needed 
to know as the principle of quote, “need to know basis” was 
10 
applied.  
 
That statement, at least the first sentence of 
paragraph 40 is somewhat puzzling Mr Mahlobo.  If the 
secret records do not reflect the true nature of the 
operations and projects, are there any records which 
reflect those? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Well, remember you have given 
certain documents about certain project name, and when 
you have given them, those names were not chosen by 
those who chose them.  So in English to mean that just 
20 
make an example.  
 
A project is called Tin Roof.  What does it mean?  
There are many examples where you would want to come 
to your annexure at a later point, but I am just giving you 
as a fact.  It does not necessarily mean that and at the 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 109 of 261 
 
very same time, those who are handling documents, there 
are clear rules how to handle certain documents.  
 
That is why I made a reference, what is the role of 
the minutes.  The minister must ensure there are policies.  
One of the biggest policy imperative that had to be 
complied with, I hope they will help you as a commission, 
depending who is security vetted. 
 
Even if they cannot give you the documents, a 
document called operational directive, you will see there 
what these requirements are, how do you do certain things.  
10 
But as I was saying to you it is a document classified, it is 
a document by law.  
 
It cannot be published even in the government 
gazette, but I will not go to it even myself.  I am saying you 
will have a better sense.  
ADV PRETORIUS:  Well, it is still not clear from what you 
say here Mr Mahlobo.  The statement in paragraph 38 
reads that: 
 
“There would be a submission prepared.  That 
would include a project plan and a project 
20 
budget for the proposed project.” 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Maybe let me help you Mr Pretorius 
so that we do not take time.  
ADV PRETORIUS:  Perhaps I can finish. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Okay, because I understood and 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 110 of 261 
 
the assumption that I never understood is not correct.  You 
probably 
want 
to 
put 
the 
question 
the 
other 
way 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, let him finish the question. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Let me probably allow him to 
finish. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  To put it differently. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  But the reality, I understood it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  Let him, Mr Pretorius. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  My apologies for interrupting.  
ADV PRETORIUS:  It is me that does not understand and 
so I am trying to clarify.  In paragraph 38 you talk about 
what I presume are official records.  The submission, the 
project plan and a project budget.  Now am I to understand 
that these do not reflect the true nature of the operations 
and projects that they refer to? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Chairperson, probably let us assist 
so that we do not take long.  The accounting or the 
20 
approval authority, now that the policies are there, the NIE 
is there and everything, to run any covert operation and in 
terms of the law, which is the policies that are there, the 
person 
will 
have 
a 
sight 
of 
that 
document, 
is 
the 
accounting officer. 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 111 of 261 
 
 
It does not come to the minister.  That is why even 
in your packs there is not a single document that has 
anything to do with projects, with respect to authorisation 
that just came to me and you do not have my signature 
there, approving projects.  
 
Probably that is how we should be able to help each 
other.  
ADV PRETORIUS:  But ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER 
MAHLOBO: 
 
I 
do 
not 
want 
to 
get 
into 
interpreting these things as if I am there.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, let me ask this way because I 
understood Mr Pretorius’s question in relation to the first 
sentence of paragraph 40 in a certain way.  I understood 
that sentence, I understood Mr Pretorius’s question to be 
asking whether in that first sentence ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Which paragraph? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Paragraph 40, first sentence: 
 
“The official records of the secret services do 
not reflect the true nature of the operations 
and projects run by CDSO as these were 
20 
covert.” 
 
So I thought what he was asking you is this 
question.  Do you mean that there would be these 
operations, but the records about those operations would 
be inadequate? 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 112 of 261 
 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Well, it is an area Baba Zondo, 
that probably when you conclude towards the end, we can 
discuss 
about 
it. 
 
There 
has 
to 
be 
some 
systems 
improvement.  Remember, I am appearing here in front of 
you.   
 
Now I have a line of sight.  Of some of the 
documents that were not approved by the minister.  Now I 
am doing my own reference to say no, no, no but remember 
there are certain things that were reported to me on a 
basis of certain intelligence products.  
10 
 
Now I look at these documents we have, but 
probably more details would have been given.  That is how 
the context Mr Pretorius needs to read in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But does it mean, because this is what I 
am checking.  Does it mean that what you are saying is you 
are not necessarily talking about the fact that the labels 
that might be reflected in terms of the document might be 
misleading to somebody who was not involved in labelling, 
but you are talking about the fact that anyone who wants to 
know exactly what is there and what is covered there, and 
20 
let us assume it is somebody who is authorised to know, 
they will not find that the records correctly reflect the 
situation.  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  As I was saying Chair, on the line 
of sight on the documents I have ...[intervenes]  
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 113 of 261 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  And the things you have given me 
here ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  I could see some words are so 
broad. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Without more prescriptive and you 
could see yourselves here ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
10 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  In the documents you have.  That 
is what I am implying to.  Remember, I am responding to 
notices with certain documents.  This is my observation.  
ADV PRETORIUS:  So I understand that you are not saying 
that the documents have been falsified in order to hide the 
nature of the project.  As I understand what you are saying 
that the full detail of the project would not necessarily be 
reflected in the official records.  Am I correct? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  You are correct.  I am not saying 
the documents have been falsified.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I thought that maybe not now, but 
earlier on, I thought that you were saying that the situation 
is such that the name of the project for example that could 
be given to the project, to a project, could be misleading.  
It could be about, it could give the impression that it is 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 114 of 261 
 
about tin roofs, when it is about complete something else.   
 
So 
and 
I 
thought 
you 
were 
saying 
in 
that 
environment that is acceptable.  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  You are correct, Chair.  Read my 
affidavit correctly.  It says: 
 
“The official records of the secret services do 
not reflect the true nature of operations.” 
 
You could see.  You have the documents that they 
have given you.  Some be classified, but you cannot give a 
sense.  Remember, it is a trade craft.  It has adoption.  If 
10 
you are not supposed to know, you will not be knowing.  
Only those who ran the things must know.  
 
That is one component even in the documents here.  
That is why you will scratch your head and say but what 
are they trying to say.  They will not tell you.  I will also 
not even tell you because it is not even my document.  
Then there is another part I am saying in the same 
sentence, even the names you see here, remember there 
are people here cooking.  
 
There is something called operation justice, you are 
20 
rushing the judges.  It is one of the thing interested to 
know.  I will deal with it, but was it really meaning that.  Is 
the document you have, giving you that sense?  I am 
saying both in terms of the document, because of the 
nature of the work, you will not get the full details unless 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 115 of 261 
 
those who had to do the job, they tell you. 
 
What you will only get, you will get an intelligence 
brief.  An intelligence brief product will say to you we are 
running this operation to be able as part of the counter 
intelligence, not special operations.  Special operations is 
just an instrument, a structure.   
 
Go and run counter intelligence, and then they will 
come to you.  They will never tell you the method.  They 
will not tell you the object, but they will tell you that this 
information, this is what it means in the country.  Either as 
10 
a decision maker you act on it, or you do not act on it.  
 
If it belongs to you, you will get it when it belongs 
to you.  When it does not belong to you, depending on the 
level 
of 
confidentiality, 
I 
can 
be 
able 
to 
cast 
the 
information to someone else if permissible by law, those 
that must implement it.   
 
That is how it works.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS:  In paragraph 41 and 42, you make it 
clear that the SSA is required to comply with the prescripts 
20 
of the public finance management act, it should read.  I 
presume that is the Act you are referring to.  The secret 
services account Act and the ministerial payment directives 
and internal policies which govern covert operations.  
 
You, I take it that Public Management Act, PMFA 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 116 of 261 
 
...[intervenes]  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Well, it is one of the issues my 
learned brother here indicate it is a typo but you could see, 
the abbreviation has the F.  We just have to insert that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Thank you Mr Pretorius just for 
highlighting it.  
ADV PRETORIUS:  Right and then at paragraph 43 you 
deal in brief with the funding process, the submission that 
is drafted for approval of the project and its financial 
10 
resources.  The appointment or assignation to a project 
manager and the like.  
 
You go on to say: 
 
“I would not have knowledge on who is the 
project manager and the details of the project.  
These were on a need to know basis.  My 
involvement was only when I get to be briefed 
through intelligence briefs.” 
 
Is that correct? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Yes, I have used this statement so 
20 
that it can help you Baba Zondo.  To deal with Annexure A.  
You have an Annexure A here in terms of your summons.  
In rule 3.3 where I am asked a plethora of projects.  Do 
you know this project, the project name, who is the project 
sponsor, how much and so forth? 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 117 of 261 
 
 
This 43 is answering that question.  It is not in my 
domain and I will not be even able to help you.  I am not 
an approving authority and that is why I am even referring 
to you on paragraph 42, to say look who is an approving 
authority, what are the instruments that are in place for any 
consideration to be made.  
 
But your Annexure A, which I will not be able to 
help the commission. 
ADV PRETORIUS:  If one looks at paragraphs 45, 46, 47 
and 48 ...[intervenes] 
10 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  You are running too fast.  You are 
saying paragraph? 
ADV PRETORIUS:  45. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS:  46, 47 and 48.  The allegations here or 
the statements here, appear to indicate that unless there 
are financial irregularities brought to your attention in the 
form of a report, you would only know about things when 
briefed about them during the intelligence brief, and by 
things I presume you talk about covert projects.  Correct? 
20 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Just for a second, you are on 
paragraph what now?  The part that you are reading? 
ADV PRETORIUS:  Well, perhaps I am going too fast.  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  No, no, no I am fine but I was just, 
is it just a statement broadly because I have seen 45, 46, 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 118 of 261 
 
47. 
ADV PRETORIUS:  48 says: 
 
“With regard to the projects I would only know 
things as and when I was briefed during the 
intelligence brief.  I would only be briefed on 
aspects that I needed to know.” 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  No, no, no this one I am very, if I 
could see it now, I want to help you.  Here we have people 
so that they can prove a story.  You know, a story and lies 
that minister is involved and minister branch operation.  
10 
This point is clear even in this affidavit and Rule 3.3 
notices.  
 
There are certain instances where certain people 
are making statements that minister got involved with an 
asset for an agent.  I will not have been involved with an 
agent, but ultimately the buck stops with me.  If someone 
comes and complains I am not saying I am ill-treated.  
 
Either 
this 
thing 
being 
given 
by 
members 
of 
parliament, either even given by the agents themselves or 
by my principle which is the president, that so and so has 
20 
a problem.  That will be a time when I will say fix this 
problem. 
 
Fix this problem.  It does not necessarily mean you 
are running the project.  I have instances and let, probably 
with your permission, I can give them now because I do not 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 119 of 261 
 
want to waste your time, and if ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Mr Pretorius, is that fine in terms of 
your planning?   
ADV PRETORIUS:  Well, I am going to go into detail in 
relation to the allegations made at the time.  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  No, no, no Chair, I want to deal 
with them now.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  I will repeat my answers, because 
the other issues, my affidavit is self-explanatory.  You 
10 
know, let us make an example.  We have a project name 
called Lock.  We have a project name called E-Wing.  You 
have it in your packs.  
 
These people, they come ... that one, that person 
has not come to testify here as an example.  Someone 
purports that this minister got involved in an operation.  I 
am not, firstly there is something that I must put as a 
reservation on record, because I am going to use the 
name, the project name that are given.   
 
There is a misstep that happened here.  Either 
20 
unknowingly or knowingly.  Certain people come here, they 
name certain agents, especially the agent under the 
project name called Lock.  It is irregular.  You do not do 
that.  Even if that information is in the public domain, you 
do not do that to divulge names because it is not you who 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 120 of 261 
 
put it in the public domain. 
 
Then there is this guy called Tiemie on the other 
affidavit by Steven.  This guy is a well-known guy.  The 
same matter was in the public domain.  He has issues and 
these issues, they come to my attention and the president 
and what do you do?   
 
Ultimately you must go in or deal with the problem.  
Because I do not want us to be going around the very same 
thing, someone speaks about the creation of a union and 
you put a name here of a person.  You do not do that.  You 
10 
do not do that and I will also not do it because I am very 
cognisant of the law.  
 
But then there is a problem.  You turn away as an 
executing authority and do not solve a particular problem.  
I will then allow Mr Pretorius at that point in time, when he 
wants to ask certain details, but I am placing it on record.  
If there is a problem, those who are in authority, vested 
with authority, they have a duty not to ignore people and 
get to those who are responsible to solve problems.  
 
That is why I might have taken long, because I do 
20 
not want my affidavit to be interpreted by other people, 
otherwise and this affidavit in mind is also helping you to 
clarify certain issues, but when the detail is required 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 121 of 261 
 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  I will be able to give you certain 
things that I am allowed to or the thing that I would not be 
able to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  But I thought let me be able to do 
that because there is a narrative.  When you intervene, it 
is like focal interference.  When you intervene, there is a 
problem.  It is a matter that must be regarded you ran 
operation.  
 
I wanted that clarity to be there.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS:  In paragraphs 50 and following, you 
place 
on 
record 
certain 
denials 
at 
a 
general 
level, 
concerning 
evidence 
that 
has 
been 
led, 
which 
may 
implicate you or may not implicate you.  If you wish to 
highlight any of those denials, please feel free to do so but 
we will be going into detail now.  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  No, let me just help you.  The 
denials and I have given the context because everything is 
on record.  The things that have been said here to 
20 
implicate me by all these individuals, are incorrect.  They 
do not even have a shred of evidence, Chair that they have 
to demonstrate that.  
 
They were sitting here Chair.  All of them, those 
three that appeared here, they told you in [indistinct].  
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 122 of 261 
 
They told you.  It is hearsay.  This is what they say about 
this one, this is what they say about this one, but at the 
end when they concluded, they told you they do not have 
evidence.  
 
They are on record.  After they have spoken for the 
whole day they told you they do not have evidence.  
Ultimately what did they tell you as a fall-back position?  
No, no, no project Vesa is incomplete.  That is what they 
told you.  
 
There is no evidence.  You know, I am not a lawyer.  
10 
I am just a pure scientist.  I only know water, but I also 
know intelligence and I deal with facts, not fiction.  They 
never gave you evidence.  They say I took money, as an 
example.  
 
You have it on record here.  If someone must take 
money there is a paper trail and you do not have my 
signature there.  It is on record.  Someone says I broke the 
law, they never told you.  Someone says they were 
standard in intelligence.  
 
They are not there.  There is one matter, when Mr 
20 
Pretorius will want to come to certain detail.  Chairperson, 
project Vesa is incomplete.  It is on record.  They gave 
you.  There is a person called Dorothy.  I just wanted, 
without bringing your meeting into, your commission into 
disrepute.  
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 123 of 261 
 
 
Someone in the commission they have decided to 
put a document and even another document that has been 
submitted by the lawyers of Dorothy, where the matters you 
want to discuss about Dorothy, I know now.  Dorothy has 
furnished them.  
 
Furnished them with an affidavit that have not been 
included in my pack.  Dorothy is on record there.  She 
never brought money on that thing, but that is why I have 
indicated Chair, there are also additional people.  Let me 
just help you. 
10 
 
There 
is 
other 
names 
here 
because 
other 
documents came yesterday.  We have someone called an 
inspector general of intelligence.  There is a Rule 3.3 that 
we only received that probably last week if I am not 
mistaken, I will not be accurate on time.  
 
Do you know something so funny Baba Zondo?  You 
know if someone is going to give you a report, you cannot 
come here.  This is one problem Baba Zondo when it 
comes to the commission, where people they will think that 
the commission is being used.  
20 
 
You need to ask us the difficult questions.  There 
are people who came here, but they have actually gotten 
away with murder.  They have actually by their own 
conduct, politicise this which is not your intention.  I 
believe in your bona fides.  
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 124 of 261 
 
 
I believe in your bona fides Mr Pretorius.  You have 
an inspector general of intelligence.  He comes on a 3.3.  
The minister of state security directed a deputy minister of 
state security, who then directed an official to give 
bursaries to certain people.  
 
Those minister, the deputy minister has never said 
here on record that I actually did that.  I was not even 
interviewed.  These are the things on 50, that these 
allegations and these things you are trying to actually 
implicate me, are not true.  
10 
 
Unfortunately in the intelligence Baba Zondo, in the 
intelligence they use a particular platform to get a 
particular narrative.  Here you are sitting with political 
animals.  You know political animals that have their own 
issues? 
 
I will demonstrate at a particular point with a matter 
of judges, where one of these witnesses called Steven as 
an example, he lies here.  He has not came here.  My legal 
team had said no, no, no but do not speak about people 
who have not came here.  
20 
 
I said no, I am not going to allow Baba Zondo to 
think that I am hiding things.  In the affidavit he writes, he 
claims that I introduced judges to him.  In the affidavit he 
says he does not remember the judges I introduced him.  
he is then asked by the then acting DG hey man, try to find 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 125 of 261 
 
pictures here so that you can be in a position to actually 
say no, no, no but minister ran something about judges.  
 
Then 
ultimately 
in 
the 
same 
affidavit 
in 
the 
documentation here, he says he cannot be in a position to 
confirm which judge.  Do you know, this witness who was 
an acting DG comes here to you and say I do not, Baba 
Nfumati, in a very leadership way, he says no, no, no but 
let us not try to create this impression about judges.  
 
I do not want to venture there, but no, the acting 
DG comes – but I have some circumstantial evidence.  In 
10 
this affidavit before the end I can tell you this character 
called Stephen is the one that right now, as I speak, they 
are working on a false alert to implicate a judge as if 
judges are bought and they are bringing the institution into 
disrepute.  In the affidavit they say no, no, no, they do not 
know about it.  They are running the operation.  That guy is 
a [indistinct] he is the same guy who chose to lie about 
certain politician and a head of Chapter 9 institution and 
said that these guys are a CIA, that guy.  And when you 
say no, no, but produce reports here, that this judge – 
20 
these people are CIA, we open up, say no, no, no, let us 
even open up a case.  Then we have a situation where the 
information was not forthcoming until I left.  As I am 
standing here without any fear or favour or contradiction I 
know there is a judge they are trying to frame when a 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 126 of 261 
 
judge has never received money and I want to place it on 
record, I have never given an instruction that a judge must 
be bought and in terms of my knowledge, there is not even 
a single judge that has been bought.  It does not 
necessarily 
mean 
that 
these 
judges, 
the 
honourable 
judges, you do not have your own missteps, the balance 
and checks that are there are very adequate. 
 
These are some of the things, insinuations that 
have been made here.  I never wanted uBaba Zondo to 
waste your time and go to each detail.  That is why my 
10 
laying of foundation, what are the sixteen, what, what, 
what, I just wanted to give you a sight of these things but 
these things that they are saying here, I am record, I deny 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you …[intervenes] 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Only denying them, uBaba Zondo, 
they have never presented you with a shred of evidence.  
When Mr Pretorius goes to details we should be faster 
because where you do not have my signature I do not want 
us to be boring each other on matters that are really 
20 
inconsequential because this is evidence but where there 
is a knowledge – but these are the issues, the country is 
waiting, judges are being paid, judges are being bought. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you mentioned a certain affidavit 
that you said, as I understood you, should have been 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 127 of 261 
 
presented to you but has not been presented to you that I 
think you say indicates that you were not involved in 
something that you were alleged to have been involved in.  
I just want to check that because obviously we want all 
facts to be in the open.  Do you know anything, Mr 
Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Certain affidavits have been given, 
there is a small bundle of documents which have been 
given to Minister Mahlobo only recently, he has expressed 
a willingness and a desire to deal with and we will put 
10 
them on that basis.  If he is not ready to deal with it then 
we will obviously have to deal with it at a later stage but 
that – my suggestion is let us put each one rather than in 
the general terms that have been put now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, that is fine, the only one I am 
asking about is the one he talked about in particular where 
he was saying there is an affidavit that is in the possession 
of the Commission from I think Dorothy, some pseudo 
name, that I think exonerates him. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, I understand the question. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We have received information, if I 
may use intelligence term, to the effect that such an 
affidavit exists.  We spoke to Dorothy this morning who 
denies that such an affidavit was ever attested to by her 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 128 of 261 
 
and if such an affidavit exists it must be brought to us and 
we will investigate it but we know of no such affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We certainly have not concealed 
any such information and would never do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Now Chairperson, let me help you.  
You know, you are trying your best, your system cannot be 
bullet proof.  I am saying to you I am not going to come 
and lie here.  I am saying to you in that position of the 
10 
Commission’s team, the lady was trying to come and show 
Mr Pretorius right now, there is that affidavit and I will not 
tell you, there is even the advocated that represented 
Dorothy here and remember, all of us, via the legal teams, 
I am saying to you Dorothy has submitted an affidavit, I am 
not going to be discussing that but that affidavit in the – 
that I know it is in the possession of your team, that 
affidavit does not say that I took money and I do not want 
us to go there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   You will be in a particular position 
where I will help you with certain aspects but I just put it 
on record, let us not it a meal out of it and at a particular 
point [speaking in the vernacular] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine, what I do not want or 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 129 of 261 
 
what I did not want is a situation where you have made a 
statement 
that somebody 
within 
the 
Commission 
has 
concealed something that should be brought to your 
attention and we do not find out what is happening.  Maybe 
we should leave it on the basis that Mr Pretorius will 
investigate and try and establish where this affidavit is and 
then take it from there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No, Chair, it is a serious 
allegation.  To the extent that we received information  that 
there was talk of such an affidavit existing, we investigated 
10 
the matter. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Let us investigate …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   May I finish, Mr Mahlobo, you have 
made a serious allegation.  Let me deal with it. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   But do not raise your voice please, 
let us respect the Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no, wait, Mr Mahlobo. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Chair… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No, let me finish. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, wait, let Mr Pretorius finish. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I want to place on record that 
according to the best of our inquiries and according to our 
legal team that supports me as evidence leader in this 
matter there is no affidavit from Dorothy which denies what 
she has said in previous affidavits. 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 130 of 261 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That is our knowledge for the 
present.  If there is such an affidavit and if we have been 
misled we would welcome being provided with such an 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV ADONISI:   Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
ADV ADONISI:   If Chair might allow me, I think if I not 
address this issue I would not have act on the best interest 
10 
of my client because earlier this morning I was approached 
by the team, the legal team of the Commission and the 
legal team of the Commission did talk about the affidavit 
that the minister is bringing to the picture now and I was 
requested to call my client with that regard to say on the 
corridors there is that thing in that there is an affidavit 
which contradict the affidavits that he had submitted 
already.  Then my client did say no, I do not know if any 
affidavit that the Commission requested which I did not 
submit.   
20 
In addition also, the questions that the Commission 
brought 
forward, 
I 
did 
answer 
and 
respond 
to 
the 
Commission.  I went back to the legal team of the 
Commission.  I get them the response of my client.  Now 
the legal team of the Commission did give me a respond to 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 131 of 261 
 
say we do have an affidavit which was submitted to the 
SSA, State Security Agency, by your client and I said hold 
it right there.   
Now we are not going to play mind games because 
even though I have not told them that you are not playing 
mind games but I am learned person and I have read into 
everything that they were discussing with me.  An affidavit 
that is submitted to SSA, it is not for the Commission and 
certain work of the SSA, it is for a classified high level.  
Now 
for 
that 
information 
to 
be 
brought 
into 
this 
10 
Commission, 
it 
needs 
to 
be 
declassified 
and 
the 
Commission to discuss that affidavit with me, they need to 
tell me or who me proof or certificate that this information 
is declassified. 
 
Now if I do not stand up and address this issue or 
the engagements that we had with the legal team of the 
Commission, I would not act on the best interest of my 
client.  So the minister to say whatever that he is saying 
right now, he is well within – position is right because this 
thing has been happening since morning and we are 
20 
hearing all this information. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can I ask you this question?  What you 
have told me now, does it amount to saying as far as you 
are concerned and as far as your client is concerned, the 
Commission does not have an affidavit that contradicts 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 132 of 261 
 
what your client previously said in the affidavit as far as 
you and your client are concerned? 
ADV ADONISI:   Chair, all the affidavits in terms of Rule 
3.3 notice that were requested from my client have been 
submitted and accordingly so.  In addition also to the 
questions, 19 questions that were submitted to my client, 
have been submitted to the Commission. 
 
Now if there is anything else outside of that scope 
which my client was given to respond to the Commission, 
then we are not aware of and like I am saying, when one of 
10 
the legal team says this affidavit was submitted to SSA, I 
said I cannot come here at the Commission to deal with the 
Commission and be expected to also address issues of 
SSA, it is a different scope and I am not going to entertain 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, what I propose should 
happen is from the – obviously there needs to be some 
investigation or discussion of some kind because from Mr 
Mahlobo’s side he is definite, I think that there is such a 
affidavit which contradicts what Dorothy said previously 
20 
and he believes that the Commission is in possession 
thereof and certainly Mr Pretorius has indicated that he is 
not aware of that.  So at some stage, at a later stage, 
there would need to be a clearing of the air to establish 
exactly where everything is but maybe let us say everybody 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 133 of 261 
 
has noted what everybody has said and let us continue for 
now. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:    Chairperson, I agree with your 
decision, it suits me and I was not going to hide this matter 
from record.  No mistakes can happen but let us allow them 
to look at it including the legal representative of Dorothy.  
Then I am fine.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   For the present, Chair, your ruling 
is noted, I would just like to make three points.  All – there 
10 
is more than one affidavit of Dorothy.  There is no affidavit 
that we have, to my knowledge, that contradicts everything 
she has said.  First point. 
 
Everything we have has been declassified, second 
point. 
 
Third point – and we must not conflate these two 
issues.  There is an accusation on record that the 
Commission’s investigation and legal team, that is the 
Commission, 
is 
withholding 
an 
affidavit 
to 
whatever 
prejudice might in future be alleged. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I know of no such allegation and in 
order to assist us in that regard we would appreciate if we 
could be provided with the so-called affidavit so we can 
investigate. 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 134 of 261 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But the existence of the affidavit 
and its deliberate concealment by the Commission are two 
different 
issues. 
 The 
latter 
one 
is 
a 
very 
serious 
accusation. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Chair, let me come in. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   You see, let us not complicate the 
work of the Commission and throw stones.  I never used 
word of conceal matters and so forth.  You know when 
10 
people they start to express opinions and try to make 
others look bad, that is not my intention.  You have made a 
very sound ruling, I respect you.  Let them go and do this 
thing.  If there is an error being made there, let us not try 
to be adversarial, please.  I have just put it on record, I am 
respecting your decision.  Well, there are the other issues 
that there is declassification and so forth, it is fine to 
respond to but someone must not to start to say I have 
used words like concealing, do this, I was just bringing to 
your attention and in a good spirit we have handled the 
20 
matter well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Mahlobo, I must say that my 
own understanding of what you said included that you said 
that affidavit has been hidden from you or something like 
that.  Did I misunderstand you? 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 135 of 261 
 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Chairperson, I am on record.  I 
say it has been brought to my attention. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   And I can even tell you, Chair, 
remember I am in intelligence, I am not actually going to 
divulge any secret or any person. I do have the copy and if 
– remember we are dealing with certain …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I just want to check whether I 
misunderstood you. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   No, no, no, you I misunderstood 
10 
me. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Okay, 
you 
are 
not 
alleging 
that 
[inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I will never use those words.  That 
is why I am comfortable and I would be very, very wary 
immediately people started to say I have accused the 
Commission.  I will never try to bring your Commission into 
disrepute.  I put this matter on record now in that good 
spirit you have done, let them look at it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
20 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   And if I am making an error in 
judgment on what I have, I will come and say regrettably 
there is an error. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   But immediately we start to be 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 136 of 261 
 
venturing who is bringing the Commission into disrepute, 
that is not – I am not actually at that point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Mr Mahlobo, our coffee 
date still stands then. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Definitely do, we have a country to 
build for you and me and our children’s children.  That one 
I guarantee.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   For the present let us go to bundle 
SSA1, if you will, at page 30. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Somebody will assist you.  Maybe Ms 
September can help him to identify the right bundle.  
Bundle 1.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Page 30, please and I am referring 
to the black numbers in the left hand top corner of each 
page, so if you go to the documents in that bundle after the 
index. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    After the index, you will see in the 
top left hand corner a page number, SSA01/030. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Pretorius, I was busy 
…[intervenes] 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Why cannot you use this - Mr 
Pretorius, these things A or B or what? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, Mr Mahlobo, I did not hear the 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 137 of 261 
 
page because I was trying to get the attention of my 
registrar unsuccessfully, so what is the page? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   SSA01, page 30. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, I understand the frustration, it 
has been expressed by several witnesses but it is for later 
recordkeeping 
that 
we 
need 
to 
have 
these 
numbers 
…[intervenes] 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Let them just show me just quick – 
so that I can run quickly because the team you brought, 
10 
they taught me about A, B, C, D. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, well you can go to C, if that 
makes it easier but I will still refer to the page numbers. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   No, no, that is easy now, when you 
say C it is easy now, I am there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So you are at page 30? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That is a letter dated the 4 
November 2015 and it is addressed to the Honourable 
Minister Mr D Mahlobo, Minister for State Security Agency.  
20 
If you go to page 34.    
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You will see at the bottom of that 
page, paragraph 5.2: 
“Approved.  R130 million approval” 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 138 of 261 
 
And then there is a signature.  Is that your signature? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Ja, that is my very fancy 
signature, Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes and if you go to page 31: 
“Budget reprioritisation”  
You will see in the middle the page a table and under sub 
programme Ministry, it reads: 
“Projects approved by the minister.” 
Do you know which projects those were?  Can you recall? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Which paragraph? 
10 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
Paragraph 
3, 
Budget 
reprioritisation on page 31, there is a table in the middle of 
the page and the second item under the heading sub 
programmes is headed Ministry and under Project Activity 
is: 
“Project approved by the minister and R20 million 
funds were requested for those projects.” 
As I read the document.  Now the question is, can you 
recall what projects are being referred to in this document? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   This thing is very faint.  Which line 
20 
is talking Ministry? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can you see that – can you see - you 
know, under paragraph 3 can you see it says “Budget 
reprioritisation.”  Can you see that heading?  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Yes, I see. 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 139 of 261 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then there are two paragraphs below 
that heading, can you see that? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Ja, I see the one start at the 
programme. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, the second one starts with “This 
means...” 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then below that last one then there 
is a table there which has got columns.  The first column, 
the heading for the first column is sub programmes and 
10 
then 
the 
heading 
for 
the 
second 
column 
is 
“Project/Activity”. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   No, no, no, I can see it now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You can see it now? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Ja.  I see in this one – let us place 
it on record.  Minister does not approve projects.  The 
naming to say it is projects approved by minister, it is a 
wrong naming because in your records there is not even a 
single project where I am the approving authority.  I do not 
even want to interpret what it says but that is what the law 
20 
says and this is what the documents will have.  Therefore I 
will not be able to assist Mr Pretorius when he starts to 
ask which projects were approved by minister. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, if you look at page 33, 
paragraph 
5.2, 
the 
fourth 
bullet 
in 
that 
paragraph 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 140 of 261 
 
…[intervenes] 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   5 point? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   5.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think it is 6.2, Mr Pretorius.  Or is it – 
oh no, ja, 5.2. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   No, no, no, I can see. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It says there: 
“Minister ’s project R20 million.” 
Is that another misnomer? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  No, no, no, as I am saying to you, 
10 
it is misleading because you are having a document and I 
am just seeing it now here, Judge Zondo, Minister does not 
approve projects, these are clear and everything you have 
here in front of you, very clear stipulated, there is no 
approval by minister. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, if you total those projects 
referred to in paragraph 5.2, R130 million, that is the 
amount 
you 
approved 
by 
your 
signature 
on 
the 
16 
November 2015. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  But do not read it that way.  Do not 
20 
read it that way, why will you approve 130 million when the 
ministry for projects is allocated 20?  Read this document 
properly, not in the eyes of the people who come and 
testify here only.  Here this what we call it in terms of the 
PFMA and in terms of the Secret Services Special Account 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 141 of 261 
 
Act.  At a particular point there has to be an adjustment of 
budget depending whether the budget is adequate or not 
and that is allowed in terms of those two legislation and 
that affidavit, if this document, you want to read it 
selectively, you will actually mislead people.  There are a 
number of programmes – there are programmes there that 
were not performing well, they requested reprioritisation  
and the reprioritisation, Chair, it does not say it was only 
meant for projects, there was a reprioritisation for the 
entire budget of SSA and I am required by the law, the 
10 
Secret Services Act that at a particular point when the 
recommendation 
comes 
to 
me, 
I 
look 
at 
the 
recommendation, I approve it.  After I am approving it, 
remember on the Secret Services special account, that 
information even before you spend the money you must 
send the approval by the executing authority to the other 
executing authority, which is the Minister of Finance.  Look 
at the date here, 16 November 2015, those are the times 
around adjustments when they are being made and the fact 
that there is some kind of an insinuation in that document 
20 
that we are approving a project is not actually what do you 
call it here, supported by facts and to suggest that the 
total amount for the projects was 130 like Mr Pretorius is 
suggesting, not true.  Just check that table you are 
referring me to.  There are a number of programmes, there 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 142 of 261 
 
are a number of proposed budgets and then the total for all 
of them, this is what it means.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Are programmes as contemplated here 
within the environment of SSA part of projects all the time 
or can there be programmes that are not under projects? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Well, it is very simple, when we 
use the word programmes there are programmes as defined 
by the Public Service Regulation.  Any organisation in the 
PMFA, 
it 
has 
a 
programme 
structure 
and 
in 
each 
programme 
1, 
programme 
2, 
programme 
3, 
like 
the 
10 
ministry, as an example, it falls under programme 1.  There 
is domestic intelligence falling under what and under it 
there are sub programmes.  This is what this approval is 
about.  It has nothing to do …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but hang on, just focus on my 
question, is the position that in certain circumstances 
within the context of SSA, maybe of the whole public 
service but let us say SSA, is the position that programmes 
can sometimes be under projects and sometimes they can 
be independent of projects? 
20 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  No, no, no, programmes are the 
structural arrangement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  In terms of the requirements by the 
Public Service Regulation that you must have a programme 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 143 of 261 
 
structure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  And then it does not matter under 
what 
programme 
where 
a 
particular 
project 
can 
be 
implemented.  That is my answer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it a project that can be under a 
programme [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Yes, it will be under a programme. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  The project does not supersede the 
10 
programme. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, so the project is – can be part of a 
programme but a programme cannot be part of a project. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Pretorius, I am not sure whether you 
question was answered but you would know. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
Yes, 
there 
may 
be 
a 
I 
misunderstanding in relation to the question. 
20 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  No, there is no misunderstanding, 
as soon as …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, hang on, Mr Mahlobo, let Mr 
Pretorius …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The I misunderstanding might be 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 144 of 261 
 
on my part, Mr Mahlobo.  If you go to paragraph 5.2. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  I am there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You will see four bullets there.  
“Domestic intelligence R90 million. 
 Foreign intelligence R20 million 
 Minister ’s projects, R20 million. 
Total R130 million.” 
As I understand this document, that amount of R130 million 
which includes R20 million under the head, as we read it, 
Minister ’s projects, is the amount approved by you on the 
10 
16 November 2015? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  I have put it on record that the 
reflection calling it Minister ’s projects, it will have been 
used incorrectly and there is nothing supporting that 
because remember your first question was to say which 
projects?  I am on record for you, minister does not. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay.  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   And the other view that you put in 
to say no, no, no but all this money was going to projects, 
like these witnesses were trying to insinuate. 
20 
 
This document when it says Minister ’s Project is 
fundamentally wrong, and it is something that I see here 
and is something that is not even a practice and it is not 
even documented that can say this is Minster ’s Project but 
the whole submission Chair, do not lose the essence of the 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 145 of 261 
 
submission.  
The essence of the submission someone comes 
here because sometimes we must not beat up on the bush.  
Let us just go to the matter.  Someone says no, no but it is 
the Minister decided to actually give special operations for 
budgets, that submission here is a proof that they gave 
R130million.  The heading is clear, it is a secret services 
account at certain programs, needed resources.  
And in my own affidavit, if you noticed Chair, that I 
am even saying that it is certain programming projects 
10 
were actually over running budget.  And I thought that I 
should be able to do that but I see what Mr Peters is 
referring to the naming as Minister ’s Project.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  You see Mr Mahlobo we will 
make - I know you want progress, I want progress, Mr 
Pretorius wants progress, everybody wants progress. I 
accept that when you answer certain questions, you may 
have to explain yourself but where you are able to answer 
briefly, and to the point, it helps, you know…[intervene] 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   To do that one. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, do that but when I say that, I do not 
want you to feel that where there is a need to explain 
something you are being suppressed, because that is not 
the case.  
So let us all try Mr Pretorius, I was not sure 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 146 of 261 
 
whether you had actually formulated your question to Mr 
Mahlobo when he responded.  I know that you had said 
that in effect, if you put together those, the first three 
bullet points under 5.2 you get the total which is reflected 
in the fourth bullet point.  But I am not sure whether you 
took it further and I thought you were going to take it 
further. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I did as I understood it.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And I might not have understood 
10 
Mr Mahlobo’s previous answer, but that R130million was 
the amount approved by his signature on the last page of 
that doc but I think we are there at the moment.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, can…[intervene] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I may ask you to go to SSA1, page 
453 please. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before he does, he goes there Mr 
Pretorius may I ask this Mr Mahlobo, if you look at page 34 
the same documents that we have been looking at, page 34 
where your signature appears.  
20 
Can you see there is a line above your signature, 
and then the - then we see the words: 
“130 M, approval.” 
Whose handwriting is that, 130 M approval? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   That is my handwriting and that 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 147 of 261 
 
Chair, is in line with 5.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright.  And now, you - and 
then there is another 5.2, I see here on page 34 just above 
130 M, 5.2: 
“Has approved/not approved.” 
And the words not approved have been crossed out.  Did 
you cross them out or you cannot remember?  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Where you actually do not agree 
with the recommendation it is always crossed out but it, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no, I understand the import I 
10 
was just wanting to make sure that you crossed out not 
approved because you did not approve.  You did - because 
you were approving. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   The one that is remaining Chair, is 
the one that remains. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is the one that you were going along 
with, ja. Okay, now you have made the point that the 
Minister does not approve projects, okay.  But you have 
said that round about this time when this document – when 
you signed this document namely November 2015, would 
20 
be the time for reprioritisation I think. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   It is normally in terms of the 
calendar of adjustment and so forth.  They happen around 
September, October, November but it depends, it is not 
only that it is on a specific date.  
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 148 of 261 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now you must help me because when I 
look at – when I look at this document, my understanding 
is that it sort approval for what was dealt with in the letter 
and that seems to me to be approval of a budget for 
projects. Now, are you saying that is not what the 
document is about?  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Read it, read the heading Chair.  
There is always a heading there it says: 
“Approved for budget reprioritisation.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   If you want to reprioritise the 
budget, follow the Secret Services Act, there is a law and 
the most – the action for the utilisation on unexpended 
balance from the budget, blah, blah, blah, blah, required 
by programs in the mid-year review.  That is the heading, 
that is the purpose, self-explanation.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So are you saying that what you were 
approving was the reprioritisation…[intervene] 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Of the budget. 
CHAIRPERSON:   …of the budgets? 
20 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Because they cannot move - the 
authority to reprioritise the budget lies with me, in terms of 
the Secret Services Act with the concurrence of finance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Until I do that nobody must touch 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 149 of 261 
 
the money. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, Mr Pretorius. 
ADV ADONISI:   Chair, may I seek you indulgence and that 
of my colleague, Chair.  As you have noted, when the 
witness was testifying that being my client that he would 
have – when referred to the bundle.   
He will have said he has noted the document in 
reference 
to, 
but 
I 
have 
always 
been 
alive 
in 
the 
engagement with Advocate Wendell[?] and - but I just need 
indulgence to check because I have got a document when 
10 
we discovered – because maybe let me just say the bundle 
that 
now 
being 
referred 
we 
are 
assured 
that 
the 
confidentiality will be given at the hearing we do not have, 
so meaning myself and the client do not have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you do not have? 
ADV ADONISI:   Ja, but however, I have throughout the 
process of preparations and as the evidence has been led 
saw that there is almost a similar document that I just want 
to check through the Chair, with the indulgence of my 
colleague.  That on why to you as you have been guided, 
20 
and the paginated numbered pages 81 or so because on 
one, 
why, 
on 
1, 
2 
or 
so 
which 
is 
the 
discovered 
predicament we have at page zero thirty-four we do have a 
similar document but I am just checking with my colleague, 
whether, is it the same document that you are now 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 150 of 261 
 
referencing because it reads almost the same including 
what you have been canvassing now in evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV ADONISI:   And approval - so I just want to check. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, the document that we are talking 
about appears at least in terms of what I have here, in SSA 
bundle 1 and it starts at page three zero.  
It is addressed to the Honourable Minister, Mr D 
Mahlobo, it is dated 4 November 2015.  Is it the same 
document?  
10 
ADV ADONISI:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have the same document? 
ADV ADONISI:   I have the same document, what seems to 
be is not - maybe the pagination that has gone on some. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV ADONISI:   But I now know why I am lost in term of – 
thank you Chair. 
ADV ADONISI:   Okay, alright, Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   As I understand your evidence, Mr 
Mahlobo you ceased being Minister of State Security in 
20 
October 2017, is that correct?  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Would you go to page 453, please. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Of, under cover? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Of SSA 01. 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 151 of 261 
 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Under cover what? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, he wants you to tell him about A, D, 
C, D. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Ja, that is what helps me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That helps him. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well by the time we get there the 
alphabet has been exhausted.  So it is…[intervene] 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Maybe you will help me. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is 3, divider 3. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Remember the team that has 
10 
brought the documents in the morning they might have 
packed it otherwise, but the A’s, the B’s, the C, the D they 
have, its annexure what? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe Mr Pretorius…[intervene] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is divider 3, hard board divider 
3, it is right there by your printer. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Oh, three? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Okay, thank you for doing that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And go please to page 453. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   453? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Ja. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   453? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Okay I am there. 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 152 of 261 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, now I would like to put to 
you certain passages that appear later in the document.  
To place this document on record, it is a letter addressed 
to the Director General SSA and certain other parties dated 
the 31 s t of May 2016.  You see that?  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Yes, I see.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is a request for authorisation 
renewal 
of 
Cover 
Project 
Mayibuye 
and 
payment 
of 
expenditure related to Project Mayibuye from 1 April 2016 
to 31 March 2017. Do you see that? 
10 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you go under the heading 
background and explanation mention is made and a 
description is given, a description is given of the Project 
Mayibuye.  Do you see that? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you over the page to paragraph 
3, financial implications.  You will see there in the table 
nature of expense Project Mayibuye estimated amount 
R54,120,000.  Do you see that? 
20 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   On the next page, that is page 456 
of SSA 01 you will see under the heading compiler 
signature of code name Darrell.  Do you see that? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Yes.  
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 153 of 261 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And then underneath that you see 
recommended, not recommended is crossed out and the 
note as per instructions issued by the Minister and then 
there is a reference number.  Do you see that? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Yes, I see that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do you know anything about any 
instructions you issued in relation to Project Mayibuye? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I never issued an instruction and 
please note that if I had issued an instruction that had 
financial implication, any executive instruction will comply 
10 
with Section 64, Sub-section 64.1, 2 and 3 of the PFMA. 
Instructions must be in writing - I am not actually – 
let me not waste time, no instruction was issued and if any 
person says there was an executive instruction, he will 
produce to you that has financial implication in terms of 
the PFMA Section 64. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Underneath the words as per 
instruction issued by the Minister, Not entirely legible. 
CHAIRPERSON:   A date is given there on I think maybe 
06/05/2016 that is how I see it.  So in that handwritten part 
20 
seems to read: 
“As per instructions, or instructions issued by the 
Minister on 06/05/2016.” 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I see that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 154 of 261 
 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   And the answer is that if someone 
says there is an instruction from me on this date, that has 
financial implications and I am not aware of any such 
instruction, please ask them in terms of Section 64 of the 
PFMA to furnish the Commission.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Perhaps that document still exist, 
if it does exist. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Well, those who put it here they 
will have to help. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, and then if you go over the 
10 
page to page 457. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Four, five? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Seven.  
CHAIRPERSON:   The next page. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The next page.  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The first paragraph reads; 
“Recommended and not recommended, has been 
crossed out.” 
It seems that Matthew another pseudonym signed this on 
20 
the 31 s t of May 2016. It reads: 
“An amount required of 54 point, and I cannot read 
the rest, million for this project was not budgeted 
for in the current baseline allocation of FY16/17.” 
I presume that is financial year 2016/2017. 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 155 of 261 
 
“A request will be made to, now I cannot read the 
next word, funds from the retained earnings.” 
Now I think that is excess funds from the retained 
earnings. 
“The request for RE, I presume that is retained 
earnings, will have to be approved by the Minister 
after recommendation by the VP.” 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I see that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, and as I understand your 
evidence, there would be nothing at all unusual untoward 
10 
for you to approve the use of retained earnings. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   The law provides it because there 
is an Act retained earnings clearly define what are the 
conditions to do but in terms of this document it is their 
own conversation there.  I am not even involved in that 
conversation. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Beneath that is, what appears to 
be the signature of Dr BWJ Langer, Director Domestic 
Branch VP01 and his comment if I may put it on record is: 
“Recommended 
based 
on 
Ministers 
express 
20 
instruction and directed for payment to be made 
urgently.  It is also based on the expectation that all 
conditions prescribed cover projects in line with 
ODO9.1 will be complied with by the end of June 
20, and the rest is not legible.” 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 156 of 261 
 
Do you have any comment in regard to, he references there 
to an express instruction for payment to be made? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I have responded Chair, if 
someone says there is an instruction, let them give you in 
terms of Section 64. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you ever issue and express 
instruction and directive for payment to be made urgently 
in respect of Project Mayibuye? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I am saying Chair with due 
respect, if there is an instruction issued to me, as required 
10 
by the law, because I cannot ask people to do something 
outside the law.  Let them put it here and then I will deal 
with it, but there is no instruction here. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I did not follow the last part of your 
answer.  Do you recall whether you issued any such 
instruction? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Chair I have said if there is an 
instruction I have issued it has to be in writing and if 
anybody carries an instruction an executive directive or 
instruction outside the law, I cannot be held liable for that.  
20 
And if the instruction was issued and the instruction was 
illegal, the law is clear what we do, ultimately the matter 
must land with the National Treasury and the matter must 
land with Parliament, which is good. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And let us - I would like you to deal with 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 157 of 261 
 
the issue much more directly.  One, did you issue any 
written instruction? 
MINISTER 
MAHLOBO: 
 
 
Chairperson, 
there 
is 
no 
instruction I issued. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you issue a verbal instruction?  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   No instruction. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair.  If you could just 
bear with me a moment.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Would you go to page 36 please, 
that is in divider letter D, SSA1 page 36.  Do you see that 
document dated, it is a document dated 30 August 2016?  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It appears to be addressed to 
yourself, Minister for State Security Agency.  Do you see 
that?  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you would look at page, the last 
page 44 bundle SSA01.  Is that your signature there?  
20 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Yeah, that is my signature. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Under the head approved? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If, you can go back to paragraph 1, 
it reads: 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 158 of 261 
 
“The purpose of this submission is to request the 
Director General to recommend to the Minister of 
State 
Security 
to 
approve 
the 
utilisation 
of 
unexpended balance to fund urgent refurbishment of 
infrastructure, provincial property acquisition and 
augment funding for Special Operations, covert 
operational 
projects 
for 
the 
financial 
year 
2016/2017.” 
Do you see that? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Yes. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Then on the second page of that 
document which is SSA01, 37 there is a heading in the 
table Project Wave.  Do you see that? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Page what? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   See on page 37. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Okay, I see, yes I see. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Project Wave it says: 
“Objective 
of 
the 
project, 
Project 
Wave 
was 
specifically 
designed 
to 
intensify 
Special 
Investigations associated with CI/CE related cases 
20 
as identified outside the South African borders, 
such investigation will be undertaken by the same 
personnel utilised in Project Construcao.  The 
extent of the investigation is to be undertaken as 
per the client's request.” 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 159 of 261 
 
And then there is a list in the next box of the table: 
“Project activities and planned events, and the 
budget amount is R24million.” 
Do you see that? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Then over the page, there is 
another heading Project Construcao and certain project 
activities are listed against six bullets in the next box and 
planned events a budget of R24million.  Do you see that?  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Okay, yes.  
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And then 3: 
“Project Mayibuye, objective of the project, Project 
Mayibuye was specifically established to provide 
counterintelligence support that will enable to step 
up State authority and its organ of governance 
(justice, Parliament, provincial legislatures) against 
hostile 
behaviour 
or 
radical 
intents 
aimed 
at 
undermining the rule of law and governance in 
general.” 
Do you see that? 
20 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And then several project activities 
are listed, and the first: 
“Is to create an agent network within identified 
State apparatus.” 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 160 of 261 
 
Second bullet: 
“Continuously provide early warning information to 
the 
Chief 
Directorate 
Special 
Operations 
Management serves to advise a client accordingly.” 
Third bullet: 
“Monitor movements and activities of identified 
targets 
in 
order 
to 
confirm, 
or 
refute 
the 
involvement of the FIS influencing such behaviour. 
And fourthly: 
“Assist to influence decisions and thinking ways 
10 
within the target camp.” 
You see that?  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The way it reads or qualify 
probably, or even possibly reads, is that the target camp 
would be the State authority and its organs of government, 
including justice, Parliament and provincial legislature.  Do 
you agree or do you not agree? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I do not agree with you; it is not 
written here.  It is your proposition. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No, it is proposition I am putting to 
you as even a possible way of reading this, can you help 
us? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I do not want to speculate, 
remember, when they do projects I am not the approval 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 161 of 261 
 
authority to say this is a project plan how does it look like. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So, you cannot speculate as to 
what is meant here, to help us? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   No.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Then paragraph - in the 
table on page 39: 
“Project Academia, objective of the project to 
neutralise threats aimed at disrupting institutions of 
higher learning, identifying, neutralise, and disrupt 
any confirmed hostile forces.” 
10 
Third bullet: 
“Recruit and place strategic assets within the 
student leadership of institutions of higher learning.  
We 
look 
for 
support 
any 
form 
of 
government 
initiative that address issues of learning within 
institutions of higher education.” 
The project activities under Project Academia are:  
“Continuous engagement with student leadership 
and other relevant stakeholders, monitoring and 
evaluation of any form of activities, bandwidth in 
20 
institutions of higher education.” 
And third bullet: 
“Initiate any form of educational lectures that will 
assist in advancing understanding of government 
educational policies and programs.” 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 162 of 261 
 
And the budget for that is R8,867,100.  Do you have any 
comment? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Chair, let me help you, I am not 
going to comment on things I am on record right now that I 
am not part of the approval authority.  These are projects 
and I will not actually have the project concept document.  
And Mr Pretorius does not try to get an answer out of a 
stone, this answer applies to all projects.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, let us go to…[intervene] 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   And secondly, I will not want you 
10 
to comment and speculate on something that I was not 
privy to this project plan as per the approved document.  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is that is fine but Mr Pretorius 
will not necessarily know in advance in the gut which 
questions you will not be able to comment.   
So he may put questions and then you are free to 
say I cannot comment on it, and then move on. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   But Chair by they are the same, 
because these are both projects.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   And the difficulty I have, projects 
there is a clear mechanism that I have explained. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let him go according to his plan, from 
your side you will be able to say look, I cannot comment, 
and then he can move on, okay continue. 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 163 of 261 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do I understand the position 
correctly, then that, as appears from page 44, of SSA01 
when you approved expenditure for the utilisation of 
unexpended balance to fund covert operational projects, 
you do not know what those projects are? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Firstly the submission must not be 
read in part.  The approval was for the utilisation of the 
unexpected balance to fund refurbishment of infrastructure, 
property acquisition and lastly, covert projects.  And when 
it comes to projects, and those project details, they are not 
10 
in my page. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I understand your answer but it 
does appear from this document at least that you appended 
your signature to a document which named allocated 
money to and described project activities for a number of 
projects which have been the subject matter of evidence 
before the Chair. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Remember the approval - let me 
help, the approval in terms of the background, go to 2 
point what – is it 2.1 where it speaks that if you want to 
20 
reprioritise budgets and be able to take it from other 
programs to other programs, you have to get the Minister ’s 
authority, that is what it means.  Let us not put it the other 
way around, it is self-explanatory as I was empowered by 
the law. 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 164 of 261 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say we should go to 2.1? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is 2.1, I think at page 36, is that 
right?  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Yes, including even the purpose 
itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well 2.1 say: 
“The purpose of this submission is to request the 
Director General to recommend to the Minister of 
State 
Security 
to 
approve 
the 
utilisation 
of 
10 
unexpended balance to fund urgent refurbishment of 
infrastructure, provincial property acquisition and 
augment funding for special operations of covert 
operational 
projects 
or 
the 
financial 
year 
2016/2017.” 
And then 2.1 which is under background: 
“In the last, is that medium term budget MTEF 
cycles 2015/2016.  MTEF budget process is the 
agency led by its accounting officer and through 
MTC 
processes 
engage 
National 
Treasury 
to 
20 
appraise it about department medium term funding 
priorities. In essence, these priorities are informed 
by MTSF outcomes, Ministers action plan arising 
from 2015/2016 budget, both speech and strategic 
medium.” 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 165 of 261 
 
Okay. 
MINISTER 
MAHLOBO: 
 
 
…[speaking 
in 
vernacular] 
because it becomes more useful, what is the law, law that 
you not touch these monies under a certain condition that 
is what is the essence of the submission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let us just continue the description 
of the projects contained in this document that you signed 
and approved.  Mr Mahlobo, the next project is Project 
Khusela, that is project number five on page 39: 
10 
“The objective of the project includes devising 
strategies to counter the designs and plans of FIS 
and 
other 
forces 
seeking 
to 
undermine 
the 
constitutional order in South Africa.” 
You have referred to that type of objective in your 
evidence, but the project activities include: 
“Mobilisation, staging of rallies, media influence, 
and infiltrating organised youth formation.” 
Do you see that? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Yes, I see do. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Budget, R25,180,000. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And finally there is on page 40, 
Project Tin Roof.  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Yes, I do. 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 166 of 261 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The project activity there is: 
“The project is informed by a situational analysis 
that 
highlights 
a 
range 
of 
security 
threats 
confronting 
the 
client 
environment 
and 
related 
institutions.” 
Would it be reasonable to infer that the client there is the 
former President? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I will, I will not disclose that and 
in this document, there is no such disclosure. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, and the budget for that 
10 
Project Tin Roof is R8million, simply then what I need to 
put to you is when you signed this disapproval, did you 
read the document? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Chairperson, the document is self-
explanatory, there is nowhere in this document that says 
we are approving projects. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but hang on Mr Mahlobo the 
question is did you read the document? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I read the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   But also the line also want to 
create an impression, let us not lose - I want to put it for 
my own record for you. The purpose of the approval is not 
amounting to approval of projects but there you have a 
description, what these things mean.  
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 167 of 261 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Pretorius.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The approval on page 44 is the 
approval 
for 
the 
expenditure 
of 
money 
on 
covert 
operational projects.  You see that? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   No but on page 44 the approval is 
written there on top: 
“Is approval of the utilisation of the unexpended 
balance to fund refurbishment of infrastructure, 
property acquisition and covert operational project.” 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
Yes, 
well, 
I 
just 
left 
out 
10 
what…[intervene] 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   No, let us not leave it out because 
we are using one document.  I will have a difficulty Chair 
with your permission.  Where is - you know what, you go 
and select one point, let us read the whole thing - what is 
the approval as on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is a fair point. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am perfectly happy to do that Mr 
Mahlobo.  The approval that you gave on the 2 n d of 
September 2016 under your signature in a document whose 
20 
purpose was to: 
“Request the Director General to recommend to the 
Minister of State Security to approve the utilisation 
of unexpended balance to fund urgent refurbishment 
of infrastructure provincial property acquisition and 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 168 of 261 
 
augment funding for Special Operations covert 
projects for the financial year 2016/2017.” 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Where you reading that? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 1 on page 36. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Okay, page 36, sub-paragraph 
what? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, paragraph 1.  I simply want to 
put…[intervene] 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   No, no I just want to be sure, are 
you referring to 1.1? 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   1.1.  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   There is no word, yes that is the 
purpose clearly defined. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Sorry, there is no word? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I am saying that is the purpose as 
you see there it is clearly defined what was this meant for. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, sure.  What I am putting to 
you is that the covert operational project referred to in 
paragraph 1 and referred to above your signature on page 
44 are the projects outlined in four pages of this document. 
20 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Yeah, that is - those are the one 
that you see them outlined. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair, I am aware that they are at 
the 
counsel 
here, 
and 
I 
need 
to 
save 
it 
I 
suppose…[intervene] 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 169 of 261 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no…[intervene] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is obviously in your hands, but 
we will be a while still unless we break now. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
I 
think 
we 
should 
take 
a 
short 
adjournment and then I could have a discussion in 
chambers with yourself and the Evidence Leader in the 
next work stream and counsel for Mr Mahlobo I think 
should come as well so that we talk about how we are 
going to deal with the situation.  As well as the counsel for 
Mr Gigaba or if he is here and for Mr Gigaba if they are 
10 
here. 
So we will take a short adjournment of 15 minutes 
and then we will resume after that and I will indicate what 
will happen.  We adjourn.  
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe I should just allow Mr Myburgh to 
say something to me about the work stream that was 
supposed to start with the application. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes thank you Chairperson.  This 
20 
relates to the application SEQ18 of 2021 Mr Gigaba’s 
application.  I have spoken to his Counsel Mr Solomon.  Mr 
Solomon has informed me that he is not available at seven 
o’clock tonight to move the application. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well okay thank you, thank you.  What was 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 170 of 261 
 
going to – for the plan for today was that I was going to hear 
Mr Mahlobo’s evidence and when he finished I was going to 
hear an application by Mr Gigaba for certain relief in relation 
to Ms Noma Gigaba’s evidence and thereafter depending on 
the outcome of that application I could hear Ms Gigaba’s 
evidence. 
 
Due to the technical – the problems of technology 
that happened this morning we have not been able to finish 
Mr Mahlobo’s evidence within the time that we thought we 
would finish it.  The arrangement that has been made is that 
10 
we are not going to interrupt Mr Mahlobo’s evidence we will 
continue and try and finish his evidence and the hearing of 
Ms Gigaba’s evidence is adjourned to Tuesday this coming 
week and will take place during the evening session so all 
concerned should be here at four o’clock we might be able to 
start at four or we might be able to start at five. 
 
I understand that Mr Gigaba’s Counsel is not able to 
move his application this evening.  What they will do about 
that application I leave it to them but the evidence or hearing 
of Ms Gigaba’s evidence is scheduled for Tuesday evening if 
20 
- they will decide and make an approach if they wish to in 
terms of their application but I will not strike it off as such 
maybe I should just adjourn it although it could be 
permissible but I will adjourn it without fixing any 00:04:09.  
Okay. 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 171 of 261 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you. May we be excused? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you are excused.  Thank you.  Counsel 
for Mr Mahlobo was not able to be with us during the 
discussion but I understood what happened but I think what 
we discussed has not prejudiced him or his time in any way. 
ADV ADONISI:  Yes thank you Chair may – let me take this 
opportunity to apologise I misunderstood the fifteen minutes 
or whether it was outside that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV ADONISI: 
Yes 
but 
I 
have 
been 
briefed 
by 
my 
colleagues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV ADONISI:  Yes (inaudible). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright.  Thank you.  Okay we – we will 
continue then – we are effectively continuing into the 
evening to try and finish.  Okay alright.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Mahlobo would 
you please go to… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I am sorry Mr Pretorius I forgot to 
mention something for the benefit of the public.  I think the 
commission had announced a few days ago or maybe 
yesterday that Ms Lynne Brown former Minister of Public 
Enterprises was also going to give evidence today.  It seems 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 172 of 261 
 
that that could not happen because of certain challenges.  
So from her side I think she was not aware that she was 
requested for today so another date should be arranged.  
Okay alright.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Mahlobo would 
you look at Bundle SSA2 please?  It is the other one – yes.   
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  I am going to break my arm – this 
thing is heavy.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Mahlobo you are – are you learning to 
refer to Bundles? 
10 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Remember where I come from Bab 
Zondo they use different names.  There is always a 00:06:47 
for every place where we work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  It is like when I said assets it does 
not mean the financial assets you know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  I am on Bundle 02 now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If you would go please to page 431 
20 
which is behind the divider YY12.  If I might just place on 
record Chair whilst Mr Mahlobo is finding the page. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  I have got it now. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You have.  All the affidavits of 
Dorothy in our possession are in fact in the bundles before 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 173 of 261 
 
you now and before Minister Mahlobo and with me.  Page 
431 is an affidavit of Dorothy in response to a request for an 
affidavit issued by the commission. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  431 ne? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  You said something about this affidavit Mr 
Pretorius and I am not sure if 00:08:31. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It was issued or attested to and given 
to the commission in response to a request. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Made to her by the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I see it is dated 10 April 2019 it was 
deposed to on the 10 (inaudible). 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Page 431 of SSA02. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no I am sorry I think I was looking at 
the last page of a different affidavit. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The last page of her affidavit is what 
page? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Page … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  445? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  445 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  2n d of March 2021. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no I was looking at the last page 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 174 of 261 
 
of another affidavit which I thought was the last page of her 
affidavit.  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Could you go please to page 441 Mr 
Mahlobo in fact we should start at page 440.  440 has 
several reference to documents and they are all tabulated or 
referenced to the documents is tabulated and at the bottom 
of page 440 is a reference to M19.  A submission dated 29 
November 2016 requesting authorisation to pay the related 
expenses for Project Mayibuye for the month of November 
2016 and comments by Dorothy: 
10 
“This is one of the instances where I took 
R4.51 million in cash to Minister Mahlobo at 
his residence.  I do not know how the invoice 
from 
Nyvasha 
was 
generated 
for 
the 
settlement or how it was provided by Lilly.  It 
appears that I initially took R470 000.00 and 
then the balance later as sometimes there 
was insufficient cash available.” 
Do you have any comment? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Well Chairperson this is the part that 
20 
we spoke earlier on if you recall and you asked Mr Pretorius, 
my team and the team for Dorothy to have that short 
discussion and I suppose to start to – to want me to start to 
engage on this document it is going to be problematic until 
we have actually sorted that particular point.  That is my – 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 175 of 261 
 
that is my comment.   
And 
– 
but 
without 
actually 
trying 
to 
stop 
the 
interaction but you have made a ruling that there is a 
process because I have made a statement and the Counsel – 
Honour his learned – my learned friend here on behalf of 
Dorothy there are certain things you have said.  Let them 
conclude that thing and if this will be the only outstanding 
matter in particular with Dorothy when we are able to clarify 
the existence or the non-existence as I was saying of that 
other document.   
10 
I will be able to find a way to come either in a form of 
an affidavit or what – a supplementary one to clarify for you.  
But at this stage I think we are going to be having this up 
and downs on a matter that is on the table right now.  That is 
my request. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Chair if there is a relief whether 
correct or not correct that there is another affidavit which is 
relevant to what is contained in the affidavits and transcripts 
that are now wanted to put to Mr Mahlobo then in fairness he 
should 
20 
a. Be reassured that such an affidavit exists or does not 
exist and 
b. If it does exist to be entitled to refer to it insofar as it 
contradicts this evidence. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  But I will… 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 176 of 261 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on, hang on Mr Mahlobo let Mr 
Pretorius finish. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Thank you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So it may be necessary for that 
exercise which we trust and hope will reassure Minister 
Mahlobo that there is no such affidavit but he should have an 
opportunity to reassure himself of that. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Well I would also ask this Chair with 
your permission the comment that monies were – were sent 
to my house that is not true and there is a process.  You see 
10 
one of the things we must deal with is that it is to create a 
different organisation just where it may be needed.  And if 
there is any person who alleges that I took money and 
against the policy directive and the control measures that I 
have referred to in the Ministerial Payment Directive and in 
terms of the 00:15:05 they will give the specificity of the 
time, the date and the documentary evidence that this is 
where Minister Mahlobo actually gave the – take – took this 
money.   
Because the system is clear those who go and take 
20 
money and those who receive money they have to be able to 
actually those internal controls are there.  You receive it, you 
sign for it, both who gave it and then the – and even that one 
and the – in any instance where those particular details are 
given here to say to this is the date, this is the proof that 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 177 of 261 
 
you did it I will be able to help you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the – but what – part of what you have 
said is you say there was no such money that was brought to 
your residence. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Yes, 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  And if there is such the person who 
alleges that they will give you the time, the date and there is 
always a document that those who receive it and those who 
deliver it they all sign. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So are you saying there is a 
procedure that is followed when cash is delivered to your 
residence? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  I have never said that way.  I said 
any person who takes money from the agency the Ministerial 
Payment Directive was the process the OD is still.  You 
cannot take cash without internal controls.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well I think the whole point of the 
evidence is that there were no internal controls. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh Mr Pretorius let him finish. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  No I am on record Chair.  There is 
no money given to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The controls that you talking about are 
controls that relate to taking money within SSA for purposes 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 178 of 261 
 
of SSA’s operations. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  It does not even matter whether it is 
operations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja to take money. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  For every acquisition you made there 
are clear rules and processes and there is also an 
accountability mechanism and internal controls. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If you could just bear with me a 
moment please Chair.  You will go please to another part of 
10 
the affidavit which is on page 437 of SSA2 please.  There 
the text reads: 
“Hence the amount of R1.5 million expenses 
related to SONA that is the State of Nation 
Address I was deployed to Cape Town for the 
State of Nation Address event.  During my 
deployment I was instructed by Mr Fraser to 
receive a bag of money from one security 
employer of SSA and to take the same to 
Minister Mahlobo.  I met the SSA member 
20 
and collected the bag of money as was 
instructed from him.  I then handed the 
money to the Minister Mahlobo personally at 
his official residence.  I cannot recall if he 
signed for it or not nor how the TA was 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 179 of 261 
 
settled.” 
Do you have any comment in relation to that? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  The affidavit is clear there is no 
evidence to say the money was delivered.  There is no 
evidence to say the TA was signed or not.  When you present 
a TA the TA is a temporary advance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but you see Mr Mahlobo do not place 
too much evidence or too much weight on whether there was 
a document or not that was signed because money can be 
given without the person receiving it signing to say I have 
10 
received it.  So when you answer these I think it is important 
for you to deal with the allegation head on. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  I am dealing with it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja.  So  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  My answer … 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was no – nothing in writing but was 
it – did you receive such money? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  There is no money I received. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV ADONISI:  Chair may I also get an opportunity on your 
20 
clarity or what the direction Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ADONISI:  But I think you my – you might have to have 
listened to him because the question and how the statement 
is read it says: 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 180 of 261 
 
“I am not sure whether the TA was signed or 
not.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes. 
ADV ADONISI:  So it brings about whether or not there was 
a TA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ADONISI:  Which my client is now trying to explain the 
issue of the signing or not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV ADONISI:  It is not placing too much weight I think the 
10 
Chair should note. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no, no I think that may be fair 
enough.  But I think what I wanted to emphasise to him was 
when there is an allegation that he was given money he 
should not think his answer is adequate if he says where is 
the receipt where I signed?  He should be able to say if he 
says I did not receive any money he say I did not receive 
any money and he can go on if he wants to - to say whoever 
says he gave me money let them produce a receipt.  I just 
want to be (talking over one another.) 
20 
ADV ADONISI:  We are helpful Chair the answer is no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja okay.  Thank you.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And just to refer to M19 and I am 
going to ask you to take the other bundle – apologise SSA1 
at page 504.   
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 181 of 261 
 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  It is M9? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  SSA1. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  And then on the cover? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Do not worry about M19 for the 
moment it is SSA1 at page 504.   
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Yes but you are spoiling our tea 
party. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I will help you Mr Mahlobo. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  He is spoiling our tea party now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I will – I will help you because I 
10 
understand what helps you – 504 you said Mr Pretorius? 
ADV VUMBI:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  504 Mr… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Behind Divider – behind Divider 3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Somewhere close towards the – then 
end of that page – close to – to Divider 4.  Yes. 
ADV VUMBI:  Thank you Chair.  Chair I am having serious 
difficulties here.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VUMBI:  Firstly we are dealing with my client which we 
20 
found out on the last hours that my client will be dealt with 
today and we had… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would be? 
ADV VUMBI:  Will be part of the – the proceedings of today.  
And then we had to take it upon ourselves to contact the 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 182 of 261 
 
commission so that we must present.  So I think right now Mr 
Pretorius is dealing with my client but I do not have a bundle 
or anything that I need to refer to right now.  I am just 
working 
with 
the 
little 
knowledge 
that 
I 
have 
from 
consultation and from whatever that I can relate to which is 
in my file but I do not have a bundle from the commission 
and they are dealing with my client and I do not think that 
is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you have never received it before? 
ADV VUMBI:  No not even that they will be dealing with my 
10 
client today was notified to us.  We had to go an extra mile 
because of the media statement that came out that Minister 
will be appearing here today.  So for some reason we felt 
that it means also my client might be implicated or somehow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it may be that you might not need to 
have the whole bundle but it seems certainly you ought to 
have any document that may refer to your client in one way 
or another.  Mr Pretorius have you got something to say? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes a 3.3 Notice was sent with 
excerpts of this evidence on the 19 t h of March 2021.  It was 
20 
sent I think electronically but I am not sure about whether it 
was hard copy or electronically. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it sent to … 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes the attorneys for Mahlobo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was sent to – was it sent to Ms – to 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 183 of 261 
 
Dorothy’s legal representatives? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Oh not to Dorothy’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that – that is his concern.  He says the 
evidence of Mr Mahlobo does affect his client Dorothy and 
there are references to bundles but he has not been given 
bundles – any bundle and I was saying well he was not given 
this bundle I think he says.  I said to him it may be that he 
did not need to be given the whole bundle but certainly any 
affidavit or document that may have – may affect his client 
should have been given. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well if you could just bear with me a 
moment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Please. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If – if by any chance there is a spare 
bundle that can be lent to him to say the least we could 
continue while he uses that and then later on whatever the 
problem is can be sorted out. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes I am – for the life of me I do not 
understand why Dorothy’s Counsel or attorney should not 
20 
have the affidavit.  I would have assumed that he did.  I am 
not aware of the delivery. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And passage of documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja.  Maybe – should we take an 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 184 of 261 
 
adjournment so that it is addressed because I think his 
concern is he is not able to follow the witness’ evidence 
properly because he does not have documents that he 
should have. 
ADV VUMBI:  Chair if I can make this simple.  I am 
communicating with the legal team here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VUMBI:  As they are talking. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VUMBI:  If they can just maybe – because I think she is 
10 
saying it is the affidavit that my client did provide to them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VUMBI:  So if it is that which they are going to be 
dealing with only. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VUMBI:  I can just have that affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VUMBI:  They can give me that document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VUMBI:  And then if it is the only thing that they will be 
20 
touching on then I do not think there is any problem I can 
always just refer to the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Chair I would like to sort this out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 185 of 261 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  For the convenience of my learned 
friend. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But I must point out that this affidavit 
came from his office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well it may well be that – well it – 
specify again what date the affidavit is so he can check in 
his file if he has got it. 
ADV VUMBI:  May I come with a suggestion? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV VUMBI:  And I think that is the proposition that the 
witness was trying to say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VUMBI:  Not 00:27:24 at this juncture.  I think initially 
you wanted to propose that we take a five minutes break and 
I will propose that because… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VUMBI:  It will – it will enhance the efficiency of this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VUMBI:  Hence we will also have to discuss all the 
20 
affidavits that have been filed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VUMBI:  I think that is – at this juncture that we need to 
do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 186 of 261 
 
ADV VUMBI:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No maybe let us take a ten minutes break 
– five minutes might be too short.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  No we have – we can try and provide 
a spare copy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have provided a spare copy. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We do not have spare copies.  These 
affidavit emanate from the attorneys for – for Dorothy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you got a copy? 
ADV VUMBI:  Ja I have got a copy Chair and I understand 
10 
the – it seems like they are not getting my point.  My point is 
not that we did not submit the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VUMBI:  My point is what they are touching on right 
now I should have made – been made aware that we will 
dealing with his affidavit today so that I can be able to 
follow.  So I am just getting a surprise as and when Mr 
Pretorius is talking. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV VUMBI:  So I am saying if my client will be part of the 
20 
proceedings today I should have been notified and given 
only those parts of which they are going to be dealing with 
which includes my client not that we did not submit the 
affidavit.  We did submit the affidavit but what you are 
dealing with I must be made aware.  I think that is how the 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 187 of 261 
 
commission operates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no I think let us take a ten minutes 
break.  You can have a discussion with Mr Pretorius and Mr 
Pretorius can have a discussion with you to make sure that 
going forward when we resume there is clarity on your part 
as to which affidavits will be referred to that may affect your 
client. 
ADV VUMBI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that when we – when we resume then 
the way forward is clear.   
10 
ADV VUMBI:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let us adjourn for ten minutes.  We 
adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are we able to proceed? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, I am instructed that or I am 
told that we can proceed.  That the thought that there was 
a contradictory affidavit has also been sorted out but I will 
20 
get 
proper 
instructions 
and 
placed 
them 
before 
you 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...on record.  It appears that it 
rested in a possible misreading but I do not want to half 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 188 of 261 
 
the submission to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I will put the whole – but all those 
issues related to the affidavits, even the missing affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...resolve that... [Speaker not 
clear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But Mr Mahlobo, would you go to 
SSA-1 at 505?  The only reason I put this document before 
10 
is the document request for authorisation for funds signed 
by Dorothy on page 508 for funds for Project Mayibuye in 
the sum of R 4 510 000,00.  I want to put it before you if 
you wish to comment on it.  Only if you want. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I have no comment. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And then, on page – if I can ask 
you, please, to go to SSA-2 again?   
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
You 
spoke 
away 
from 
your 
mic, 
Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If I can ask you to go to SSA-2 
20 
again, page 441? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Four hundred and...? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   41. 
CHAIRPERSON:   441? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   441.  After the divider YY-12.  You 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 189 of 261 
 
had before you.  I would just like to refer you to paragraph 
13 there, 13.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it is Bundle 2? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Bundle 2, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Are we back ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, it is 13 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...Ms Dorothy’s affidavit? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair.  Page 441, 13.1.  The 
affidavit reads: 
“I confirm that I have on three occasions 
10 
withdrew 
R 4.5 million 
by 
instruction 
of 
Mr Darryl 
to 
hand 
the 
money 
over 
to 
Mr Mahlobo...” 
 
Do you have any comment? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   3-18.1-39? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you got the page Mr Mahlobo, page 
441? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   No, no.  I am there.  It is sub-
paragraph 13. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Where my name is referred to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   And my answer.  It is a denial. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Well, I guess you cannot 
deny that Mr Darryl gave instructions but what you can 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 190 of 261 
 
deny is that money was handed over to you. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Then if I can ask you, please, to go 
to SSA-2, page 460? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Yes, I am there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   This is an affidavit of Dorothy in 
response to 3.3. Notice issued in relation to the evidence 
of Lloyd Mhlanga.   
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Yes, I can see. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It does say in paragraph 2.2: 
“I have never told Mr Mhlanga that I have 
given 
the 
alleged 
cash 
withdrawals 
to 
Mr Mahlobo...” 
 
But she does go over the page to say the 
following and I am going to read on page 461 and 462, 
paragraphs 2.3 to 2.2.1: 
“In 
absence 
of 
schedules 
of 
the 
cash 
withdrawals of R 4.5 million, I am only able to 
recall having done so on three occasions...” 
20 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   What is the number, again? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You have it?  Page 461 of 2. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   No, no.  Yes, the subparagraph. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 2.3. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   2.3.   
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 191 of 261 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Right-hand top. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And I am going to read these 
paragraphs and then you can comment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Right at the top.  Can you see 
...[intervenes]  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   No, no.  I am onboard.  I see 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   And I have given on the other 
page. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   If he can just refer to the numbers, 
then I will respond. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  2.4: 
“At all material times, I made the temporal 
advance in my name.  
2.5 
The documents for settlement and 
preparation for settlement of each temporal 
advance was done my colleague, known as 
20 
Lilly, in the State Capture Commission.   
2.6 
I would sign off - it should read - the 
request for temporal advancement in my name.   
They are prepared by Lilly and also signed off, 
the settlement documents in my name that are 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 192 of 261 
 
prepared by Lilly.   
2.7 
I would then go to the finance section 
with Lilly and the cashier will count the money 
in front of me and Lilly.   
2.8 
Lilly always brought the bag where 
the money would be packed by myself and 
Lilly.   
2.9 
The money would then be taken to 
the official residence in Waterkloof of the 
former Minister Mahlobo. 
10 
2.10 
On the first occasion I delivered it 
alone, on the second and third occasions I was 
accompanied by Lilly. 
2.11 
I got involved in the cash withdrawals 
because I was told by Mr Darryl that I should 
do so because I am acting in his position and 
he used to do the same and take money to 
former Minister Mahlobo. 
2.12 
I 
was 
acting 
in 
the 
position 
of 
Mr Darryl because he was acting in another 
20 
senior position. 
2.13 
I was made to inherit all that he used 
to do and continue to do it. 
2.14 
I was specifically instructed by Darryl 
to agree that my name be used and also to 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 193 of 261 
 
collect and deliver to Minister Mahlobo. 
2.15 
At no stage did Darryl or Mr Mahlobo 
informed me of the purpose and objective of 
the withdrawals and the delivery of cash. 
2.16 
At no stage did Mr Mahlobo ask me to 
make the temporal advance a clause(?). 
2.17 
At 
no 
stage 
did 
Darryl 
of 
Minister Mahlobo 
informed 
(I 
am 
reading 
literally) me of the objective of the objective 
and 
ultimate 
destination 
of 
the 
cash 
I 
10 
delivered. 
2.18 
As an Intelligence Officer, one of the 
cornerstone values of Intelligence is always 
“work on a basis of need to know” principle. 
2.19 
The 
environment 
in 
which 
I 
was 
working is in his covert operations and the 
officers were unknown to many SSA members. 
2.20 
On delivery of the money, I would be 
ushered by Minister Mahlobo to his home 
office where I would remove the money and 
20 
count it. 
2.21 
Having counted it in front of him and 
having satisfied himself that it is R 4.5 million, 
I would leave the money and the suitcase with 
him...” 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 194 of 261 
 
 
Do you have a comment on that evidence? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Well, where specifically my name 
is mentioned, my answer, it is a no. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Dorothy also conducted an 
interview with the investigations under Operation Veza, the 
Internal SSA Investigation.  The transcript together with 
certain other affidavits of Dorothy were supplied to the 
Commission by the SSA under certain conditions. 
 
The conditions were that they could not be made 
public but could be used in evidence.  I interpreted that to 
10 
mean that – and I have instructed that that means, if that 
to be used in evidence, Dorothy can obviously have sight 
of them as can Dorothy’s counsel but they should not go on 
the website in due course.   
 
The transcript of Dorothy’s evidence with the 
SSA investigators has been declassified and it is in the 
paper bundle before you, the plastic bundle and it is in... 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   You know.  Sorry, can I interject 
here? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Sorry, you have a plastic folder 
20 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV ADONISI:   Chair, I think we have made the point and 
we came grudgingly on this issue of discovery and 
prejudice recorded.  I think it has been cleared. 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 195 of 261 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV ADONISI:   We have tried in attempted to, at least, 
clarity to ourselves as the counsel the administrative issue 
how it happened that my client had to testify on a 
deliberation(?), new evidence that...   
 
Chair, it has also now become apparent that, his 
other affidavits and/or documents, which now also relates 
to us and these are not I our possession.  These are not 
even discovered and that is worrisome because we have 
had on several occasions. 
10 
 
And you will see if you go through the affidavit 
that has been placed with the constraints that we have 
raised that it cannot be correct Chair that we are subjected 
to this and in particular when my learned colleagues have 
in their possession, whether it is extra stipulations or 
otherwise. 
 
At least for the relevant – where it is relevant to 
us, it should have been provided.  Worse when it has now 
since testified.  So we have had engagements until the 
early hours of the morning.  We were promised that in 
20 
actual fact there would be some documents that are 
classified, not into the way my learned colleague is 
proposing now before you. 
 
That we will be provided with copies for the 
relevance of us following the proceedings this morning and 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 196 of 261 
 
that is how we accepted and subjected ourselves to it even 
because we wanted to but it has become apparent that 
there is – and this is probably where the issues of 
concealment and otherwise but I will use it in context... 
 
That there are further documents and affidavits 
that mention us and deposed by this relevant person that 
are not in our possession and that is worrisome because as 
to why they are not in our possession, in particularly, when 
they have made reference.   
 
And we have been given 3.3. Notice in particular 
10 
with this witness and the extracts that are relevant to us 
but it seems like there is over and above what has met our 
eye in deliberation that has been discovered and I do not 
want to cast suspicions by doing so but it is clear that 
there is more. 
 
The worse now, even records.  And you will have 
noted, Chair, and you will see as we progress, there is also 
correspondence to the effect, be it on difference of opinion 
of 
how 
we 
interpreted 
discovery 
but 
one 
thing 
is, 
essentially is that, we griped and we have written to the 
20 
SSA itself on declassify and providing information for us to 
be able to submit in either in any election of whether oral 
or...   
 
That has not been done until we are here.  So.  
And this is a situation and that will be an injustice.  
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 197 of 261 
 
Although we are not in court, Chair, but we still have to 
respect the framework of the legal, the framework that is of 
principles of discovering, principles of ...[indistinct] and 
otherwise.  That is my submission Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV ADONISI:   I am not trying to be obstructive. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV ADONISI:   And you have realised that we have kept 
quiet and my client has also said that:  Look, to the extent 
that I would participate with – despite the fact that there 
10 
were late discoveries. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV ADONISI:   But it cannot correct that my learned 
colleague now has declassified information and it is 
relevant to their own understanding as stipulated what they 
think is relevant but now when you are leading evidence, it 
seems like now these other paragraphs that they were not 
provided to us of the same document even. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay.   
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Maybe Chair I can also add 
20 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Hang 
on 
Mr Mahlobo. 
 
Hang 
on 
Mr Mahlobo.  Your counsel has raised a certain point and I 
would like to hear what Mr Pretorius has to say about that 
point before we go further.  Mr Pretorius. 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 198 of 261 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, these are the documents that 
were declassified on the 25 t h of March this year and were 
declassified on the condition that they should not be given 
to anyone else but could be used in evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And it is on that basis that they 
have been used.  They were all – these documents were 
supplied to Mr Mahlobo and Mr Mahlobo’s attorneys past 
few days.  That is the factual position. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Well, I do not know whether you 
10 
have that mister ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I want to come in, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, hang on.  Let me first hear from 
your counsel. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...represents you Mr Mahlobo.  Let me 
hear him. 
ADV ADONISI:   Chair, I can see my learned colleague is 
constraint to accept and to an extent he is, with respect, to 
say that they have not discovered and this declassification 
20 
has happened on the 25 t h of March. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, let me just make sure that you and I 
are on the same page in terms of what we understand him 
to say.  My understanding of what he is saying is that the 
documents to which he wants to refer the witness were 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 199 of 261 
 
supplied to you on the 25 t h of March.  That is what my – I 
understand him to say.  Is that your understanding as well? 
ADV ADONISI:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is not your understanding? 
ADV ADONISI:   No – yes ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you proceed, let me clarify with 
Mr Pretorius.  Is my understanding ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Sorry, I have been corrected Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m?  You have been in – corrected? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   These documents originated from 
10 
the SSA.  They were documents given to the SSA or 
testified to before the SSA in terms and in relation to the 
transcript 
and 
all 
classified. 
 
We 
requested 
those 
documents and we were given then under condition that 
they were not to be given to anyone.  That was the 
condition.  But could be used in evidence.   
 
Now, obviously, if it can be used in evidence, we 
can disclose them, deal with them in evidence.  That is my 
interpretation and that is the instruction I have been given.  
But the Legal Team, apparently prior to that, did not give 
20 
them.  So these documents were not given over the last 
few days.  They were given now. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Chair, I want to come in because it 
is my reputation here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 200 of 261 
 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   You see, Chairperson.  I repeat.  I 
have utmost respect. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I never wanted to deal with some 
of the things happening in your office for a particular 
cause. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   This document was brought by the 
investigators this morning.  Even my lawyer does not have 
this document.  They brought this document in the morning.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   What I have done, Chair, to assist 
the Commission.  The issues referred to on 3.3, I have 
furnished the affidavit.  I will not comment on this 
document that was given this morning and I have not read 
it.   
 
But those guys, when they came this morning, I 
know it is coming from Project Veza.  These documents 
that I have allowed myself, even under constraint, to speak 
to, they were sent, even this bundle.  Late hours, 
20 
yesterday in the evening.  I went through this document 
until two a.m.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   That this one that he says from 
SSA, it has been declassified.  I was not given but the 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 201 of 261 
 
instance of the accusation made about me, not the 
consideration of other people, I have responded to that 
issue, like I am dealing with the question of the...  But I am 
not, Chair, going to get into the document that was given 
this morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no.  You may remember – well, 
one, let me deal with the – what your counsel raised now.  
I think it is common cause now that the documents were 
not given to you.  I think that is common cause.  Okay.  
Just to go to deal with what you have just said Mr Mahlobo. 
10 
 
You will recall that I have said before lunch, at 
some stage, that any documents that you may have 
received late, we would – I would be happy if you say:  
These ones I am able to deal with them even if I have 
received them late. 
 
But if there are others where you say you are not 
able to deal with them or answer questions on them 
because you have received them late, that would be 
acceptable. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   If we are assisting us(?), Chair.  
20 
These document written Exhibit YY-13 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, h’m? 
MINISTER 
MAHLOBO:   ...of an internal discussion 
between people in SSA.  I was not given to and I am not 
going to deal with it.  And also on record, Chair, because 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 202 of 261 
 
one of the things that we must not allow is to create 
perception because ...[indistinct] strong.  In politics, they 
mean a lot. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   The people of SSA they came 
here.  Ms K who was running the project, they have told 
you this Project Veza is incomplete.  Someone is bringing 
a conversation of other people of an incomplete document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   But to save time and reserving my 
10 
right, I am not going to comment on Exhibit YY-13.  And I 
am prepared, Chair, despite the constraints I have been 
subject to, because I am of the view there was no malice 
from the Secretariat.  I will deal with issues on Bundle 1 
and Bundle 2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mister ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, we can always recall 
Mr Mahlobo’s notice. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no I am satisfied. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Until he has had a chance to look 
at the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  Let him not be questioned on the 
document that he has not had chance to look at.  Okay 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 203 of 261 
 
alright.  I think that covers your concern? 
ADV ADONISI:   Ja, Chair, your intelligence has given me 
light(?), because otherwise, there is a secondary argument 
to this but I think your summary has been embracive and 
we will think – we take queue from that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Thank you, Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I must just place on record, Chair, 
that it is not as if the State Security Agency opened their 
doors to the Commission and allowed us to obtain any 
documents we wish.  It has been a continuous investigative 
10 
process that has taken place over a long period of time.  
So that it explains the fact that not everything was 
obtained at one time and certain requests ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   For that ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...or a request had to be made 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, Mr Mahlobo. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...over a period of time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Thank you, Chair.  But let it also 
20 
be on record, this one so that South Africans know what 
are we dealing with.  SSA, the acting Director General 
then, has a lot of correspondence from my legal team, 
requesting documentation.  These correspondence was 
also copied to your offices and I hope you had sight of 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 204 of 261 
 
them.  Not a document has been given to date by them.   
 
And I do not want to deal with the motive that 
they continued to politicise and weaponize using this 
platform.  That is why I am happy with your ruling but 
where I am uncomfortable, like I have told you about the 
exhibit that they have just given. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I am not venturing.  But that is 
why the Commission has been caused problems.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
10 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   We are even in court now because 
other people that are implicated by people in SSA, they are 
refusing to give them documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   And the instruction that was given 
by His Excellency when the then President and our current 
President was that we should do whatever it is to support 
the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   But there are certain institutions 
20 
and SSA in particular, not the whole institution, the then 
Acting Director General, who is deliberately ensuring that 
we do not receive documents so that the objective that we 
wanted to paint here can actually fly.  But I am happy.  You 
have called us here now.  We are able to have the right to 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 205 of 261 
 
reply to certain things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   But let us just put it on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, no that is fine.  Well, I am not 
aware whether I have seen or the correspondence you may 
have addressed to or your legal team may have addressed 
to SSA and copied the Commission.  It might have gone to 
the Secretariat and the Legal Team because such matters 
only comes to me when it is really necessary. 
 
But I do know that in terms of the Terms of 
10 
Reference of this Commission that we have published in 
2018, there was a specific provision saying all organs of 
state must cooperate with this Commission and all organs 
of state need to bear that in mind.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair.  If you would go, 
please, on the understanding that we can put to you 
statements or affidavits in Bundle SSA-1 and SSA-2 but not 
the additional bundle to SSA-2, page 145, please. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Bundle 2, SSA-2, 145.   
20 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   YY-5.   
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I am there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   This the affidavit of one Darryl and 
I would like to take you to his statement at paragraph 50. 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 206 of 261 
 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Paragraph 15? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   50, five zero on page 160.  At the 
time, I understand, that Darryl was the General Manager of 
the CDSO but if you go to paragraph 50 under the heading, 
Minister Mahlobo’s involvement in Operational Activities.  
Paragraph 50 reads: 
“An added challenge I faced as GM of the 
CDSO was that Minister Mahlobo was closely 
involved in the operational activities of the 
CDSO. 
10 
Given Minister Mahlobo’s personal interest and 
direct involvement in CDSO operations, I did 
not feel like I could question his priorities and 
instructions. 
Minister Mahlobo had given me a very warm 
welcome to the SSA and had made it clear that 
he wanted to work closely with me. 
I 
became 
concerned 
about 
this 
direct 
involvement in the CDSO as I did not consider 
it appropriate for the political head of the 
20 
agency to be involved in operational activities. 
In particular, Minister Mahlobo boasted about 
having his own sources and would report 
directly to President Zuma...” 
 
Paragraph 51 reads: 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 207 of 261 
 
“I raised my concerns with Minister Mahlobo 
on more than one occasion, warning him that 
he could be relaying unreliable intelligence to 
the President as this information has not been 
verified with formal SSA channels. 
I felt that the Minister was overly friendly for 
the reason that he had hoped to ensure my 
cooperation 
and 
my 
facilitating 
his 
active 
involvement in CDSO operations. 
Being wary of this, however, I tried to distance 
10 
myself from Minister Mahlobo...” 
 
Do you have any comment? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   These statements are false and I 
deny them. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraphs 80 to 82 on page 168.  
We will come back to this affidavit in another context, later.  
Paragraph 80 in page 168 reads under the heading, Cash 
Delivered to Minister Mahlobo: 
“I became aware that Minister Mahlobo would 
request money from the CDSO for his own 
20 
projects although I did not know what these 
projects were. 
This did not sit well with me as I did not think 
the Minister should be handling cash from the 
CDSO...” 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 208 of 261 
 
 
Paragraph 81: 
“There was one occasion where I was required 
to deliver cash to Minister Mahlobo. 
I was aware that SSA members, such as Frank, 
were drawing large amounts of cash on a 
monthly basis. 
I wanted to establish what the money was for. 
I became aware that Frank had collected cash 
from the SSA headquarters. 
So I asked him on his return to come to my 
10 
office and explain to me what the money was 
for. 
I 
asked 
him 
what 
amount 
of 
cash 
was 
contained in the suitcase he had with him and 
who the intended recipient was for a project 
and he proceeded to divide the money into 
various groupings, counting out the bundles on 
the table indicating how much was to be 
allocated to each operation on the project.  
After he had allocated the money to each 
20 
operation, I noted that a certain amount of 
money was left over, although I cannot recall 
the exact amount I subsequently put the 
outstanding money in the safe in my office. 
I presume that Frank told Minister Mahlobo 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 209 of 261 
 
about the surplus money as I subsequently 
received a call from the minister, requesting 
the money as he had required it for the ANC 
woman’s 
league. 
 
On 
Minister 
Mahlobo’s 
instruction I subsequently handed this money 
to his chief of staff, Jay who was in the 
company of [indistinct] at the OR Tambo 
airport. 
 
I 
did 
not 
make 
them 
sign 
any 
acknowledgement for the receipt of the funds, 
because 
this 
was 
at 
Minister 
Mahlobo’s 
10 
instruction.” 
 
Do you have any comment in that regard? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Well, on 80 I was not involved in 
projects as we spoke earlier on, on those day to day.  It is 
in my affidavit, I will not be able to refer you to.  On 81, on 
the first paragraph, I deny that he came to deliver cash as 
he is stating there.  
 
On 82, I denied that I gave him the instruction to go 
to the airport and give the money to the ANC women’s 
league.  
20 
ADV ADONISI SC:  I do not want to interrupt as I would do, 
but as I normally say Chair, it is to protect the rights of my 
client.  We have made a qualified affidavit.  I think it is 
prudent of me now to say that this individual affidavit, 
despite the fact that my client has already somehow 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 210 of 261 
 
commented, this is a person who has not testified once.  
 
We, if you have reference to paragraph 50 of our 
affidavit, we deal briefly with it to say we cannot at this 
stage 
deal 
extensively 
with 
the 
expert 
of 
statement  
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, your voice is going down.  Not 
at this stage ...[intervenes]  
ADV ADONISI SC:  I was told to take of this mic. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV ADONISI SC:  I have been exposed before Chair, so 
10 
that is why ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  As long as I can hear because obviously 
it is important that I should hear what you say. 
ADV ADONISI SC:  Okay.  Chair, I was merely making a 
point that we should not for the record that this individual 
despite my client because he has already commented on 
some, that we deal specifically because we have already 
qualified our, paragraph 50, if you were to be directed, we 
cannot deal extensively with the extracts and statements of 
people that, who have not testified.  
20 
 
But in view of the fact that the notice and the rule 
says you can comment or otherwise you have tried to an 
extent, unlimited.  But there is also a great concern of this 
particular paragraph or affidavit Chair.  You will see, and I 
will understand the ...[intervenes] 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 211 of 261 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, it may be so that we can dispose of 
some of the issues.  Let us start with the first one.  The 
mere fact that a witness has not yet testified, would not be 
a ground to say the witness cannot be questioned on that.  
so if there is already an affidavit in the possession of the 
commission, even if that person has not been, has not 
testified, it can be put to the witness to say so and so who 
has not testified or who would not be testifying, but he has 
signed an affidavit and this is what he says about you, 
what do you have to say. 
10 
ADV ADONISI SC:  Yes, correct Chair and I take wisdom 
from the Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  
ADV ADONISI SC:  However, I have other further legal 
arguments to seek your guidance.  Maybe let me put it that 
way.  The discovery of these documents, you will see that 
the very same affidavit that is being read out to the 
witness, 
I 
just 
unfortunately 
cannot 
locate 
with 
the 
pagination that was done.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
20 
ADV ADONISI SC:  But I am taking it from the discovered 
notice.  You will see that it is not even signed.   
CHAIRPERSON:  The page I am looking at, the page I am 
looking at is initialled in terms of pages, so I will have to 
go to the end of the ...[intervenes]  
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 212 of 261 
 
ADV ADONISI SC:  Maybe just to guide you Chair, because 
the numbers at the bottom will remain. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV ADONISI SC:  Despite the pagination that we use in 
this commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV ADONISI SC:  It is page 46 where the signature of the 
deponent had to appear.  If you look at the number at the 
bottom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  My understanding ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV ADONISI SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You will see that the name Barry Roux 
appears there, which would be a student pseudonym name.  
My understanding is that the, if you put in the signature 
there, the signature might reveal the identity of the person.  
So then they put just the pseudonym name.   
 
So for all intents and purposes, it is taken to be 
deposed to. 
ADV ADONISI SC:  Yes, thank you Chair for that and 
hence I stood up.  It was not objecting, it is just to seek 
20 
clarity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  
ADV ADONISI SC:  Not only that Chair, the last point if I 
may.  If one has regard to the whole affidavit you will see 
that the font changes.   
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 213 of 261 
 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Okay, 
just 
to 
complete 
what 
I 
...[intervenes] 
ADV ADONISI SC:  If one has regard to the whole affidavit 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, I am sorry.  Mr Adonisi, just to 
complete the point I was making.  You will see at page 191, 
that is the next page where the commissioner of oaths has 
signed, that part of what he certifies, is that the deponent 
has signed.   
 
So just to complete that point but you were onto 
10 
another point.  
ADV ADONISI SC:  Correct Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV ADONISI SC:  Thanks, and hence I said Chair I then, 
I understand the difficulty of extrapolating and all that 
Chair, because then you will be tampering with the but I 
need to protect my client to not to comment to things that 
are not proper. 
 
Chair, one of the things that I have noted with this 
affidavit probably because they had to extract on it, the 
20 
font changes.  You will see if I were to guide you to 
paragraph 32 for instance, which I in the document that I 
am using, is page 11 Chairperson. 
 
You will see if we were to compare it, quickly 
glancing Chair with paragraph 50 that the fonts are 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 214 of 261 
 
different.  Moving on to the highlighted version.  So I am 
not sure whether Chair will be technically acute then to 
guide me on that one, what will be the discrepancy and 
how does that happen to a document.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I would say that as far as the facts 
that there might be a different font from one page to 
another, or from certain page onwards, maybe you might 
just wish to place that on record, what you make of it.  You 
can decide later on. 
ADV ADONISI SC:  Thank you Chair, thank you for the 
10 
indulgence.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Mr Pretorius?   
ADV PRETORIUS:  I see that each page is initialled but I 
do not know what my learned friend wishes to make of a 
change in font, but be that as it may, if I may continue 
please to the next affidavit.  That is Exhibit YY7, in Bundle 
SSA2. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  It is still the same one we are 
using? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, I think it is the same affidavit on 
20 
which he was.  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Okay, where there is zero to 300. 
ADV PRETORIUS:  Page 300, yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  You are still on bundle 2.  
ADV PRETORIUS:  This appears to be the affidavit of a 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 215 of 261 
 
person with the pseudonym Steven.  If I could refer you 
please to paragraphs 48 to 51.  I will give you the page 
now.   
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  I am there.  
CHAIRPERSON:  What page Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS:  310.  Three one zero, SSA2.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  You said 48 to 51? 
ADV PRETORIUS:  Yes.  I confirm the typing is not very 
good. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  48 looks like 4B I guess. 
ADV PRETORIUS:  It looks like 4B.  49, 50 looks like SO 
and 51 looks like S1.   
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  I see the content.  
ADV PRETORIUS:  But paragraph 4B or 48 reads, under 
the heading further information regarding the payment of 
judges by Minister Mahlobo from SSA covert funds.  48 
reads: 
 
“I was subsequently informed by the director of 
the domestic branch of the SSA, Doctor Bheki 
20 
Langa, and also saw records that Doctor 
Langa had authorised the drawing of 12 million 
rand cash from the special operations budget.  
This money Doctor Langa said was packed into 
paper bags and was received by SSA special 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 216 of 261 
 
operator 
Frank 
for 
a 
delivery 
to 
Minister 
Mahlobo for payment to judges to influence the 
judiciary.” 
 
Now I must emphasise right away that this is a 
hearsay statement, but I would ask you to comment on 
that. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Well Chair, I did comment on this 
statement earlier on if you recall and they claim some of 
these malicious statement that have been made and 
putting the judiciary in disrepute.  My affidavit is clear.  No 
10 
payment, no direction was actually ever made to judges 
and I have actually indicated to you Chair and I am very 
serious, this is the pack. 
 
You know [indistinct], they are found outside but 
they are also found in intelligence.  Where certain people 
even give one information, and even lies.  This is the same 
person, I am on record, who actually accused certain 
politician and the head of a chapter 9 institution and he 
continues to do so here.  
 
At the end of this affidavit, on the 3.3 that you sent 
20 
me, this same person agrees that he has no knowledge of 
this thing and I am repeating it with heavy heart, because 
not all men and women intelligence are good.  There are 
many of them who are working hard to keep our country 
safe, but this one, those actions I hope the leadership at a 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 217 of 261 
 
particular point will deal with it.  
 
But the reality as 48 says, there was no money 
delivered to me and as it speaks about me on 59, and I 
deny, it is 50 of these numbers.  It is 50, I also deny it, 
including 51.  
ADV PRETORIUS:  I am not going to put the other 
paragraphs to you because there is one name, pseudonym 
that should have been changed and if necessary I will put 
in more detail to you at a later stage, but I would first like 
to have the names in paragraph 51 changed Chair.  
10 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Yes, I do see it and it is the very 
same omission that we made earlier on when I was 
testifying at home and I would gently accept that Mr 
Pretorius and your team including our team will do that.  
ADV PRETORIUS:  Alright.   
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Then next paragraph I would like to 
refer you to, is paragraph 12 of the same affidavit.  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Paragraph 12? 
ADV PRETORIUS:  12.   
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  I am there, Chair.  
20 
ADV PRETORIUS:  This deals with the state of nation 
address in 2015 and from paragraph 12 to paragraph 32, 
the circumstances which are public knowledge because 
they have been dealt with in several court cases, giving 
the background to the state of nation address are deal with 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 218 of 261 
 
but I would like to take you to, unless you want to go into 
the background I would like to take you to paragraph 23. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  No, I do not want to do that.  
ADV PRETORIUS:  “Soon after 12 February 2015 and 
arising out of the public outcry and the legal 
challenge 
by 
the 
South 
African 
National 
Editor ’s Forum, SANEF, over the incident the 
then minister of the SSA, Mr David Mahlobo, 
Minister Mahlobo, instructed me to meet with 
him at his official residence.  My driver drove 
10 
me to his residence and remained in the car, 
while I went inside the house.  On entry into 
the house I went through to the lounge where I 
found Minister Mahlobo and no one else was 
present at the time.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on Mr Pretorius, I think I lost you 
somewhere.  What paragraph are you on now? 
ADV PRETORIUS:  23. 
CHAIRPERSON:  23? 
ADV PRETORIUS:  Page 305 of SSA2. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, I have got it. 
ADV PRETORIUS:  Paragraph 24 reads: 
 
“On entry into the house I went through to the 
lounge where I found Minister Mahlobo.  No 
one else was present at the time.” 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 219 of 261 
 
 
25: 
 
“Minister Mahlobo explained that I was there to 
discuss the response to the legal challenge by 
SANEF to the jamming of the signal at SONA.  
He went on to tell me that two judges would be 
joining us who worked for him as operatives 
and 
would 
assist 
in 
influencing 
the 
case 
against 
the 
SSA 
brought 
by 
SANEF.  
Furthermore I was told that although they were 
attached to the Gauteng bench, they would be 
10 
able to influence the court in Cape Town where 
the matter was to be heard.” 
 
26: 
 
“I enjoyed a cordial relationship with Minister 
Mahlobo and knew that he ran intelligence 
operations and paid operatives.  I knew this, 
because this was an open secret at SSA and 
was often a topic of discussion amongst SSA 
managers.  Furthermore, as already 
seen 
below, this is an issue I discussed personally 
20 
with 
Minister 
Mahlobo. 
 
I 
knew 
from 
discussions at SSA amongst managers, that he 
had demanded and received a budget from 
SSA to allow him to pay his operatives.  It was 
of course completely irregular for a minister to 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 220 of 261 
 
run SSA operations as I had previously spoken 
to him about this and I had previously spoken 
to him about this.  Minister Mahlobo [indistinct] 
regard to what I said about this, however and 
he simply replied that he knew far more about 
running operations than me.  I knew that the 
DG during this period, Ambassador Kudjoe, 
had 
come 
under 
pressure 
from 
Minister 
Mahlobo 
for 
a 
budget 
and 
that 
she 
had 
eventually agreed to provide this.  I knew too 
10 
from talks at SSA that the chief financial 
officer Matthew had succumbed to this political 
pressure and routinely paid out large amounts 
of cash with no regard to SSA financial 
prescript.  Minister Mahlobo spoke openly to 
me about the operations he ran.  It was not out 
of 
the 
ordinary 
for 
him 
to 
receive 
large 
amounts of cash from SSA for the special 
operations project he ran.  This was well 
known at SSA.” 
20 
 
Paragraph 27: 
 
“Shortly after my arrival two other men arrived 
and joined us in the lounge.  I believe these 
men to be the two judges that the minister had 
told me about.  The one was a black man and 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 221 of 261 
 
the other a white man.” 
 
Paragraph 28: 
 
“The black judge who was introduced as Mr 
Ngwenya wore khaki shorts, while the white 
judge was dressed smart casual with long 
khaki pants.  The white man was bolding, 
although he was introduced, I cannot recall his 
name.  Both appeared respectable middle aged 
men.  I did not note any other particular 
features of the men.  Ngwenya is a Zulu 
10 
surname, however Mr Ngwenya spoke in an 
accent that sounded as if he came from one of 
the provinces in the north of South Africa 
rather than being a Zulu.  Being Zulu myself I 
was not convinced judging from his accent that 
Mr 
Ngwenya 
was 
actually 
Zulu 
or 
that 
Ngwenya 
was 
his 
correct 
surname. 
 
A 
conversation then occurred between the two 
judges and Minister Mahlobo.  I was present 
during this conversation and participated in 
20 
explaining the circumstances of the jamming 
case, 
having 
been 
placed 
in 
parliament.  
Minister 
Mahlobo 
expressly 
instructed 
the 
judges to take steps to influence the judges 
who were to hear the jamming case, to render 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 222 of 261 
 
a favourable finding for the minister.  The 
white judge seemed uncomfortable about the 
directness of the conversation and appeared 
hesitant to participate in the conversation, 
while the black judge seemed at ease with the 
situation and engaged Minister Mahlobo in the 
discussion.” 
 
Paragraph 30 reads: 
 
“I was told at the meeting that an advocate 
who was a senior counsel, had already been 
10 
appointed to represent SSA but that there was 
a concern about the ability of this advocate.  It 
was decided that an additional senior counsel 
should be appointed by the state attorney.  
Ultimately 
the 
minister 
as 
the 
fourth 
respondent had separate counsel.  Advocate F 
van Zyl SC and DJ Jacobs SC who were 
briefed by the state attorney.  The first two 
third respondents were the speaker of the 
national assembly, the Chairperson of the 
20 
national 
Council 
of 
provinces 
and 
the 
secretary to parliament and they were all 
represented by Advocate Jeremy Gauntlet SC.” 
 
Paragraph 31: 
 
“I was instructed to travel to Cape Town and 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 223 of 261 
 
remain in attendance to brief counsel on every 
aspect of the jamming device and to give 
sound reasons as to why it was deployed.” 
 
32: 
 
“Having received my instructions, I departed 
from the meeting.” 
 
Do you have any comment?   
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  Chairperson, you will have to 
assist us here, before I comment Mr Pretorius, whether you 
want to keep us long because these things you are 
10 
reading, they are not part of the Rule 3.3 notice.  They are 
extracts.  I am going to comment, but if we go this route 
Chair, with respect there are specific things.  
 
I will comment on this one, but I will want us to find 
a more productive way because I was not given the full 
affidavit but the extracts, because here the just of the 
matter is that this person alleges that I introduced him to 
judges, and the answer is no.  
 
I never introduced him to judges and I never issued 
any instruction or by any directive that the judges must be 
20 
paid, and it is an important issue that we are clarifying for 
the nation.  So that these kind of people do not come here, 
when you hear someone say no, no, no his relationship 
went bad and so forth.  
 
I am not here to do that.  I am more of a leader to 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 224 of 261 
 
get into that level, but let me help you Chair so that we can 
disperse with this matter, as I have denied this thing.  I am 
not saying I am denying a meeting or what because I 
cannot recall.   
 
If you want to go to that part.  Go to paragraph 33 
and 34, under SSA 02, 307.  This same guide Chair, he 
cannot even say who are these people and this is the kind 
of an evidence that must be presented to the nation and 
create 
innuendos 
on 
a 
hard 
fought 
constitutional 
democracy we fought.  
10 
 
I will not undermine it and I will never be party to 
that, where judges are actually insulted.  This guy on  his 
own words, he says he will not be in the position to do 
that, even despite the operation that they are running with 
Mr Jaftha, the then acting DG, just to try to prove their 
weaponisation, that is the word they use here.  
 
Weaponisation and politicisation.  They are trying to 
find a judge to make a scapegoat.  Even if one day they 
can come to you or anybody and insult that judge, because 
now I even have an idea which judge are they trying to 
20 
actually insult, when an affidavit is written that he has no 
kind of a recollection. 
 
I will help that particular judge, because you will 
actually even have to do those method of telephone 
extrapolations and so forth, but these are some of the kind 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 225 of 261 
 
of people.  This one the main issue I actually made an 
instruction.   
 
I introduce judges, answer is no.  I instructed them 
to actually bribe judges or pay judges, the answer is no 
and the own affidavit of this person, self-explanatory.  
Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes, Mr Pretorius?   
ADV PRETORIUS:  Apologies Chair, I am just looking at 
the 3.3 notice sent to Mr Mahlobo and it does include the 
passages that I am referring to.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  It does or it does not? 
ADV PRETORIUS:  It does.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, but as I ...[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS:  For the sake of complete, I am sorry 
Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  As I indicated, where Mr Mahlobo needs 
more time to look at documents that he has not looked at, I 
am sure that we will make sure that when he is ready, he 
can address them. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  This one Chair, I am dispersing 
20 
with this one.   
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I understand that.  I am just 
saying in general because you made the point and Mr 
Pretorius is responding to say those documents where you 
say you have not had time to look at, and you are not able 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 226 of 261 
 
to deal with, arrangements will be made for ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  [Vernacular – 00:25:24] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, that is right ja, but otherwise where 
you are able to respond, that is fine.  Okay, Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS:  Thank you Chair.  Just from our own 
point of view, these are quite serious allegations and 
therefore obviously any time that is required ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, well I think ...[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS:  In addition to that Chair, my learned 
friend I might point out to him, has the ability to re-
10 
examine ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no that is fine, but I am ... I 
just want to say that it is important that whatever 
allegations 
are 
being 
made 
about 
judges 
that 
this 
commission while on the one hand not necessarily wanting 
to elevate anything that does not deserve to be elevated, 
on the other hand should not be seen not to look into those 
allegations. 
ADV PRETORIUS:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I have already been accused of 
20 
sweeping under the carpet allegations of corruption by 
judges.  So that evidence or allegations that were made 
here, I have already been accused of sweeping those 
under the carpet.  
 
But for what it is worth, if there is any sector of 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 227 of 261 
 
society that I would really want us to make sure if the 
allegations and the substance that we look at certainly 
would be those against judges, because it is so important 
that the integrity of the judiciary is not impacted adversely, 
unnecessarily, but I accept that also when there may be 
people who for their own reasons throw around allegations 
that have no substance, one also has to be alive to that.  
 
But certainly there will be no attempt by me or this 
commission to say A, you are saying that about judges, we 
will sweep it under the carpet.  That will not happen.  
10 
Anyway ...[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS:  One way or the other Chair, and I am 
sure Mr Mahlobo would agree.  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  No, this is very profound.  You 
know 
certain 
actions 
we 
do 
either 
by 
omission 
or 
commission.  We have a security risk to this democracy we 
enjoy and this thing I refuted with the content it deserve.  
That is why I was actually even, sometimes I have a feeling 
well lawyers are lawyers, you studied your own profession, 
I studied mine, you need to follow certain things.  
20 
 
But you have something self-explanatory at the end.  
You know what, I do not have evidence and I was hurt 
because you know, you actually was involved when I took 
my oath the last time and you sit here this man is taking an 
oath with me here.  
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 228 of 261 
 
 
Probably he thinks I am in his pay roll.  No, they 
can criticise judges like any other person but it should not 
be an easy thing to make inferences without proof.  Well, 
judges and all of us, we are mere mortal.  We do certain 
things.  
 
That is why there are balancing checks.  That is 
why we are having that particular structure and chain. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:  And I am happy for public interest, 
on this specific matter.  I am very clear on this specific 
10 
matter.  No introduction, no instruction and I am just 
saying please be on alert because intelligence is good but 
it can also be dangerous.  
 
And people who know how to play around depending 
on issues of, you know certain people are paranoid.  If you 
hear 
something 
about 
you, 
you 
become 
paranoid.  
Intelligence must be evidence based.  
CHAIRPERSON:  No, that is fine but sir, just for the sake 
of completeness about this, the one thing which the nation 
must be reminded of is that on a number of occasions the 
20 
Chief Justice has gone public to say if anybody has 
evidence of any wrongdoing or corruption on the part of 
any judge they must come forward and to the best of my 
knowledge nobody has come forward with evidence other 
than what I have heard here and various witnesses 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 229 of 261 
 
including you, Mr Mahlobo, have said what you think of 
some of these allegations and I believe I have also said 
the same thing to say, you know, it is unacceptable for 
people to be making all kinds of allegations about judges 
and when they are invited to come forward with evidence, 
the do not come forward, they do not want to be subjected 
to questioning and cross-examination to see whether what 
they are talking about is true but they keep on making 
allegations away from fora where their allegations can be 
tested so it is very important.  The leadership of the 
10 
judiciary has been very clear over a long time that anybody 
who has got evidence of any corruption or any wrongdoing 
on the part of judges must come forward.  There are 
structures that are there.  They can to go the police, they 
can go to the Judicial Conduct Committee but as far as I 
know, I do not know of any case where evidence has been 
placed before those structures.  Okay, let us continue. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   For the sake of completeness, Mr 
Mahlobo, you have referred to it in passing, paragraphs 33 
and 34, the last two paragraphs that deal with the topic.  
20 
33 reads: 
“Some 
three 
years 
later 
when 
discussing 
this 
incident with Mr Loyiso Jafta, the present Acting DG 
of the SSA encouraged me to look at photographs of 
judges that appeared on the internet to see if I was 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 230 of 261 
 
able to identify the two judges I had met at Minister 
Mahlobo’s home in 2015.  I must point out that in 
2015 I did not take particular note of the two judges 
that I met.  I was in their company for a short period 
only, about fifteen minutes, and did not make a 
point of memorising their facial and other features.” 
34: 
“Despite this I carried out an internet search for the 
images of South African judges but was unable to 
find a photograph that closely resembled either the 
10 
white or the black judge that I met.  Having done 
this exercise I now know that I am not in a position 
to reliably identify either of the judges.” 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I have dealt with that, Mr 
Pretorius, but very interesting that you should do as an 
observation, if you read 33 and 34 and take into account 
Mr Jafta’s testimony, of another allegation despite this 
affidavit, 
Chair, 
I 
have 
circumstantial 
evidence 
of 
a 
particular judge.  These things are serious and they must 
not 
be 
done 
in 
our 
name, 
people 
must 
bring 
this 
20 
information and I hope you will not allow them to get away 
and I am happy that you are clarifying the position of the 
judiciary as headed by His Excellency, the Chief Justice 
Mogoeng-Mogoeng. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In the same affidavit at page 310 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 231 of 261 
 
of SSA 2, the creation of a trade union to rival AMCU is 
dealt with, A-M-C-U. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not put on your mic. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   [Speaking in the vernacular]  
Okay, I am there, Mr Pretorius, from page 52.  We can 
proceed. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 52 reads: 
“I recall that during 2015 I was called to meet with 
Minister Mahlobo on at least three other occasions.  
I am not able to place these meetings in the correct 
10 
chronological order with any certainty but they all 
occurred during 2015, neither am I able to say with 
confidence whether they occurred before or after 
the meeting with the judges which I have described 
above.” 
53 reads: 
“The one meeting which took place at the 
minister ’s home and was attended by the 
minister, 
Daryl 
and 
myself 
concerned 
a 
person

ADV PRETORIUS SC:   “She is now deceased.” 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 232 of 261 
 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Chairperson – just a sec, Mr 
Pretorius, you by omission or commission, I have a very 
serious problem with this affidavit now especially when Mr 
Pretorius is reading.  One, if these people worked for 
intelligence, these people that have been mentioned – let 
me finish it, there is a very problematic issue, you cannot – 
you cannot at any stage – I know it is not your affidavit, Mr 
Pretorius, because certain people decided to do their job 
to say declassification and classification.  Now we are 
being made unintentionally to speak about people’s names.  
10 
You always respect that cardinal principle and this that is 
actually appearing here is a problem and but I also do not 
want to fall into a trap just to disclose indirectly or directly 
any secret entrusted to me in terms of the oath you gave 
me.  But [speaking in the vernacular] it does not get to be 
done because I am seeking from the point of vantage(?) I 
know certain names and I know their status whether what 
is their role, they should have actually done certain things 
but you do not do it.  Probably uBaba Pretorius just going 
forward, he can refer to us, probably omit certain names.  
20 
It is the biggest risk that while I am trained on this thing, 
uBaba Zondo, I do not want to accuse at a particular point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, my understanding from what Mr 
Pretorius said, I think, when the SSA evidence was led is 
that there had been cooperation between the Commission’s 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 233 of 261 
 
legal team and SSA to make sure that names that were not 
supposed to be disclosed were not disclosed and my 
understanding was that – I do not know whether it includes 
this affidavit but at least at that time, my understanding 
was that the affidavits that were being used then, the SSA 
had satisfied themselves that everything was in order. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   What I will prefer, Chair, there is 
always a misstep, certain things they will fall through the 
cracks.  This doctrine inasmuch as how we feel about 
certain people, it must be respected.  I made an earlier 
10 
comment 
that 
is 
unprecedented 
in 
the 
intelligence 
environment to disclose certain information, methodology, 
body, mean, whatever structure that is being used that 
could unintentionally reveal certain names. 
 
I made an example for you, that there is a reference 
of a name in what we call it Project Lock and then there is 
no reference of a name on a project called Eewee(?).  
When the two individuals are prominent names you do not 
do that.  Then there is a same mistake that I pick it here, I 
do not have a problem, Mr Pretorius must continue to ask 
20 
me but where he sees a name of a problem, let us not do 
this while I am sitting here so that I just – that is my 
instruction to assist you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, that is fine.  Mr Pretorius? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   But because I have it you will see 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 234 of 261 
 
the name is in the document where people’s names.  
Unless the name of a person is about the title or the 
responsibility but immediately it becomes an operational 
matter which is a covert operation, where you see a name, 
you do not call it.  But if it is about policy, about titles and 
all these other, anyway, you can do it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Pretorius? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I do not want to be… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you are just expressing a concern. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Ja, I am – my English word is 
10 
running, you know, being complicit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   By way of background, Chair, you 
are correct that …[intervenes] 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Remind me where we were?  We 
are on page…? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 311. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Thank you, I am there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   311.  If I may just respond, Mr 
20 
Mahlobo?  All the redactions were indeed checked with the 
SSA’s attorneys and my belief is that what has been put 
now is in accordance with those arrangements.  I am not 
sure about the first name mentioned and I am quite happy 
not to mention it in response to …[intervenes] 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 235 of 261 
 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   We are on page – on 53? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   311, para 53. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Yes, I can see the name. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So that the first name I need not 
mention nor the name of the wife anymore. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Thank you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But the other name, the principal 
agent, he actually sued in his own name and set out all the 
circumstances in a court application of this series of 
incidents, so I do not think there is any reason why that 
10 
having been made the subject matter of a court case which 
was settled but I am happy to be guided by your Chair.  If I 
do not mention that name I am not sure that in public – it is 
before Mr Mahlobo, he knows who it is, should know who it 
is. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   No, no, no, I am familiar what you 
are speaking about but the cardinal principle, Chair, 
anything that is covert-related whether it happens to get 
into the public domain, the authority, which is this case, 
the authority in law, which is intelligence services even if 
20 
the name is there, you do not do what people have already 
done.  Will be able to go to this but I have given my advice 
so that we do not waste time. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  Well, the Commission is 
obliged to deal with matters in open and we will follow that 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 236 of 261 
 
unless there are lawful reasons rather than reasons of 
practice to operate otherwise, but I am going to read on at 
your invitation.   
“At this meeting…” 
And I am at paragraph 54. 
“…with Minister Mahlobo, I was informed by the 
minister that Mr Blank  had been deployed together 
with principal agent Blank  to start a rival union to 
the association of mineworkers and construction 
union, AMCRU.  He told me that this project ran into 
10 
trouble 
and 
Mr 
Blank 
 
was 
kidnapped 
and 
threatened.  Mr Blank now feared for his life. 
Minister Mahlobo required me to arrange for funds 
to be paid to Mr…for him see to his protection.” 
Paragraph 55: 
“I arranged the four monthly payments of R120 000 
were paid to Mr Blank  so that he could secure 
private security and protection services.” 
Paragraph 56: 
“Unknown to Mr Blank  I also placed him under 
20 
counter surveillance by using our SSA surveillance 
team to determine whether there were indeed 
threats on his life.  I monitored the surveillance 
reports based on a threat assessment, which we 
conducted based mainly on the surveillance reports, 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 237 of 261 
 
it was concluded that there was no threat against 
Mr Blank  and I stopped the monthly protection 
money being paid to him.” 
I am not sure whether that is entirely relevant to our terms 
of reference but what does follow may well be.  Paragraph 
57: 
“I also met Mr Mahlobo at his residence in order to 
discuss a problem that had arisen with the principal 
agent and the project to create a rival union to 
AMCRU.  Minister Mahlobo informed me that Mr 
10 
(blank} had been hired by special operations as a 
principal agent for the project at one of the project 
meetings former President Zuma was also present.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Pretorius, you have used 
Mr Blank for different people, somebody who reads the 
transcript will think it is the same person that you 
…[intervenes] 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, well I am now dealing with Mr 
Blank 2. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The principal agent. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  I was just wanting to alert you 
that somebody who reads the transcript will think it is the 
same person because you say Mr Blank all the time. 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 238 of 261 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  No, fair comment, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, continue?  Or shall we say – 
because each time you read you did say which paragraph 
you are reading from. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you want to simply say in paragraph 
53 – there is only one Mr Blank, there is Blank 1 
…[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Mr and Mrs Blank. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja and then continue under paragraph 
10 
54 and the next two of …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   54 and the first blank is Blank 1 
and the second Blank is Blank 2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And the third and fourth Blanks are 
Blank 1.  Para 55 is Blank 1, 56 is Blank 1 throughout and 
57 – let me read it again. 
“I also met Minister Mahlobo at his residence in 
order to discuss a problem that had arisen with the 
principal agent and the project to create a rival 
20 
union to AMCRU, Mr Blank 2.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, is it not Blank 3? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   “Minister Mahlobo informed me  
that Blank 2 had been hired by special operations 
as a principal agent for the project at one of the 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 239 of 261 
 
project meetings.  Former President Zuma was also 
present.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, is it not Blank 3, that paragraph? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Blank 1, the one at paragraph 53, is it 
just Mr Blank or is it Mr Blank 1? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 53 is Blank 1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, then you go to 54. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And Mrs Blank. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, then you go to 54 in the second line 
10 
at the end …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Blank 1 and Blank 2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Blank 1 and Blank 2, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And then later on Blank 1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   55, Blank 1, 56 Blank 1 throughout. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   57, Blank 2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  No, that is fine. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay?  58: 
20 
“The assignment went ahead as planned but Mr 
Blank 2 became dissatisfied over remuneration and 
threatened to disclose the details of his assignment 
including the role of the President and Minister 
Mahlobo unless he was paid an amount of R6 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 240 of 261 
 
million.” 
59: 
“Minister 
Mahlobo 
wanted 
me 
to 
arrange 
the 
withdrawal of R6 million in cash in order to pay Mr 
Blank 2.  I found myself in an impossible position as 
I was not able to legally arrange this amount of 
money from SSA.  Furthermore, I was against the 
payment of extortion money and was also against 
Minister Mahlobo involving himself with operational 
issues.  I explained my position to Minister Mahlobo 
10 
and warned that if Mr Blank 2 was paid the amount 
he would return for more money once he had 
depleted the initial amount paid to him.” 
Paragraph 60: 
“My advice to Minister Mahlobo and my inability to 
raise R6 million caused me to fall out of favour with 
the minister.” 
Paragraph 61: 
“I have subsequently been told by the current Acting 
DG, Mr Jafta, that Mr Blank 2 did demand a further 
20 
amount 
of 
money 
from 
Minister 
Mahlobo 
by 
launching a civil claim against him.  I do not know 
the details of this litigation.” 
Do you have comment on that? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Chairperson, I will need the help 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 241 of 261 
 
from my legal team.  There are certain things that I am 
going to say here that I want them to pay attention so that 
they can assist me.  There were certain documents that I 
received last night on a WeTransfer – I do not know 
whether that is the platform you use – and certain things I 
saw and there are certain things that these allegations are 
made.  I might not go on each point in the paragraph but 
there are certain things I want to put on record.  This is 
one matter that was brought to my attention about difficulty 
of an intelligence operation going wrong and people they 
10 
come here to you, they make affidavit, they have been into 
the papers.  I am speaking about Blank – this Blank 2, Mr 
Pretorius, and it has been very difficult, very difficult 
because in intelligence you always have to safeguard the 
secret nature of operations.  But when something goes 
wrong and the complaint comes to you, in this case a 
complaint came to me and when this complaint comes to 
me, already they are legal papers.  Legal papers are being 
taken to court.  Not an opinion, it is a fact, they are taken 
to court and I am the respondent in some of these 
20 
documents, Mr Pretorius, you see here.  But some of this 
evidence, without getting into that operation, one, people 
so confident Mahlobo creates a union and I have chosen 
not to defend myself in public.  The documents in your 
possession, the alleged union – I will use this word 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 242 of 261 
 
because I am trying not to indirectly or directly divulge 
secrets – the alleged union.  The documentation in your 
possession and the affidavits that are here, they allege 
that this incident happened around 2013.  Even the 
documents that are coming from the Department of Labour 
in your possession.  But people have been saying this 
minister, my apology, is meddling on matters of rights for 
workers to belong and the dates are not corresponding.  
When did this guy become a minister?  25 May 2014.  And 
someone has the audacity “This minister creates union.”  It 
10 
is here, on this 3.3.  Just check the documents.  You know, 
I like evidence because it is factual.  I will not speak about 
that thing, Deputy Chief Justice and Chair, but do not 
incriminate me on things that there is no correlation.  
Those dates that are there are not correlating. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They are 2013 dates? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   No, I am saying that someone 
says here on record “Mahlobo created the union”, a fact.  
And I am saying your own documents at your disposal, the 
alleged union created was not from the 25 May of 2014, 
20 
the documents in your possession, they are showing you 
otherwise.  I went through them last night.  
 
Number two, I do not want to deny that this person 
did actually took us to court and then this person, the 
responsible managers whose operation had a misstep, had 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 243 of 261 
 
to actually correct this thing and it is the manner it was 
corrected but there is no instruction that I say you know 
what, every time you receive a problem, you cannot say 
people must deal with it, they had to deal with it but there 
was no instruction to say give money, do this, I say solve 
the problem because the problem was brought to my 
attention.  But to lie and say that because I had to get 
better involved to say that that agent, the matters of the 
agent must be attended.  They attended the matter the way 
they deem it fit.  Then they insinuate in another paragraph 
10 
here now, Mr Pretorius, is to sign off an involvement in 
operation.   
We will go to the others now and I am happy to give 
you this information.  In as far as these others you will 
come to, indeed there were complaints and my affidavit 
from 
time 
to 
time, 
complaints 
from 
public, 
from 
parliamentarians including assets for agents and this is 
one case.  Thank you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Well, that could cut the 
questioning short, given your response.  As I understand 
20 
your 
evidence 
was 
that 
you 
played 
no 
part 
in 
the 
establishment of the operation. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Thank you, it is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But that where problems arose and 
particularly where there was a lawsuit including a lawsuit 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 244 of 261 
 
against you as one of the defendants, I think it is, you 
could legitimately become involved, is that correct? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   It is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And just for the record, the 
particulars of claim in the matter appear at SSA1, page 
186, where you are cited as the 3 r d Defendant.  Do you 
recall that? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   That one is correct, you have it 
there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  I do not think it is necessary 
10 
to it, I mean, it is common cause …[intervenes] 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   But this one think that Baba 
[indistinct], certain operation can go wrong and you will not 
be a bystander under the circumstances that you are 
talking about and it should never and ever be construed as 
running an operation and fortunately here your Commission 
has assisted, you have put dates here, you have put 
documents, I am fine. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The claim was for actually an 
amount of R120 million under a number of what might be 
20 
termed – may I be so bold as to comment, dubious claims.  
But be that as it may, it was finally settled, is that correct? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Ja, it was finally settled. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   On your instruction? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   No instruction. 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 245 of 261 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you know of the settlement? 
MINISTER 
MAHLOBO: 
 
 
I 
know 
the 
settlement 
but 
ministers do not get into contracts.  I never signed any 
settlement agreement. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, it was settled in an amount 
of R7 million our investigators tell us. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Well, that is what I am told 
because I had never had sight of the settlement agreement 
but the responsible managers manage – who manage the 
problem that has often intelligence, operational failure(?).  
10 
Chair may I…? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I am not sure for – because I have 
had to look at the evidence leader, he has been standing 
the whole day and I am a youngster, I should in actual fact 
be the longevity and together with the Chair, I am battling 
to understand now where you get this energy.  Can we 
have about five to ten minutes and also that will allow me 
to go to the bathroom, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, well I guess it shows Mr Pretorius’ 
20 
resilience. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   He has done a very good job, it is 
not easy to stand there for all the time unlike us who are 
seated. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The only one standing. 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 246 of 261 
 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   And I am on your corner, you can 
hire me to be your shop steward.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   And then you will be the employer 
– I will carry some black cards that will not [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, let us take an adjournment, 10 
minutes adjournment. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
10 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you Chair.   Just to finish off 
on the Trade Union matter Mr Mahlobo can I refer you 
please to Bundle SSA2 at page 165.  This is the affidavit of 
Daryl which begins at ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Are we still on the same page we 
were before? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No, a different one, YY5. 
CHAIRPERSON:   YY5. 
20 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Bundle 2, SSA2, page 165. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Y5, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then page 165. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   165, okay. 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 247 of 261 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   There Daryl deals with the Workers 
Association Union project and in the establishment of the 
project he does not mention your name, but he does 
mention your name in paragraph 69 in relation to the 
summons issued under the Gauteng High Court jurisdiction 
on 12 December 2017 to which we have referred and he 
says in paragraph 69: 
“Minister Mahlobo told me to meet with Mr Maswabi 
to negotiate an out of court settlement.  Given the 
risk of exposure to President Zuma I made an 
10 
appointment to meet with President Zuma at the 
Union Buildings to determine whether he was aware 
of – I am sorry – I mentioned the name – of the 
Court action.  President Zuma informed me that he 
was aware of the formation of the Union and that he 
had tasked Mr Dlomo to work with Mr Blank 2 on 
this project.” 
He then goes on to say that, in paragraph 72: 
” He initially wanted – that is Blank 2, initially 
wanted about R30million to withdraw the matter.  I 
20 
discussed it with Minister Mahlobo who informed me 
that I should negotiate a settlement which could not 
exceed R10million.” 
73: 
“I set up another meeting with Blank 2.  After some 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 248 of 261 
 
discussion I managed to negotiate him down to 
R7million.   I took this proposal back to Mr Mahlobo 
who agreed to the amount, on the amount to be 
paid.   Mr Mahlobo said that he would arrange the 
money through SSA.” 
What do you say about those allegations?    
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Well as I have indicated the issue 
that 
when 
the 
problem 
came 
to 
me 
I 
did 
ask 
the 
responsible project managers who handled the matter, and 
indicated that matters of intelligence if they go to Court 
10 
they become so damning and I never gave him to say this 
is the amount this you must be able to pay.   I only said we 
do not have the hundred and something million that is 
required, find a way to deal with the matter because it was 
their operational failure, but the quantum’s I deny them, I 
agree that I asked them to actually engage with this asset 
that had problems, that had already been brought to my 
attention. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Then in relation to Project Lock, 
there is in Bundle SSA2 at page 317, the affidavit of 
20 
Shadow, and if I may refer you to ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   We are running too fast now, my 
cover page? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    YY8.   
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   YY8, of? 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 249 of 261 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   At page 317.    
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I am there Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you have any involvement in 
Project Lock, the operation Project Lock? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Firstly let us start with this 
person, this affidavit, because I want to address it.   I do 
not know this person, and in the very same affidavit this 
person is actually when I read your Rule 3.3 notices Chair, 
[speaking in vernacular], it is hearsay, he alleges that he 
came to my house with one of the senior managers who 
10 
was driving and he says that this senior manager I made 
him to account why this asset mentioned here is not being 
paid.   I have never met with Shadow, and I have never 
discussed this issues.  All the issues that Shadow refers to 
here, because I do not want to waste your time, I deny 
them. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   He says in brief that there was a 
visit made to your house in Pretoria in the presence of Mr 
de Kock, he also says that there was a complaint made to 
you about the breach of the arrangement SSA had with 
20 
him, that is Mr de Kock. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Let us deal with Mr Shadow, so 
that we do not deal with a – what do you call it, smoke and 
mirrors, this guy Shadow never brought this person or 
interacted with me, and I deny the things that he is saying 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 250 of 261 
 
here, because I am going to be speculating of even of a 
person that never set foot into my house, and he is one 
funny character, even if you look at his profile here.    
Look at the profile of this guy and that said 
inasmuch as we do have good men and women this guy 
that I have never even met, even on a single day, comes 
and tells stories that no, so and so said about this or said 
about something else, that cannot be the work of the 
Commission, but for completeness for this affidavit my 
answer I refute it. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  If we can go on then to 
YY14 in SSA2, right at the back of the file, the affidavit of 
Blaise, page 742, there is an extract from what has become 
known as the Boast Report…[intervene] 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   What? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   There is an extract on page 742 of 
the Boast Report I would just like to put one paragraph to 
you. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   What kind of report? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Boast, B-o-a-s-t, it has been 
20 
referred to colloquially as the Boast Report. It is a report 
by an operative Blaise and this is his confirmatory affidavit 
on certain activities of the SSA.  
It’s been dealt with in evidence and the matter of 
record it's been read onto the record and I just like to 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 251 of 261 
 
understand 
under 
the 
heading 
SONA 
Western 
Cape, 
February 2016 on page 742, the last paragraph reads: 
“The collection efforts of the CDSO also provided 
alternative 
information 
regarding 
the 
Sesikhona 
movement.  The CDSO team was directly tasked by 
the Minister of State Security to activate the 
Sesikhona agents to ensure a presence within the 
City of Cape Town during the SONA, State of Nation 
Address, this was done to great success.” 
In other words, the allegation is that in relation to SONA, 
10 
that you gave a direct instruction for certain activities to 
take place.  
MINISTER 
MAHLOBO: 
 
 
Well, 
this 
affidavit 
is 
not 
explaining how SONA processes work and I do not want 
spend time here explaining how it works.  I never got on 
operational matters of SONA, there is a structure there a 
Deputy Chief Justice you attend the very same structure, 
why we were taken to Court is called [indistinct] joins.  
Those are the people who run things and is 
responsible Ministers, we get to be briefed and I did in my 
20 
time as a Minister, when there is a SONA I will receive a 
security assessment report but to say I had a sitting with 
these people, what, what, what - the answer is no. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay, there is evidence in the 
bundle about the monies allocated to the Sesikhona 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 252 of 261 
 
Project but I do not then think it is necessary to put them 
to you.   Lastly, at least for the moment, there are certain 
allegations that we have agreed not to put you at the stage 
because they are in the additional bundle and quite clearly 
you need time to acquaint yourself with the allegations.  
But if I may deal with the document at SSA1 at page 
235.  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   It is under cover what? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say 235, Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair appropriately under 
10 
cover, it is under P. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   We can proceed. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Under the header background it 
reads: 
“Murray.” 
Now this is Murray’s affidavit or Murray’s report rather that 
has been classified as not an affidavit.  The report reads: 
“Murray was recruited to join the SSA in 2013 by J, 
former Head of Ministerial Services in the Ministry 
of State Security under Minister David Mahlobo.  
20 
Murray resigned from the SSA in 2014 to pursue 
studies in the UK.” 
Next paragraph reads: 
“Upon 
return 
from 
the 
UK 
in 
2015, 
he 
was 
approached by former Minister Mahlobo to discuss, 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 253 of 261 
 
Fees Must Fall Protests, which had erupted in 2015. 
According 
to 
Murray, 
the 
reason 
for 
Minister 
Mahlobo to engage him was his background as the 
former SRC President at Wits.  Murray went on to 
say that by then he had already written several 
articles.” 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Can I just with your permission 
Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Mr Pretorius dealing with a next 
10 
annexure P where is the affidavit because now I am just 
dealing with a report.  I want affidavit so that I deal with 
people what they say to implicate me because this is one 
report I have not actually even read it, probably yesterday 
and I will not be able even to help you now. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, well there are two issues. 
The one is that I do not believe that it is untoward to put to 
you a report that is made to or under the auspices of the 
SSA whether it is an affidavit or not might go to the weight 
to be attached to it, but in relation to your second point 
20 
you need time to deal with it I understand that. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   My preference say through Chair 
is that I do not want to deal with Project Veza. 
CHAIRPERSON:   With project? 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Project Veza and internal SSA 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 254 of 261 
 
investigation, I am not even party to that participation.  If 
members of Project Veza or anybody who participate in 
Project Veza let them give you an affidavit Chair, then I will 
deal with it.   
And I agree with Mr Pretorius on the other second 
part, but annexure P I need someone to - remember the 
people who came here were managing Project Veza, they 
were able to actually put this thing on an affidavit.  But this 
document also Chair, with your indulgence I have not read 
this one here, Mr Pretorius.  You can find a way that 
10 
probable if you want to come back, we can agree with the 
legal team of a way of how we handle it.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now perhaps there is a point to the 
fact that this document authenticity is not established, it 
simply says it is a report.  If there was a covering affidavit, 
then I could validly argue that although it is a report, it is 
an authentic document, and therefore it should be dealt 
with but we could argue that at a later stage, because it 
seems we agree on the fact that time is required.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no that is fine, between now and 
when Mr Mahlobo comes back or get to deal with it both 
sides will have thought about the concern that he has 
raised and then we can deal with it, then in terms of 
whether there is affidavit…[intervene] 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 255 of 261 
 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   If there is an affidavit I will 
respond. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Someone taking ownership of what 
Honourable Pretorius is saying. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair, in order to expedite matters 
if maybe before the next appearance without sending 
questions, 
because 
that 
is 
not 
the 
practice 
of 
the 
Commission but to highlight topics with the appropriate 
references that will be dealt with we could be much 
10 
quicker. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is fine. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair that is all for 
now.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:    No, you have done all your 
questions? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, apart from – yes for the 
moment apart from issues raised in that other bundle. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   No, I have an issue.  
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And secondly, well just let me tell 
you 
what 
we 
have 
not 
dealt 
with. 
Secondly, 
any 
recommendations that you might have to assist the Chair in 
relation to regularisation of State Security. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   That one I have indicated even to 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 256 of 261 
 
the leadership, the Head of the National Executive despite 
challenges we have gone through in the organisation we 
assigned to we will give some views and then it will be up 
to them to deal with those view.   
But our experiences there, the good things we did 
and the missteps, they can be able to serve as a lesson.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But are you saying that your intention is 
to bring to the Commission such views as you may have on 
the recommendations through the organisation as opposed 
to you at some stage dealing with them?  
10 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Well what I will do because 
normally Chair, you give us an opportunity of concluding 
remarks.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   I might not have to come and 
appear here but I will definitely put it through the 
Secretariat those certain things because I have views to, 
other than the other thing that people were implicating me 
on but I have views because they debate around the 
intelligence services all over the world, it continues rage 
20 
on.  Even in the best of biggest the oldest democracies, let 
me not use the biggest the oldest democracy that I have 
we all have to grapple with it from time to time.  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, I think that is okay if you are 
able to share with the Commission the views that you have 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 257 of 261 
 
in terms of what going forward you think should be done to 
address certain challenges that you experienced or that 
you are aware, were there or maybe are still there, and 
what may need to be strengthened, which was working.  
That would be most welcome.  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But what I think we have agreed upon is 
that there are still some documents that will need to be 
dealt with.  What will remain is whether - I think preferably, 
they should be dealt with Mr Mahlobo giving evidence 
10 
rather than just sending documents.  
But that does not prevent you from sending that 
document with your views on recommendations that you 
can still do.  I have in mind these other these other 
documents. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Yes, Chair Mr Pretorius and my 
legal team, they will have a discussion, even if it means I 
must come just for a shorter period if we can find time in 
your tight schedule, because only this document of which 
we can give. But the other one will also even if depending 
20 
their final agreement, will even by that time, I would have 
tried to do some write up.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   It will already be furnished here 
and then depending on your ultimate decision, we will 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 258 of 261 
 
decide how to handle it.  But for your own completeness as 
well assisting this process to read of ourselves of the 
challenges experienced over time while still tending this 
democracy, I will clearly do it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, that is fine.  What I must just 
say is also that if your legal team and they are listening, if 
your legal team would like to make written submissions on 
what I should find on the evidence that has been led in so 
far as it may relate to you that need - that should be done 
reasonably soon, because we will not have oral argument.  
10 
There 
will 
be 
no 
oral 
argument, 
but 
written 
submissions will be acceptable.  So where you can say, 
well, this was the evidence that affects my client.  It is 
evidence from your - or whatever, whoever, whoever, and 
this is what they said.  This is what my client said, in our 
submission. These are the findings that should be made 
you know against that one or in favour of that one, 
because 
then 
I 
will 
have 
regard 
to 
those 
written 
submissions in preparing the report. 
 There will not be time for oral arguments.  
20 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   No, we are very happy Chair, that 
our team needs to do where there is really, really concrete 
matters that has to be done, so that at least you have the 
completeness even despite your time constraints.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, that is fine.  I think your counsel 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371 
 
Page 259 of 261 
 
will speak to Mr Pretorius but I think those submissions, 
written submissions should be with the Commission not 
later than the end of April, those submissions. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Sorry I think what I did earlier is 
an error that I misunderstood your 15 minutes and you see 
me in chambers.  Maybe let me understand the directive 
from the Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   We would await a correspondence 
from the Commission it is from us, we just have to file. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, do not wait anything.  
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Okay, we owe the Commission 
ourselves.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, just from now, from tomorrow work 
on written submissions, have regard to all the evidence 
that might affect your client that has been led.  Of course 
we know that he is still to come and deal with this other 
document, but you can start preparing.  
So that by the end of April, at the latest, you can 
submit your written submissions that tell me as far as you 
20 
are concerned, these are the findings I should make.  
These are the findings I should not make insofar as it 
relate to your client. 
MINISTER MAHLOBO:   Noted Chair, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
09 APRIL 2021 – DAY 371
