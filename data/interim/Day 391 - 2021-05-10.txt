PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 10 MAY 2021 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Soni, good morning 
everybody. 
ADV SONI SC:  Morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Montana.  Thank you.  
Are we ready? 
ADV SONI SC:  We are ready. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Please administer the oath 
again. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
10 
MR MONTANA:  Tshepo Lucky Montana. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
MR MONTANA:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath binding on your 
conscience? 
MR MONTANA:  I do. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you solemnly swear that the evidence you 
will give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing but 
the truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help 
20 
me God. 
MR MONTANA:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Yes we may proceed then.   
ADV SONI SC:  As you please Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 4 of 179 
 
ADV SONI SC:  Chairperson when we were last here a week 
ago we were going to deal with the properties.  Now I want 
to adopt a slightly different approach to this issue instead of 
dealing with Mr Oellermann’s report I just want to put 
certain documents to Mr Montana and ask him to – or put 
the contents of those documents through him for the 
record> 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  Most of the documents are annexures to Mr 
Oellermann’s report or annexures to Mr Loubser’s affidavit. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now Mr Montana can I firstly ask in relation 
to the Parkwood property you have seen the relevant part of 
Mr Oellermann’s report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I just want to say once again Mr 
Montana I know that were asked at short notice to avail 
yourself today and you agreed so that is – that is – that 
cooperation is appreciated. 
MR MONTANA:  Chair I must say I come as an unhappy 
witness today because I thought – I even asked the team 
20 
over the weekend why am I being called because the last 
time the – the Chairperson summarised the discussion on 
this matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  Was that I quickly sort out my affidavit. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 5 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  So that we – we can deal with these issues 
in the full context. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  Especially the fact that Chair I stated very 
clearly we are working on Mr Oellermann’s report which – 
what I have said I do not accept Chair and I think it should 
not even be before the commission unless he had filed the 
proper affidavit.   
You see – it cannot be that some of us file affidavits 
10 
under oath and then somebody files a report; attaches 
reports and other things. There is a context Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  And I think you probably allow me before 
we go to the specifics of the documents because I think so 
that the Chair can appreciate why I am aggrieved and the 
unfairness. 
CHAIRPERSON: Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  But I have also said Chair because I have 
been cooperating with the commission and the team I do not 
20 
want to bring administrative issues here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MONTANA:  We will continue dealing with them in the 
background. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 6 of 179 
 
MR MONTANA:  So that the focus on the hearings must be 
on the hearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Must be on the real issues ja. 
MR MONTANA:  So I am not going to stop you Chair but I 
think at some stage before – before we even go to the 
details I do not know when but maybe Mr Soni wants to 
finish the Parkwood. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  And then I indicate particularly because I 
think Chair the – the section on my affidavit on properties 
10 
which I think I have worked with the team it was done and 
of course it has not been before the commission as yet. 
Because I think that as we discuss the issues of properties 
my affidavit is not – it is not here.  We are discussing these 
issues – I want the part of my affidavit Chair to – to read it 
out – it is not long. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  So that – so that we can then – I can – we 
can deal with this issue in totality Chair.  So that – that will 
be my request Chair.  I do not know at what point you would 
20 
allow me but that is my request Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Well let me say this Mr Montana.  
Last week we adjourned on the basis on which we 
adjourned but for some time I have been trying to allocate 
dates to different witnesses and there are limited dates – 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 7 of 179 
 
days available because we are trying to finish all oral 
evidence by end of May.  So when I spoke to the legal team 
and said they should try and check whether you could make 
today it was within that context. 
MR MONTANA:  No I appreciate that one thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja but – so that is the one point.  
The second point is that you – you – we know that when we 
parted last time it was on the part of the basis was that it 
would be desirable to have something in writing from you 
that deals with the issue of properties and you do say that 
10 
your affidavit has a section that deals with that and that you 
– you would like to read that into the record.   
Now 
even 
if 
your 
affidavit 
is 
not 
before 
the 
commission as yet if that section can be dealt with as a 
standalone I do not see a problem and assuming that the 
issue – the problem with annexures does not affect it – now 
of course I do not know whether it does or it does not.  Mr 
Soni where – have you got – would you like to say 
something about that? 
ADV SONI SC:  Chairperson I have read Mr Montana’s 
20 
affidavit and I am just setting out what the difference is 
between the evidence that is intended to be led and what is 
contained in Mr Montana’s affidavit and Mr Montana can 
comment after I have given my – what my submission is in 
regard to those issues. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 8 of 179 
 
 
Mr Montana in his affidavit deals with all the 
properties that he owns and they are – if my memory serves 
me correctly about eight properties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Eight? 
ADV SONI SC:  Eight. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  We deal with only four properties.  These 
are the four properties that in some way or the other based 
on the documents that we have Mr Montana and Mr Van Der 
Walt were involved.  That is all we intend – that is the only 
10 
evidence we intend producing to you Chairperson. 
 
Now we do not accept that Mr Montana’s evidence 
on the other properties is relevant to the Terms of 
Reference 
of 
the 
Commission 
because 
there 
is 
no 
connection between Mr Van Der Walt and Mr Montana – and 
those properties.   
 
So that is the first point of departure.  The second 
point of departure is that Mr Montana in his affidavit does 
not deal with the issues as they are set out in the 
annexures to Mr Oellermann’s affidavit and once we get 
20 
passed that issue Chairperson – in other words if for 
example there is as there is a – an agreement – an offer to 
purchase and an acceptance of the offer therefore an 
agreement to purchase the property or to sell the property.  
That is a matter that we would like Mr Montana to confirm 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 9 of 179 
 
and in respect of each of the properties we have that.  
 
We 
also 
have 
the 
background 
to 
how 
those 
agreements arose and also the method of payment for those 
properties. 
 
Now those are the facts that we submit ought to be 
placed before you.  What inferences are to be drawn from 
those facts – what conclusions on would draw from them – 
whether there is anything improper – whether there is 
anything irregular is an entirely separate matter but we 
cannot reach that either in respect of what Mr Montana says 
10 
or what we say unless there is agreement on those basic 
facts. 
 
And so the purpose for this – although we do not 
have Mr Montana’s affidavit the purpose was – the purpose 
is just to get the facts before you when Mr Montana wants 
to comment on what inference is to drawn from them then 
we can deal with that which is contained in his affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I got the impression when last week 
Mr Montana talked about the issue of properties that he may 
be seeking to say his involvement in the properties that you 
20 
– you are focusing on. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Should be seen in the context – should be 
seen in a wider context. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 10 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Of 
his 
involvement 
even 
in 
other 
properties. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the impression I got that he is 
saying well maybe if you look at those particular properties 
you might get certain impressions but there is a wider 
picture that should be taken into account and when you take 
into account the wider picture you may take a different view.  
Or that – I thought that is what he might be wishing to say.  
So I guess that one will only take a view when one either 
10 
reads or hears what he has to say about the other 
properties how they come in – into the picture. 
 
But in terms of him reading into the record that 
section of his affidavit that deals with properties subject to 
the issue of relevance you do not have a problem? 
ADV SONI SC:  No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  Not at all Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  Not at all. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja so – so no that is fine.  Then the next 
thing is just the right time to do that. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  From your side is there a particular 
time that you – you would submit should be the right time? 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 11 of 179 
 
ADV SONI SC:  Chairperson I really do not have a problem 
with when it to be done I do not want to be unfair to Mr 
Montana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  If it is to be done at the outset but there 
must be one condition to it Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  That after Mr Montana sets out what he 
says are the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  The bigger picture. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  The bigger picture – what he says is the 
bigger picture then he must answer the questions that are 
posed in relation to those documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No he is here to do that.  He is here to do 
that ja.  Mr Montana you are here to do that? 
MR MONTANA:  Chair I – none of the – I have seen 
previously these documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  And I am here Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR MONTANA:  I would have asked that – I would have 
asked for another month to study the document to consult.  
I here Mr Soni. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  I will answer.  But Chair I think let me deal 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 12 of 179 
 
with three issues – small issues.  You see the commission 
owes me an apology Chair.  In fact if we were – if I did not 
respect the Chair and the commission I would have actually 
refused.  Mr Soni and Mr Oellermann stood and you asked 
an important question.  I think it was on the 2 n d of July 
Chair I cannot recall you wanted to clarify how much – how 
much – how many properties and how much.   
Chair the response from Mr Soni at that time was 
that Mr Montana – he corrected – he corrected the Chair 
and said Mr Montana bought properties for R36 million and 
10 
that is why Chair the process we are going to follow – 
because that is – that is not correct. Okay and that is why 
in my affidavit I deal with these properties dealings Chair 
because they are not – they are not illegitimate – they are 
unlawful.   
Why Mr Soni set it up in the manner that he does it 
is basically Chair and sustaining that false narrative and I 
think it is very important Chair for your benefit – I am not 
saying I am going to deal with that – broad picture. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR MONTANA:  I am going to deal with the specifics today 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR MONTANA:  So – so I think that for me I raise two 
issues in the 00:15:32. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 13 of 179 
 
 
The first one was what is the source of this thing?  I 
think the commission needs to understand why we came to 
this issue about houses.  
 
Secondly it then – the – and I said I want to be here 
to be accountable to the country.  The commission should 
probe my dealings on anything including on my properties.  
And Chair I have written over fifteen pages of my affidavit – 
focusses on my properties.  
 
So (speaking in vernacular)  I am here to answer it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR MONTANA:  And I am going to answer it.  So I think 
what should happen now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  You just said you are not funning 
away. 
MR MONTANA:  Chair I am here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  I am here and I think Mr Soni can grill me 
the whole day (speaking in vernacular) I am here Chair.  But 
I think it would be fair considering what has already been 
put on record that these parts of my – of my affidavit I read 
20 
it in – into record and then Mr Soni takes me out on each 
and every issue that he wants to grill me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no, no, that … 
MR MONTANA:  And then the other context of how we come 
here. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 14 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  And other attached documents.  I will 
speak with the – I will speak on them in the course of the – 
of the testimony Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no that is fine.  As you know I have 
asked Mr Soni whether he has any particular time that he 
thinks would be appropriate he says he has no particular 
time. So I think I will give you a chance now to put your 
side of the story on the properties basically reading into the 
record what is in your affidavit that is not before the 
10 
commission but it is fine to just read that part. So after you 
have finished then Mr Soni can put questions to you. 
MR MONTANA:  Thank you – thank you Chair I really 
appreciate it. Thank you Mr Soni. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Soni you wanted to say something. 
ADV SONI SC:  Just – I am going to deal with the contents 
of that in a moment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In due course. 
ADV SONI SC:  In due course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  But what I would just like from Mr Montana 
is I do not know whether the affidavit he submitted earlier is 
the same affidavit because I understand that he has drawn 
up a new affidavit.  I – I am not raising technicalities I just 
do not want there to be a disjuncture between what he 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 15 of 179 
 
reads into the record and the affidavit that may become part 
of the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Actually what you know what we could do 
– now I remember even our discussion las time because I 
had said it would be better if one has read your – what you 
are going to say before we start it makes things easier.  Is 
it not possible that for present purposes we could so to 
uplift from his affidavit that section that deals with the 
properties and then maybe we could adjourn – let me read – 
read it Mr Soni you can get a chance to read it and then 
10 
when we come back then he – he reads them into the record 
or whatever but at least we know what he has to say. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can – is it fine if we do it that way? 
MR MONTANA:  No, no I am happy Chair I think that – that 
would be the right way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja – Yes. And that section could – 
because it is a stand-alone could even be an Exhibit on its 
own.  It could be admitted as an Exhibit . 
ADV SONI SC:  As you please Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know on its own.  Shall we just 
adjourn so that that can be done.  How long would that take 
to – to do? 
ADV SONI SC:  Is this the same as – I am asking. 
MR MONTANA:  No, no it is – I have got it Chair I – I have 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 16 of 179 
 
got it here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have got it here. 
MR MONTANA:  I will give it to the team to make copies 
quickly 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. It is a stand-alone. 
MR MONTANA:  It is a stand-alone Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Stand-alone okay. 
MR MONTANA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then – then let me adjourn and then 
copies can be made. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We – it is fifteen page you said. It is 
fifteen pages. 
MR MONTANA:  Chair I think it is about fifteen pages.  I 
think it is page 311 to – to page – ja I think it is about 
fifteen pages Chair – I think to page 3 – 327.  It is not a lot 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay we have – Ja it might – I do not 
know – I do not… 
ADV SONI SC:  It certainly would expedite matters. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes it will expedite matters.  So – so let 
us see once I am done or – well – I will let you know.  That 
might take about maybe thirty/forty minutes I am not sure.  
Depends on how – how fast one can read.  But let us – let 
us try that. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 17 of 179 
 
ADV SONI SC:  As you please Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So let me adjourn and that copies can be 
made then I will be given a copy I will start reading and 
then we can resume after that.   
ADV SONI SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are we ready? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   We are ready, Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Let us continue then.  
Well, I saw in the statement, Mr Montana, that there is a 
reference to, maybe one or two, annexures.  I am not sure.  
Are those annexures available? 
MR MONTANA:   Yes, Chair they are available.  Just to 
explain, as discussed with Mr Soni. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, you will see I have given – I 
thought I had the commissioned affidavit but it will be here 
by lunchtime, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MONTANA:   So I gave the copies so that we can 
proceed, but it is exactly the same as you have.  The 
annexures are also available.  So we will make those 
available.  And we have agreed with Mr Soni that over and 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 18 of 179 
 
above that we will pull out this section with the annexures 
so that I hand them to the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   So that we know we are done with this 
particular matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Soni. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As you please.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   It seems as if the annexures are not 
here at the moment but Mr Montana will make them 
available ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Will supply them. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   ...at lunchtime or ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Okay let us continue then. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Mr Montana ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Montana, you can then read into the 
record ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   Thank you ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...your statement.   
MR MONTANA:   Thank you, Chair.  I think – I really 
appreciate Chair and I think this matter has been, not only 
before this Commission, but throughout the country to the 
nation about this properties and everything.  And that is 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 19 of 179 
 
why I wanted to put that on record before Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MONTANA:   And you will see, initially, Mr Soni 
mentioned that I am talking about four properties – all my 
properties. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   And that is four, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MONTANA:   But this statement explains Chair, you will 
see, it explains how the – actually the entire seven 
10 
properties which I used to have Chair.  I do not have them 
today.  I think it is very important.  That those properties 
how they are financed.  All the other properties that we are 
referring to.  And I think it is very important because it is 
at the heart of what we do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   You will see that, Chair, is – so it is – the 
heading is, My Property Dealings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe, Mr Soni, we should admit this as 
an exhibit. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As you please, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you have a suggestion what exhibit it 
should be? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   It is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think we should – I am going to write 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 20 of 179 
 
on mine ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...I will write – I will simply write 
Mr Montana’s version on the properties as read into the 
record today. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes.   
MR MONTANA:   I think they took – that after I have 
submitted with the affidavit at lunchtime, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, we can admit it now because 
...[intervenes]  
10 
MR MONTANA:   Now?  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...because it is a standalone. 
MR MONTANA:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then the annexures can come later.  
Mr Montana’s version on the properties as read into the 
record on 10 May 2021.  And then what exhibit should we 
make this to be? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Chairperson, I was just going to 
make a suggestion that it would be SS-18(b) because it is 
a response to Mr Oellermann’s ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Exhibit SS-18(b).  Capital letter B or 
small letter B? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   We can make it small letter B, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Small letter.  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You confirm, Mr Montana, that this is 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 21 of 179 
 
your version?  This document contains your version on the 
properties and that it contents are true and correct? 
MR MONTANA:   Yes, I do Chair.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  This document will therefore be 
admitted as an exhibit and will be marked as Exhibit Ss-
18(b). 
WITNESS, MR MONTANA’S STATEMENT ON PROPERTIES 
(WITNESS’S 
OWN 
VERSION) 
IS 
SUBMITTED 
AND 
MARKED AS EXHIBIT SS-18(b) 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As you please, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Okay you can go ahead 
then Mr Montana. 
MR MONTANA:   Thank you, Chair.  Chair, let me be 
heading to the document, to that document you just 
admitted.  This is my property dealings.  Chair, it says: 
“There is an allegation that Montana received 
gratification 
in 
the 
form 
of 
properties 
purchases 
on 
his 
behalf 
of 
Siyangena 
Technologies. 
In it so-called preliminary report on PRASA, 
20 
the 
Commission’s 
investigator, 
Clint 
Oellermann, and Evidence Leader, Advocate 
Basson, 
is 
told 
the 
Chairperson 
of 
the 
Commission, 
DCJ 
Zondo, 
that 
“Montana 
purchases 
properties 
of 
over 
R 36 million 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 22 of 179 
 
within a year. 
This is false. 
Siyangena Technologies for Riaan van der 
Walt did not purchase any property for me. 
There 
are 
four 
properties 
mentioned 
in 
Mr Oellermann’s report. 
One in Rose Street, Waterkloof in Pretoria, two 
adjacent properties in Brooklyn, and another in 
Antire Road, Sandhurst. 
This were purchased, buy and are owned by 
10 
Precise Trade, a company in which Riaan van 
der Walt is a sole shareholder and director. 
I reject with contempt the suggestion these 
properties belonging to me. 
There are seven properties in my name. 
I acquired three of the properties before I 
joined PRASA in 1998, 2004 and 2005 and I 
acquired four when I was in the employ of 
PRASA. 
I have since disposed off four properties over 
20 
the years. 
There was no Riaan van der Walt of Siyangena 
Technologies who did not buy any of these 
properties. 
I used my properties to generate profit or as 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 23 of 179 
 
an 
equity(?) 
in 
any 
property 
development 
where I became partner. 
I have the full right to grown my property 
portfolio and elected to partner with Riaan van 
der Walt in this regard. 
My relationship with Riaan van der Walt was 
above board. 
It was a partnership about mobilising common 
resources to develop properties and make 
money. 
10 
The partnership we built were about identifying 
opportunities in the property sector with a view 
to enter into a joined venture partnership 
agreements for purposes of development and 
ultimately share in the profit in each of the 
developments. 
There is nothing irregular or unlawful about 
this. 
Mr Van der Walt was not a director or an 
employee of Siyangena Technologies, had not 
20 
done 
work 
for 
PRASA 
nor 
has 
he 
been 
involved 
with 
PRASA 
tenders, 
our 
Electrician(?) Siyangena Technologies. 
There was no conflict of interest. 
There was no case of a conflict of interest. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 24 of 179 
 
Unfortunately, the partnership, Riaan van der 
Walt and I were pursuing did not materialise 
and ended on 29 October 2015. 
A copy of an email from Riaan van der Walt 
terminating our relationship is attached hereto, 
marked TLM-1160...” 
 
And Chair, I think that is what we will provide 
there in the course of that.  It will show that the – in our 
communication that we talk about that partnership or joint 
ventures. 
10 
“There is a desperate attempt to present the 
partnership with Riaan van der Walt and I were 
pursuing as a secret and linked to this to the 
tenders awarded to Siyangena Technologies. 
This is simply not true. 
In its preliminary report presented to the 
Commission, 
Mr 
Oellermann 
attempts 
to 
present financial or grand(?) statements of 
Loubser(?) 
Van 
der 
Walt 
Incorporated, 
managed by Riaan van der Walt as if this 
20 
belongs to Precise Trade and by extension to 
my relationship with Riaan van der Walt...” 
 
So, Chair, whatever transactions that took place 
between Loubser Van der Walt Incorporated and TMM are 
not known to me and have nothing to do with me.   
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 25 of 179 
 
“I had dealings with Precise Trade which had 
nothing to do with TMM or the properties which 
Loubser 
van 
der 
Walt 
Incorporated 
was 
managing. 
This was confirmed by Robert...” 
 
I think Matthews is the surname. 
“...from Loubser Van der 
Walt during his 
testimony here. 
“He seemed aggrieved, thought, about the fact 
that Riaan van der Walt may have done other 
10 
business outside the law firm and the other 
partners did not know. 
Again, this fight among the partners had 
nothing to do with me. 
The false information about gratification was 
first leaked to the journalist, Mr Peter-Lynne(?) 
Myburgh when I was still at PRASA. 
The journalist requested an interview with me 
on the various properties I owned at the time. 
The initial allegation was that the property I 
20 
owned 
in 
10 
Newport, 
Parkwood, 
Johannesburg was bought for me by Alstom, 
the lead company, the Gibela Rail Consortium, 
which won the R 53 billion PRASA Rolling 
Stock Fleet Renewal Programme Tender in 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 26 of 179 
 
2012. 
Mr 
Myburgh 
had 
already 
contacted 
some 
members of the Gibela Consortium to interview 
them about the said property. 
I 
granted 
Mr 
Myburgh 
an 
interview 
in 
April 2015. 
I brought to the office all my files of the 
properties, 
containing 
bank 
approvals 
and 
monthly repayments of the bond facilities. 
I gave Mr Myburgh the time in my office...” 
10 
 
He sat there, Chair, to read these documents in 
the presence of the PRASA’s spokesperson, Mr Moffat(?) 
Mofokeng – so we are not into peruse the files. 
“It became clear to Mr Myburgh that he was on 
a goose chase to nowhere and the files 
indicated 
the 
property 
in 
question 
was 
acquired by me in 2008 and financed by ABSA 
Bank...” 
 
So 2008, there was also no tender, Chair, for 
this rolling stock.  So there was no Alstom involved in that. 
20 
“When the opportunity presented itself – and 
Mr Myburgh to interview me, he changed his 
tune. 
It was no longer about properties. 
Instead, the interview focus on the Rolling 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 27 of 179 
 
Stock Fleet Renewal Programme, RSFRP, and 
he wanted clarity on the different players in 
this particular transaction. 
He proceeded to write a piece in the Rapport, 
a Sunday newspaper, about the role-players 
and trying to link these various individuals to 
former President Jacob Zuma. 
I had issue then...” 
 
Chair, I want – I am going to build(?) with a later 
stage when I come back with my affidavit, how this entire 
10 
thing was actually said as to pursue former president.  I 
will deal with that at the – at a later – so he is...  He 
interviewed me about the house and said:  Alstom bought 
you a house.   
 
But when he wrote and he realised, then it was 
said:  No, it is financed by the bank – the Parkwood 
property that Mr Soni will ask me about.  He found that that 
property actually is financed by the bank.  And then he 
then interviewed me about who are the different players.  I 
explained to him and he went to write an article for 
20 
Rapport newspaper as well as the City Press, I remember.   
 
And that is when they tried to drag the name of 
former President Zuma in all of this.  This thing is big, 
Chair.  I will deal with it at the right time.   
“I issued a statement on February 2016, the 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 28 of 179 
 
allegations that I benefited corruptly through 
my properties and I will attach here to you a 
copy of my statement marked TLM-161...” 
 
Chair, I think that will be another annexure that 
we will provide Chair.   
“As recent as 30 January 2018, I have rejected 
this allegations again in my testimony before 
the Parliamentary Inquiry into Governance at 
Eskom. 
I 
am 
rejecting 
the 
false 
information 
and 
10 
conclusion been made by Clint Oellermann, 
claiming that I bought properties to the value 
of over R 30 million. 
I can confirm that my own properties were 
financed by ABSA through a facility called a 
Private One Bank Account, a facility to the 
tune of R 10.5 million. 
I attached hereto a copy of the ABSA Private 
One Bank facility marked TLM-162...” 
 
And I think there is another annexure, Chair, that 
20 
we will provide to the Commission. 
“My monthly repayments for the facility at the 
time was R 95 973,00. 
A copy of the email from ABSA, calculating the 
repayments and the terms of the facilities are 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 29 of 179 
 
attached hereto, marked TLM-163. 
The specific details of the properties covered 
by the Private One facility... 
F-178, Saxonwold, Johannesburg, mortgage 
bond in the capital amount of R 4 675 000,00. 
Erf 359, Parkwood, Johannesburg... [and this 
is the one that has been highlighted, Chair, 
that I sold it.] ...mortgage bond in the capital 
amount of R 2 million. 
Remainder 
extent 
of 
1 F 161, 
Waterkloof, 
10 
Pretoria, first continuing cover mortgage bond 
in the capital amount of R 1 750 000,00. 
Remainder 
extent 
of 
Erf 
161, 
Waterkloof, 
second continuing covering mortgage bond in 
the capital amount of R 270 000,00...” 
 
So this was when I was doing improvements on 
the properties and of course, so you can see for the same 
property there is a third continuing cover bond in the 
capital amount of R 200 000,00. 
“Erf 1242, Waterkloof, Pretoria.   
20 
First continuing covering mortgage bond of 
R 2 160 000,00...” 
 
And Chair, I proceed, I say:   
“I sold one of the properties in Waterkloof 
which reduced the principal debt of the facility 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 30 of 179 
 
to R 8.3 million. 
The 
monthly 
repayments 
were 
accordingly 
reduced to R 63 593,00. 
A copy of the ABSA letter is attached hereto, 
marked TLM-164. 
In addition to the four properties, I acquired in 
1998 another property in Mamelodi, Pretoria 
with a mortgage bond from National Bank...” 
 
I think the amount was – they did not include the 
amount there but it was R 116 000,00 Char. 
10 
“I later sold four of the properties and used the 
proceeds to settle debts and to invest in other 
properties...” 
 
And I think, Chair, this is very important because 
Mr Soni said let us focus on the four.  I want to show the 
Commission how, when I sold, I got involved in the four 
properties that he mentioned.  So in each of these I have 
used my own money, Chair, from the sale of other 
properties that I have developed(?). 
“I had relied on the properties which I owned 
20 
and the Private One facility that ABSA had 
extended to me, to either buy properties or 
enter into partnerships or joint ventures to 
unlock value from properties I owned or to 
invest in new developments. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 31 of 179 
 
I 
had 
also 
lost 
money 
in 
some 
of 
the 
developments, did not materialise or were 
abandoned...” 
 
So Chair, it has been made, a statement has 
been made that I bought – I got involved in all of those 
things.  I did not have a cent to buy and that is so false 
Chair.   
“Unfortunately, ABSA could no longer extend 
the Private Once facility further and had 
insisted that I had to dispose off or rent out 
10 
some of the properties to remain within the 
affordability set that the bank before any 
financing could – feature financing could be 
considered. 
I, therefore, had to sell some of the properties 
to meet the bank’s requirements to generate 
cash or pay for my stake in the various 
developments’ agreements I had intended to 
partake. 
The 
false 
allegations 
about 
gratification 
20 
emanates from the affidavits of Paul O’Sullivan 
and Philemon Mamabolo who has doing some 
investigation work on behalf of Popo Molefe 
and Werksmans Attorneys. 
I provide below further details of each of the 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 32 of 179 
 
seven properties I owned...” 
 
And Chair, that is where I want to then explain 
the 
sale 
of 
this 
paid 
for 
this, 
which 
I 
think 
this 
Oellermann’s report failed to understand.  Chair, let me 
start with the first one.  In 2016, Mr Myburgh trespassed 
on one of my properties, 333 Main Street, Waterkloof, 
Pretoria, claiming he was investigating corruption in the 
manner in which I had acquired this property.   
 
The 
said 
property 
was 
purchased 
in 
December 2004 when I relocated from Cape Town to start a 
10 
new job as Deputy Director General in the Department of 
Transport.  Now Chair, I mentioned that because it is very 
important.  I only started at PRASA in 2006.  The bank 
financed this property in 2004 but I am being accused that 
I bought it from corrupt proceeds from PRASA when I was 
not even working for PRASA at that time, Chair.  So it is 
very important that I put that on record. 
 
The property again was financed by ABSA and I 
think I mentioned the details of how it – the amount of the 
bond.  I developed the property into a modern property in 
20 
the heart of Waterkloof.  It is today being used as an 
embassy after I have sold it, Chair, for about R 8.5 million.  
Ja, R 8.5 million in late 2016.  The bond cancellation was 
in the region of the R 2.2 million and the rest of the 
proceeds were invested into another property, Victoria 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 33 of 179 
 
Street in Waterkloof.   
 
So, Chair – so this property I bought in 2004, 
developed it, I was not working for PRASA, and sold it in 
2016.  Yet the journalist comes into the house.  I think 
there was a story that I hit him with a brick or something 
like that.  It was in the newspapers.  But Chair, I am an 
African man.  [Speaking vernacular].  And do as he wish.  I 
will never allow that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MONTANA:   I was saying, Mr Soni, that as an African 
10 
man I will not allow a man to trespass at my father ’s(?) 
house and do as he wishes.  Mr Myburgh was trying to do, 
Chair, he trespassed.  He was there inside my – inside my 
yard.  And this property, as you can see, I bought it before 
I worked for PRASA, Chair.  So that is the first issues 
here. 
 
Then there is another property, 1242 Waterkloof.  
Chair, this property was purchased in 2005 and again I was 
not working for PRASA, Chair.  This was financed by the 
bank through the very same private one bank facility.  
20 
Chair, the important point – two points – let me finish 
reading it and there are two important points that I want to 
highlight for the Chair. 
“I had done major renovations and extensions 
to the property. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 34 of 179 
 
The property was valued at R 8.5 million in 
2013. 
However, 
the 
property 
was 
sold 
for 
R 2 750 000,00 to a family that owned one of 
the properties purchased by Riaan van der 
Walt in Brooklyn...” 
 
So when he talked about two Brooklyn adjacent 
properties, Chair, you will see, I will explain this point.  So 
it relates to the second property that they are not part of 
the four that Mr Soni...  I want to demonstrate, Chair, to 
10 
you that in each and every property dealings I got involved 
I owned a house.  I either sold or put it into a scheme.   
“I have taken the risk of letting go of the 
property at a hugely discounted price.   
This was to facilitate for the consolidation of 
the properties and development in the future. 
The development would have involved Precise 
Trade and myself. 
Precise Trade is a company that is owned by 
Riaan van der Walt...” 
20 
 
So here is this family, Chair.  Why I bought – and 
these properties are in the same street, by the way Chair, 
in Waterkloof.  When I was Deputy Director General in the 
Department of Transport, I was staying in a house.  My 
house was attacked by warlords or Inkhati(?) from the taxi 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 35 of 179 
 
industry because one of the programmes I was running was 
a Taxi Recapitalisation Programme. 
 
And the State Security, National Intelligence at 
that time, agency, came and do a security assessment and 
said:  Look, your property is actually sitting in a place 
where it is easy that you could be attacked because it is 
closer to a shopping centre.  Someone can monitor and 
movements from there.  They asked that I move.  So I did 
not sell the property but I moved Chair six street further 
away from there.  This is the property that I bought. 
10 
 
And I developed it and you can see, Chair, I 
bought it before I worked for PRASA in 2005.  So the first 
one in 2004, the second one is in 2005.  I developed it 
Chair, but if disposal is very important because it relates to 
the two properties that Riaan purchased, Chair, as it were, 
and this was not in Oellermann’s report, Chair, because 
those details were left out.  If I had been interviewed, 
those details would have been made and this report would 
not have come before the Commission because they would 
have seen that this man had put his money into all of this 
20 
development Chair. 
 
So, I had effectively after that transaction and 
the entire thing was abandoned, I have lost approximately 
Chair, if we look at the values of the properties, about 
R 5.7 million in - when I prepared for that partnership.  
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 36 of 179 
 
Now this Erf 178 Saxonwold, Chair.  This property was 
purchased in 2008.  I was working for PRASA.  Again, it 
was financed by the bank for R 4.6 million and I just 
recently sold it Chair to settle my – to settle the very same 
facility with ABSA and to settled also my debt with the 
South African Revenue Services. 
 
Now Erf 359 Parkwood, Chair, the property was 
purchased in 2008.  Chair, I paid R 2 million for it.  It was 
financed by the bank from the very same facility and it was 
a complete wreck, Chair.  I still have pictures of then and 
10 
now.  I bought the property because I have been dealing 
with property Chair.  I had rebuild the property and then 
turned it into a modern house.  I sold it for R 6.8 million to 
Riaan van der Walt in 2013, Chair. 
 
Mr Louis(?) Myburgh claimed in his article, and 
this you will get it from the affidavit of mister – the 22-page 
affidavit 
of 
Mr 
Paul 
O’Sullivan, 
that 
according 
to 
neighbours in Parkwood, the property should have been 
sold for R 4.8 million.  I initially asked for R 7.2 million but 
Riaan van der Walt offered me R 6.8 million for the 
20 
property which I accepted.  The valuation of the R 3 million 
that is been the abandoned(?) Chair, it is not known to me 
and did not relate to the price of the property at the time of 
the sale. 
 
It 
has 
been 
brought 
here 
as 
part 
of 
the 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 37 of 179 
 
Oellermann’s 
report, 
Chair, 
that 
the 
property 
was 
valued(?).  It is false, Chair.  There is no such a thing.  
This is noise about the price of the property did not – the 
noise about the property or the price of the property did 
not come from neighbours, as claimed by Myburgh in his 
article, but it came from Mr Paul O’Sullivan’s 22-page 
affidavit.  And Chair, I want to challenge the neighbours.  I 
think this Commission, if it is true to what Mr Oellermann 
says. 
 
Take the statement from the neighbour, they put 
10 
it under oath and we cross-examine the neighbours as well 
to say:  Do you believe it?  And yet have you seen 
Mr Montana’s house?  Have you lived in that particular 
house? 
 
Mr 
Soni 
raised 
an 
issue 
that 
Mr 
Saiki(?) 
Zamchlaka(?) who was one of the CEO’s lived in the 
house, Chair.  And it is true.  He lived in my house – in the 
house Chair but the insinuation that Mr Zamchlaka lived in 
that house because he was involved in a corrupt scheme, 
that is not true Chair. 
 
The house was a wreck, I fixed it, I left it, 
20 
actually, unoccupied.  It was vandalised.  I fixed it and 
Mr Zamchlaka at some stage for his own family reasons 
which I cannot deal with it.  He was forced to live in the 
city of Johannesburg.  And I said to him:  My brother, the 
gangster in the city of Johannesburg, they are going to kill 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 38 of 179 
 
you.  I have got a house.  You can live there rent free for a 
while.  And when I sold the house to Mr Riaan van der 
Walt, they then agreed that he can rent the property.  I do 
not know how much he was paying and all of those.   
 
But I put him there because when I left it empty 
– so it was vandalised, I fixed it again at a huge cost, 
Chair, but – and then he lived there.  Later I sold the 
property, Chair, as it were.  Now Chair, you can see – I 
want to explain the R 6.8 million, how it was spent but let 
me finish readings these two paragraphs first. 
10 
“The journalist... [And that is Mr Myburgh] 
...and the so-called neighbours did not have 
details of the investment I had made and had 
not been inside the house – into the house. 
Did not see work which had been done, the 
quality of finished or items that had been 
installed, yet they wanted to determine the 
price for my property...” 
 
The same journalist and investigators did not 
rely on any independent evaluation, Chair, to say you must 
20 
sell it for R 5 million or R 3 million.  This thing is just... 
[coughing].  We are here to discuss the... [coughing] of the 
house that people do not even know how I bought it, what 
were the developments and all of those things.   
“Mr Myburgh started writing about the new 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 39 of 179 
 
owner, Mr Van der Walt, and that he had 
represented Mr Mario Ferreira in some deal as 
an attorney...: 
 
Therefore, you are guilty by association, Chair.  
It is not an issue of corruption here.  It is that because 
Lucky works with Riaan van der Walt and Van der Walt was 
a director in another firm and that firm had worked with – 
did something for Mr Ferreira’s company, TMM.  Therefore 
we are guilty.  That is at the heart of this thing Chair but I 
will explain the underlining reasons why this is done(?). 
10 
 
Let me go to Erf 161, Chair.   
“This property was purchased for R 2.2 million 
cash from the proceeds of the sale of the 
Parkwood property...” 
 
Okay?  Now this another property, Chair, in 
Waterkloof.  It was behind ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   It is two comma ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   Two ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...twenty-five ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   R 2.25 million, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   Now Chair, just for you to make the 
connection.  You can see that I am – there are two – this 
remain – remaining extent of Erf 161 Waterkloof and then 
there is Erf 161 Waterkloof.  You can see these are two 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 40 of 179 
 
properties.  So I owned the properties in front.  So the 
property has been sub-divided.   
 
So when I sold Parkwood property, Chair, I then 
said because Riaan was buying the...  I said:  No, I want 
part of that money to be put into that property.  So you will 
see that when you look at my bank account there is no flow 
of the payments of the R 6.8 million to me.   
 
There is - the money primarily went to three 
places.  It did not come to my account.  And I thought the 
investigators, 
Chair, 
would 
ask 
themselves 
that 
first 
10 
question and they did not because they are not interested 
in the truth.  R 6.8 million – the first payment Chair went to 
settle – to cancel the bond of R 2 million.  So that was – 
that happened.  It was done by Riaan to ABSA for the 
Parkwood property after it was transferred in his name.   
 
The second R 2 million, Chair, it went to the 
Hurlingham property.  You see the Hurlingham is one of the 
four, Chair.  So after I have sold in Parkwood and I found 
the property in Hurlingham, I paid the first deposit.  You 
will see that in the offer to sell this – to this – a deposit of 
20 
R 2 million.  It was paid by me, Chair.  Mr Oellermann...   
 
Mr Soni has been saying here he did not have 
money to pay.  Not true, Chair.  The R 2 million deposit 
was paid by me.  It is money – it is proceeds from the sale 
of the Parkwood property that was financed by ABSA.  Why 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 41 of 179 
 
would – and Chair, you see, this shows the importance that 
people should do proper investigations.  They were here to 
damage my name, to make sure that whole country is told 
Montana is involved in corrupt properties, okay?   
So I paid the 2 million and then the remainder, 
Chair, of that 6.8, part of it is 2 million, 2 million, four, so 
that is 4.8 and the 2. – what is it, where am I, Chair, the 
2.25 was paid by Riaan on my behalf, Chair, from the 
proceeds of the sale.  Okay? 
So, Chair, the story that Parkwood was expensive, 
10 
that I sold it above, it is false, unless if someone who get a 
quantity surveyor and say calculate all the costs and then 
make a market value, a determination of the market value 
and do that and then decide it is so.  But for me the bottom 
line is that there is no single transaction are being 
involved where my money was not involved, Chair, and I 
think that the - you know, I was sitting with her in that 
chair, when I listened this report being tabled here and you 
can see that there was no interest in the truth except to 
damage 
my 
reputation, 
that 
he 
is 
corrupt, 
he 
gave 
20 
Siyangena contracts so that he can get properties.  It is so 
false, Chair. 
Now, Chair, let me go to 12 Montrose, Hurlingham, 
is the one that I said the R2 million, Chair, was deposited.  
And let me explain, Chair, you will see in the annexures 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 42 of 179 
 
that will come, I have got an agreement, what do you call 
it, 
a 
joint 
venture 
agreement 
with 
a 
company 
me 
Midtownbrace.  You remember last week, Chair, I insisted 
that you read the affidavit deposed by Andre Wagner, the 
Commission said it is irrelevant, okay?  Why?  Because the 
Commission’s investigators were trying to deny the fact 
that I put the first 2 million and I have entered into a 
transaction, into a development for this property because 
we had wanted to build 15 luxury units in the heart of 
Sandhurst and each one of them, we were going to sell it 
10 
for 18 million according to the plan that we had in 2015. 
So when you get involved in property, [speaking in 
the vernacular], you are not doing it for charity.  So these 
investigators at the Commission believed that because I 
am CFO of PRASA, I am not entitled to get involved in any 
other development because these properties do not conflict 
with PRASA, it has got nothing to with PRASA, it is a fact 
that, Chair, every Sunday – you know, Chair, [speaking in 
the vernacular], I do not drink, I do not smoke, I do not do 
parties.  I am a CEO, I get this amount of money, then I get 
20 
involved in property, that is what I have been doing.  If 
there is one activity I do in my spare time, I go, I look for 
empty land.  That is what I do.  There is nothing corrupt, 
there is nothing unlawful and, Chair, I will not even 
apologise to anyone because if we do not get involved in 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 43 of 179 
 
property, as Africans, I am being victimised here, that you 
should not get involved in property and you have stolen, 
but yet the fact about the transactions are deliberately 
being ignored by the Commission.  Montrose, Chair, a 
deposit was paid by me and let me tell you, Chair, I did not 
have the money.  I did not have the money, I had R2 million 
and I instructed Riaan that from the proceeds of Parkwood 
can you pay because I wanted to buy time.   
I was not going to this property, Chair, I went to 
view a property in Sandhurst and I ended up in this place 
10 
by accident.  It was an old house but it was a garden of 
Eden, Chair, it was a massive property, I think that it was 
6 600 square metres.  The garden was amazing and I said I 
want this property.   
That is where I met Louis Green, Chair.  So the 
affidavit of Louis Green is not false, it is true, I met – I 
went to that property and I said no, I will pay a deposit of 2 
million because he told me there are people who are 
interested, they are developers, so I said no, I am also a 
developer, I will pay a deposit of 2 million so that I can be 
20 
given time.   
The investigators are true to themselves and to this 
Commission, they will also say that I was threatened 
because the 2 million was a non-refundable deposit I have 
made.  They then put me on terms to say you have now 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 44 of 179 
 
missed the deadline, you are going to forfeit the 2 million.  
That is when I had to find, Chair, someone to partner with 
me on this development and that is how I was introduced to 
Mr Andre Wagner and Andre says we put the money – we 
put 11.5 million into this and that you will then also match 
our investment to 11.5.  So I had already put 2 million, I 
have already put the deposit money – or rather, the 
transfer costs and everything and then I had to raise the 
other money, Chair. 
Chair, I want to FNB in Pretoria, private one, there 
10 
is a lady who financed my properties from ABSA but had 
moved to FNB in Pretoria.  I went – she was based in Cape 
Town, I went to her and say I need money, I have got this 
property, I have got partners and I need to put – can you 
give me 10 million to put into this property?  But they were 
very honest with me because at that time the stories were 
made – they told me I am a politically exposed person, 
Chair, and that is why we had a problem because the cost 
of development was going to come from me.  So I put that 
in an annexure and I put all those details, Chair, in that 
20 
particular regard. 
Now, Chair, the Mamelodi property, I do not want to 
talk much, it was in fact our family home, Chair, but 
because of a legal dispute the property was auctioned and 
I went to the auction, I was the – I made as the winner in 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 45 of 179 
 
that bid and that this was financed by First National Bank 
for 160, it is a family home.  Even though it is my name but 
it is one of our family homes in Mamelodi, Chair.  So I am 
still a property owner.  No one can say I left Mamelodi, I 
am still there, I still have a property.  I am a rate payer in 
Mamelodi, Chair, so people cannot exclude me there 
because I need a base, [speaking in the vernacular], Chair. 
Then let me deal finally, Chair, with Precise Trading 
in Brooklyn.  And you see, Chair, I have been silent on two 
properties deliberately.  I touched them at the beginning, 
10 
the Waterkloof property in Rose Street and the property in 
Sandhurst, despite my involvement in those properties.  
There is no doubts, I mention – I confirm here that Riaan 
and I were involved in a partnership.  So I have been 
involved. 
What I heard at this Commission, Chair, was in fact 
something that – somebody, Ms de Beer comes here, Mr 
Montana came to fetch the keys.  Irrelevant things.   
If – you are not helping the Commission unless you 
can clarify how each of these properties were financed.  By 
20 
the fact that I was there or the keys were fetched, it does 
not help this Commission.  Was it going to do?   
If I am involved in partnership with Riaan surely 
that I will be there, Chair, and I think that the point is 
being missed here because the real issue is to try to 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 46 of 179 
 
project me in this negative light. 
Now, Chair, let explain to you the Precise Trade’s 
Brooklyn properties because I have heard again some very 
interesting stories, being mentioned by Mr Oellermann.  
Mamabolo the guy from PRASA who deposed of an 
affidavit, claims – and I have attached his affidavit, as well 
as O’Sullivan’s affidavit, I have attached both of them, 
Chair.  Claims in his affidavit that Riaan van der Walk 
bought 
a 
property 
for 
me 
in 
Brooklyn 
as 
part 
of 
gratification by Siyangena.   
10 
Mamabolo and O’Sullivan were so determined to 
tarnish my image and quickly piled the false information to 
Pieter-Louis Myburgh who wrote another article in the 
Afrikaner 
Sunday 
newspaper 
Rapport 
and 
its 
sister 
publication City Press.  Had they done proper investigation 
they would have come across the following facts. 
The first one was that Riaan bought two adjacent 
properties in Brooklyn and registered this in the name of 
his company, Precise Trade.  Not lucky Montana, Precise 
Trade. 
20 
I had sold one of my properties in Waterkloof and, 
Chair, this property is one I referred to erf 1242, the one 
that I moved into after the taxi people chased me.   
Chair, I had sold one of my properties in Waterkloof 
– the family was staying in one of the properties bought by 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 47 of 179 
 
Riaan.  So he bought those two properties. 
Now this property, my property was R8.5 million at 
that time.  I developed, Chair, I doubled the size of the 
property, so I give this property, so we then agreed that I 
will sell my property to this family to match the price of 
their own house that they were selling because they were – 
in real terms, that family was not selling the house, Chair, 
but because – if you were do – these properties is two 
properties that have been subdivided.   
You will not do a development if they are not 
10 
consolidated, so that family was incentivised to move from 
Brooklyn to move into my property in Waterkloof and then 
we – basically there was no money exchanged, Chair.  So 
my bond – I said as long as we can cancel my bond with a 
bank, which was done and the family moved that thing and 
the two properties.  Now until that stage I did not have any 
role because we then agreed that once the properties had 
been consolidated into one I will then – we will then be 
able to do a joint development onto that property. 
So it is business, Chair, I put my property with 
20 
higher 
value 
precisely 
because 
I 
know 
that 
the 
development would be very important and I had also 
rendered that – that is one of the properties, Chair, used 
by my aunt who was running a catering business, Chair.  
So that property was used there in that process. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 48 of 179 
 
So O’Sullivan and Mamabolo  
do 
not 
know 
these facts, they are not in Oellermann’s report because 
they are not interested in the truth, they were there to say 
pursue Montana because after they investigated corruption 
at PRASA they could not link me to any corruption, Chair.  
What did they do?  They say he is a property man, then 
they have damaged me, Chair, I have lost a lot of money.  I 
have lost a lot of assets.  That some of these properties, I 
have got – the Hurlingham property, I had to abandon it, 
Chair, I could not do the development precisely because 
10 
even the banks say we cannot touch you, Montana, with all 
these reports that are there.  I think they have succeeded 
in what they are trying to do, Chair. 
The development potential of the two Brooklyn 
properties was huge, Chair, and not only that, when you 
look at the Rose properties, by the way, the one owned by 
Ms Sally de Beer.  Why were we interested in that 
property, Chair?   Because  - and she did not say it here, 
the property had business rights.   
So you can call me a black Jew, Chair, when it 
20 
comes to making money and properties, it is a thing that I 
do and will not come to the Commission and apologise.  
You know, if there is something that we have – so here we 
are fighting about inferences about these properties, Chair. 
Now, 
Chair, 
you 
can 
see 
that 
Parkwood, 
the 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 49 of 179 
 
property that was there in Parkwood, bought by Riaan, it 
was bought after I had done a lot of work.  You can see 
that the proceeds of the sale of that property went into 
Hurlingham, it went into my other Waterkloof property that I 
still own to this very day, Chair.  You can see, Chair, that 
the family that moved – it moved into my own property, 
Chair, precisely because the development potential was 
huge. 
Chair, I worked with Riaan.  Riaan van der Walt is 
such a man of integrity and, you know, it saddened me to 
10 
see a man who was a key person, he was playing a major 
role in his church, he was one of the church elders, the 
story about the properties had destroyed him, Chair, a 
great legal mind and I know a committed South African, an 
Afrikaner who was committed to this country who was 
involved in businesses, Chair.  And let me say finally, 
contrary to what you have been told, Chair, because the 
Commission 
and 
Oellermann, 
getting 
the 
story 
from 
O’Sullivan, he is saying but Montana was involved with 
Riaan, never denied that, Chair, and he says it means 
20 
Riaan’s properties are Montana’s properties.  Why would – 
I bought other properties that are registered in my name, 
why would properties that are bought by Precise Trade be 
Montana’s properties?  That is what they are trying to say, 
that is the inference that no, Riaan was buying them from 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 50 of 179 
 
Montana.  But, Chair, I since got information about the 
liquidation of Precise Trade and, you know, to my surprise 
I found that they are in fact – and I think this is very 
important that the Commission get the liquidators of 
Precise Trade because I am told they have approached the 
other investors in Precise Trade to offer them these things.  
That is what the information I got.  They never approached 
me.  
In public I am told the properties belong to me but 
when they are sold, the investors, there are two investors 
10 
into – the one that Riaan worked with and I think in Robert 
Neethling’s affidavit he mentioned the people who invested 
into Precise Trade.  I was not even one of them but I had a 
partnership with Mr Riaan van der Walt, which was public, 
which was known, and I was proud, Chair, if another 
opportunity were to arise, for me to work with Mr Riaan van 
der Walt because Riaan does not work for – you know, you 
get a sense that Riaan is a director of Siyangena or is a 
lawyer or internal lawyer of – no, Chair, Riaan is a person 
there but what has happened is that the people – the group 
20 
that is guided not by facts but by connecting the dots.  
That is all.  Montana works with Van der Walt.  Van der 
Walt has got some relationship with a law firm that works 
with – that did work for what is it called, TMM or 
Siyangena.  So they are saying they are tied, it is one 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 51 of 179 
 
thing, it is a corrupt scheme.  It is so false, Chair. 
Now let me conclude, Chair, my submission by – 
how did you get to this point?  Because, I think that, Chair, 
it is very important to understand that.  How did you get to 
this point being turned around?  It starts with one Mr Paul 
O’Sullivan and O’Sullivan and in a different section of my 
affidavit I deal with that at length, Chair. 
Immediately after I have left PRASA in 2015 I was 
approached by people who wanted to help me.  I later 
learned that these people are Paul O’Sullivan’s people.  
10 
They told me, Chair, that – they met me at the DaVinci 
Hotel in Sandton.  I got a call from someone from Cape 
Town in the ANC who said there are people who want to 
help you because already the noise has started.  I said  I 
will with them, I went to Sandton. 
So these people came and when I arrived there I 
realised there is a problem but I met with the chaps.  They 
told me something and I think this was about in August – I 
think it should have been in late July, beginning of August 
2015.   
20 
They said to me Mr Montana, we want to help you.  
I say how do you want to help me?  They say we work with 
the Hawks, we work with the NPA.  You are regarded as the 
leader of the biggest criminal syndicate that has defrauded 
the state of R3.6 billion.  [speaking in the vernacular], if 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 52 of 179 
 
you can pack it on the ground here, just to say this, Chair, 
is 3.6, do you think I will be on these shores, Chair, I 
would be here in South Africa?  I would probably be sitting 
on a yacht somewhere, is it not, in the middle of the 
Mediterranean enjoying that money.  There is a R3.6 billion 
Montana took, he used different contracts, Swifambo, 
Siyangena and stole this money.   
So I said so why do they not charge me?  They said 
no, we are working with them, we want to help you.  So I 
say how am I going to help you?  They say I must pass part 
10 
of that money to them, they will help me.  I think at that 
time they wanted 500 million.  Chair, you can see in my 
face, I mean, I am 500 million myself, maybe that is my 
value.  They wanted 500 million. 
Do you know what was my response, Chair?  I said I 
am very happy to work with you but can you please go – 
why do you not identify and tell me where this money, this 
loot is stashed?  Those are my exact words.  Show it to 
me, once you guys can show it to me, you are going to get 
even more than what you had asked for.  They have never 
20 
come back to me. 
Chair, I thought that was the end, okay?  They 
approached some of the companies that are mentioned, 
that are said to be involved in a corrupt relationship with 
me.  They then demanded money and these companies 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 53 of 179 
 
called me and say man, we have been approached.  I will 
not mentioned their names, Chair, because I think it would 
be unfair, but I do not want to put their lives at risk. 
So they were approached to say pay some money.  I 
blocked it.  They say no, O’Sullivan will solve your 
problems.  I blocked it, Chair, and I told them – let me use 
my words, O’Sullivan must go to hell.  He has intimidated a 
lot of people. 
Now what O’Sullivan does, Chair, if you want to 
understand his affidavit, I have refused to pay.  I say in 
10 
South Africa, I do not pay anybody, in South Africa I never 
pay anybody.  If the law enforcement believe that they 
have got a case against me, let me be put – let me go to 
court. 
Now, Chair, what has happened is that – and this 
modus operandi is not isolated, Chair.  I know Mr 
O’Sullivan has said in response to my affidavit that he is 
willing to cross-examine me, Chair.  Like Werksmans, I am 
more than happy, Chair, I hope he applies to cross-
examine.  I told him, Chair, I call him the Irish extortionist 
20 
because what Paul O’Sullivan does in this country – he has 
been praised as a crime fighter and praise himself “I 
bought down Jackie Selebe”.   
No, no, no, the man is at the heart of criminal 
activity in the country.  Those of us who know, Chair, and I 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 54 of 179 
 
am saying because it is in my affidavit and he has been 
notified.  What I am saying here he knows, Chair, and that 
is why I am inviting him to cross-examine.  What he does, 
Chair, where people – prominent South Africans are 
involved, are having problems with SARS or the law, Paul 
O’Sullivan come in and say I will help you and he collects 
money and let me say, Chair, I have even seen statements, 
financial statements – and you remember in my affidavit I 
have 
called 
for 
this 
Commission 
to 
subpoena 
the 
companies 
and 
the 
financial 
statements 
and 
bank 
10 
statements of all companies that belong to Paul O’Sullivan.  
You will actually see, Chair, that the modus operandi is 
very simple.  If you are in trouble, Paul arrives.  He got his 
enforcers and these enforcers came from Cape Town.  I 
have come face to face with them at the DaVinci Hotel and, 
Chair, they insist you must pay them and therefore they 
will sort out the case.  They also pay on the other side at 
SARS.  Chair, you cannot tell me about SARS, one of the 
most corrupt organisations that we have, okay?  And I am 
still going to – Chair, I am saying these people because I 
20 
want, Chair – for me, I want this Commission on what it 
should focus on, the real capture.   
And when you move beyond O’Sullivan, Chair, so 
they go to SARS and the police, he send me emails and 
say Montana – I think it was in 2018 – Montana, got good 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 55 of 179 
 
news for you, you are going to be arrested before 
Christmas.  I say I am happy for you, Mr O’Sullivan, Happy 
New Year, I will see you in January in 2019. 
So he tried to intimidate me, Chair, and I told him 
that he is one of the most  - the number one criminal in the 
country and the biggest crook.  The intelligence services, 
the law enforcement agents are afraid to deal with Mr Paul 
O’Sullivan 
and 
because 
they 
are 
afraid 
of 
him 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I want to limit you now because we are 
10 
dealing 
with 
the 
properties 
but 
I 
wanted 
you 
to 
…[intervenes] 
MR MONTANA:   Yes, Chair, but let me …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Show the connection, ja. 
MR MONTANA:   Sure, Chair.  The issue I am saying is 
that all these lies about my properties, they come from a 
criminal gang that wanted to extort money from me and 
other people and then they went to write – afterwards that 
is when this 22 affidavit came and accused me of all sorts 
of things and that is why I want Mr O’Sullivan, I want 
20 
Werksmans here.  And you know it is going to be very 
interesting, Chair, because I want to use that cross-
examination to expose the real criminals.  But I will not 
end there, I actually want to show how they link to the 
structure of power in our country and, Chair, I have made 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 56 of 179 
 
up my mind, I am one of the people who are going to 
spearhead the fight against the structure of power that 
actually use criminal – including [indistinct], Chair, so I am 
inviting them to apply to the Commission and say want to 
cross-examine Montana, I will be here to engage with 
them, Chair, to assist this Commission to understand.   
That is why, Chair, let me read, as my conclusion, 
what I said in the conclusion to my statement to this 
Commission.  I think it is very important, Chair, that I do 
that.  I said – I thank you, Chair, in this statement but I say 
10 
here that – and I quote, Chair: 
“The work of this Commission will be incomplete 
without looking deeply into the activities of this 
network and its unlawful surveillance activities at 
PRASA and beyond.  It has appropriated to itself 
key functions of the South African state.” 
So, Chair, this Commission, in my view, the property thing 
looks like Lucky Montana is saying there is some corrupt 
thing.  It is a big thing, Chair, and I hold that before May, 
Chair, when you close the work of this Commission and I 
20 
know, they chase me, Chair, because they have got the 
people armed and everything, but I come here, Chair, and I 
am going to assist this – Chair, one thing, you asked me to 
come and assist this Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you …[intervenes] 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 57 of 179 
 
MR MONTANA:   I am going to assist you with the real 
criminals, Chair, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, alright.  Now at least you got 
a chance to put your side of the story and now Mr Soni can 
begin the questioning. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As you please, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Mr Montana …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not know what your approach is 
going to be, Mr Soni, but in the light of the various 
10 
explanations that Mr Montana is giving in regard to the 
properties and I think some of them, the explanations 
affect different properties and are interwoven.  It may be 
that it would be helpful to take one property at a time. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As you please, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And move from one to the next. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  Okay, alright. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Chairperson, I am placing on record I 
am only going on the properties we have investigated. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja, no, no, no, obviously those are 
the only ones that you will question him on. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now, Mr Montana, in the first 
paragraph of the statement you read this morning, that is 
SS18B, you say in the second sentence: 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 58 of 179 
 
“It its so-called preliminary report on PRASA the 
Commission’s investigator, Clint Oellermann and 
evidence leader Soni told the Chairperson of the 
Commission that…” 
And you quote: 
“Montana purchased properties of over R36 million 
within a year.” 
That is the allegation you made. 
MR MONTANA:   No, no, Chair, I am not making allegation, 
this is what you answered the Chair. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I just want to – can I …[intervenes] 
MR MONTANA:   It is a statement of fact, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Well, let me – you did not only  say I 
said it, you said Mr Oellermann said it as well. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, the Chair – the Chair asked for 
confirmation and asked you, Mr Soni, and you are the one 
who answered to say no, he bought properties for R36 
million. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Mr Montana, I do not want us to go to 
and fro, I did not interrupt you.  I am going to ask you a 
20 
question.  I would like you to please look at paragraph 4 of 
Mr Oellermann’s report which is bundle, H, SS18 and page 
4 and I will just read the relevant parts of that paragraph, 
it says: 
“Between August 2014 …[intervenes] 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 59 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Soni, when I came here 
this file was opened on a certain page and that is not the 
page you are on. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Oh, sorry, Chairperson, it is a 
different page, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   It is page 4, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We will be using bundle H. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Bundle H. 
CHAIRPERSON:   PRASA bundle H and to what page must 
10 
I go? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Page 4, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 4, okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes.  I just want to set the record 
straight on something. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   We need not have a debate, if there 
is something, it will come up ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But this is what Mr Oellermann says 
20 
between August 2014 and August – October 2014 Mr 
Montana was involved in arrangements for the purpose of 
three properties for a total of more than R36million.   
Nowhere in his report, and you have made that allegation 
previously, I looked at the report over and over again, that

allegation that you purchased properties of over R36million 
within a year is not contained in his report, I’m putting that 
to you, Mr Montana. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, can we play a clip, I’ve got a clip, 
Chair, you ask a question, Mr Soni doesn’t answer – he’s 
actually dealing with it differently.  I said the Chair asked 
the question and you said, how many – you even said, is it 
R30million, 
Mr 
Soni 
said 
he 
bought 
 
properties 
for 
R36million.  Now, he’s reading a different thing, he’s not 
telling me about what I’m referring to.  I said, what Mr Soni 
10 
said, in response to you Chair, he said, actually he had 
even a smile that Mr Montana bought – and I brought the 
clip so that we can play it…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no that’s fine…[intervenes]. 
MR MONTANA:   And then we don’t have the dispute about 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think, Mr Soni hasn’t reached the point 
where he is talking about what he may have said, he’s 
simply looking at what Mr Oellermann said in his report 
because the second sentence of the first paragraph of your 
20 
document says,  
“In its so-called preliminary report on PRASA the 
Commission’s investigator, Clint Oellermann and 
evidence 
leader 
Advocate 
Vas 
Soni 
told 
the 
Chairperson of the Commission blah, blah, blah”, 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 61 of 179 
 
 
So, in other words, I think the understanding is that 
you are saying both Mr Soni and Mr Oellermann – and in 
regard to Mr Oellermann in his report, preliminary report 
this is what he said, and I think that is what Mr Soni is 
trying to clear up.  So – and he’s doing so by going to the 
report because your sentence says, “in the preliminary 
report”, you understand?  He’s still going to come to the 
question of what he may have said as opposed to Mr 
Oellermann…[intervenes]. 
MR MONTANA:   Yes Chair, but I was referring to, 
10 
specifically, what he had said to you, Mr Oellermann was in 
full agreement, he was nodding Chair, that is why I say 
that – you recall, initially I said, the Commission owes me 
an apology. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MONTANA:   It will be earlier on, so Chair, I’m 
referring to that and Mr Soni …[indistinct] the issues. I see 
the paragraph that he’s reading there but I’m saying that,  
you enquired from them, they confirmed to you they didn’t 
even give this…[indistinct] and it was even like a joke, no 
20 
he bought properties for R36million …[indistinct], so that 
was the statement, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the question, I think is, let me put it 
this way.  Is your statement in the first paragraph of the 
document that Mr Oellermann said in the preliminary 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 62 of 179 
 
report, that you purchased properties of over R36million 
within a year, correct, is your statement correct insofar as 
it refers to him and the report? 
MR MONTANA:   Yes, Chair, he’s saying in the report in 
paragraph four that we just read he says – this is different 
Chair,  
“Mr Montana was involved in arrangements for the 
purchase of three properties for a total of more than 
R36million”. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
10 
MR MONTANA:   Correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, within a year? 
MR MONTANA:   No, Chair it doesn’t say within a year. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   What I’m referring to, is what they were 
saying, they were not saying I’m involved in arrangement 
for properties of R36million, is that I bought properties for 
R36million Chair and that is factually incorrect, that’s what 
I’m challenging. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but I think, Mr Soni wants you to 
20 
make it clear whether you are sticking to the statement in 
terms of which you attribute to Mr Oellermann’s report, 
preliminary report, the statement that you purchased 
properties of over R36million within a year, whether you 
stick to that or you say…[intervenes]. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 63 of 179 
 
MR MONTANA:   No, no Chair, I stick to that, that is why 
I’m…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s different. 
MR MONTANA:   Sorry Chair, sorry for interrupting you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no so I’m saying, I think he 
wants to see whether you’re sticking to that or whether you 
accept that, that doesn’t accurately reflect what was said 
in the report and then take it from there. 
MR MONTANA:   No, no Chair, I think my statement in my 
– the one that I submitted as part of my evidence – of my 
10 
affidavit is actually a correct statement, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But remember we’re talking about -we’re 
looking  at this one that you have – that we, at least, I 
have seen that’s the one that you read into the record. 
MR MONTANA:   No, no I see it Chair but I’m saying that 
we are – we seem to be confusing issues here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  Let me clarify it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MONTANA:   I didn’t say, Mr Oellermann, in his 
20 
statement, I mentioned the report.  I’m saying Chair that, 
in 
its 
so-called 
preliminary 
report 
on 
PRASA 
the 
Commission’s 
investigator, 
Oellermann 
and 
evidence 
leader Advocate Soni has told the Chairperson okay and I 
clarified during the testimony you asked a specific question 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 64 of 179 
 
Chair, and that response is not consistent – contradicts 
number four.  You see number four says, Chair, I was 
involved 
in 
arrangements 
for 
the 
purchase 
of 
three 
properties, that I accept, it’s correct Chair.  The statement 
that was given to you Chair, was that I Tshepo Lucky 
Montana bought properties for R36million. You know, 
throughout, I’ve explained Chair, in my statement that I’ve 
worked with people, you can say you were involved in when 
that property was bought, Chair, I will admit that but if you 
say, Montana bought properties for R36million, I didn’t buy 
10 
properties for R36million…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But hang on, Mr Montana, in order for us 
to make progress, this is important.  Is my understanding 
of the second sentence of paragraph one of the document 
you’ve read into the record, incorrect?  Namely, that it says 
– it says, among other things, Mr Oellermann said in his 
preliminary report on PRASA that you purchased properties 
of over R36million within a year, is my understanding of 
that sentence correct, at least in part? 
MR MONTANA:   Are you reading mine or Oellermann’s 
20 
statement Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m reading yours, no your document. 
MR MONTANA:   My document? 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
The 
first 
paragraph, 
the 
second 
sentence. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 65 of 179 
 
MR MONTANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, my statement there is correct, I’m 
sticking to that statement yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright.  Okay, now I think 
what Mr Soni is going to say it, can you help us – show us, 
where in the preliminary report, Mr Oellermann said that, 
said what is written in that sentence? 
MR MONTANA:   No, no Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
10 
MR MONTANA:   I think, it shouldn’t be me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   The evidence leader is supposed – when 
we were discussing that, the question to – the question you 
asked was the properties I bought. You see, I’m saying 
number four is correct Chair, I mark it, I agree with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   I was involved in even more properties 
than this, I don’t have a problem with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR MONTANA:   But when you asked the question Chair, 
okay, they even said – they even moved beyond that 
statement – so this statement was changed so in writing 
they say this but to you, Chair, there was a massive 
misrepresentation.  Firstly, Montana bought properties for 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 66 of 179 
 
R36million, secondly he didn’t have the money to buy 
those properties.  This is what both of them said in 
the…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But remember, remember now I don’t 
know whether the question you say I asked, I asked while 
Mr Oellermann was giving evidence, is that correct? 
MR MONTANA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did he say the same thing as well, 
because I don’t know whether I was asking him or asking 
Mr Soni on that issue when that response was given? 
10 
MR MONTANA:   You were asking Mr Oellermann. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   Mr Soni answered on his behalf, he came 
in to clarify. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   He nodded, he agreed, Chair and that is 
why Chair…[indistinct] so we can close this thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no but that’s fine.  So, that was not 
in his written report, that was in his oral evidence? 
MR MONTANA:   Yes, no, Chair, during that – I think it was 
20 
– you asked in the course of him presenting his report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   That’s what I’m referring to Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   Yes. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 67 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   In other words, you accept, do you not, 
that if one goes to his written report, one will not find that 
sentence to that effect? 
MR MONTANA:   No, Chair, I agree except that we know 
that we’ll take this and we’ll also take the transcript isn’t 
it? 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no the transcript is a different 
matter.  If you say, look I’m not saying he said that in the 
report – in the written report but he said in his oral 
evidence and that will be in the transcript, that can be 
10 
checked if necessary. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, I’m happy with number four. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   Because it’s saying Montana was involved 
with people, that’s fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   But that is different from saying Montana 
bought properties for this amount of money, that I reject 
Chair, and that is why I wanted to read my statement in the 
beginning so that you can see that this is not one and the 
20 
same thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think, where we are, and I’m saying 
this so that you can tell me if I’ve misunderstood you, I 
think where we are with regard to Mr Soni’s question, is 
this.  One, you accept that in the preliminary – written 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 68 of 179 
 
preliminary report Mr Oellermann did not say that you 
purchased properties of over R36million within a year but 
you are saying that, in his oral evidence, he did say that, 
is my understanding correct? 
MR MONTANA:   No, no Chair.  I think number four, I’m 
happy that’s what he’s saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   When we go – it’s just that I didn’t mark it 
Chair, as we have the discussion during the course – I’ll 
draw it to your attention. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   Where he actually even move away from 
four and I think that could be…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
It 
says 
what 
you 
are 
saying 
here…[intervenes]. 
MR MONTANA:   It’s saying what I am saying Chair, and 
when you asked Chair, because you wanted clarity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   They then, both of them confirmed Chair, 
and that is why I’m saying, probably Mr Soni will look at 
20 
the clip at that time, the team can help him get that clip 
and ask your question, you’ll see Chair, they are saying, I 
bought properties and I take an exception to that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, that’s fine but as you answer the 
questions just bear in mind, or try to make a distinction 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 69 of 179 
 
whether it’s something that was in a written documents, 
such as the report or it’s something that was said during 
oral evidence because I think part of Mr Soni’s question 
was to say, here you talk about the written report.  Okay 
but you have said there is somewhere in the written report, 
where he says what you say? 
MR MONTANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay, Mr Soni? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Okay, Mr Montana, you’re going to 
come back some time.  I’m going to challenge you now, 
10 
and I’m challenging you publicly and officially, I want you 
to show the Chairperson, on a different occasion, when you 
come back where that is contained in his report. 
MR MONTANA:   I’ll do that Chair, I’m more than happy to 
do that, I’m glad that we are going to be robust today and 
deal with these issues, Chair, I’m happy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   No, Mr Montana I want to also say 
this to you, the purpose of asking you questions about 
these matters is to give you an opportunity to respond to 
20 
allegations that are contained in documents and so on.  
Now, you either meet those allegations head-on or you 
avoid them.  If you refuse to meet them head-on, at the 
end I will argue to the Chairperson that those allegations 
stand unanswered because you have not met them head-
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 70 of 179 
 
on.  I’m only making you aware of the approach I am going 
to adopt…[intervenes]. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, can I object to that very strongly? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let him finish first, finish, are you done 
Mr Soni? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, can I object to that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MONTANA:   You know,  Mr Soni has told me about the 
10 
report that he’s bringing to you, I’m not here for that, 
Chair.  Mr Soni can write whatever he wants to write and 
present to you, the Chair will apply his mind.  I – Mr Soni 
write whatever you want to write.  I’m not here to convince 
the Commission to take my version, I’m here to assist the 
Commission and present evidence.  Chair, Mr Soni was 
wrong, okay. Let me talk about your role, Mr Soni, is to 
assist the Commission to reach the truth, to find the truth. 
It’s not to pursue or to push a particular view.  Chair, in 
that particular instance – and that is why I’ve kept over 20, 
20 
over 20, Chair, of the clips where Mr Soni was talking to Mr 
Oellermann, here when he was leading him in the evidence 
and Mr Soni forgets, he’s still has to lead my evidence 
here, okay, it’s going to be very interesting.  Chair you 
must also see those clips and say, let’s go back, Mr Soni 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 71 of 179 
 
was not facilitating for Mr Oellermann to tell his story he 
was making assertions, his own assertions okay, there are 
so many.  So, Chair, you have invited me here, and let me 
put it very clear because I’m not one person who comes 
and want to please the Chair so that a favourable – I’m not 
asking you for a favourable report.  I’ve just read my 
statement and my statement proves beyond any reasonable 
doubt, okay Chair, he’s going to ask me, that the story 
presented to this Commission, that I bought properties I 
didn’t have money, some people – it’s all false, it’s not 
10 
backed up by evidence.  I’ve given – and I hope he’s going 
to ask me Chair, about the breakdown that I’ve given to 
him about – because you see, he wanted to deal with four 
properties, yet he knows the other properties I’ve sold 
were actually the basis of my involvement or possible 
partnerships in these other four properties.  He wants to 
restrict you there, that is why I insisted on coming so that, 
Chair, you understand the context.  So, Mr Soni cannot 
threaten me Chair, I can never be threatened, I’m one 
person who can never be threatened.  So, Mr Soni can 
20 
write, I mean even where I proved, previously in my other 
testimony where he said things – you can see on the 
evidence of Martha Ngoye and the thing, he said, I’m going 
to write.  Mr Soni let me face you and not face the 
Chair…[intervenes]. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 72 of 179 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   You must face the Chair, please. 
MR MONTANA:   No, but I want to say it to him in his face, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, face me. 
MR MONTANA:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But let me – I want to say something 
ja…[intervenes]. 
MR MONTANA:   My last sentence, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, you know, when I wrote to you in 
10 
2019, July 2016, I said in my letter I want to – before it 
became fashionable I want to assist the Commission’s work 
and I want to demonstrate that those that make allegations 
of corruption against some of us are, in fact, the most 
corrupt and they are involved in wrongdoing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MONTANA:   I believe this Commission is very 
important for the future of our country.  So, if Mr Soni, as 
he has shown, demonstrated throughout that he serves a 
particular view, a particular narrative and he threatens he’s 
20 
going to – let him write Chair, because ultimately these 
things will be tested in Court, will be contested, I’m not 
here, Chair, to guy the Chair ’s face, I’m here to assist the 
– that is why I’ve been fighting to come here.  So, for me 
to be told that I’m going to write this thing, so he’s going to 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 73 of 179 
 
– Chair, why don’t we stop this session because what he’s 
saying, is that despite the fact that I told him that I put 
R2million there, R2million there, I got this facility from the 
bank, he’s saying I’m still going to write so that I can – so 
we’re going to fight today Chair, I’m ready for this fight, I’m 
ready for this fight, but I’m still going to assist you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No let me explain why he was saying 
what 
he 
was 
saying, 
Mr 
Montana. 
 
You 
know 
the 
Commission, you know, certain things in a Commission 
happen in the same way they happen in a Court of Law, 
10 
whether it’s a criminal case or civil case but of course 
there are certain differences but also we – I’m a Judge, 
he’s a lawyer, most of the time we spend our lives in 
Courts and we – that’s where we spend most of our 
working lives.  Now, one of the – one of the rules of 
fairness that I think I would rather call it that, rules of 
fairness in a Court of Law is that if you are questioning a 
witness, and you, later on, argue in a certain way, if you 
didn’t do certain things and you didn’t  explain certain 
things to the witness you might be held to have been unfair 
20 
to the witness.  So, to avoid being said to be unfair you 
want to explain those things.  So, I think what Mr Soni is 
doing, he is saying, I will be asking you questions, I advise 
you to deal with them head-on but if you don’t deal head-
on with certain allegations I may have to argue later on to 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 74 of 179 
 
the 
Chairperson 
that, 
you 
were 
avoiding 
them, 
or 
something like that but what he’s doing is, he wants to 
make sure that if you decide not to deal head-on with 
certain allegations you must know that there might be this 
risk so that it can’t be a situation where he’s seen maybe, 
to take advantage of the fact that you might not have 
known that, you might have explained things in a certain 
way and this is particularly more important when you are 
not legally represented because sometimes when you are 
legally represented one can assume that your lawyer would 
10 
have explained certain things and so on.  So, that’s the 
context, so robustness is not a problem and so on but I 
think that’s the context in which he was asking. 
MR MONTANA:   No, Chair, I accept that, Chair I made a 
commitment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MR MONTANA:   You see, I didn’t …[indistinct] Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   Because I’m not that kind of a person. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MR MONTANA:   I’m here, Mr Soni can tear me apart and 
he must accept my response. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   But, Chair, I make it very clear, I can’t be 
threatened. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 75 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no I don’t think he’s threatening 
you, I think that’s just what he – that’s the context of what 
he was saying.  I see we are at five to. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Five to, Chairperson before we 
adjourn.  You perhaps, put it a bit more eloquently as to 
what my duty is to Mr Montana.  It was never meant as a 
threat, you would not allow me to threaten a witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And I would not threaten a witness 
but at the end of the day, Chairperson, we have a limited 
10 
time available. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And if, for example – and I mean 
that’s all I was trying to do, is to say to Mr Montana I’m 
going to refer you to certain documents and you must 
explain what those documents mean to you and I will tell 
you what I believe they mean and that’s the whole purpose 
of this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And to the extent, Mr Montana thinks 
20 
I’ve already made up my mind.  I would not ask Mr Montana 
questions if I’d already made up my mind because the idea 
is to get his version, so that you can look at it.  It’s not me 
who’s going to look at it, it’s you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, maybe also to just mention to add 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 76 of 179 
 
this, Mr Montana, you see the best way to prejudice you, if 
an evidence leader wanted to prejudice you would be, not 
to explain what Mr Soni has explained to you and ask 
questions and then you don’t deal with allegations head-
on, he moves on next question, next question, next 
question then we are done then you go then when he 
presents argument he says, you see, he was not answering 
questions he was avoiding.  I asked him questions he was 
telling me other stories and so on but when he explains it 
like this, you are able to say, okay, I’m going to be alive to 
10 
whatever allegation and I’m going to make sure that I don’t 
have the situation where, I leave it without answering it 
head-on.  So, I think, let’s adjourn on that basis and then 
let’s take lunch and then we’ll come back at 2 o’clock. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, I accept your guidance on this 
issue, my point has been made, I’ll come back after lunch 
to come and answer this question Chair, thank you very 
much. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that’s fine, we adjourn. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As you please. 
20 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV SONI SC:  As please Chairperson.  Chairperson I have 
explained to Mr Montana what I am going to do now is in 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 77 of 179 
 
respect of each of the properties forget the report because I 
understand Mr Montana’s concerns about the report we just 
want to look at the supporting documents in respect of these 
properties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no that is fine.  In the meantime, did 
you get those annexures that we talked about Mr Montana? 
MR MONTANA:  Chair I have then bu… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you get them during lunch? 
MR MONTANA:  Chair I have received everything but I have 
since been told that I submit them after this when I meet with 
10 
the – with Ms Rangata. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the position Mr Soni do you know 
what is happening in regard to this particular document as 
opposed to in regard to the affidavit?   Because I thought 
that the ones that are mentioned in the document that he 
read into the record we could get those admitted together 
with – admitted so that we are done with that part. 
ADV SONI SC:  Done with that yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and then – the rest they can deal with 
in terms of the process. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  I was not aware that there was that 
distinction Chairperson so it is not something I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well during the lunch – before lunch you 
remember – before he read into the record. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 78 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I – I raised the issue.  I said something 
along the lines that hopefully there are no annexures 
relevant to – to this. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think Mr Montana – I got the impression 
he was nodding at the time but after I read it I saw that there 
were references to annexures. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So before – when we came back from the 
adjournment I said I noticed that there are two references or 
10 
so to annexures and I think he said during lunch he could 
bring them – or after lunch or something. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what I had in mind is that those that are 
referred to here. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.

others that relate to the rest of the affidavit can be dealt with 
in terms of the process that has previously agreed. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what – that was my – what my 
understanding was. 
ADV SONI SC:  I – I accept that Chairperson it is not

Page 79 of 179 
 
ADV SONI SC:  Sought out independently. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Simply because we are already 
admitted this. 
ADV SONI SC:  No sure.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Therefore whatever is referred to here we 
should try and admit if we can. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And so that this is complete. 
ADV SONI SC:  Chairperson may I – may I suggest a way 
forward and that is we… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or we can deal with it during tea break. 
ADV SONI SC:  We could deal with this and then as soon 
as… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  The questioning is finished on this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They are done. 
ADV SONI SC:  Mr Montana can hand those to Ms 00:03:28. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it is not a question of him handing 
them to her – those that – the annexures that relate to the 
document – this document he can hand them to you.  I want 
20 
them to be handed up.  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So there – those should not be 
subject to that process that has been agreed on. 
ADV SONI SC:  To that process yes.

Page 80 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – but what we can do is let us continue.  
Either when you are done or during the tea break. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then it can be attended to. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV SONI SC:  Mr Montana we would be able to get – they 
are at the end of your affidavit so we will be able to take 
10 
them out as a pile – those annexures. 
MR MONTANA:  No, no Chair I have got everything – they 
are here.  I just asked the team at lunch time in line with 
your instruction but they said no, no it is fine we will deal 
with it later.  So I just put them back safely in the car Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
MR MONTANA:  But I will give them to the team then. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It can be sorted out ja. 
MR MONTANA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.   
20 
ADV SONI SC:  Now Mr Montana in regard to the Parkwood 
property you will see that there are certain annexures 
referred to OR – Annexure OR1 to Mr Oellermann’s affidavit.  
I just want to refer to the annexures. 
 
Annexure PP1 is a series of emails and I just want to 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 81 of 179

and 45.  You will see at the bottom of page 44 there is an 
email from you dated the 21s t of August 2012, do you see 
that – right at the bottom at page 44? 
MR MONTANA:  I am on page 45 sorry Chair.  Okay.

understand was your personal banker, is that correct?  Sorry 
Mr Montana if you could… 
MR MONTANA:  That is correct ja.  Sorry, sorry. 
ADV SONI SC:  And then you will see at page 45 in the 
second paragraph you say to her: 
“Would you be so kind and also send me 
latest updates or rather balances on each of 
20 
the 
properties. 
 
This 
is 
important 
in 
determining the properties to be disposed of 
under current economic concerns.” 
And then you will see her reply in… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on Mr Soni. It will be convenient as 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 82 of 179 
 
we deal with each affi – email just to state who it is from, 
who it is to – what date it is.

transcripts.

ADV SONI SC:  Then Mr Montana can I ask you to turn to 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 83 of 179

CHAIRPERSON:  At this stage Mr Soni we are not dealing

CHAIRPERSON:  Held. 
ADV SONI SC:  Held 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. Ja you can continue. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  And this is in answer to your email Mr 
Montana and about in the middle of the page next to the 
number 
3 
it 
is 
dealing 
with 
ERF 
359 
Parkwood 
Johannesburg.  Do you accept that? 
MR MONTANA:  I accept that Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  And she gives the address as 10 Newport 
20 
Road, that was the address of the Parkwood property, is that 
correct? 
MR MONTANA:  That is correct. 
ADV SONI SC:  And then she says: 
“The valuation amount is R3.5 million.” 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 85 of 179 
 
MR MONTANA:  Is that on page 42? 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  It is just under the physical address 
you will see valuation amount R3.5 million. 
MR MONTANA:  That is correct. 
ADV SONI SC:  Right.  And then of course this reflects as 
per your request she reflects the amount of the bond – I 
think it is between – oh sorry for R2 million.  Saying – just 
under valuation amount. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am struggling to – to see where you are 
Mr Soni.  Are you still at page 42? 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  No 43 Chairperson.  This is the – the 
substance of the email from Ms Willis to Mr Montana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  Right at the top she says: 
“Hi Lucky.  Here is the information you 
requested.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I can see that. 
ADV SONI SC:  And then she deals with the information in 
regard to one of the properties in Waterkloof or two of the 
properties in Waterkloof and then number 3 she deals with 
20 
ERF359 Parkwood. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay you see I was looking a sentence 
that says something like here is or something like that. 
ADV SONI SC:  Oh.  Sorry 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that was. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 86 of 179 
 
ADV SONI SC:  That is right at the top. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Valuation amount R3.5 million.  
Right. 
ADV SONI SC:  That is so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Bond amount is it R2 million, is that right?  
The bond was R2 million. 
ADV SONI SC:  R2 million yes.  That is correct Mr Montana? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that correct? 
MR MONTANA:  No I am happy – I am happy with this Mr 
Soni. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  Alright then I just want to ask you then to 
look at PP2 which is page 40 – starts at page 46 – this is the 
offer by Precise Trade – well perhaps I should just describe 
what the document is.   
 
It – the title of the document is Offer to Purchase Full 
Title, is that correct at page 46? 
MR MONTANA:   I see that Chair ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  And it is a document which is a – an offer by 
20 
Precise Trade to purchase from you the property which is 10 
Newport Road, Parkwood.  And that you will find at page – 
oh sorry 1. – paragraph 1.2.  Is that correct? 
MR MONTANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  Right.  And then it is the Terms of the 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 87 of 179 
 
Agreement are the purchase price is R6.8 million. That is 
what you said already.  And the payment was going to be 
way of a deposit of R2.5million to be paid within 30 days – 
that is at paragraph 2.2 and at 2.3 the balance of the 
purchase price to be paid to Loubser Van der Walt 
Incorporated 
Trust 
Account 
within 
90 
days 
after 
the 
signature.  Is that correct? 
MR MONTANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  Okay.  And they say at paragraph 2.4: 
“Loubser Van Der Walt Incorporated will 
10 
issue acceptable guarantees against this 
purchase price.” 
Is that correct? 
MR MONTANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now Loubser Van Der Walt is obviously Mr 
Van Der Walt’s legal firm – I mean he was a partner in that 
legal firm. 
MR MONTANA:  He was a partner indeed.  He was a partner. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  Well now can I just ask you quickly I 
want to come back to PP2 but I just want to get this over 
20 
with.  If you look at PP3 which is at page 53 – it starts at 
page 53.  This is the Deed Of Transfer in respect to that 
property, is that correct?  Page 53 Mr Montana and you will 
see right in the middle of that page it is a Deed of Transfer. 
MR MONTANA:  Ja. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 88 of 179 
 
ADV SONI SC:  Alright and you will see at page 56 the 
property was transferred on the 20t h of February 20015. 
MR MONTANA:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  Is that correct?  Now Mr Van Der Walt has 
given an explanation of the payments made in regard to this 
property.  It is contained in Mr Loubser’s affidavit.  Can I ask 
you then to please turn to Bundle G – Annexure SS16 which 
is Mr Loubser’s affidavit.  And can I ask you to please look at 
page 198.  This is the black numbers now – page 198.   
MR MONTANA:  198. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  198. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think the 198 on my one is written by 
hand. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it? 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja so look for one that is written by hand 
Mr Montana.   
ADV SONI SC:  Have you got it there? 
MR MONTANA:  Ja is this the one with the amounts in 
20 
Afrikaans? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  It is dated the 28t h of January 2016. 
MR MONTANA:  I have got it Chair ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  I will just tell you what this is.  This is the 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 89 of 179 
 
evidence given by Mr Loubser.  He says after the – after 
articles were written about the property deals they asked Mr 
Van Der Walt certain questions about the deals and he wrote 
to them.  This is a second letter he wrote to them on the 28t h 
of January explaining all the transfers – or all the payments 
that were made in respect of the different properties.  We 
are only dealing with four of them.   
 
Now at paragraph 2.2 of page 198 of the letter of the 
28t h of January he says in his letter that the purchase price 
of R6.8 million this is in respect of Parkwood property was 
10 
paid as follows and he sets out the date of payment and the 
amount on each of – the amounts paid on each of those 
dates.   
 
Now can I ask – well can I also ask… 
MR MONTANA:  What page is that? 
ADV SONI SC:  Sorry it still page 198. 
MR MONTANA:  We still on page 198. 
ADV SONI SC:  Paragraph 2.2.  He says: 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second.  Mr Montana how is your 
Afrikaans? 
20 
MR MONTANA:  Not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is good enough for this. 
MR MONTANA:  Ek praat net kombuis Afrikaans DCJ so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MONTANA:  So –  particularly I see here – I think it 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 90 of 179 
 
would be – but I trust the commission’s – I have read this 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  But not this particular letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR MONTANA:  So I do not know – I do not know but it is 
fine Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I think – I think Mr Soni will tell you 
what it – what it says but I think what the legal team should 
obtain is an English translation. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  We will Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the letter ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV SONI SC:  So it says at paragraph 2.2 the purchase 
price of R6.8 million was paid as follows:  And then he 
isolates – I mean then he itemises each payment.  Now I 
want you Mr Montana if you could please assist as well – if 
you could keep your hand on that page and also turn to page 
190 earlier page 190 and that is – I have got to tell you 
20 
again that is the evidence given by Mr Loubser that this is 
one of the documents that Mr Van Der Walt handed to him at 
the time he wrote the letter and this – the document at page 
190 Mr Van Der Walt said was the bank account – the 
transaction history of the bank account relating to Precise 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 91 of 179 
 
Trade’s Property deals.  You understand that that is what it 
is. 
MR MONTANA:  Well I hear Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  Well that is the evidence I – you know 
it is not. 
MR MONTANA:  I accept that ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now I – why I want you to look at this is I 
want us to compare what is said by Mr – in that letter with 
entries in the bank account.   
 
So if you look at 2.2.1 he says: 
10 
“On the 18 t h of June 2014 an amount of 
R2 258 000.00 was paid.” 
MR MONTANA:  Where – are you still on 19? 
ADV SONI SC:  Oh sorry on 198. 
MR MONTANA:  On 198 ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  Alright so we can just concentrate on that.  
Now if we look at an entry in the bank account which is at 
page 1… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on I was also still trying to go back 
to 198.  Which item? 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  2.2.1 Chairperson.  The 18 t h of June. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV SONI SC:  2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  And the amount reflected as being paid is 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 92 of 179 
 
R2 250 000.00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  Alright.  Now Mr Montana can – and 
Chairperson can I ask now we turn to page 190 and you will 
see the third entry on the bank account is for the 18 t h of 
June 2014 and it is reflected as a withdrawal from Precise or 
by Precise Riaan Loan.  You see that Mr Montana? The third 
entry on page 190 Chairperson. 
MR MONTANA:  I am on 190 Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.   
10 
MR MONTANA:  Ja, okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  You see it says withdrawal value date 18t h 
June and Precise / Riaan loan.  That is the description given 
to that entry.  Do you see that? 
MR MONTANA:  Yes I see that. 
ADV SONI SC:  Right.  And the amount there is R1 250 
million?  Mr Montana. At page 190.   
MR MONTANA:  Chair I see – I see the – I think that the 
above 4 I see R350 400 linked to Montana.  Oh I see at the 
bottom R2 250 I see that Chair 18t h June. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  We are going to deal with each of them 
Mr Montana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 93 of 179 
 
ADV SONI SC:  Alright and according to Mr Loubser the 
word guarantee was written by Mr Van Der Walt at the time 
the document was given to Mr Loubser. 
MR MONTANA:  But this – so this is a guarantee given to the 
bank – to ABSA. 
ADV SONI SC:  No, no, no this is a Debit in the account.  I 
am just trying to draw a link between what he says at page 
198. 
MR MONTANA:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  And what is reflected in the bank account. 
10 
MR MONTANA:  In the statement ja okay sure. 
ADV SONI SC:  Okay. 
MR MONTANA:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  So I am just saying he says that amount was 
paid on the 18t h of June and when you look at the account 
you will see that that account – that amount was debited to 
the Precise Trade account on that day. 
MR MONTANA:   Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  Okay.  Now I just want to alert you to two – 
the two earlier entries of the 18t h of June.  There is a deposit 
20 
– the first entry is a deposit of R1 850 million.  Do you see 
that? 
MR MONTANA:  I see that. 
ADV SONI SC:  And then there is another deposit of R4 
million.  And in his handwriting Mr Van Der Walt writes TMM 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 94 of 179 
 
loan. 
MR MONTANA:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  Then if you look at – go back to page 198. 
MR MONTANA:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  You will see 2.2.2 on the 18 t h of July 2014 
he says a payment of R110 800.00 was made to you.  You 
see that? 
MR MONTANA:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  And then you will see that when you look at 
page 190 on the 18t h of July there is a withdrawal of 
10 
R110 800.00 and it is marked Montana payment. 
MR MONTANA:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  Okay.  Now I suppose I should ask you with 
regard to each one.  The R2.25 million is that a payment that 
was made to you on the day reflected? 
MR MONTANA:  No, no Chair.  I suspect Chair I do not know 
– it was not made to me but when I see that I think it is 
linked to him settling the bond with ABSA for that amount. 
Because that was the – that was the bond amount that I had 
so when has bought the property the first payment must go 
20 
to – it must go to the bank.  So I think that is what it reflects 
Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  No now I understand – I understand 
perfectly.  Alright so the first payment was – was – you 
accept the first payment would have been made in respect of 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 95 of 179 
 
the property but it was not made to you and when you put 
the full picture or taking the full picture into account you 
think it was a payment made to the bank? 
MR MONTANA:  Chair I think – look Chair I – I think this is 
consistent with my statement that I have made but I would 
not know what is the – because when I saw the affidavit and 
made contact with Riaan to say what was this and he says 
no but these were my statements when I was using the 
money around. But that is he – he is the one who must come 
and account to – about how he used the money at Precise 
10 
Trade.  But when I look at the amount of R2 250 I think let us 
go back to the email – the email from Ursula Willis I do not 
know how much did they say they recall but… 
ADV SONI SC:  Do you recall it was R2 million. 
MR MONTANA:  Ja I am sure. 
ADV SONI SC:  But I mean that was the year earlier so it 
(talking over one another0. 
MR MONTANA:  That was the year earlier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV SONI SC:  But Mr Montana all I want us to agree on is 
20 
that Mr Van Der Walt says that the payment was made – that 
payment was made in respect of the Parkwood property.  I 
accept that you say it was not made to you so we must 
accept that it would have been made to the bank. 
MR MONTANA:  It should have been made to the bank.  
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 96 of 179 
 
Chair the risk of course of doing that I think Mr Soni should – 
let us continue taking me through 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  But I am being asked about the financial 
statements of another company not about mine.  I think it 
would have been good if we had my own bank statements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  Because I think if you look at the R6.8 the 
bulk of the money did not even come to my account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR MONTANA:  As I explained earlier I said pay there – pay 
there -  pay there.  But you would record it as a thing.  How 
you got the money – who shift monies around.  I would not 
have the details Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
MR MONTANA:  So I think that the – so I think let us go 
through them as you say. 
ADV SONI SC:  No sure. 
MR MONTANA:  But I . 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where you are able to say something you 
20 
will say where you are not able to say you are not able. 
MR MONTANA:  Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  And – and if you dispute any particular 
payment place that on record. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 97 of 179 
 
MR MONTANA:  No, no on this one Chair I cannot because it 
is not my statement.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  I do not know them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  I am seeing them as they are tabled here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.   
ADV SONI SC:  Alright.  Then on the 2.2.3 he says same on 
the 18t h July 2014 a payment of R350 00.00 was made and if 
you look at page 190 a withdrawal of that amount is made 
10 
and he marks it Montana payment.   
MR MONTANA:  Ja I see that yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  You see that – yes.  Alright then at 2.2.4 on 
the 24t h of… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I guess – I am sorry Mr Soni.  
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess the point you are making or part of 
the point you are making Mr Montana is where the statement 
might be saying Montana payment do not take that as if it 
means I was paid that amount.  You would accept that might 
20 
have been paid in respect of that transaction but you are 
making the point that it did not come to you. 
MR MONTANA:  No, no Chair some of them may not have 
come to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 98 of 179 
 
MR MONTANA:  Particularly the big amounts I think that is 
when he was – he was settling the banks and all of those 
things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  So it is his – you can see that he had 
written a lot of notes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  Because he is dealing with in that statement 
he is dealing with ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
MR MONTANA:   ...or by the company.  So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine.  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   So, but I will take you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   That this accounting for the six-hundred 
and... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   ...R 46.8 million when he bought the 
properties from me.  Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Okay.  Then 2.2.4.  Sorry, have we 
20 
dealt with 2.2.3? 
MR MONTANA:   3, ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   That is the 18 t h of July, the 
R 350 000,00. 
MR MONTANA:   H’m. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 99 of 179 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then you will see on the 
24 t h of July, he says R 400 000,00 and he – there is a 
withdrawal of R 200 000,00 and it is marked TLM.  Those 
are your initials.  Is that correct? 
MR MONTANA:   So this one, it says TLM, Nola(?) 
Montana. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   [laughs] 
MR MONTANA:   So how do you know, Chair, it is 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Ja.  Well, unless there was an 
10 
indication in the evidence that TLM was understood or 
referred to – was meant to be his acquisition – his initials.  
What did the – Mr Van der Walt’s partner said about it? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Well, he – what we need to look at 
Chairperson is two things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   What – he says ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What is written in the letter. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   [Indistinct]  
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   R 400 000,00. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   On the 24 t h of July. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 100 of 179 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then on the 24 t h of July, there is 
a withdrawal of R 400 000,00. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay.  No, I think – I think, 
Mr Montana, what Mr Soni is saying is.  What - the items 
we are looking at 190, that he points out, we must read – 
we must understand them in the context of the letter. 
MR MONTANA:   The letter.  No, no Chair I accept that 
fully. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR MONTANA:   I accept that fully, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   I think the only problem ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   ...that I have and I think the numbers are 
very clear there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   I do not have a problem with... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   He was explaining to his partners. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR MONTANA:   Now, Riaan and I had a much broader 
relationship.  We are dealing with other things and you will 
see in my annexure that I attached where we ended up a 
relationship. 
 
He 
said 
to 
me: 
 You 
are 
owing 
me 
R 1.3 million.  The balance between the two of us is 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 101 of 179 
 
R 1.3 million.  And when I calculate the R 1.3 million, he 
got it from the payments that we are – which is outside of 
the thing.   
 
So I think that unless if he is here or depose of 
an affidavit to say:  I paid that amount.  I paid that.  
Because then if – and that is why I am saying the 
annexure, he says to me when we ended the relationship, 
he says the payment that I paid you to in excess of 
R 1.3 million.  So you must pay it back to me.  Of course, 
at the end, we realised that no I have also put money and 
10 
it did not...  So I am not question in the payments that 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR MONTANA:   And in some instances they are recorded 
as Montana. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   But in the – say for example, I would say 
pay someone for this work. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR MONTANA:   Or I remember when he bought the 
20 
Parkwood property, there were certain things that were not 
done and I said:  No, you can draw them from the 
R 6.8 million because then you pay from there.  You will 
record that as Montana’s fee but I did not mean – 
unfortunately, my accounts have been shut down, Chair 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 102 of 179 
 
and I do not know if we can get the records because they 
will tell you and it probably means(?) that the bulk of those 
amount really did not even...   
 
So we may have had the discussion and say put 
that money there, okay?  But we do not know.  So it – this 
– he may also have – there is another possibility or 
explanation.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MONTANA:   Would have been that after his partners 
has questioned him, he then went to the statements and 
10 
then put everything under the Parkwood property and 
explained it as such.  So that is a possibility.  But again, I 
cannot speak on his behalf.  The issue is that we had the 
relationship with Riaan van der Walt.  We were involved in 
many developments or transactions and so I think I will not 
question the – whether the numbers ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   It is not in my – so I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the number you do not question but 
the relationship between each payment and for example 
20 
the Parkwood property that that you have no problem with 
that? 
MR MONTANA:   No, no Chair, the Parkwood property 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 103 of 179 
 
MR MONTANA:   ...he paid me R 6.8 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   But that money, as I have said, it did not 
come to me ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR MONTANA:   ...in that way. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   So what happened is that, I said:  No, we 
have to settle the bank first. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
MR MONTANA:   So the bank was paid two plus.  And now 
that is why I am saying I assume ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   R 2.25 million. 
MR MONTANA:   ...two five(?) zero. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   You know, Chair, in fact – no, no.  In fact, 
I think the two point two five zero may be linked to the 
Waterkloof property after the sale. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MONTANA:   So that is why I do not see the two million 
20 
where he was settling the bank. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MONTANA:   So I think and I am not sure how many 
accounts he was using and all of those things but I assume 
that the two point two five – if you look at the price of the 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 104 of 179 
 
property in Waterkloof, the amounts correlate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MONTANA:   You remember I said earlier on paid that 
property after – from the proceeds of the sale.  And there 
are emails, Chair, by the way, that Riaan and I have been 
exchanging. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   And these emails were available.  I am 
surprised that they are not included because they have 
given 
a 
proper 
context 
of 
each 
payment 
and 
what 
10 
happened to the proceeds of R 6.8 million.  So it did not 
come to me.  He paid various entities and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   ...processes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you have got those emails or you do 
not have it anymore? 
MR MONTANA:   No, no I do not have, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MR MONTANA:   You remember those emails, I wrote them 
when I was still at PRASA. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR MONTANA:   But the investigators, Chair, they have 
got those emails.  And you know what happened? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MONTANA:   Then they went on cherry(?) picking(?). 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 105 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MONTANA:   So all my – all my emails at PRASA were 
downloaded and what has happened, Chair, is that they 
were downloaded by Werksmans.  From Werksmans, of 
course, later on they moved to the Commission through 
Mr Oellermann’s report.  But you can see, Chair, my emails 
in their entirety are not even provided – indicate here.  And 
that is why when I look at my emails with Riaan, I wrote 
them while I was still working for PRASA.   
 
And I say the relationship was not a secret, 
10 
because when I was being investigated they downloaded 
the emails but what cleverly has been done here is to 
select what portray a particular narrative and leave others 
that do not.  But I think, I agree with Mr Soni’s method 
where he says there is an – there was testimony, a partner 
came and he said here is a letter.  That also I cannot Chair 
that if I had a relationship with Precise, okay?   
 
I understand when the partners ask him about 
the activities of the firm, of the law firm but if Precise 
which they we did not have control over.  We did not even 
20 
know about it.  So maybe he was trying to give them 
assurance, I do not know, but I think some of them do not 
correlate to me Chair.  But if we ask ABSA, Chair.  I was 
banking with ABSA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 106 of 179 
 
MR MONTANA:   Surely, ABSA ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   I was told – I read the statement in the 
Sunday 
Times, 
by 
the 
way. 
 
Mr 
Soni, 
where 
the 
Commission said they are going to subpoena my bank 
statements.  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MONTANA:   And I think, Chair, we could go back to 
that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   When was that? 
10 
MR MONTANA:   It was in the Sunday Times, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   This weekend? 
MR MONTANA:   No, no not the – I think ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sometime back? 
MR MONTANA:   ...it was earlier in the year.  And I said I 
welcome the opportunity for the Commission to subpoena 
these bank statements and look at that because then we 
can do a three-way exercise.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MONTANA:   What Van der Walt says, what this letter 
20 
says and what my bank accounts are telling us Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   And I will give permission to the 
Commission to ask for those statements from ABSA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 107 of 179 
 
MR MONTANA:   They should still have my statement, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   I do not have access to them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Mr Soni. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Chairperson, let me just say.  I know 
nothing about – there are two things ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   ...and I think I need to set the record 
straight.  Mr Montana says the investigators.  I think he 
10 
must make a distinction the Commission’s investigators 
and the investigators who conducted the investigation at 
PRASA.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   This is in fairness to the Commission.  
That is the first thing, I think, when he is talking about 
investigations and investigators. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But the second thing is, Chairperson.  
We did not get anything from Werksmans.  We got - all the 
20 
information contained in here, tells you what the source is.  
The source is the Siyangena affidavit and – well, PRASA’s 
affidavit ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   PRASA. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   ...in the Siyangena matter and 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 108 of 179 
 
Siyangena’s response. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   We did not get anything from 
Werksmans.  So to the extent that Mr Montana thinks we 
may have left out things, give him the assurance that 
everything that was given to us of relevance was included 
but we did not have any dealings with Werksmans and we 
could not, for one reasons, Chairperson.  Complaints had 
been made against Werksmans. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m.  Ja, okay.   
10 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, no, I do not want to dispute what 
Mr Soni is saying.  I do not have a problem with it.  I am 
glad that you are saying there is that relationship and 
there is – note that there is a distinction. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MONTANA:   But Chair, let me tell you.  When these 
documents – when the Commission asked ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Chairperson, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   There seems to be a technical 
20 
problem and I have been asked if we can have five minutes 
for them to attend to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Mr Montana is not me.  
MR MONTANA:   Sure. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 109 of 179 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I just want everything to be recorded. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  Okay.  Let us take a five minutes 
adjournment and two, so that they can deal with the 
technical problem. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As you please. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I hope they have fixed the 
problem. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   They have, Chair. 
MR MONTANA:   Okay alright.  Let us continue. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As you please, Chair.  Sorry, 
Mr Montana.  You were saying something? 
MR MONTANA:   Yes, Chair, I was saying that Mr Soni 
made the distinction between the Commission and the 
investigators.  I accept that.  The issue that I have 
consistently raised was the fact that when the Commission 
requested information on the documents, on the case of 
Siyangena, I filed an affidavit and that affidavit was 
20 
ignored.  That is the first issue.  Okay?  The second issue 
is that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry.  Is that affidavit the one that is 
being fixed in terms of the annexures or there is another 
one? 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 110 of 179 
 
MR MONTANA:   No, no I am saying in regard to 
Siyangena.  It is not in relation to this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, at the high court? 
MR MONTANA:   At the high court. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   You remember Mr Soni was saying the 
source 
of 
the 
information 
from 
the 
Commission 
is 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes.  No, now I understand. 
MR MONTANA:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you are saying there is an affidavit 
that you had filed – you had also filed in the high court? 
MR 
MONTANA: 
 
 
I 
have 
also 
filed 
an 
affidavit 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MONTANA:   ...to get all the details that I am today 
presenting to the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   But also, there is information where – I 
think the affidavit of Siyangena, if I recall well, it even 
20 
denied this very issue and say:  No, no but not as 
Siyangena.  We were not even related to this issue that is 
there.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MONTANA:   Now Chair, if I accept that, Mr Soni, but if 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 111 of 179 
 
I do accept that, there is no reason Chair why Mr 
Oellermann - the very people who are accused in this thing 
they are actually not even interviewed.  He says he has 
seen the properties from outside, took picture during his 
testimony here but the first person that it is alleged the 
properties were bought from Mr Montana.  Surely, Chair, 
there is just no reason.  So I do not want to fight over it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   But I want to place it on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
MR MONTANA:   That is one of the reasons Chair why I 
will not accept Mr Oellermann’s thing.  Now we are dealing 
with the statements and we are dealing with the other 
annexures and some of them I have got problems but I 
think in the course of the issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   Yes, I am not putting them as one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   But if someone does not interview me and 
take allegations from the very same people, as I see it, 
20 
and put them as part of the report(?) of the Commission, 
that is not acceptable Chair and so that is the issue that 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That is an issue for you. 
MR MONTANA:   ...but I accept the ...[intervenes]  
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 112 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   ...do not treat us one as – like 
Werksmans ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   ...and other things.  I respect that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no it is fine.  The one thing, though, 
that I want to mention is that you said that Werksmans, I 
think you said, has got all your emails including emails that 
you would have exchanged with Mr Van der Walt. 
MR MONTANA:   Indeed, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say some of those would show 
or support what you say about these properties, your 
dealings with him. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, my dealings with Mr Van der Walt 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MR MONTANA:   ...is a very open thing.  The issue before 
the Commission is a different matter, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   Is because I have never – in my 
20 
statement of 8 February 2016, I was responding to Mr Popo 
Molefe’s – it is the second annexure in the document that 
we have dealt with.  I dealt with that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ja. 
MR MONTANA:   And we spoke about the nature of the 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 113 of 179 
 
relationship. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   The issue before this Commission is the 
fact that this report, what it does, it tries to say – and that 
is why I say we are guilty by association.  Montana worked 
with Van der Walt – with Van der Walt.  Van der Walt is 
paid by Siyangena.  That is the issue here, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   And I am saying – and they say, 
therefore, as a result of that because Van der Walt has got 
10 
a relationship with this.  He has paid for Montana’s 
properties. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   That is why I then reading my statement 
early the – to say no, no, no.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   I have a relationship with this man.  I 
have sold properties,  I am in partnership with him, and let 
us look at all of them.  So one of the first transactions we 
did was when he bought the property from me. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   But ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no let that is fine because you have 
made your point. 
MR MONTANA:   Okay.  Thank you, Chair. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 114 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think that, Mr Soni, to the extent that 
Mr Montana is saying there are emails at Werksmans or 
there should be emails at Werksmans that will show that 
his relationship with Mr Van der Walt was an open one.  I 
think, one way or another, it would be good if those can be 
obtained.  Now...  So I think maybe you can apply your 
mind to that because I do think that one of the issues that 
arises is whether it was known at PRASA.  That kind of 
thing.  What are your thoughts on that? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Chairperson, we can ask.  I – 
10 
perhaps I should clear something up with ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Mr Montana, can I ask you?  When 
your relationship with Mr Van der Walt start? 
MR MONTANA:   Shu, Chair.  I suspect it was in 2012 and 
if I remember well, it was at the – I was in...  It was a big 
event.  I think it was at the Portuguese Club in Pretoria.  
That I think should have been 2012, Chair.  Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Mr Montana, it has been raised and I 
now need to raise it with you directly.  I said to you among 
20 
the documents that we relied on were documents filed in 
the Siyangena application.  Now in the – in Siyangena’s 
answering affidavit to the matters raised by mister – by 
PRASA. 
MR MONTANA:   PRASA. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 115 of 179 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   One of the issues they raised was 
your property – your relationship with Mr Van der Walt.  Is 
that correct? 
MR MONTANA:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now in response to that, the person 
who 
filed 
the 
affidavit 
for 
Siyangena 
is 
their 
CFO, 
Mr Dubek.  Do you know him? 
MR MONTANA:   The CFO of ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Of ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   Ja, Thomas Dubek, ja.   
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   That is correct, ja.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now he filed an affidavit and I just 
want to read something to you and tell me whether you 
agree with it or not because it may just clear everything up 
on this issue and I am not dealing with the other issues. 
MR MONTANA:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   He says at paragraph 176 of the 
answering affidavit: 
“During 
Siyangena’s 
involvement 
with 
the 
20 
ISAMS Phase 1, Montana and Ferreira... [It is 
obviously Mario Ferreira] ...had a discussion in 
regard to Ferreira’s other business interest 
which inter alia related to investments in 
immovable property and construction. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 116 of 179 
 
In response, Montana noted similarly that he 
was also involved in such industries. 
Montana enquired as to whom Ferreira used to 
assist him in this regard as he was always on 
the look out to improve his team and in 
particular was looking for a good lawyer. 
Ferreira then referred Montana to Van der 
Walt, who was at the time the attorney that 
attended 
to 
transfers 
of 
the 
immovable 
property and possessions within Ferreira’s 
10 
other interest and who, from time to time, 
recommended and was a partner in some 
ventures which came across his table on his 
day to day activities...” 
 
At paragraph 178, Mr Dubek says: 
“Neither Ferreira, Siyangena or any other 
entity associated with either of them had 
knowledge of subsequent dealings between 
Mr Montana 
and 
Mr 
Van 
der 
Walt 
until 
November 2015, when during a conversation 
20 
with Van der Walt, Ferreira became aware of 
these dealings. 
Ferreira’s request to Van der Walt was to 
ensure that any and all dealings with Montana 
by Van der Walt were completely above board 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 117 of 179 
 
and completely transparent. 
Mr Van der Walt heeding Ferreira’s request 
and 
after 
requesting 
Montana 
on 
various 
occasions to deposit money into his trust 
account to continue with their proposed joint 
venture, decided not to include Montana in the 
dealings and proceeded with the transfer of 
the subject properties on his own accord 
without Montana...” 
 
Now is that correct? 
10 
MR MONTANA:   Well, Chair, I do not know the discussion 
between the other people.  So I cannot confirm or reject 
but I am saying that the relationship I had between myself 
and Riaan was our relationship.  I think he is correct 
insofar 
he 
is 
saying 
they 
do 
not 
know 
about 
the 
relationship.  And we will see in the many emails that I am 
talking about that there was a relationship, we are writing 
– and I am was writing on my system as the PRASA CEO.  
They are publicly available Chair, and I think it should be 
drawn to confirm that.  So the other conversation I do not 
20 
know.  I do not know what was discussed between Van der 
Walt and the CFO and mister ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ferreira. 
MR MONTANA:   ...Ferreira but what I know is that Chair I 
have entered into a relationship with Riaan van der Walt.  
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 118 of 179 
 
He had his own properties.  I had my own properties.  We 
wanted to go into joint ventures on things.  And where he 
was not involved like LLM(?), he was not involved but we 
asked him to be – what is called the conveyance side, that 
his law farm becomes the conveyancers in line with the 
affidavit of Mr André Wagner.  So I think Chair, I know 
Riaan.  I am saying it is common cause here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   I know him, I have worked with him, I 
trust him, he trusted him, we were doing property deals 
10 
together.  That we must accept Chair and that I am 
confirming to this Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  And you think that started in 2012> 
MR MONTANA:   I think it did start in 2012, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But is it also correct – sorry, 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Is it also correct that it was 
Mr Ferreira who introduced you to Mr Van der Walt?  
20 
Because that is the allegation that is made by Mr Dubek. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, I do not think so.  I think that it is 
possible but I think what – I remember when I met – at the 
– this big club.  At the club they had a big event, Chair, 
and I think that a lot of people including from PRASA were 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 119 of 179 
 
invited there.  So I think that – I cannot recall specifically 
who it was but I met him at that event, if I remember well, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MONTANA:   It was on a Saturday afternoon.  It was a 
big event, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   And I was introduced to him and then 
thereafter, me and him hit it off and we went to work on 
properties. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m.  I wanted to just round off that 
issue about emails at Werksmans.  If the Commission were 
to obtain them and there are too many, you will be fine with 
having access to them and looking for those emails that 
might support what you are saying? 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, I think the Commission should have 
everything. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   The point I am making is that those 
commissions are available – these emails are available.  
20 
They were used in specific instances. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MONTANA:   But I know that they have downloaded all 
those emails.  So used others and kept others.  But I think 
in the interest of what this Commission is all about, its 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 120 of 179 
 
Terms of Reference, I think that Werksmans and PRASA 
should find it within their good hearts to hand them to the 
Commission.  And I think you will analyse them, Chair, and 
say these are the inferences we are drawing from there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   And I think they will tell a different story 
to the noise that we have been hearing in the media, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja-no, what I am thinking.  I mean, I do 
not know how many there are but you know one could find 
a mountain of emails.  I am thinking that with the time 
10 
constraint that the Commission has, you might say:  Look, I 
am quite – I will identify them easily.  Therefore, I am quite 
available.  If the Commission makes them available to me, 
I can look at them ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   No, I will assist the Commission in its 
work, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
MR MONTANA:   That is my starting point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MONTANA:   [laughs] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright.  Mr Soni, let us continue. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Mr Montana, if I could now roundup 
that issue.  You filed an affidavit in the Siyangena matter 
which was not used by the court.  We have been through 
that.  I see you shake your head.  That means yes. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 121 of 179 
 
MR MONTANA:   Oh, no I...  Thank you, Chair.  Sorry, 
Chair.  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now in that affidavit, do you deal 
with all these matters, your dealing with Mr Van der Walt, 
how 
you 
came 
to 
know 
Mr 
Van 
der 
Walt, 
your 
communications with him, and all your dealings with him 
including any written agreements you had with him? 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, everything is there.  And I think 
last week, Chair, you requested that I submit a full 
affidavit.  It is part of the annexures that I have prepared 
10 
for the Commission.  I do, yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright.  So can I make the 
suggestion then, and I make it through you Chair this.  Is 
to say, let us look at that affidavit.  That will tell us the 
ambit of the further investigation we need to... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja.  No, that is true because it will 
tell... 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In all probability what he would be 
saying here ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...is what he - has already been said in 
the affidavit. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 122 of 179 
 
MR MONTANA:   Well, Chair, I am happy that the 
Commission will do its own investigation and talk to me so 
that I do not come here and be confronted with reports that 
were written that are factually incorrect like I have been 
doing with the Oellermann’s report.  So I would be more 
than happy Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But that affidavit, as you speak, you 
have a copy in your car or here? 
10 
MR MONTANA:   Yes, Chair.  Actually, I prepared three 
files. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   They are available, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   We can... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   After the break, I can bring them here, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MR MONTANA:   And we can deal with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Let us do that, Chairperson, so that 
at least we know ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 123 of 179 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   ...we have got the annexures relating 
to the properties ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   ...that Mr Montana has referred to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And we have got that affidavit and 
then 
we 
know 
that 
almost 
everything 
in 
relation 
to 
properties ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV 
VAS 
SONI 
SC: 
 
 
...from 
Mr 
Montana’s 
side 
10 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   ...is in our possession. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And whether it is part of the overall 
affidavit ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   ...it is irrelevant.  We just look at 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That particular one, ja. 
20 
MR MONTANA:   No, that I put separate with the 
annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   I think it will be ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay no, that is fine. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 124 of 179 
 
MR MONTANA:   ...to present with them during the break, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine.  We are at quarter past 
three.  There is the question of obtaining them.  There is 
the question of reading them.  What is your suggestion, 
Mr Soni?  We ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Chairperson, can I make the 
suggestion? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   We are partly finished with the – with 
10 
Parkwood. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And can we make a decision after 
that as to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   ...when we should, unless you want 
to decide ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no.  Do you suggest we have the 
break now ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As it please ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...to obtain that and then we will 
resume?  How much break are we talking about? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Well, how long will it ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe 20-minutes, 15-minutes? 
MR MONTANA:   No, Chair, my car is parked outside.   
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 125 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   I can get it quickly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay we will adjourn and let us say 15-
minutes for now. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As you please. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And if we – if that is not enough, we will 
take it from there. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
10 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Soni? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As you please, Chairperson.  
Chairperson, in light of your suggestion, Mr Montana has 
now brought the annexures to the document that we dealt 
with this morning, that SS18B. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   There are about 15 or 20 of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but in the document are there 
references to so many?  I thought it was a few in the 
20 
document.  In the document itself, the references to 
annexures. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, they are all – but, for example, 
what we will first do is one appearing 165, it is a, b, c, d, 
e, f, g. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 126 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or maybe let me ask him.  Mr Montana, I 
thought it was only a few that we referred to in this 
document. 
MR MONTANA:   No, no, Chair, indeed, ja, that is why it is 
a small thing but there others where you may find that in 
one subject there are three letters.  For example, letters 
from Ms Ursula Willis from ABSA.  So those would be put 
let us say under 162, but you will see that – I will indicate 
that there are about three documents there.  But these are 
merely letters or documents confirming – showing a bond.  
10 
So it is not – it is a small purchase, it correlates exactly 
with the annexures in the document we admitted, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As long as when one reads this and 
wants to find the annexure that we hear one would find 
there.  That is the important thing. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   They are marked. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They are marked. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So that difficulty is out now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MR MONTANA:   They all correlate, Chair, and I think this 
20 
is based on the guidance from the team. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   I met with them, we did them in that way. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR MONTANA:    So each number in that are a copy of 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 127 of 179 
 
that affidavit, correlates to the annexure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Corresponds with that, ja. 
MR MONTANA:   Corresponds, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay.  No, that is fine, then maybe 
we should deal with that formality and get it out of the way. 
MR MONTANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of having them admitted. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that fine, Mr Soni? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As you please, Chairperson.  We will 
10 
hand this to you and then we will make copies.  We do not 
have copies obviously. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Well, I am not doing – you do 
not have copies at the moment yourselves. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  But you would need to – you may 
need to ask him questions about the annexures, is it not? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you would only know that once you 
have …[intervenes] 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Once we have looked at them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Then maybe there is no – we can 
have them handed up and then you can make copies in due 
course. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   In due course, yes. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 128 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Let me say in our part of the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, let us get the formalities out of the 
way.  I am thinking that the proper way to do it because 
this is not an affidavit. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is to admit them one by one. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As you please to, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, to say reference is made in 
paragraph so and so to annexure whatever. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then let him confirm that that is the 
annexure that is referred to and we admit them one by one 
like that. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Because the other issue, and we will 
do that in a moment but I just wanted to get through the 
formalities.  The other issue you will remember is the 
Siyangena, Mr Montana’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Affidavit, yes, ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   It is a big document with many 
20 
annexures, so it is this file. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja.  That would need – ja, it would 
need some reading. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, well why do we not get this 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 129 of 179 
 
out of the way and then talk about what should happen with 
that, ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Absolutely, yes.  Chairperson, you 
will see in SS18B that paragraph 1470 on page 312 at the 
bottom there is a reference to annexure TLM160. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I can see that. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Perhaps I should give this pile to Mr 
Montana. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To Mr Montana, yes, yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And we can hand them up one by 
10 
one, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, ja.  Oh, because there are no 
copies. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Montana, the second page of your 
document, paragraph 1470, TLM160 is supposed to be a 
copy of an email from Mr Riaan van der Walt intimating the 
relationship between the two of you.  Have you got that 
email?  Okay, is it marked TLM160? 
MR MONTANA:   That is correct, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, I think that we may have 
to admit them, Mr Soni, as EXHIBIT SS18B1, B2, B3 3.so it 
is going to be easier that way.  This email from Mr Riaan 
van der Walt to Mr Lucky Montana, dated 29 October 2015 
will be admitted and marked as EXHIBIT SS18B1.  
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 130 of 179 
 
EMAIL 
FROM 
RIAAN 
VAN 
DER 
WALT 
TO 
LUCKY 
MONTANA DATED 29 OCTOBER 2015 HANDED IN AS 
EXHIBIT SS18B1.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As you please. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is a document that has got two pages.  
Okay and then? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then, Chairperson, at the bottom of 
page 314 and paragraph 1480 there is a reference to 
TLM161. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you got that, Mr Montana? 
10 
MR MONTANA:   I have got that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, thank you.  Registrar, you might 
have to wait here and no go to your seat until we are done 
with this process. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And that will be 18B2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  The statement by Mr Montana 
dated 8 February 2016, which is marked TLM – oh you see 
there is TLM14 and TLM16 or 161, that will cause some 
confusion.  Maybe I think I should cross out the TLM14 for 
purposes of this one so that we use TLM161.  Mr Montana? 
20 
MR MONTANA:   I can hear you, I am looking at 1480. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, 1480 says TLM161. 
MR MONTANA:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have got in this document that I have 
been give, I have got TLM161, that is written in the middle 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 131 of 179 
 
of the page, first page. 
MR MONTANA:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But at the corner of the same page, top 
corner, it is written with a marker TLM14 and S16.  I am 
saying the two may cause confusion so I propose to cross 
out the one in the corner. 
MR MONTANA:   Ja, that is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so that there is no confusion but 
otherwise, therefore, this statement of 8 February 2016 by 
Mr Montana on allegations of corruption levelled against 
10 
him by PRASA Mr Popo Molefe will be admitted and marked 
as EXHIBIT SS18B2.  This statement has got – I think the 
pages are not paginated but I think I will cross our these 
numbers written with a marker so that they do not cause 
confusion on all the pages, ja. 
MR MONTANA:   I pulled them from another affidavit, 
Chair, that is why I have that problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, I understand, I understand.  I 
just want to make sure.  Okay, that is the second 
document. 
20 
STATEMENT BY LUCKY MONTANA DATED 8 FEBRUARY 
ON 
ALLEGATIONS 
OF 
CORRUPTION 
BY 
MR 
POPO 
MOLEFE HANDED IN AS EXHIBIT SS18B2 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   There is a reference TLM162.  Mr 
Montana, you are handing that up now, 162. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 132 of 179 
 
MR MONTANA:   162. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that it will be necessary just to say 
that so that it goes into the transcript.  Mr Montana, so that 
it goes into the transcript that you are now handing it up, 
so I am saying that will be important. 
MR MONTANA:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay now? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   That will be SS18B3, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The letter dated 31 August 2009 
addressed to Mr T L Montana.  I am looking for the end of 
10 
the letter, Mr Montana.  The last page here cannot be the 
last page because it ends “and”. 
MR MONTANA:   That is 162, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is TLM162, is that how it is 
supposed to be? 
MR MONTANA:   It should be, Chair, I think the big issue 
there is the – that is the ABSA Private one, Chair, 162, is it 
not?   
CHAIRPERSON:   162. 
MR MONTANA:   Ja, it should be a full document, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see, at the beginning it is like a 
letter, it is addressed to you and it says “Dear Mr Montana” 
but it looks like quite a long letter but it is just that the 
pages are not numbered at the bottom but it is not 
completed, ends with 12.2.3 at the bottom, that is a 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 133 of 179 
 
paragraph and with the number that appears at the top 
corner is 509 but I do not know where it comes from, who 
is the author. 
MR MONTANA:   No, this comes from the bank, Chair, that 
is a letter summarising the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The terms. 
MR MONTANA:   If you look in the paragraph, ja, that is a 
letter from the bank. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   And that is what I have, Chair, so I am 
10 
not sure if… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Well, I do not know it may be that 
whatever we do not have is not material, we do not know.  
But I wanted to make sure that… 
MR MONTANA:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that you understand that the pages… 
MR MONTANA:   The first four, five pages summarises the 
facility from the bank, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   And I think that is what is material for the 
20 
Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  So that letter will be 
admitted as EXHIBIT SS18B3.  Ja, I have got that. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And for the record, Mr Montana, you 
confirm that the letter on the record is incomplete, it is just 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 134 of 179 
 
for …[intervenes] 
MR MONTANA:   No, no, I confirm that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja, okay.  Maybe I can just mention 
that it is how many pages – it is 7 pages.  Okay, let us 
continue. 
LETTER FROM ABSA PRIVATE BANK DATED 31 AUGUST 
2009 (7 PAGES) ADDRESSED TO MR. T L MONTANA 
HANDED IN AS EXHIBIT SS18B3 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then on the very next paragraph 
on the same page, paragraph 1483, there is a reference to 
10 
TLM163. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   This is an email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Will you hand that in? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you got that, Mr Montana? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   That is an email calculating the 
payments to the bank, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  This is email from… 
MR MONTANA:   Ursula Willis. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ursula Willis addressed to Mr Montana

as EXHIBIT….

next page at paragraph 1486 and that is annexure TLM4, is 
a letter from ABSA and you are handing that up as TLM164, 
Mr Montana and Chairperson that should be admitted as

admitted as EXHIBIT SS18B5.

CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Are those the – all the annexures 
now? 
MR MONTANA:   No, no, Chair, I think we are continuing, 
20 
page – to continue the proper page, we are going to page 
321 of the affidavit in that document, Chair, I think we are 
actually the next page. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. 
MR MONTANA:   Ja, page 322, Chair. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391

ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   Paragraph 1518. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:   There, Mr Montana, you are handing 
up a joint venture agreement between Midtownbrace and I 
take it to yourself as TLM165 (a) to (h) 
MR MONTANA:   That is correct, Chair. I am just removing 
the divider, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
10 
MR MONTANA:   I am just removing the dividers quickly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, that is fine. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So you are handing that up as 
TLM165 (a) to (h), Mr Montana?  That is correct, is it not? 
MR MONTANA:   That is correct, yes.  Sorry, Mr Soni, that 
is correct.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Chairperson, if this page can be 
admitted as SS18B6. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, it is an agreement and I see there 
are letters but they are all – it is (a) to (h) in terms of 
20 
…[intervenes] 
MR MONTANA:   (a) to (h), Chair, they are all under that 
agreement with Midtownbrace for the Hurlingham property, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  So EXHIBIT SS18B6 will be

CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, on the properties.  Ja, okay.  No, 
that is fine.  I wonder, Mr Soni, whether in terms of the 
agreement, I see that in the document he has got (a) to

document so that – so the memorandum of agreement, I am 
revising what I said earlier on will be EXHIBIT SS18B6.1.

CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that is done.  As well as the

10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, now we need to talk about the 
affidavit. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, [indistinct – dropping voice] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Did you recall how long the 
affidavit on its on is, Mr Montana, more or less? 
MR MONTANA:   I will check it now, Chair.  Sorry, Chair, I 
cannot recall, it was a long affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   The affidavit is around 49 pages. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Does that sound right more or less, Mr 
Montana?  You cannot remember? 
MR MONTANA:   No, Chair, I think – I thought that the 
entire file was the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Excluding annexures for now. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 140 of 179 
 
MR MONTANA:   Annexures, okay.  That should be correct, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That should be correct, ja.  Okay, I 
guess you cannot deal with that without having read it first.  
Ja.  So should we not do this, that to the extent that there 
may be – I know that properties was your last topic, is that 
right? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  It seems to me that on properties 
you may have to read that first before you can proceed in 
10 
any effective way.  If that is correct it may be that one, you 
cannot deal with that today. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   [indistinct – dropping voice] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  But, two, it may be that we can do 
one of two things.  Mr Montana, during the days that you 
have been questioned, I got the impression sometimes that 
some of your answers might not have been full because 
you intended to – or you were hoping to refer to your 
affidavit, I am not sure.  What I am looking at is, we are 
tight for time in terms of finishing and I was thinking that to 
20 
the extent that there may be some issues that you have 
been asked about where you felt your answers might not 
have been full you wanted to do that, maybe we could use 
this opportunity for you to do that because – so that what 
would remain is simply the issue of properties. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 141 of 179 
 
 
And on the issue of properties, if it is possible to be 
ready 
tomorrow, 
we 
could 
proceed 
tomorrow. 
 
We 
fortunately can have time tomorrow.  In my schedule of the 
hearings I remember there was an issue of Ms Ngoye 
coming back and maybe Mr Holele.  So the idea was that if 
you were to finish your evidence today, depending what 
time you finished, then Ms Ngoye and Mr Holele could take 
the witness stand and deal with some of the issues you 
have raised, if they didn’t deal with them today they could 
deal with them tomorrow, I think they are available from 
10 
what I have been told, but so – but if you are able to deal 
with whatever you think you haven’t been heard fully 
because you – for whatever reason, you could deal with 
those and we finish that part. 
 
 
If you cannot do that now and Ms Ngoye or Mr 
Holele or one of them is available we could slot them in 
this afternoon and then tomorrow you could then deal with 
whatever is left plus the properties.   
 
So I don’t know from your side Mr Soni have you 
got an particular preference? 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Chairperson as I understand it, and it 
may have been a miscalculation on our part, we indicated 
to Ms Ngoye and Mr Holele based on what had happened 
just before lunch, that we would be busy with Mr Montana 
for the rest of today and in a sense we have released them 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 142 of 179 
 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, no. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   From their commitment today. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay no that is fine, well then if Mr 
Montana has some issues that he has been asked about or 
since 
he 
started 
appearing 
where 
he 
would 
like 
to 
supplement his answers he can do so, we can use this time 
for him to do so, but then tomorrow we continue. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then with the properties after you have 
10 
had a chance to read and depending what time we are 
finished then Mr – Ms Ngoye and Mr Holele could also 
come. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Chairperson may I ask, and I am 
asking this in -  during the part-hearing, from Mr Montana’s 
evidence today what he read out this morning it does not 
appear when one looks at the map – the documents I want 
to show him, for example when one looks at the payments 
that Mr van der Walt refers to, there doesn’t seem to be 
much dispute about that. 
20 
 
If I could just – and I am saying this for Mr 
Montana’s benefit, but also for your guidance, and asking 
for 
your 
guidance, 
if 
Mr 
Montana 
can 
look 
at 
the  
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The Transactions, the ...[intervenes]  
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 143 of 179 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   The, the, well all the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The actions. 
ADV VAS SONIC SC:   But all the annexures to Mr 
Oellermann’s affidavit, he needn’t – his report needn’t 
concern himself with the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   For example if I could just say with 
regard to the Waterkloof Property, Ms Sally de Beer has an 
affidavit which is annexed, if he can just tell us which parts 
of the affidavit he disagrees with, so it will expedite the 
10 
hearing itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, then we can focus on those issues 
that are issues. 
ADV VAS SONI:   So I don’t have to put each of the 
matters to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And for example there were an extent 
in regard to the Sandhurst property, there was an exchange 
of emails between him and the ...[indistinct] which is 
referred to, and there are agreements in regard to those 
20 
properties which concerned Mr Montana or his trust but 
which then fell by the wayside and were effectively taken 
over by Precise Trade. 
 
All that we want from Mr Montana is yes this 
happened, Precise Trade took over because of these 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 144 of 179 
 
reasons, that is if he agrees with what is contained in the 
annexure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   It would certainly save time and we 
can move on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so there are two ways of doing it 
Mr Montana, the one that Mr Soni is proposing is that if 
you already have had time to apply your mind to all of 
those you might be able to say I don’t have any issues with 
this one, that one and that one, this is where I have issues 
10 
on so then we can focus on that, that is if you have not had 
time to apply your mind to them, the other – we could have 
a situation where maybe when you come back tomorrow 
you have applied your mind and you are able to say these 
are not – there are no issues on these ones, this is where 
the issues are, as far as I am concerned. 
 
What do you think of that?  
MR MONTANA:   Chair I will take the – again Chair I 
repeat I am here to assist the Commission to gather 
information. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   And also to put my version on record, so I 
think I will be willing to take the route that Mr Soni had 
proposed and comment on both, because I have looked at 
them and ...[intervenes]  
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 145 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MR MONTANA:   I have looked at them Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh so you would be able to comment 
...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   No, I do ...[intervenes – speaking over 
one another] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I see, excellent, excellent, then in 
that event we should at least do that part. 
MR MONTANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then what will remain can then be 
10 
dealt with tomorrow, but that part can be done. 
MR MONTANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let’s do that then, that’s fine.   Mr 
Montana do you want to ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   Should I proceed Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
MR MONTANA:   Thank you Chair, the – let me start first 
with how most of these affidavits of course have come 
about and all of this Chair, you recall that some of them 
are in a way filed in the Siyangena matter.   Let me just put 
20 
on record Chair because I did approach some of the people 
and asked them on what basis did you file this affidavit, 
while I understand at the Commission, but I am referring 
before they reach here Chair; people were told and they 
were threatened Chair, I asked Mr Louis Green can you tell 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 146 of 179 
 
me about your affidavit, because I want to take you to 
Court and he said no but you signed copies of the 
interactions, of emails that were there, that is why I am 
referring to them Chair, that they should also be here but 
they 
were used there and 
people 
were told by 
Mr 
O’Sullivan at that time Chair that it is part of  Hawkes and 
if they do not file these affidavits against me they will be 
arrested Chair. 
 
And so people were threatened.   Now, and that is 
why Chair I am emphasizing that the Commission can work 
10 
on the basis of something that had been obtained legally 
but I am not afraid to get into the issues Chair, and let me 
deal 
with 
the 
three 
affidavits, 
because 
in 
essence 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   ...in essence Chair what I am saying to 
the Commission a big issue I am saying that I confirmed 
that I have had a relationship – I have had a relationship 
with Mr Riaan van der Walt, I think that the first annexure 
that you have taken, in fact he talks about the partnership 
20 
between myself and Riaan van der Walt, that is the first 
issue I am making there. 
 
The second issue Chair that – so you can see in the 
press statement that I made in 2016, I made a press 
statement to say no I am working with this man, there is no 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 147 of 179 
 
issue there, and I don’t want them to do that.   The second 
issue Chair that I have always said, I have always rejected 
of course the relationship, I think that they said there must 
be an inference, can we draw a link, okay.  I said there is 
no link, other people say there is a link and Chair I have 
seen not the Commission but some of the numbers were 
sent to me at the time when Mr O’Sullivan raised, put the – 
or rather lay a complaint at the Brooklyn Police Station. 
 
Now the numbers they deal with the numbers there, 
but I must check this thing because it doesn’t deal with me, 
10 
it deals with the relationship like Robert Neethling has 
done between their relationship on the different properties, 
and I said give me the numbers precise and Lucky Montana 
had 
a 
relationship 
with 
Precise 
Trading, 
and 
this 
relationship speaks to the development of properties, it 
has got nothing to do with anything. 
 
Chair I don’t want to take issues with the – with Ms 
de Beer, but I think she didn’t answer – she didn’t answer 
the Commission Chair.  The reason why we had the ups 
and downs about how do you buy the properties, because I 
20 
am the first one, we had agreed after – remember Chair we 
don’t make an offer for the property.  We realise that the 
property has got business rights, in fact I think that the 
agent who spoke to me, told me at length about some of 
the bookings for example, I think he mentioned one of them 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 148 of 179 
 
but sometimes we will ...[indistinct] this, because Ms de 
Beer was not living in the house, it was used as a 
guesthouse, so this was a guesthouse, it had business 
rights located and in Waterkloof Chair with embassies, you 
have business all the way.  That is our interest in that 
business. 
 
Now the first time Chair I dealt with this property 
was the fact that – was the fact that in Rose Street, she 
wanted R11million.  I made an offer of R11million Chair, or 
R11.5, there was no issue at that time, not to her, to her 
10 
agent, I didn’t know her, she didn’t know me Chair.   Some 
of 
the 
things 
that 
she 
spoke 
about 
here 
that 
the 
Commission was leading her on I mean they are so petty, 
they don’t speak to the real issue.    
 
Why didn’t I buy the property Chair, just one 
reason, the bank came back to me and said in the 
evaluation of that property the property is valued at 
R7million, remember I wanted it for business, okay, and I 
said I will use my – there is a what is it called, minor 
property trust, I said no it is fine, my participation in that 
20 
project will be through my kids, my children’s trust.   I see 
Chair that in some of these they say I paid R3million, I 
never paid any cent into the property, the bank rejected 
and she doesn’t tell it, but she said the property is very 
important, the development and the opportunities that is 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 149 of 179 
 
there huge, at the end then we said look Riaan can buy the 
property Chair and we will get that thing so it is not my 
property. 
 
She spoke here about I saw Montana in the last 
days that he come and fetch the keys, Chair all of those 
things happened, there is no issue there, the issue is that 
she says, she says and Mr Oellermann in his affidavit in 
his 
testimony 
she 
says 
I 
got 
the 
impression 
– 
an 
impression Chair, sometimes ...[indistinct] Chair and you 
get your own impression, she get that impression that it is 
10 
Montana’s property and she has got the right to say that, 
but she doesn’t know the factual basis there, there is no 
factual basis but I have seen Mr Montana, she wasn’t there 
by the way when I went with Mr Riaan van der Walt to her 
own property, because I have been there twice or thrice 
before even – just to look at, to get the details about the 
property and what opportunities, which embassies book in 
there and all of those things Chair, okay. 
 
So it was business, I was doing business Chair.  
But when the bank said to me we cannot finance it Ms de 
20 
Beer was angry okay, and that is why Riaan and I had to 
discuss even if – even if the bank doesn’t want, so for me 
of course I am using a facility, for her she is involved in 
other things, she says no it is find, I will take the property 
and I will raise the money for this particular property, so 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 150 of 179 
 
...[indistinct] Chair one of the key things that I think were 
never explored Mr Soni in great length is the partner to Mr 
van der Walt, his testimony. 
 
You see it is very important that we know what is it 
that we want to take from an affidavit, what message is 
coming out of there.   What – he was saying two things 
from what I can gather, and I listened to his testimony and 
I have read his affidavit.  Two things are very clear Chair, 
the first one is clear that they were unhappy with the fact 
that Mr van der Walt had – and he said it actually very 
10 
clearly – he had other business interests outside of the 
firm which didn’t agree with them as partners, and they 
only learnt for example when he was transferring some of 
the properties to then use the law firm, even though the 
relationship was not – so they had a problem with that and 
the problem arises from questions asked by the media, that 
is why they are asking that question. 
 
But the second issue, the second point he makes 
which is very important, when I ...[indistinct] Chair in the 
way that I like the – Andre Wagner ’s affidavit Mr Soni.   He 
20 
is basically saying that in Precise Trade Mr van der Walt, 
Mr van der Walt had other partners or investors into that 
business, okay.  The allegation Chair that say no these are 
Montana’s properties, I have confirmed in black and white, 
I played a part in us identifying those opportunity, it does 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 151 of 179 
 
not make those my properties.  The properties that are my 
properties are registered in my name. 
 
For 
example 
if 
you 
look 
at 
the 
property 
in 
Hurlingham registered in my name, the bulk of the money 
didn’t even come from me Chair, because I had to find an 
investor and that is why Mr Louis Green in his testimony 
here, he said something very important, and I think you 
and Mr Soni ...[indistinct] but he made a fundamental point 
which I want to raise and I was so happy because I think it 
was courageous Chair, you tried to probe this thing and he 
10 
made an important – it is not unusual, he made that point 
Chair, it is not unusual that Montana can arrive, identify a 
property and when we register, because it has to do with 
where the money is and how do you find the money, in Pedi 
say Chair these people who didn’t investigate because they 
were targeting me [speaking in vernacular] so they just 
Chair wanted to make sure that no he is guilty as charged 
and not looking at the details. 
 
Now Chair one of the two things the ...[indistinct] of 
State Capture you know I love them Chair these people, 
20 
they say you must follow the money.  Chair but Mr 
Oellermann said he went to the property in Sandhurst and 
it seems there are people there, after hearing that he 
called and said who lives there, and the property had been 
rented out to somebody by Mr van der Walt, okay.  The 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 152 of 179 
 
most next logical step is that this rental income where 
does it go to, because it will tell you who is the real owner 
of the property.  They don’t do that, they jump that point, 
okay, they jump that point Chair because it doesn’t assist 
what they are trying to get to, that he is guilty as charged. 
 
If you look at it Chair going back to the Rose 
Waterkloof, Waterkloof property.  Then she was angry and 
she says terminate this relationship.   Ms de Beer when I 
think there was a guy, if I remember very well, his name 
was Daniel, the agent, Daniel went back to her and said no 
10 
he went, he took my offer, not Riaan’s offer, my offer, I say 
no look let me put an offer and I go to the bank, the bank 
sent a team for valuation they say no that property, but of 
course the bank was wrong, she was right to be angry, not 
of course she shouldn’t have been angry with me, but with 
the bank because the bank they were looking at this 
building, 
but 
they 
were 
not 
looking 
at 
the 
income 
generation in that particular building so they undervalued 
the property.  She was angry because the time share that I 
first made contact with her, and we agreed with Riaan and i 
20 
said no let’s find a way, let’s get money for me to get the 
bank’s amount or rather valuation, and get an additional 
R3.5, and I said to Riaan will you then lend me the R3.5 so 
I can then say to the bank don’t give me for R11million, 
just give me for R7million in line with your valuation and 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 153 of 179 
 
then I will put the additional money in there Chair. 
 
Of course  I realised it will not work, I think the 
bank did not have an appetite for that, and then that is why 
we said look this presents a lot of opportunities, it’s in 
Waterkloof, Embassies are keen on doing that, and it has 
got business rights already, that is what it is. 
 
Now Ms de Beer as I said Chair she talks about in 
her affidavit very small things, she doesn’t know the 
relationship between Lucky Montana and Mr Riaan van der 
Walt.  She doesn’t know how these things are funded, so I 
10 
am surprised that the Commission would bring Ms de Beer 
here who actually doesn’t add value to this Commission 
and leave out Mr Andre Wagener, I know Chair you have 
explained the thing, I am not opening that, I am just simply 
saying that she doesn’t know Chair, yet she talks about 
something she doesn’t know, she doesn’t know – she 
knows nothing bout the matter, how the nature of the 
relationship with Riaan and that is why Riaan then said no 
I will deal with that and I will raise money and I will take it 
under Precise Trade so that that opportunity is not lost 
20 
Chair. 
 
That is the most important thing, that is how we are 
involved in business we do Chair, strategy, very strategic 
from where it is in Waterkloof, and Chair when the first 
people to break that house, to start the work Riaan asked 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 154 of 179 
 
me and I went to fetch people from Mamelodi and say no 
break this property.  So the things the details that are 
defined are detailed there.  They are true, but they are not 
telling the Commission the story because she doesn’t 
know, she is incapable of doing that and that is why when 
people beat up drums, they want to fetch the keys and 
everything but how is the property financed, because that 
is what it tells us.  If you say Santez, yes Chair even the 
Santez property I was playing a major role, so I don’t – 
whatever they say doesn’t tell the Commission anything, it 
10 
is a story what you must tell, tell us about the money, you 
will actually see that Montana is not involved in that, you 
can actually see from my first annexure I say Riaan is – he 
came here, and we met I say 1.3, I say no, no but if we 
calculate in fact I should be getting ...[indistinct] because 
partners do that all the time Chair. 
 
If you look at Hurlingham property they issued Chair 
– what is it called – Midtown Brace.  Riaan was not 
involved except that Chair as a lawyer we asked him to put 
a deal for us, for me and Mr Andre Wagner.   I put, I asked 
20 
him to put the money there for me, Mr Wagner brought in 
the other money, the other difference was money for 
development Chair. 
 
Now the development didn’t happen and it didn’t 
happen because then I couldn’t bring the other R9.5million 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 155 of 179 
 
for development, the R10million that I spoke about from 
FNB that I said that I went to apply and they told me they 
are politically exposed, they are not going to consider 
extending any facility to you.  It is FNB.  I thought I would 
go in because the lady who was – as I explained earlier, 
who did my properties at ABSA from Tygervalley in Cape 
Town she had moved here and she told me I said I want to 
do business with you, that is the property that I went first 
to her.   I actually asked her from the bank can you give 
me 
my 
application 
so 
that 
I 
can 
attach 
it 
here, 
10 
unfortunately they said no, we didn’t – it was declined, one 
credit didn’t accept it we are not keeping those documents 
because we are not having in that respect. 
 
They took  me to court Chair and you will see the 
letters I have attached, there has been to and fro, until 
they 
issued 
summonses 
against 
me, 
Midtown 
Brace.  
...[Indistinct] we then agreed in response to let’s sell the 
property and that you get what you get and I get something 
out of that because we both put money into this property. 
 
We then took the – and that is why Chair you will 
20 
see one of the things I touch is what you call the Power of 
Attorney, I then had to sign a Power of Attorney to Midtown 
Brace so that they run an auction, they ran an auction 
Chair and the prices were ridiculous and you will see there 
we said no let’s not even accept it, okay. 
 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 156 of 179 
 
 
Now my document Chair confirm the affidavit of Mr 
Andre Wagner, he is directly involved, he put his own 
money into this thing so he knows the story, but when you 
compare to Ms de Beer I think Chair she wanted to – I was 
irritated with her, not angry, irritated, because, and you 
could see that she wanted to talk about what car Mr 
Montana drove and everything to convey a picture of a 
corrupt man, okay, what I came out there, she is not 
focusing on the issue that I want to buy a property because 
we want to do business there Chair, so her affidavit we can 
10 
go, my view is that I am not even denying anything, there 
is nothing to define, to defer, to deny, the affidavit tells the 
Commission nothing about the nature of the deal, it says I 
saw Mr Montana, he was wearing this, this, he was driving 
this car, but Ms de Beer only saw me Chair towards the 
end, after all of those things and that she can see Chair 
with the partner to Mr Riaan van der Walt.  It is basically 
telling this Commission that in fact Precise was Riaan was 
the sole owner and director.   
 
In all these dealings it had investors, which means 
20 
people that he was borrowing money from to finance all the 
different – and that is why Chair I think from the 
information I picked up ...[indistinct] the liquidation of 
Swifambo, the liquidators of Swifambo here, let’s get the 
liquidators there and see who did they speak to as the 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 157 of 179 
 
people 
who 
lend 
money 
there, 
you 
will 
actually 
be 
surprised 
Chair, 
these 
are 
not 
the 
people 
that 
are 
mentioned in the newspapers, because people know they 
are not interested in the truth Chair, so the long and short 
of it Chair when you talk about Ms de Beer she was – I 
don’t know whether, I think at that time Chair she has been 
probably told and primed on what to say or it was just an 
absolute show of racism, I am not saying but perhaps 
Chair, fascinated by this black man who wants to buy a 
property of R11million, who is driving this kind of a car and 
10 
all of those things. 
 
Chair there is nothing, there was nothing unlawful 
or irregular and people are taking this thing too far, 
because they are trying to say Riaan – if Riaan was the 
owner or shareholder of Siyangena I would understand, he 
is there, he has got nothing to do with ...[indistinct – 
dropping voice], his mentors was now if the – the 
allegation was that no and as I think Mr Oellermann in fact 
said it during his testimony, he said Chair the owners from 
which these properties were bought had an understanding 
20 
that the properties were bought by Mr Montana, there was 
a plan to all of those things, but the fact that I ultimately 
didn’t buy the property tells you there is a story, so I was 
not using Riaan to buy properties. 
 
Then if the property is owned by Precise are my 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 158 of 179 
 
properties what is the status of the lenders to Precise or to 
Riaan, I don’t even know them Chair, I was saying – I saw 
their names for the first time when this affidavit was 
deposed there.    
 
Would they take a risk of putting money into Precise 
to somebody that they don’t know, and I think Chair that 
you can see that what Ms de Beer was saying, of course it 
is up to the Commission to evaluate evidence, but did he 
tell you about the nature of Mr Montana’s property 
dealings, no she can only describe certain parts when she 
10 
saw me and to want to present, so what does it matter that 
I am wearing a pink shirt, tell us to say no I think if you 
believe that Mr Montana is involved in corrupt activities 
and is buying properties.    
 
She doesn’t say Chair I mean from 2016 I have 
been very clear, I have worked with Riaan, he is a good 
businessman Chair.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair let me make the last one with 
regard to ...[indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR MONTANA:  Because that is also attached. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR MONTANA:   Or rather two short points Chair, because 
I want to finish with the financials here. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 159 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, because I wanted to say to you 
what you have been telling me it is fine and it is important 
in terms of it being part of your answer to the allegations, 
but I think Mr Soni had in mind that you could clear up in 
terms of saying – in terms of these bank statements and so 
on I have got no issues with everything, these are the only 
things you have issues with, so that we get that out of the 
way, but in terms of what you – finishing your part of the 
story that is fine, subject to the understanding that on 
properties we will still deal with this aspect ...[intervenes]  
10 
MR MONTANA:   No, no, no Chair I am more than happy.   
I will stay at this Commission for as long as you want me to 
answer these questions, if the Commission get other 
information and say Montana tomorrow wake up and come 
here I will be here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you will come here. 
MR MONTANA:   I will be here Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   That I give you my assurance, because I 
have got nothing to hide Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  Chair Mr ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You said you want to make two points 
...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   Two points. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 160 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   We can then have clarity on the bank 
statements. 
MR MONTANA:   Yes, no I want to make one and then deal 
with the bank statements. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.   
MR MONTANA:   Mr Louis Green, I think Chair the – Mr 
Louis Green, Mr Andre Wagner they are their statements 
and I think that they are good.  Because Mr Louis Green 
said you are asking a specific question and he said when 
you ask him why did he – when Riaan Van Der Walt wrote 
10 
an email and said do not get involved there – do not copy 
Mr Montana and Mr Van Der Walt Chair and rather Mr Louis 
Green unlike Ms De Beer she says look Mr Montana came, 
he was coming to look at the property.   
He was not looking at that 00:00:42 you get different 
property.  And he said something very important at the end 
– He was assisting the commission about what they do as 
estate agents.  The kind of transactions they get involved 
in.  And he said one important point.  I do not know the 
nature – or he said I did not know – because she asked me 
20 
why did you respond in that way; why did you accept?  And 
he says because I did not know the nature of the 
relationship between Mr Montana and Mr Van Der Walt.  
Now that is an honourable man Chair.  He does not describe 
things that he does not know.   
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 161 of 179 
 
And I think Chair that is why there has been a lot of 
speculations but there are people who have driven this – 
this what is it called – this property story.  Now people who 
are conflicted Chair.  I have described some of them in the 
morning and I think Chair if you look at my statement also 
put as part of the annexure – my statement in response. 
Because the first time I had thing by the way was when Mr 
Molefe had filed – he deposed to an affidavit Chair on the 
Siyangena matter and one of the journalists I think wrote 
about it – I think it was Pieter Louis Myburgh and I got a 
10 
call that did you see that you are involved.  
And I said I look at her and I had a press conference 
and I dealt with those issues.  I said there is no basis to all 
of these things.  And I thought by that press conference 
Chair I would have done enough to dispel the things.  It was 
well covered in the SABC but when the matter continued 
Popo Molefe, then continued making this so – so I decided 
that I want to come into the Siyangena matter because I 
was upset that my name was being mentioned but I was not 
– I was not cited as a – as a respondent.   
20 
So – so I am being brushed then and then left aside.  
So my statement dealt with it at length Chair and then my 
full record – my full thing is captured Chair in the statement 
that I have just – that we have put in that you said we will 
only admit it as soon as – once it has been read – I have 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 162 of 179 
 
accepted that.   
So let us deal with the – with the monies.  You know 
the flow of – they say follow the money but it is follow the 
money where it suits us – where it does not suit us we – we 
then abandon that.   
 
You see Chair when Riaan – when Riaan and I think 
I want to link this to the first annexure that I submitted on 
properties and you think there is a slight disjuncture 
between what he said to his partners and my discussions 
with him.   Because if you look at those amounts he says 
10 
you owe me R1.3 million – he says that.  It is in that 
annexure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You talking about Exhibit SS18(b)1. 
MR MONTANA:  Yes that email Chair that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
That 
email. 
 
The 
letter 
that 
was 
terminating the relationship, is that right? 
MR MONTANA:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  He then mentioned that amount and my 
understanding … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well that letter says: 
“I have noted the contents of your mail below 
and confirm the following as – as the Director 
and 
Shareholder 
of 
Precise 
Trade 
and 
Investment: 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 163 of 179 
 
1. I am prepared to agree that the loan of R1.3 
million plus interest must be repaid by no later 
than 31 December 2015 or even at 1 January 
2016.” 
That is the R1.3 you talking about? 
MR MONTANA:  That is what I am referring to Chair 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MONTANA:  Now you have seen that loan – in that 
Chair he is referring to R1.3 now there is an issue about the 
relationship between the numbers that are mentioned here. 
10 
 
You remember here Chair we are dealing with two 
things.  We are not dealing with money that came to me.  
We are dealing with – it is quite clear to me that what Van 
Der – Mr Van Der Walt was doing with all the people who he 
was involved with he was – it was like some kind of a 
rotating fund which he gives to Montana here, he gives to 
Zondo – he got Zondo to pay this and all of those things. 
 
His notes say that and I have confirmed that with 
him Chair.  Now I have asked that can we deal with 
Montana’s – what is it called – statement especially the flow 
20 
of money between Precise Trade and Montana.   
 
What I have been presented here Chair we are 
dealing with what Robert deals with the relationship in 
respect.  He does not deal with Precise Trade. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I want to stop you there.  Mr Soni I 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 164 of 179 
 
think it is going to be better to do it the – in the usual way. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I think it is going to be better for Mr 
Soni to take you through the transactions. 
MR MONTANA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that for purposes of simply saying I 
have no issue with this transaction yes I have no issue with 
the fact that so much appeared to have gone from that 
account to that account or maybe that it was in connection 
with that particular property or whatever you want to say 
10 
and then when we deal with the – when we – when we have 
read your affidavit and Siyangena then whatever else you 
want to say to complete the picture in relation to properties 
you can then deal with.  But we can put aside and have a 
clear picture on where the issues are on the payments. 
MR MONTANA:  I have… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think one of the points you are making is 
– is that a lot of the payments maybe you say all of them 
but a lot of the payments that are dealt with were not 
payments that were coming to you.  I think that is one of the 
20 
points you make, is that right? 
MR MONTANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  But the bigger issue I am saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 165 of 179 
 
MR MONTANA:  We are dealing with Mr Riaan’s account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  Not my account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes ja. 
MR MONTANA:  Now – now the only thing I can do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  And that is why I said earlier on to Mr Soni. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  A three way match is going to be very 
important. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  We are starting to do – I am supposed to 
confirm statements which have – have even a whole range 
of other transactions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  So I can only note Chair – I can only note 
and that is why I am asking the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  Let us ask ABSA to give us my statement 
for the period then we can compare Chair because – and 
20 
you can see Chair you have got a statement that says 
Montana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  And then below it says R400 – it says TLM.  
So if somebody is using Montana as his reference why 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 166 of 179 
 
would he use TLM – and I thought I am the only one Chair 
but who uses the reference TLM to just to cover it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  And you can see even in how I have 
marked my documents.  So Chair in real times I can note 
but I cannot assist the commission specifically on those.  
The only person who can assist that commission is not even 
Robert it is Mr Van Der Walt. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  Because he can say tell us what the – what 
10 
do you mean there?  The – or else all of us are left in the 
realm of – of what is it called – speculation.  And Chair I 
can only note them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  But I cannot – I cannot. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot – yes. 
MR MONTANA:  Unless if the commission says in your bank 
statement Mr Montana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You … 
MR MONTANA:  We see R400 000.00 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  It came from there can you confirm that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  Now then we are happy.  But I am being 
asked about somebody and this can you see Chair the ups 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 167 of 179 
 
and downs in that account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  It is not my account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  He is the one – he – they say he gave – he 
has written notes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  And I see for example Chair that when 
PRASA went to court one of the things they were trying to 
see they were trying to take the notes and said these notes 
10 
means the money came from TLM and I asked Riaan did 
they come from TLM – he says no.  It tells me how I am 
using the money to that.   
And 
Chair 
when 
I 
looked 
at 
the 
affidavit 
of 
Siyangena by the way including the affidavit that I think has 
been read – I am referring to the affidavit that has been 
read earlier by the CFO.  That – they are very clear in that 
– in that thing that they are not even involved. They have 
never even transferred a cent from Siyangena to – what is it 
called – to Precise Trade.  
20 
They say we do not have a relationship with Precise 
Trade.  So – so Chair you can see that I am being asked 
about things – ask me about my relationship with how we 
bought these properties with Riaan Van Der Walt.  They are 
properties that I bought for development.  There are 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 168 of 179 
 
properties that we bought and we had the bigger picture 
about what we wanted to develop and Chair so these are. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  So I cannot answer – people speculating or 
drawing inferences from somebody else’ statement Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I think Mr Soni maybe the best way 
might be this because you would – you probably have an 
idea that the various bank statements reflect 1,2,3,4,5 such 
as on such and such a date there was a payment from 
Precise Trade to whoever or from somebody to Precise 
10 
Trade.  If you put those series of propositions based on 
what is reflected on the bank statements Mr – maybe even 
without going through each one Mr Montana can say well I 
have no problem with all of those propositions because my 
point is simply this.  Then maybe it might be faster.   
ADV SONI SC:  Yes 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am just thinking you might have a 
different way I am easy I just want to see how we can move 
expeditiously. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  And Chairperson I do not want us to 
20 
run into difficulties.  What we have is a statement or a letter 
from Mr Van Der Walt. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
ADV SONI SC:  Who is asked tell us about the Parkwood 
property. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 169 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  And he says it was bought for R6.8 million 
and these are the payments I made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now he does not say he made the payments 
to Mr Montana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  What he says is here is the bank statement 
and in the bank statement you see a correlation between 
what he says in his letter and what is reflected in the bank 
10 
statement 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now the difficulty we have is that when he 
says TLM or Mr Montana reading it with the letter of the 30 
– 28 t h of January 2016 we say that that is a payment made 
in respect of his indebtedness to Montana. It does not mean 
that he paid it directly to Mr Montana.   
 
Now of course we are now in this difficult situation 
because Mr Montana’s point is well I do not know about 
those it may have my name but I cannot confirm this. 
20 
 
Now in a sense Chairperson we are running around 
in circles because instead of Mr Montana saying because – 
and this is an issue and I am going to put to Mr Montana in 
a moment.   
 
I buy something from well Mr Van Der Walt buys a 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 170 of 179 
 
property worth R6.8 million from Mr Montana.  He says I 
made these payments.  Now that is Mr Montana’s property 
he must know if those payments were made or not.  
Whether it was made to him or to somebody else because 
they are payments due in terms of the agreement which we 
have already looked at. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
ADV SONI SC:  So – but that is the proposition I am going 
to put and that is as far as we can take it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine.  I think you deal with it 
10 
the way you – you are happy with it.  From your side Mr 
Montana when he puts any proposition or question if you 
are able to answer because you do have knowledge you 
answer.  If you say I do not know because it is somebody 
else’ account that you say you do not know and you can – 
we can move on. 
MR MONTANA:  Chair can I say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja 
MR MONTANA:  Can I say something?  I do not think we are 
far apart Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no I also do not think so. 
MR MONTANA:  I think – I think we are in agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  Remember when I came to – in the morning 
when I came here Chair I wanted to demonstrate one 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 171 of 179 
 
fundamental thing.  The story that Siyangena or Van Der 
Walt bought properties from me is false.  And Chair I went 
through each properties and showed how much money I 
have.  That is the first thing I wanted to say. 
 
Secondly Chair I am confirming – I also confirmed to 
the commission Mr Soni that myself and Riaan had – were 
partners so I am not saying Chair that I am denying even 
the fact that I may – I may have said transferred 
R100 000.000 to pay somebody or – that is not what I am 
saying. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  I am simply saying Chair you are putting 
me in a difficulty because you are not dealing with my 
statements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  You are dealing with a statement of 
somebody involved – where I say for example I said on the 
2.2 million that Mr Van Der Walt paid.  I said I think – I said 
that – I think he may have been either settling the bond. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The bond. 
20 
MR MONTANA:  Facility or he may have been paying the 
property note – for the property note in order to – on my 
behalf.  That I accept Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  But I am saying the difficulty I have is that 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 172 of 179 
 
we are going to see R300 million he does not want to say it 
is Montana he say this is his reference.  And another one 
says TLM.  It is not my – I do not know because I did not 
know how Riaan for example was mobilising his own money 
to be involved with me and even other people Chair that is 
the issue.  And so – and so I am saying that it is becoming 
unfair but I think … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  I think to be fair to the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR MONTANA:  Let us go through that process Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  And if I do not know (speaking in 
vernacular). But if the commission cannot hold that against 
me and say because if the commission wants to hold it 
against me they say now Mr Montana here is your 
statements Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  Riaan and I had a relationship it involved 
money – it involved properties Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  But this had nothing to do – the issue here 
is that I said – they said in this report and many other 
allegations Montana did not even have a cent they – we 
bought the – Siyangena bought properties for him Chair. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 173 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  And that is my – I am here to talk about 
that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no. 
MR MONTANA:  And to demonstrate that it is so false. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
MR MONTANA:  It does not have 00:17:01 and secondly 
that I have never hidden my relationship because Riaan has 
got nothing to do with Siyangena or tenders at PRASA.  He 
is a lawyer on the side and I do not want to be persecuted 
10 
on the basis of – of association with him because he 
happened to know so and so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  Now finally on this  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
MR MONTANA:  On these statements Chair I think Mr Soni 
should take me through. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  But he cannot expect me to know another 
man’s account Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no, no where he – where he has issues 
with you saying you do not know because he thinks you 
know he will – he will put that to you. 
MR MONTANA:  No, no Chair I am more than happy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 174 of 179 
 
MR MONTANA:  I think let us do that ja thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.   
ADV SONI SC:  If I recall we were at 2.2.4 at page 198. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Soni I see we are at five to 
five. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think we – we should just take an 
adjournment ten minutes adjournment. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  Chairperson there is – while proceedings 
were going on there is something that occurred to me that if 
we go on late into the evening today it is going to be 
impossible for being meaningfully to deal with these 
matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I – I agree.  I did not realise that 
we are already close to five. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought we were still close to four. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I was thinking that maybe we should go up 
to six but it may well be I think I can be guided by you 
because that may be a lot of reading to do.  It may be that 
we should stop so that there is enough time to read.  It may 
be that we should go maybe up to six.  What is your sense 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 175 of 179 
 
because there is the reading as well? 
ADV SONI SC:  Chairperson there – there may be things in 
the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  And I have not seen the annexures yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  So it is going to be another issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  That … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe it is better we adjourn. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  And I just do not know how to – 
because we need to make copies as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So maybe it is convenient that we 
should adjourn or – and then tomorrow start at a little 
earlier half past nine I do not – what is your sense? 
ADV SONI SC:  No, no the – the problem though 
Chairperson has that we would have to make copies this 
evening so that we are able to deal meaningfully with what 
is contained in these affidavits. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no what I mean is in terms of 
20 
whether we adjourn now or later. 
ADV SONI SC:  I think we should adjourn now Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  Because this is – and it will into… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Mr Montana you – you have given us 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 176 of 179 
 
a lot of – a lot of paperwork that must be read. 
MR MONTANA:  Well Chair I was willing to go until ten. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Until twelve midnight. 
MR MONTANA:  They say the minute – the meeting with the 
President until two am.  So I am – no Chair it is fine I think I 
will – I will be here tomorrow that is fine Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay yes.  Yes should we start – should 
we stick to ten or how – do half past nine but sometimes we 
start at half past nine like we did I think on Friday but I 
ended up needing to have a longer lunch because there 
10 
were some things that needed my attention. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.     
CHAIRPERSON:  What is your sense. 
ADV SONI SC:  In view of the reading we have as much 
time that we have to prepare would be appreciated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. Then let us start at normal time ten 
o’clock.  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  Are you starting with me or with the PRASA 
people and then I come afternoon Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  My sense is that we should start with you.  
20 
I do not know.  Mr Soni – ja let us start with you we 
continue and try and finish with you.  We- I would like to – 
to finish with your evidence. 
MR MONTANA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Tomorrow if we can. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 177 of 179 
 
MR MONTANA:  That is in respect of properties Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well in respect of everything.  But if – if 
we do not achieve that despite our best efforts we will take 
it from there to see what can be done.  As I say I do have – 
my schedule of hearings and witnesses up to end of May it 
is almost full you know – actually it is full.  But let us see 
how far we can go and we do our best efforts but if we come 
to the end of – of – and I do have an evening session 
tomorrow.  So if we come to five o’clock we see that we are 
not done and we have done the best we can we will take it 
10 
from there. 
MR MONTANA:  No Chair I am happy with that except that 
they kept on reminding the team. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  Tomorrow it will be my sixth day Chair 
here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  And in all of them I have been responding 
to allegations made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR MONTANA:  Against me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ja. 
MR MONTANA:  And I have been asking the team when will 
I have the time to tall my own story. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 MAY 2021 – DAY 391 
 
Page 178 of 179 
 
MR MONTANA:  Because I have been replying Chair – I 
have been responding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  So as long as the commission takes that – 
keeps that at the back of its mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja 
MR MONTANA:  I have to tell my own story and my affidavit 
Chair I am more than happy. 
CHAIRPERSON: No, no that is fine.  You will – you will 
remember that earlier this afternoon I said if we park the 
10 
properties issue I could give you a chance to – to deal with 
whatever issues that you have been asked that you – you 
have not given a full answer or – so – so … 
MR MONTANA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I take that into account. 
MR MONTANA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay let us adjourn for the day.  
There will be no evening session this evening.  We will 
resume at ten tomorrow morning.  We adjourn. 
ADV SONI SC:  Thank you Chair. 
20
