PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 23 APRIL 2021 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Good morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I understand that there has been 
miscommunication about what time we start.  We are 
supposed to start at 10:00 but it looks like one of my staff 
members sent the wrong information.  So we are going to 
adjourn and start at 11:00 that will then give also the – 
your team and Mr Singh’s team a chance to discuss any 
issues that may need to be discussed so that when we 
10 
start at 11:00 we can just go on.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  We will then adjourn until 11:00.  We 
adjourn.   
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
PROCEEDINGS RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning again Mr Myburgh, good

ADV MYBURGH:  Good morning DCJ. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Morning Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning, good morning.  Are you 
ready? 
ADV MYBURGH:  Yes thank you DCJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let us start. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Good morning Mr Singh. 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 4 of 110 
 
MR SINGH:  Good morning Sir, morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Singh. 
ADV MYBURGH:  I would like just to go back to the issue 
of your travel. When you – when you went to Eskom did 
you continue making these personal/private trips to Dubai? 
MR SINGH:  If I recall correctly yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Can I ask you… 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Sorry Chairperson I cannot hear 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
You 
cannot 
hear 
your 
client 
or 
10 
everybody? 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  I cannot hear my learned friend. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your client.  Oh. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  And I also need to hear him it is 
very important. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADV MYBURGH:  Alright well let me repeat the question 
then if I my DCJ? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  I had asked you whether after you went 
to Eskom you continued with your personal/private trips to 
Dubai and I understand you answered yes? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 5 of 110 
 
ADV MYBURGH:  Could I ask you please to go to Bundle 
5(b) Exhibit BB23.  And could you turn – could you turn to 
page 829 in fact to 828.   
MR SINGH:  I am there. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Are you there? 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Now this is a judgment of the High Court 
in 
the 
matter 
between 
Eskom 
McKinsey 
and Trillian 
etcetera where Eskom sought to overturn the payments 
made to Trillian.  I just want to take you to a few paragraph 
10 
of this judgment insofar as it relates to you.  Could you 
please go to paragraph 16 – 16 at page 835.   
MR SINGH:  I am there. 
ADV MYBURGH:  At the foot of page 835 paragraph 16 
reads: 
“Once Mr Molefe and Anoj Singh arrived at 
Eskom senior officials at Eskom who were 
expected to act in good faith and in the best 
interests of Eskom started to interact with 
Mr Essa meeting him at his offices in 
20 
Melrose Arch Johannesburg feeding him 
with confidential information belonging to 
Eskom. 
 
Some 
of 
these 
officials 
in 
particular Mr Matshela Koko and Mr Anoj 
Singh enjoyed trips to Dubai either paid for 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 6 of 110 
 
or facilitated by Mr Essa through the Gupta 
Link businesses but these are then secured 
with the sole intention of favouring or 
benefitting Trillian if not fraudulent is quite 
obvious.” 
 
And then if I could ask you to go to paragraph 56  
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Chairperson would it not be 
convenient if Mr Singh answers the various points put to 
him by my learned friend otherwise it becomes a very long 
statement and we might have to repeat it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr Myburgh might be needing to 
refer him to Mr Singh to another paragraph before he 
makes a – puts the question he wants to put. 
ADV MYBURGH:  I just … 
CHAIRPERSON:  What paragraph? 
ADV MYBURGH:  I want to take you to paragraph 56 at 
page 868 and just continues the theme obviously Mr Singh 
I am going to give you an opportunity to answer or to raise 
whatever you want to.  At 56  
“Corruption is the only issue that Trillian 
20 
seems even though feebly to put in issue.  
Upon examination of the undisputed facts it 
seems that even on this aspect Trillian fails 
to make out a case.  One of the events that 
stand out in the corruption collaboration – 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 7 of 110 
 
sorry in the corrupt collaboration between 
Trillian and Eskom officials was the all 
expenses 
paid 
trips 
enjoyed 
by 
Eskom 
officials Koko and Anoj Singh to Dubai 
which 
were 
arranged 
by 
Mr 
Essa 
and 
Sahara a Gupta owned company.:” 
 
Do you want to comment on those two paragraphs? 
MR SINGH:  Thank you Mr Chair.  I think you – we refer 
this entire … 
ADV MYBURGH:  And you need speak into the mic. 
10 
MR SINGH:  Oh sorry.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  Sorry Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Bring the mic closer to you. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair if we refer to the entire how can I 
say – matter between Eskom and McKinsey and Trillian Mr 
you will note that I was not cited as a party to this 
application.   
So for me to comment on these matters would be 
inappropriate but to the extent that Mr Myburgh to advise 
20 
me to comment on paragraph 15 and to the extent that we 
have dealt with these matters yesterday Mr Chair I am – if 
you look at paragraph 16 Mr Chair it says: 
“Senior Eskom officials were expected to 
have – 00:06:17 started interacted with Mr 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 8 of 110 
 
Essa meeting him at his office at Melrose 
Arch 
feeding 
him 
with 
confidential 
information belonging to Eskom.  Some of 
these officials in particular…” 
 
So let us deal with the first 00:06:29 Mr Chair.  
Firstly Mr Chair I deny that I met Mr Essa at Melrose 
offices.  There was no – there is no evidence suggesting 
that Mr Essa and I met at his Melrose Arch offices while he 
was a shareholder of Trillian.  
 
Secondly Mr Chair in terms of feeding confidential 
10 
information about Eskom again Mr Chair I deny that I fed 
any confidential information to Mr Essa because again 
there is no proof to support that. 
 
In terms of the trips Mr Chair I think we have dealt 
with that yesterday and I have denied the involvement of 
Mr Essa or the Gupta – the Gupta linked entities relating to 
these trips that he has mentioned in paragraph 16. 
 
If we then go to paragraph 56 Mr Chair we deal 
again with the issue of the corrupt collaboration between 
Trillian and Eskom officials Mr Chair. 
20 
 
Again Mr Chair I deny any allegation of corruption 
against me.  I have dealt with the issue of Trillian 
extensively in the Eskom stream and again Mr Chair in 
terms of the trips I deny any association with Mr Essa or 
Sahara Group of Companies relating to these trips as we 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 9 of 110 
 
have dealt with this. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Alright and then if I can take… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry Mr Myburgh.  Do we by any chance 
have a set of the court papers relating to this judgment? 
Do you know? 
ADV MYBURGH:  I am sure we can obtain them DCJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I would like to – to see the set. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja.  Well Mr Singh after the – this 
application had been launched which resulted in this 
10 
judgment were you – did you become aware of the fact that 
an application had been launched at the High Court by 
Eskom against Trillian among others?  Did you become 
aware of the application pending in the High Court before 
the judgment? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair at the time I do not recall but I would 
think through the media I did become aware. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Nobody sent you the papers 
or anything? 
MR SINGH:  No Sir. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Thank you.  And then at paragraph 57 
Trillian claims: 
“That even assuming the correctness of 
these allegations they do not assist Eskom.  
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 10 of 110 
 
In 
essence 
the 
allegations 
concerning 
Messrs Koko and Singh do not demonstrate 
a cause or nexus between their alleged 
receipt of gratification and the conclusion of 
any 
agreement 
with 
McKinsey 
or 
the 
appointment of McKinsey or indeed Trillian 
and sub-contractors.” 
 
What Trillian states in this exert is far removed from 
the truth as the following facts demonstrate.  If you go over 
the page. 
10 
“As Chief Financial Officer Singh was the 
signatory to the board tender committee 
submission 
on 
8 
August 
2016 
which 
motivated 
the 
R1.8 
billion 
settlement 
inclusive of payment to BBBEE partner 
which partner is not identified. 
2. Trillian sent invoices directly to Singh as 
what 
appeared 
to 
be 
Trillian’s 
contact 
person at Eskom. 
3. The board tender committee’s December 
20 
2016 resolution appointed Singh, Koko and 
Mabelane to negotiate – Mabelane I beg 
your 
pardon 
– 
to 
negotiate 
the 
final 
settlement which included payments to the 
BBBEE partner. 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 11 of 110 
 
4. On 6 July 2015 Koko was tasked to 
conduct negotiations as Group Executive 
Technology 
and 
Commercial 
to 
conduct 
negotiations of the MSA. 
5. Koko and Singh sought approval of the 
2015 McKinsey contract from the Eskom 
board.  
Evidently 
there 
is 
a 
consistent 
pattern in the behaviour of these senior 
officials 
which 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
day 
10 
benefitted Trillian.   
Another theme in the conduct of 
these officials was that whenever invoices 
landed at Eskom’s desk they were settled 
with alacrity and with a total and unseeingly 
disregard for Eskom’s internal prescripts 
regarding payment approvals. 
The objective evidence presented by 
Eskom 
demonstrates 
that 
just 
a 
nexus 
between Eskom and Trillian’s benefaction 
20 
but 
seeks 
– 
speaks 
to 
a 
theme 
of 
consistently corrupt behaviour.” 
Perhaps I should just read the last sentence again. 
“The 
objective 
evidence 
presented 
by 
Eskom demonstrates more than that just a 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 12 of 110 
 
nexus 
between 
Eskom 
and 
Trillian’s 
benefaction 
but 
speaks 
to 
a 
theme 
of 
consistently corrupt behaviour.” 
You want to comment upon that? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair again in terms of the objective 
evidence that is presented by Eskom demonstrates…sorry 
Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You – I think you must put your file on 
top because when you speak looking down. 
MR SINGH:  Let me do this. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  When you speak looking down we 
cannot hear you properly.  Yes.  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair in terms of let us start with probably 
the last sentence.  In terms of the objective evidence 
presented by Eskom Mr Chair again reiterate I was not 
party to this application so I am not privy to the evidence 
that was actually presented by Eskom to demonstrate the 
issue of – that speaks to the theme of consistently corrupt 
behaviour. 
 
On whose part I am extremely – I do not know who 
20 
that – whose part it is.  Mr Chair if we look at the – the 
paragraph 57.1, 57.2, 57.3, 57,4 and 57,5 and we will take 
them in turn.   
 
Mr Chair if we can start with 57.5 it says: 
“Koko and Singh sought approval of the 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 13 of 110 
 
2015 McKinsey contract from the Eskom 
board.” 
 
Mr Chair as I have – as we have discussed in 
Eskom’s stream dates become very important in these type 
of matters and I do not recall having arrived on the 1 s t of 
August 2015 where I sought approval for the McKinsey 
contract. 
 
If I recall the McKinsey contract was a confinement 
to McKinsey he was approved in July 2015 by if I recall 
correctly that was prior to my arrival. 
10 
 
So that is as it relates to 57.5.  And here again on 
57.4 Mr Chair which confirms. 
“On 6 July Koko was tasked with the – to 
conduct 
negotiations 
as 
the 
Group 
Executive Technology and Commercial to 
conduct negotiations on the MSA.” 
 
Which again suggests that it is pre-dated to my 
arrival of 1 August.  If we look at the board tender 
commission – the board tender committee in December Mr 
Chair I think that was – I do not think there is a dispute in 
20 
terms of the 57.3. 
 
Mr Chair I do not know what level of detail you want 
me to go into relating to these matters because obviously 
this is not an – this is not an Eskom stream but for me to – 
to fully – for you to fully appreciate the comment in terms 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 14 of 110 
 
of the board tender committee 2016 resolution appointed 
Singh, Koko and Mabelane to negotiate the settlement 
agreement I would have to go in a relative amount of detail 
for you to appreciate the context behind this resolution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think – I think it is important that within 
the – within the context of Mr Myburgh’s question that you 
give me enough that you think gives you a fair or – a fair 
opportunity you know to deal with Eskom. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair can we do… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And obviously – obviously there is the 
10 
Eskom work stream … 
MR SINGH:  I was just going to suggest that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but I do not want a situation where 
the question might require you to deal a little more fully 
with the issue and you do not deal more fully with it to your 
detriment.  So… 
MR SINGH:  Well Mr Chair I think maybe… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I would like you to – to be able to say 
this is the thrust of my answer or this is my answer. 
MR SINGH:  I think Mr Chair with the understanding that 
20 
we still going to traverse these issues in the Eskom stream 
I will provide you with the context and the background 
behind 57.3 to the extent that I think it is necessary here 
with the understanding that will more fully cover it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well because Mr Myburgh is the evidence 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 15 of 110 
 
leader subject to what he says because he might be 
wanting a full answer on certain matters; he might be 
wanting not so detailed an answer on certain matters.  Mr 
Myburgh what is our input? 
ADV MYBURGH:  Chairperson I have no difficulty with Mr 
Singh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Providing whatever explanation he 
wishes to give at this time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja okay alright.  So … 
10 
MR SINGH:  Thank you Mr. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja so satisfy yourself that you have given 
a fair – you have given an answer that reasonably satisfies 
you that you have answered the question. 
MR SINGH:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  So let us come back to 57.3.  So we have 
dealt with 57.5; we have dealt with 57.4 Mr Chair 57.2. 
“Trillian sent invoices directly to Singh as 
what 
appeared 
to 
be 
Trillian’s 
contact 
20 
person at Eskom.”   
 
Mr Chair 57.2 as I recall in terms of the evidence 
that we presented on the Eskom stream okay.  The – if 
memory serves me correctly the only invoice that was 
actually sent to me directly was the invoice for the 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 16 of 110 
 
corporate plan that related to the R30 million payment.  I 
do not recall if any of the MSA invoices were actually sent 
to me.  And Mr Chair again the issue of Singh appears to 
be Trillian’s contact person at Eskom I think we have 
explained and traversed again in the Eskom stream.   
Any connotation as it relates to me being Trillian’s 
contact person in a – how can I say – unsavoury manner I 
think we reject because we have explained that the invoice 
relating to corporate plan was sent to me directly because 
I was a recipient of those Sir.   
10 
And as I say Mr Chair again this is from memory.  In 
terms of the 57.1 Singh was a signatory to the board 
tender 
committee 
submissions 
on 
8 t h 
August 
which 
motivated for R1.8 billion settlement inclusive of the 
BBBEE partner which was not identified.   
Mr Chair factually that is not disputed.  I did sign 
the memo I did recommend the memo and Mr Chair the 
recommendation of the memo was on the basis that the 
board tender committee had the mandate to either approve 
or disapprove.   
20 
I did not hold the mandate because you will recall 
that prior to the 8 t h of August 2016 I think sometime in 
June 2016 the board tender committee had already taken a 
resolution to terminate the board – the Master Services 
Agreement with McKinsey and its sub-contractors. And that 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 17 of 110 
 
resolution empowered a settlement process to be engaged 
upon following the 28 t h June letter from McKinsey let us 
call it letter of demand.   
So Mr Chair again in context I did not approve a 
R1.8 billion settlement.  The document was prepared based 
on a request from the board tender committee that 
emanated 
in 
June 
visa 
vie 
the 
settlement 
and 
the 
termination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was this – was the submission of the 8 t h 
of August 2016 he did not recommend the approval? 
10 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair it was a recommendation for them to 
consider the settlement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  So yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but it motivated for the approval? 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  But the actual approval actually sat with the 
board tender committee themselves. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think the – to the extent that you want 
20 
to make the distinction at a factual level that you did not 
approve. 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Even though you may have recommended 
in support of the approval. 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 18 of 110 
 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is a fair point. 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair in terms of – so then going back to 
57.3 Mr Chair because I am trying to deal with it in 
chronological order.  The board tender committee in 
December 2016 resolution appointed Singh, Koko and 
Mabelane to negotiate a final settlement with – included 
the payments for the partner.  And she says subsequent to 
10 
the approval of the 8 t h of August a 1.8 the board tender 
committee I think at that point approved the payment of 
R800 million of the R1.8 but there was continuous – there 
was still a settlement process that was – that was still on-
going because the eventual amount that was actually 
settled on was an amount of R1.6. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was an amount of? 
MR SINGH:  R1.6 billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  And the settlement agreement Mr Chair was 
20 
ultimately 
signed 
between 
Eskom 
and 
McKinsey 
in 
February 2017.  So that is the context behind the 
December 2016 resolution of the board tender committee.  
In this on-going negotiation process they then requested 
that myself, Mr Koko and Mr Mabelane engage with 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 19 of 110 
 
McKinsey to find a lower value than the R1.8 that they had 
originally – that they had originally approved and at that 
time Mr Chair I think this coincided with the independent 
review that had been done by Oliver Wyman and that was 
the basis for let us ask for a lower amount.  Okay.   
Mr Chair again in terms of this the resolution 
appointed us to do this we engaged with them, we nego – 
we engaged with McKinsey – when I say we I think it was 
primarily Mr Govender and Mr Mabelane that used then the 
Oliver Wyman report to settle – to arrive at a settlement 
10 
value of R1.6 billion which was then I think taken to the 
board tender committee in February and then was settled 
upon approval by the board tender committee which then 
resulted in Mr Mabelane signing the final settlement 
agreement with McKinsey which then affected the last 
payment of R1.6.   
Mr Chair if we then go on to the point of evidently 
there is a consistent pattern of behaviour of these senior 
officials which at the end of the day benefitted Trillian.   
Mr Chair I deny any benefit – any favouritism that I 
20 
had showed toward Trillian or McKinsey for that matter.  As 
I understand it Mr Chair the negotiations that were 
undertaken between Mabelane and Mr Govender in terms 
of the settlement process was actually done with McKinsey.  
Another theme of conduct of these officials was that 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 20 of 110 
 
whenever invoices landed at the Eskom desk they were 
settled with alacrity and with a total and unseemingly 
disregard 
for 
Eskom’s 
internal 
prescripts 
regarding 
payment approval.  
Mr Chair again on the Eskom stream we went into a 
level 
of 
detail 
and 
we 
have 
also 
provided 
in 
our 
supplementary affidavits to the commission the roles and 
responsibilities of who approves – approves payments; how 
payments are approved; who the officials are that actually 
checks invoices and the like. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry has that document been 
provided because you remember in the Eskom stream I 
think I did mention that Mr Seleka and his team should try 
and obtain the document that sets those things out at 
Eskom. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair just for clarity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Operating procedures or policies ja. 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  So we – if you recall Mr Chair I think it 
was on the last day that we came for the Eskom stream 
previously where we put up a supplementary affidavit and it 
20 
was relatively voluminous. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja oh well… 
MR SINGH:  And we wanted to start with that and then it 
was decided that listen we will continue with Mr Seleka’s … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 21 of 110 
 
MR SINGH:  And we will come back to –  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I think I … 
MR SINGH:  So that – so those things are in that bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR SINGH:  So we will certainly come back to that Mr 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so I have not seen them.  I think I 
(talking over one another). 
MR SINGH:  So the commission has not actually seen 
them. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR SINGH:  But the documentation is with… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there. 
MR SINGH:  In the possession of the – as part of one of 
our supplementary affidavits. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Okay.  
MR SINGH:  So Mr Chair again if we look at the wording of 
this it says  
“The conduct of these officials” 
And I can only assume that they are referring to 
20 
myself and Mr Koko.  Mr Chair these invoices that the refer 
to on the MSA that was approved and paid I certainly did 
not play any role in the manner  in which they were 
approved – in the manner in which they were processed in 
the system for them to be paid.   
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 22 of 110 
 
And again there is no evidence to suggest that I 
was the one that engaged in the payment of these 
invoices. I think Mr Chair that is all I would like to say in 
terms of this paragraph. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Excuse me thank you.  Before I go on 
further into the judgment could I ask you just to go back 
please to page 856.  There the Judge quotes from an 
extract from Eskom’s affidavit 47.2 
“Eskom 
expands 
on 
the 
corrupt 
link 
10 
between Trillian, Essa and the Gupta family 
when it says quote as I have mentioned Mr 
Essa was the majority shareholder and a 
director of Trillian Capital Partners.  I 
attach Mr Essa’s biography as well as 
relevant 
extracts 
from 
a 
PIPC 
director 
search as annexure PH14 and PH15.  Mr 
Essa 
is 
widely 
known 
to 
be 
a 
close 
associate of the Gupta family.  Annexure 
PH15 reflects Mr Essa’s role as a director 
20 
of VR Laser another company with close 
links to the Gupta family. Mr Koko has also 
admitted that he attended private meetings 
with Mr Essa regarding Trillian’s work at 
Eskom.  In this regard I attach relevant 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381

extracts 
of 
Mr 
Koko’s 
testimony 
in 
Parliament as Annexure PH16.” 
 
Do you want to – do you have any comment on 
that? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair none of these issues in this 
paragraph 47.2 are within my personal knowledge. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Are you suggesting that you did not know 
that Mr Essa was a shareholder and director of Trillian? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair when the – I think I have testified to 
this on the Eskom stream Mr Chair not until McKinsey had 
10 
given us the termination letter relating to their relationship 
with McKinsey – or Trillian sorry. 
ADV MYBURGH:  So you came to learn – sorry whose 
termination letter? 
MR SINGH:  There was a process that – of vetting that 
Trillian was undertaking – McKinsey was undertaking on 
Trillian. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Alright.  So you only came to learn of 
this right at the end? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH:  Did you not have any dealings with Mr 
Essa in relation to Trillian? 
MR SINGH:  So Sir. 
ADV MYBURGH:  I see.  And then let us go to the 
conclusion.  Paragraph 67 at page 875.   
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 24 of 110 
 
“In 
the 
present 
matter 
where 
the 
probabilities are apparent.” 
MR SINGH:  Sorry – what – sorry Sir what page is it? 
ADV MYBURGH:  875 paragraph 67. 
MR SINGH:  875 – 875? 
ADV MYBURGH:  875.  I think you appear to be in a – are 
you in the right file? 
MR SINGH:  No, no yes Sir.  It is the same one. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Yes it is. 
MR SINGH:  Ja.  I am there Sir. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH:  Paragraph 67. 
“In 
the 
present 
matter 
where 
the 
probabilities 
are 
apparent 
that 
senior 
officials of Eskom would leave no stone 
unturned 
to 
benefit 
Trillian 
where 
confidential information belonging to Eskom 
was 
leaked 
to 
Trillian 
where 
senior 
personnel of Eskom who were expected to 
display the conduct of the utmost good faith 
and to act in the best interests of Eskom 
20 
where 
there 
appears 
to 
be 
a 
corrupt 
relationship 
between 
Eskom’s 
senior 
personnel 
and 
the 
directors 
of 
Trillian 
justice and equity demand nothing less than 
that the monies paid to Trillian unjustifiably 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 25 of 110 
 
be returned to Eskom.” 
 
Any comment on that? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair again if we look at the paragraph in 
turn Mr Chair I do not know who the officials that they refer 
to in terms of leaving no un stone – no stone unturned to 
benefit Trillian I deny that was me Mr Chair.  As I have 
explained to you before Mr Chair.  The entire process 
relating 
to 
the 
settlement 
Mr 
Chair 
was 
relating 
to 
negotiations with McKinsey themselves.  The – where 
confidential information belonging to Eskom was leader to 
10 
Trillian Mr Chair I deny that was me in any way, shape or 
form.  Personnel at Eskom were expecting to display a 
conduct of utmost good faith through – and act in the best 
interest of Eskom.   
 
Mr Chair, I think at all relevant times, I – 
personally, I was conduct – I conducted myself in that 
regard.  When the issues relating to the MSA became 
apparent, as I testified in terms of the reasons for the 
termination of the MSA, Mr Chair, that was acting in the 
best interest of Eskom.   
20 
 
When that termination decision was made by the 
Steer Co, Mr Chair, I requested that Legal and the 
Procurement Department get engaged to ensure that the 
termination process is handled in a manner that is in 
compliance with or identified risks associated with the 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 26 of 110 
 
termination process, I mitigated them appropriately.   
 
Mr Chair, in terms of the negotiations or final 
negotiations, Chair, we did obtain a final independent 
assessment that was conducted by Oval(?) 1(?) which 
indicate a certain value which was negotiated by McKinsey 
and was settled.  Again Mr Chair, acting in the interest of 
Eskom.   
 
Lastly Mr Chair, at all relevant times Mr Chair I 
was – even to understand that the legal review and legal 
processes or legal review of this McKinsey contract was 
10 
being undertaken and there were no issues relating to a 
settlement.   
 
And again, Mr Chair.  Just from my perspective 
of the sake of clarity.  Again, the legal assessment and 
legal aspects relating to this falls outside of purview of the 
office of the CEO. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then if we go, finally, to the 
order.  It starts at paragraph 70 at page 876 and I just 
want to direct your attention to page 878 following on the 
paragraph that I have read.  There were two orders that I 
20 
just want to put to you or ask – bring to your attention. 
17.6: 
“The payments made by Eskom to Trillian 
arising from the impugn decisions above, were 
declared unlawful and invalid.” 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 27 of 110 
 
And 17.7: 
“Trillian is ordered to repay to Eskom the sum 
of 
R 595 228 913 29 
together 
with 
interest 
thereon at the prescribed rate, calculated from 
the date of judgment...” 
 
I do not suppose you have anything to say?  Do 
you want to comment on that? 
MR SINGH:   No, Chair I do not have any comments. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So, Mr Singh, as I read paragraph 67 
...[intervenes]  
10 
MR SINGH:   Sorry? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   ...of this judgment.  You were found, 
in effect, to have been in a corrupt relationship with 
Mr Essa. 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, which page are you on now? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   67. 
MR SINGH:   867? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, 876, paragraph 67. 
MR SINGH:   Oh ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   When you read that paragraph in the 
20 
context of the judgment, in effect, you have found to have 
been in a corrupt relationship with Mr Essa. 
MR SINGH:   876? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 875, paragraph 67. 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 28 of 110 
 
MR SINGH:   Yes.  Mr Chair, as I have explained previously 
from one of the other paragraphs, Mr Chair.  I deny the fact 
that I have a corrupt relationship with Mr Essa. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, but what I am putting to you is 
my interpretation of that paragraph is that you were found 
to have been in a corrupt relationship with Mr Essa 
because the directors of Trillian referred to are Essa and 
the senior officials of Eskom that are referred to are you 
and Mr Koko. 
MR SINGH:   Well, Mr Chair, then the finding of the court, 
10 
obviously, occurred without my input because I was not 
cited as a party to this application. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you accept that the interpretation of 
the paragraph but you say that the finding was made 
without your input? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Now, whilst on the issue of 
Mr Essa.  You will recall that on the first occasion that you 
gave evidence, I took you to parts of Mr Bester ’s affidavit.  
20 
We are still going to come back to that. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And he said that he met with you and 
Mr 
Essa 
at 
Melrose Arch 
at 
a 
restaurant 
there 
in 
approximately April 2014 and you, as I recall, you denied 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 29 of 110 
 
that.  Correct? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And as I understand it, your 
evidence before the Commission, and you must correct me 
if I am wrong, is that you only ever met Mr Essa twice. 
MR SINGH:   That is so. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you met him in the context of 
him wanting to meet you to explore potential business 
opportunities and I am talking about Transnet.  You say 
that those meetings might have happened at Melrose Arch 
10 
but that was the sum-total of your meetings with Mr Essa.  
Is that correct? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And as I understand it.  You now in 
evidence content that both was when you were at Transnet 
and Eskom. 
MR SINGH:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You said when you were at Eskom, 
you had no need to work with Mr Essa. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct.   
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So your testimony before this 
Commission is.  You have met this man only twice? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Informally, outside of Transnet? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct.   
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 30 of 110 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So that then brings me to something 
that I did not ask you the last time and that is the 
testimony of Mr Gama.  And you have been provided with 
the relevant extract of his affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   May I interrupt you Mr Myburgh?  Please 
do not forget your question because I do not want to forget 
getting this clarification from Mr Singh.  I do not know 
whether this would have fallen under the Transnet – it may 
have fallen under the Transnet work stream.  Did you deny 
having part – having been part or having attended the 
10 
meeting that Mr Henk Bester testified about, where he 
said, if I recall correctly, you were there and Mr Salim Essa 
was there and he was there.   
 
One, I think he testified about two meetings 
which he had which involved Mr Essa but I think in one of 
them he said you were there but most of the time it was Mr 
Salim Essa who was doing the talking.  But I think in the 
other one he did not include you.  Did you deny having 
been part of any meeting in which Mr Salim Essa was 
present as well as Mr Henk Bester? 
20 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I think for context, I think 
Mr Myburgh at that time had started leading this evidence 
relating to this meeting and I think we then got into the 
first bit of the details of the meeting ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 31 of 110 
 
MR SINGH:   ...which I then denied it ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   ...being present at that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   And then I got into the reasons as to why the 
meeting was potentially – how can I call it – as to why I 
deny the meeting ever happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   And I think at that point in time, we then 
adjourned for the day. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.   
MR SINGH:   So I think we never completely traversed the 
reasons ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   ...as to why I had my denial. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MR SINGH:   But I did deny it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
MR SINGH:   [Indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  With ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...and I was wondering whether when he 
says he met Mr Salim twice, whether that could be one of 
the two times and that is why I wanted to double-check. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, it was not.  You are right.  You 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 32 of 110 
 
denied this.  And perhaps just to refresh everyone’s 
memory.  You have – if you could please go to Transnet 
Bundle 4, Exhibit BB-19.   
MR SINGH:   Just give me one second.  My files... 
[Speaker moves away from microphone – unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you need some assistance there, 
Mr Singh? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, if someone ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay someone will come and assist 
you. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, may I just...   
[Speaker moves away from microphone – unclear] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I think it is in the files... 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, sir.  You are at? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   On page – so you need to go to the 
tab that say BB-19. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then if you could turn to page 45 
of BB-19? 
20 
MR SINGH:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   This is Mr Ester(sic) – Bester ’s, I 
beg your pardon, affidavit.  And this is the meeting that the 
DCJ was asking you about.  I just want to reflect on it. 
“Upon my arrival at Melrose Arch, as I walked 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 33 of 110 
 
towards 
the 
restaurant, 
I 
was 
met 
by 
a 
gentleman who introduced himself as Mr Salim 
Essa. 
He said that he was there to meet with us as 
part of the discussion with Singh and needed 
to see if the restaurant is clean. 
I asked him where Singh was and he said that 
he will call him when he is ready. 
I asked Essa whether he himself works for 
Transnet and he responded that he is doing a 
10 
lot of things or something to the effect that I 
have a lot of businesses. 
He clearly had no intention of answering my 
question in detail. 
I was surprised at the time that as soon as 
Essa called Singh, Singh arrived a few minutes 
later...” 
 
This is the meeting that you denied, is that so? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So you stand then by your testimony 
20 
that you only ever met Mr Essa twice in the circumstances 
that I have described and you have confirmed? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, sir.  Sorry, just a point of 
clarification Mr Chair.  Do you – or Mr Myburgh, do you 
want us to go into the detail as to why this meeting is 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 34 of 110 
 
denied because we did not really finish it now? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I think you have already dealt with 
that but it is my intention to come back to MMP to finish off 
that later.  Now ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  In that event, we must just make 
sure 
that 
he 
gets 
the 
chance 
to 
substantiate 
his 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay.  Mr Singh, perhaps you could 
just deal with that now so it will not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes. 
 
Ja, 
maybe 
– 
ja, 
to 
give 
10 
...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Only for the sake of completeness Mr Chair, 
we can. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Because this is obviously one of the more 
contentious issues in Mr Bester ’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, when I started the last time in terms 
of providing feedback and context in terms of this meeting 
Mr Chair.  As I said, I deny these meetings and I was going 
20 
into the details as to why I deny this meeting.  And it has 
its nexus in the paragraphs that precede that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   And I think it is paragraphs 54 and 55, if I 
recall Mr Chair.  It has been sometime in terms of being 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 35 of 110 
 
able to have dealt with these matters.  But I think the issue 
is, and I have dealt with this in my affidavit, in my 
responding affidavit Mr Chair. 
 
If you look at paragraph 55.  Now you will recall 
Mr Chair, the nexus of this entire process was a company 
called DEC and Mr Reddy and how the DEC and Mr Reddy 
was 
trying 
to 
use 
their 
influences 
to 
engage 
with 
Mr Bester ’s company to be able to become a subcontractor 
to them. 
 
And I think that Mr Bester had testified to the 
10 
fact that it was, you know, they were unscrupulous or 
underhanded mechanics that were happening at the time.  
So notwithstanding that testimony that Mr Bester had given 
prior to that – this Mr Chair, he still seeks out Mr Reddy to 
engage with myself through purportedly resolve some 
unpaid invoices in terms of the project that they had 
undertaken at the time. 
 
And Mr Chair, at that time, Hatch was involved 
in, if I recall correctly, the new multi-product pipeline 
project and this is the pipeline project and Mr Bester is, 
20 
obviously, from the Railroad Division of Hatch.  So 
Mr Chair, in that then – again, I am not understanding how 
Mr Bester gets involved in Rail – I mean in pipeline related 
invoices when he is a Rail - Director of Rail in the Hatch 
environment, but anyway.   
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 36 of 110 
 
 
He then goes on to say that: 
“At 
the 
time 
Craig 
Sumption, 
CFO 
of 
Infrastructure Division of Hatch, now the CEO 
of Hatch Africa, sent numerous emails to Singh 
requesting 
a 
meeting 
to 
discuss 
the 
outstanding invoices without success...” 
 
Mr Chair, then he does not attach any of these 
emails.  I do not have any recollection of these emails in 
terms of a request for discussions from Mr Simmer. 
“There he told me that it was possible for him 
10 
to arrange a meeting as he had very close 
relationships 
with 
Singh 
and 
that 
he 
will 
arrange the meeting.   
Pursuant to my request to Reddy, he called me 
and told me that Singh would meet me – would 
meet us but outside Transnet offices at a 
restaurant at Melrose Arch.   
The meeting was confirmed and Craig Simmer 
from 
Hatch 
Infrastructure 
Division 
and 
Sumption accompanied me to the meeting...” 
20 
 
Mr Chair, what is peculiar about this meeting is 
that Mr Bester does not attached any of these invites of – 
to Mr Simmer or to Mr Sumption, yet if you recall, 
previously he had a very good record of actually providing 
us meeting requests previously in his testimony.   
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 37 of 110 
 
 
Neither does he supply us with the confirmatory 
affidavits of Sumption or Simmer in terms of that.  And 
again, Mr Chair, peculiarly, the date of the meeting, neither 
Simmer nor Sumption arrive.  So it is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat that, please? 
MR SINGH:   I said curiously, on the date of the meeting, 
neither Sumption nor Simmer arrive at the meeting.  So it 
is just ...[indistinct] [00:16:34] that turns up - that arrives 
to purportedly meet with the CFO of Transnet to discuss 
invoices 
that 
are 
outstanding 
on 
which 
he 
has 
no 
10 
background. 
 
So if I had to – if it was not a legitimate meeting 
where he was prepared to come and discuss these 
invoices, Mr Chair, he was going to discuss invoices of 
which he had no understanding or background.  And I am 
saying, Mr Chair, it is highly irregular for a person – well, 
in an organisation such as Hatch to engage with the CFO, 
Group CFO of an organisation like Transnet and sent 
individuals that actually have no background in terms of 
the topic that is going to be discussed. 
20 
 
Secondly, Mr Chair.  What is curious is that: 
“Upon my arrival at the restaurant at Melrose 
Arch... [which is paragraph 57, Mr Chair, on 
page 045] ...I walked towards the restaurant.   
I was met by a gentleman who introduced 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 38 of 110 
 
himself as Mr Essa...”   
 
Now again, Mr Chair.  I am not too sure how 
either Mr Bester or Mr Essa recognises each other because 
at this time Mr Reddy is not there, neither am I there but 
they recognise each other somehow and then obviously the 
discussion ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, it is clear from that sentence that 
Mr Bester, at least it seems to me, is meeting somebody 
that he did not know before.  I get the impression that 
Mr Essa on 
Mr Bester ’s version walked to him and 
10 
introduced himself.  Obviously, he could only do that if he 
thought he was the person he expected to meet there. 
MR SINGH:   But that is the point Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If he had been told how he looks like or 
something like that. 
MR SINGH:   And that is what I am saying.  [Indistinct] 
[00:18:41] by someone that I did not know, I would 
probably ask:  How do you know who I am?  I think.  Which 
Mr Bester fails to explain. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
20 
MR SINGH:   And Mr Chair, lastly.  In terms of these 
issues.  I deny that I was at this meeting.  I also deny the 
fact 
that 
Mr 
Essa 
called 
me. 
 
And 
I 
arrived 
at 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You denied that Mr Essa...? 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 39 of 110 
 
MR SINGH:   That Mr Essa called.  Because it says here, 
in the last sentence of paragraph 57. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
“I was surprised at the time that as soon as 
Essa called, Singh arrived a few minutes 
later...” 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   I have not arrived – I have not received any 
calls from Mr Essa, Mr Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Yes.  Well, in paragraph 58, he 
says that the meeting centred around payments from 
Transnet to Hatch for work that had been performed on the 
MMP and Hatch was supposed to have been paid within 45-
days after submitting invoices to Transnet but he says the 
meeting was superficial because you did not offer any 
insight into the reasons for the late payments of system 
communication 
that 
could 
potentially 
improve 
the 
payments. 
 
And he says he thought you were probably 
20 
disappointed 
with 
the 
meeting. 
 
He 
had 
a 
distinct 
impression that you had hoped that the discussion were 
going centre around Hatch working with Reddy and his 
group, rather, and to resolve Hatch issues of outstanding 
payments. 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 40 of 110 
 
 
He said throughout the meeting, he got the 
impression that Essa was the boss and you were his 
subordinate.   
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I deny the entire contents of this 
paragraph. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Did you know Mr Hatch at all while 
you were at Transnet?  Sorry.  No, no Mr Bester.  Did you 
know Mr Bester at all when you – while – when you were at 
Transnet? 
MR SINGH:   No, Mr Chair.  To the best of my recollection I 
10 
do not think I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So, but you ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Other than ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   This ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Let me qualify that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   Because later on in his affidavit, he does 
mention – I cannot recall if it is later on or it has already 
preceded Mr Chair, but he does mention that there were – 
there was a meeting that happened at Transnet offices. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which you were supposed to attend, 
according to him. 
MR SINGH:   That was an earlier ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...walking up and down the passage. 
MR SINGH:   Yes.  But this was an earlier meeting. 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 41 of 110 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, that is an earlier one. 
MR SINGH:   But I think there is another one that comes 
later on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   Where I think did attend that meeting and 
Mr Bester was part of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   So, if anything, Mr Chair.  I would probably 
have met him at that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
10 
MR SINGH:   And I think then there was – there was a 
cocktail function or something thereafter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   And maybe he was there and maybe I met him 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   So, but prior to that Mr Chair, I would find it 
difficult to understand when I would have engaged with 
Mr Bester. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But on, as I understand it and you must 
20 
tell me if I misunderstand you.  On your version, Mr Henk 
Bester just fabricated this whole idea of this meeting and 
that he had a meeting with you and Mr Salim Essa? 
MR SINGH:   So Mr Chair, on the available facts it is 
clearly a fabrication. 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 42 of 110 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  And why do you think he would 
want to falsely and deliberately put you in a meeting that 
you did not attend? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, the motives of these things, I would 
not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But the two of you never had any 
issues? 
MR SINGH:   No, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay.  Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, thank you.  Perhaps I could just 
10 
take you to a few other paragraphs because there was 
another meeting that Mr Bester had with Mr Essa and that 
you see at paragraph 59 at page 46. 
“Soon after this meeting, I received a call...” 
 
But perhaps before I lose my train of thought.  
Can I ask you this?  Do I understand you know to say - or 
perhaps I could put it differently.  Did you ever receive 
telephone calls or make telephone calls to Mr Essa whilst 
you were at Transnet? 
MR SINGH:   No, sir. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Not a single one? 
MR SINGH:   No, sir not that I recall. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Even around the two meetings that 
you had? 
MR SINGH:   Which two meetings?  Yes. 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 43 of 110 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The two meetings that you have told 
us about. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You did have telephone calls around 
those meetings? 
MR SINGH:   No, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So you had not – you placed not a 
single call to Mr Essa at your time at Transnet and he 
placed not a single call to you? 
MR SINGH:   Not to my recollection. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me put this proposition.  Coming – 
going back to my question to you about this meeting.  What 
would you say to the proposition or a proposition along 
these lines that on your own version Mr Henk Bester had 
no reason to fabricate a story like this against you but 
maybe you might have a reason to deny that a such a 
meeting took place even if it did take place because it 
might associate you with Mr Salim Essa who has lots of 
allegations of corruption against him.  What would you say 
20 
to such a proposition? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I think – again, I would not want to 
speculate, right.  So the proposition that you put, I would 
not want to look at it in the term of speculation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 44 of 110 
 
MR SINGH:   I would rather take you back to what I would 
believe as to be the objective facts ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   ...relating to Mr Bester. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, if you look at ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And those are the ones that you have 
articulated. 
MR SINGH:   No, no I will ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You want to clarify it?  
10 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
MR SINGH:   So if you look at the entire submission of 
Mr Bester.  Mr Bester engages in this – firstly, he engages 
with the issue of Reddy and DEC and then engages with 
Ms Strydom and – what is the gentleman’s name?  Strydom 
and Basson.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Right. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   In the issues relating to DEC and a 
subcontractor.  Now, Strydom, Basson and Bester are fully 
aware that they are not supposed to be doing this yet they 
continued doing it.  Okay?  It then comes to a point where 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 45 of 110 
 
he concludes that Reddy is a less than honourable 
gentleman.  On his version.   
 
He, nonetheless, then still seeks our Reddy’s 
help to resolve this alleged impasse relating to the 
invoices that he wants resolved.  And coincidentally, then 
there 
is 
a 
meeting 
with 
Essa 
that 
has 
happened 
notwithstanding the fact that he then has this, let us say, 
meeting/interaction with Essa.   
 
I think then Mr Myburgh was going to lead to the 
next meeting with Mr Bester and Mr Essa that excluded me.  
10 
Again, I am not too sure whether it was arranged by Reddy 
or not but again he still proceeds with the meeting with 
Mr Essa.  Again, Mr Chair, you then move on.  Now you 
have the extension to the first ...[indistinct] [00:26:55] that 
was issued. 
 
Now you have MMP 2, let us call it that.  And 
again, Mr Chair there is an issue of subcontractors that 
comes up, right?  We still maintain that we require a high-
level of empowerment in the tender.  They understand that 
that is a requirement and they basically know that they 
20 
need to comply with, again ostensible, because of the 
history, let us call it, Phase 1.   
 
They then still, Mr Chair, notwithstanding the 
fact they have already understood the issues with DEC, 
understood the potential relationship that DEC may have 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 46 of 110 
 
with Mr Essa.  Understanding the issues that Mr Essa 
allegedly has of his own.  They have – Hatch themselves 
sits down and have a meeting as to whether they can then 
accept DEC as a subcontractor on Phase 2 and eventually 
accept Hatch as – accepts DEC as a subcontractor.   
 
Now, Mr Chair when you take all of this into 
account, it will probably be looking – it would probably 
seem to me a more plausible outcome for Mr Bester to be 
explaining why Hatch was engaging in this behaviour rather 
than me and in a meeting with Mr Essa. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Thank you.  Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, thank you.  Now just 
incidentally.  The affidavit does read that Mr Simmer and 
Sumption accompanied Mr Bester to this meeting.  That 
you will see at paragraph 56. 
MR SINGH:   Oh, that is correct, sir.  Sorry, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  And in fact, Mr Bester testified 
to 
that. 
 
So 
Mr 
Singh, 
what 
we 
do 
know 
is 
that 
...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   But it does not retract from the fact that we 
20 
do not have confirmatory affidavits, only one of them. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Fair enough.  What we do know, 
Mr Singh, that this is a very important allegation made 
against you. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, sir. 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 47 of 110 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You did not apply to cross-examine 
Mr Bester. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   In fact, you applied – you have not 
applied to cross-examine anyone. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see.  Now let us go to the next 
meeting that Mr Essa had with Mr Bester.  At paragraph 59, 
at page 46: 
“Soon after this meeting, I received a call from 
10 
Reddy informing me that Essa requested a follow-up 
meeting with me in Melrose Arch. 
I informed Craig Sumption of the call and the 
meeting date as set. 
Unfortunately, I cannot remember the date of the 
meeting. 
The meeting was held at JB’s Corner at Melrose 
Arch and in attendance was Essa, Reddy and me...” 
Let me take you to paragraph 61: 
“It was a bizarre meeting.  It appeared to me that 
20 
Essa was a regular in the restaurant as everyone 
seemed to recognise him. 
He, Essa, allowed carrying [word cut] with him and 
during the meeting he received numerous calls 
which 
interrupted 
our 
conversation 
as 
he 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 48 of 110 
 
continuously to take calls.  I became very annoyed 
with this behaviour.” 
Paragraph 62: 
“Essa told me that Hatch must include his company 
(whose name he did not mention at the time) in our 
phase 2 tender submission.  I told him that we had 
already 
finalised 
our 
group 
including 
our 
SD 
partners and that there was no way of now including 
his company in the submission.” 
Paragraph 63: 
10 
“He insisted that we should include his company 
and said that they have a lot of power.  Having 
regard to my previous understood they to be Essa 
and Singh but I could also have included other 
individuals within and outside Transnet that could 
also.  Essa mentioned that “they”, Essa and Singh, 
would increase the contract value after award and 
that we should include about 80 million.  I cannot 
remember the exact value but it was an enormous 
figure as an initial value.  He further indicated that 
20 
the 80 million will increase to something ridiculous 
in the order of 350 million or beyond.  He said that 
the contract value (for in phase 2) would eventually 
increase the over 2 billion.  If I remember correctly 
at the time our submission for rail was valued at 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 49 of 110 
 
approximately 800 million.” 
Now what I want to ask you, is are you able to dispute – do 
you have any knowledge of this second meeting that Bester 
held with Essa? 
MR SINGH:   No, Sir, I did not know. 
MR MYBURGH SC:   And you see here that Mr Essa was 
really trying to muscle in on Hatch was he not, as an SD 
partner. 
MR SINGH:   I would appear so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   For what it is worth, I just mention that 
10 
when Mr Bester makes the allegation that Mr Essa said the 
contract value eventually increased to over R2 billion, it is 
difficult to read that without thinking about the trains which 
– where the value increased drastically.  That crosses my 
mind, that is all I am saying. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, maybe if put your mind at ease, Mr 
Chair, the contract was not awarded for 2 billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, I am not giving any figures but I 
know there was – there are transactions where the values 
increased in a manner that is very unusual.  Yes, Mr 
20 
Myburgh? 
MR MYBURGH SC:   Yes, thank you.  Then perhaps whilst 
we are on this affidavit let me take you to paragraph 75 
because you are correct, Mr Singh, you did – there was a 
time when you met Mr Bester and there is reference in this 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 50 of 110 
 
affidavit to I think it is a cocktail party.  That you find at 
page 51, paragraph 75. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe before you proceed, Mr Myburgh.  
Mr Singh, if this meeting which you said you know nothing 
about takes place, the challenge with your version is that 
Mr Bester say in effect it was a follow up on the previous 
meeting which you say is a fabrication? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so I am just mentioning that there 
is that challenge. 
10 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I do not see the challenge, Mr 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the challenge is this.  If Mr Bester 
is correct that this was a follow up meeting then there must 
have been an earlier meeting then the earlier meeting 
would only the one he is talking about. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if you say it was – if it was not a 
follow up, it was a standalone meeting, that is different. 
MR SINGH:   Well, Mr Chair, I think let us put the earlier 
20 
meeting into context.  When I say I deny the meeting, I 
deny that I attended the meeting.  I would not be in a 
position to deny that the meeting actually happened 
between Mr Bester and Mr Essa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So you deny that you were part of 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 51 of 110 
 
the meeting. 
MR SINGH:   Part of the meeting on the basis of what I 
have suggested. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  You do not deny that there may 
have been a meeting involving them without you. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, I would not be able to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, alright.  But then if that was 
the case then Mr Bester must really have been singling you 
out to just falsely put you in that meeting in a very strange 
way because a meeting took place and you would have 
10 
known who were in that meeting but he brings you in 
knowing that you were not in that meeting.  That would be 
the implication. 
MR SINGH:   Well, Mr Chair, I think in my last response to 
your proposition I outlined possibility as to why Mr Bester 
is taking the approach that he is taking. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   In order to motivate why they actually ended 
up taking BEC as Hatch as a subcontractor where they 
patently knew that it was problematic or there were alleged 
20 
issues with BEC and the alleged relationship that existed 
with Mr Essa and Mr Essa himself in terms of the 
allegations against Mr Essa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, okay.  Mr Myburgh? 
MR MYBURGH SC:   Yes, thank you.  And at paragraph 75, 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 52 of 110 
 
page 51: 
“After negotiations but before the project kicked off 
in early 2015 the senior people of the H2N JV 06.31 
were invited to a meeting with Senack(?) Peter in 
Carlton Centre.  In attendance of on behalf of the 
H2N 
JV 
were 
me, Aligasen 
Naidu, 
CEO 
Mott 
MacDonald and Dempsey Naidoo, CEO of Mott 
MacDonald and an executive of Orecon.  At this 
meeting Singh told us that we were very lucky to 
have been awarded this contract and he will watch 
10 
us very closely.  All directors viewed Singh’s 
comments 
as 
very 
negative 
and 
could 
not 
understand why he was against our appointment.  It 
may have been because we did not include Essa in 
our bid.  After this meeting the H2N JV hosted a 
small 
celebratory 
function 
and 
invited 
senior 
representatives of Transnet such as Singh, Peter, 
Skhosana and Mr Mohammed Mahomedy.  During 
his speech Singh made negative comments about 
the H2N JV and criticised our team before the 
20 
project had even commenced.” 
Do you want to comment on that? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, yes.  I my affidavit, Mr Chair, I go 
to some extent in terms of trying to outline the context 
behind this meeting.  If I take you back to the testimony I 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 53 of 110 
 
led before the Commission, Mr Chair, you will remember 
that I …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, are you talking about an 
affidavit where you are responding to Mr Bester ’s affidavit 
that we are looking at now? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, is it in the bundle, Mr…? 
MR MYBURGH SC:   Yes, I will find it whilst Mr Singh is 
[indistinct – dropping voice] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
10 
MR SINGH:   Thank you, Mr Myburgh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Continue? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, in terms – let me take you back to 
when we actually started the MEP phase 1.  MEP is 
manganese expansion project which is this entire affidavit 
of Mr Bester.  I did say, Mr Chair, at that time it was a 
relatively large project.  I think it was probably one of the 
top five projects in terms of by size in the capital 
expenditure programme of 300 billion which I introduced 
yesterday. 
20 
 
Mr Chair, a project of this size and magnitude does 
and will carry an inordinate amount of risk, an execution 
risk relating to – from time of inception to time of 
completion and Mr Chair, one of the reasons that we as 
Transnet at the time were focusing particularly on let us 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 54 of 110 
 
call it capital expenditure and capital expenditure risks was 
because of the sheer size of the capital expenditure 
programme was 300 billion.   
As I explained yesterday, Mr Chair, the MDS was a 
counter-cyclical investment strategy so it means we were 
actually investing against the demand which increased the 
risk quite significantly for the organisation so you needed 
to have a handle on risks, a real handle on risk.  So given 
the fact that we had history, Mr Chair, of overruns on 
previous locomotive purchases on the NMPP itself, the 
10 
Durban dug-out port, the Transnet entrance wide – sorry, 
not Durban dug-out port, Mr Chair, I think the project was 
called the Durban entrance harbour widening project and 
given the fact that we are now embarking on this 300 
billion programme, one of the stakeholders that were really 
keen on understanding how we were going to manage the 
programme from a risk perspective was the credit rating 
issue. 
The 
next 
stakeholders 
that 
would 
be 
interested 
in 
understanding 
how 
we 
were 
going 
to 
manage 
this 
20 
significant [indistinct – dropping voice] was potentially 
investors that were going to fund Transnet. 
Now we needed to demonstrate firstly that we had 
learnt – or we had learnt our lessons from the past and 
what were we going to do differently in the future.  That 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 55 of 110 
 
would be one way to demonstrate through [indistinct] 11.01  
as well as potential investors that okay, we know what we 
are doing. 
And one of the biggest issues that we encountered 
on the NMPP project or the new multi product pipeline 
project, Mr Chair, and I think I cover it in one of my 
affidavits but the project actually increased from I think it 
was 9 billion to - and I think currently it is sitting at about 
30 billion, if I am not mistaken or 35 billion in terms of 
completion, is that the EPCM contractor is vital and the 
10 
manner in which you engage the EPCM contractor, the way 
you engage with the EPCM contractor, the manner in which 
you manage the EPCM is critical to one, successful 
implementation of the project and when we say successful 
implementation of the project we are talking project on 
time, within budget and within schedule. 
Now the reason why EPCM contractors are so 
critical, Mr Chair, is because they become an extension of 
the organisation.  So Transnet does not – or Eskom does 
not have the personnel who actually sit on the project on a 
20 
day-to-day basis to manage it, so we actually outsource 
that to what we call the EPCM project or the EPCM 
consultant. 
Now Hatch, Mr Chair, was one of those consultants.  
So we are basically taking an MEP project, we are handing 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 56 of 110 
 
it over to Hatch and we are saying Hatch, implement this 
project on our behalf and you have a budget of whatever it 
is, let us 10 million.  So basically we are handing 10 
million over the Hatch, right?   
So the context of this meeting, Mr Chair, was there 
was – in my view there was nothing untoward about it, this 
meeting was basically a meeting to say guys, we have 
dealt with EPCM contractors in the past, we have burnt our 
fingers significantly and we have a live example in the 
NMPP.  We want do things differently on this project, we 
10 
want this project to be a success and we want it to be on 
time, within budget and schedule and that is what your 
actual function is.  And that was the context behind this 
meeting.  There was nothing untoward about it, it would – 
this meeting was, as I said, set up to outline Transnet’s 
expectation 
vis-à-vis 
our 
EPCM 
contractor 
that 
was 
appointed. 
Also, Mr Chair, just to highlight, in terms of - to 
provide context in terms of the award, Hatch could have 
been awarded, any other company could have been 
20 
awarded and this comment of whoever was awarded would 
have had the same meeting because the underlying basis 
for the meeting was to outline our expectations. 
So even it was any other – if it Orecon that was 
appointed, they would have also been said you were lucky 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 57 of 110 
 
to get this because our expectation is not to service us as 
you serviced us in the past, it is completely different.  And, 
Mr Chair, in my – I actually played no role in awarding this, 
so whether it was Hatch, whether it was Orecon, whether it 
was any of the other engineering companies that was 
awarded, it was a product of the process and the 
evaluation process is conducted by the evaluation team. 
So, Mr Chair, that is the context behind this meeting 
and as I said it was really a meeting where we really 
wanted to outline what Transnet’s expectations of our 
10 
EPCM service providers was going forward. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MYBURGH SC:   Well, that is the context but did you 
say these things, that they were lucky to have been 
awarded the contract and did you make – were you critical 
of them? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I do not think I was critical of them, 
I think that is the reason why I spent an inordinate amount 
of time explaining the context for the meeting and the 
context of the meeting was to outline our expectations. 
20 
MR MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  Well, did you say these things, 
did you say they were very lucky? 
MR SINGH:   No. 
MR MYBURGH SC:   DCJ, you asked for the reference to 
the affidavit.  You will recall that Mr Singh has filed a 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 58 of 110 
 
series of affidavits, five different affidavits.  He deals with 
Mr Henk Bester in his first affidavit and that you find in 
bundle 5B at page 445.  I do not intend to take you through 
it, I just simply bring it to the attention of the DCJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MYBURGH SC:   From paragraphs 42 onwards. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, just repeat the page? 
MR MYBURGH SC:   Page 445 through to page 451. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MYBURGH SC:   But these are things that we had gone 
10 
through, Mr Singh, before.  I am not going to re-traverse 
that.   
What I would like to do then is to take you to Mr 
Gama’s evidence.  If I could ask you please to pull out 
EXHIBIT BB28. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I have found it Mr Myburgh, I just 
wanted to know where it is because I might have to just 
read it again. 
MR MYBURGH SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  We go back to bundle 4? 
20 
MR MYBURGH SC:   We are now in a different exhibit, 
EXHIBIT BB28, Mr Gama’s exhibit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In which bundle? 
MR MYBURGH SC:   It is in a different file, your registrar 
will give it to you. 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 59 of 110 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, a different one, ja. 
MR MYBURGH SC:   And could you please turn up page 
48?  Are you there? 
MR SINGH:  Sorry, what page, Sir? 
MR MYBURGH SC:   Page 48. 
MR SINGH:   I am there, Sir. 
MR MYBURGH SC:   Paragraph 31.3.   
“In or during July/August 2015…” 
Says Mr Gama. 
“…I needed to discuss a work-related issue with 
10 
Anoj Singh, the then Chief Financial Officer of 
Transnet.  Singh’s office was in close proximity to 
mine and I walked to his office and observed 
(through a clear glass partition) in boardroom 
together 
with 
Singh. 
 
I 
entered 
the 
office 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Together with Essa. 
MR MYBURGH SC:   Sorry, I beg your pardon, together 
with Essa.   
“I entered the office and had a very brief discussion 
20 
with Singh and as I left Essa indicated to me that 
he was desirous of having a meeting with me.  
Without giving much thought to the request, I 
responded that he could obtain my contact details 
from Singh.” 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 60 of 110 
 
Do you want to comment on that? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Mr Chair.  Mr Chair, I have no 
recollection of this said meeting with Mr Essa and neither 
do I recall Mr Gama ever meeting Mr Essa in my office.  Mr 
Chair, 
you 
would 
have 
regard 
for 
the 
date 
being 
July/August 2015.  If it was August 2015, Mr Chair, I can 
tell you the meeting never happened because I was at 
Eskom at the time, then that only leaves July 2015. 
 
Mr Chair, in terms of July 2015, if the meeting did 
happen and on Mr Gama’s version, Mr Chair, my office is 
10 
constructed in such way that my office is let us say here 
and then there is an atrium and my PA sits in the atrium 
and then there are two – there is two additions individuals 
that sit in an office that is adjoined to the atrium.  So you 
have my office here, you have the atrium and then there 
are two additional offices but they are all part of one 
office, okay? 
 
So, Mr Chair, if this meeting did indeed happen, it 
will be very easy for either Ms Thakhane, who was my PA 
at the time, to confirm whether Mr Essa was indeed in my 
20 
office or Mr Yusuf Mahomed, who would be sitting in that 
additional office or Mr Norman Mabaso, who also occupied 
that office to confirm that this actually happened which I 
categorically deny. 
MR MYBURGH SC:   Just so that I understand your 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 61 of 110 
 
evidence, when you say you have no knowledge or 
recollection, you are not saying you cannot remember, you 
are saying this did not happen, you categorically deny that 
it happened. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
MR MYBURGH SC:   So Mr Gama also just gets it all 
wrong? 
MR SINGH:   Well, Mr Chair, respectfully, I think when Mr 
Gama comes he can explain.  Well, he has already come, 
but …[intervenes] 
10 
MR MYBURGH SC:   Yes, he has already come. 
MR SINGH:   Yes but in my view, Mr Chair, I am telling you 
this meeting did not happened. 
MR MYBURGH SC:   You did not …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Myburgh, continue? 
MR MYBURGH SC:   Ja, sorry, you also did not apply to 
cross-examine Mr Gama.  
MR SINGH:   No, Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you say that he is also just fabricating 
this story of having seen you having a meeting with Mr 
20 
Essa in your office. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And are you able to offer any reason 
why Mr Gama would want to falsely implicate you in a 
meeting with Mr Salim Essa in your office? 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 62 of 110 
 
MR SINGH:   I have no reason, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR MYBURGH SC:   So at this time Mr Gama was the 
Acting GEC of Transnet. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
MR MYBURGH SC:   And you were his CFO? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
MR MYBURGH SC:   Now Mr Gama’s version or evidence 
about the fact that Mr Essa said I am desirous of meeting 
with you and without giving much thought, as he said, you 
10 
responded and said he could obtain my contact details 
from Singh.  That you knew to be Mr Essa’s modus 
operandi, did you not?  He was desirous of meeting you, 
he sought you out and he had meetings with you, correct? 
MR SINGH:   There is two, yes.  One or two, yes. 
MR MYBURGH SC:   So that is how Mr Essa operated? 
MR SINGH:   I would not know, Sir. 
MR MYBURGH SC:   No but I am asking you, is that not 
exactly 
what 
he 
did 
in 
relation 
to 
you, 
he 
knew 
…[intervenes] 
20 
MR SINGH:   As it relates to …[intervenes] 
MR MYBURGH SC:   Just if you bear with me?  He knew 
you to be a high-ranking official at Transnet, seems he 
sought you out, he sought to make contact with you and 
meet with you.  He did that, did he not? 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 63 of 110 
 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
MR MYBURGH SC:   And he then does the same with Mr 
Gama because of course now Mr Gama is a very high-
ranking official, he is acting as the GCE of Transnet, 
correct? 
MR SINGH:   I would hazard to say that Mr Gama was a 
high-ranking official of Transnet for a very long time, other 
than when he was a GCE, he was also the Chief Executive 
of Transnet Freight Rail for a very long time. 
MR MYBURGH SC:   But this is Mr Essa’s modus operandi, 
10 
is it not, to try and make contact – close contact with high-
ranking officials. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, I wanted – or I left 
my learned friend to pursue this point but I really have to 
object at this point in time.  When you put a proposal like 
this to a witness you must have a factual basis on which 
you put the proposal and …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just tell me what proposition? 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   That this is his modus operandi.  
The way that my learned friend is putting it to Mr Singh, he 
20 
is asking him to comment on a factual statement that my 
learned friend is making and I am submitting to you there 
is not a basis for him making such a factual statement 
unless he can direct me where in the bundles he has got it 
under oath and I will then ask forgiveness for having 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 64 of 110 
 
missed it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh? 
MR MYBURGH SC:   Well, the factual basis is what 
happened with Mr Singh and I thought I had made that 
clear.  Perhaps I can re-traverse that ground.  Mr Singh… 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Sir. 
MR MYBURGH SC:   It is your own evidence, as I 
understand, you must correct me if I am wrong, that you 
had two meetings with Mr Essa.  He contacted you.  Your 
evidence is not that you contacted him so on two occasions 
10 
when you were Chief Financial Officer he makes contact 
with you.  He asks for meetings with you and during those 
meetings he, I think you said, explored potential business 
opportunities.  So I am simply putting to you that Mr 
Gama’s version of what Mr Essa said to him accords with 
your interaction with Mr Essa. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, I again object.  
That is not so.  Look at what is stated by Mr Gama. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Ms van den Heever, I am going to 
add to what Mr Myburgh says about Mr Salim Essa’s modus 
20 
operandi, I am going to add something that is not in the 
Transnet 
work 
stream 
because 
I 
happened 
to 
hear 
evidence relating to different work streams, it is something 
that 
happened 
in 
the 
Denel 
work 
stream, 
Mr 
Essa 
…[intervenes] 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 65 of 110 
 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, I just missed 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Essa sought out the CEO of the 
Denel, Mr Saloojee and called him to a meeting at the 
Gupta house and on the evidence that has been led here, 
sought to have Mr Saloojee agree to some businesses 
involving Denel and entities that Mr Salim Essa was 
connected with. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Of 
course, we have no knowledge of that, so… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   So my objection was based on a 
proposal that was put that was nowhere to be found in our 
bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no, that is fine.  Okay. 
MR MYBURGH SC:   Perhaps I could just fast forward.  
What then happened, I do not assume you can dispute this, 
is that Mr Essa then did invite Mr Gama to a meeting.  Can 
you dispute that? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I have no knowledge of this said 
20 
meeting.  
MR MYBURGH SC:   Mr Gama’s version is that that invite 
arose from the interaction in your office. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I testified to the fact that this 
meeting in my office never happened. 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 66 of 110 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, actually, now that Mr Myburgh has 
asked that question, I wanted to say to you when I asked 
you a question about whether Mr – you were saying Mr 
Gama was fabricating all of this about this meeting, I was 
under the wrong impression that he saw you sitting with Mr 
Salim Essa on his version while he was passing, but I see 
that he actually says he did enter your office. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which means he had a proper opportunity  
to see who you were with on his version. 
10 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So as opposed to maybe just passing and 
seeing inside your office through a window or glass or 
something.  So he says he did enter, so which means that 
it is unlikely he would be mistaken about if he saw you with 
somebody that might not have been Salim Essa, if he was 
just passing and saw through a window.  But here he says 
he entered so if his version is true he had enough 
opportunity to see who the person was that you were 
having a meeting with.  Alright, I understand that you say 
20 
no such meeting took place, I just wanted to clarify 
because earlier on I was under the impression that he did 
not enter your office but it is clear from his version that he 
says he did enter.  But you say nothing of that sort 
happened. 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 67 of 110 
 
MR SINGH:   No, Sir.  Sorry, I am saying yes, nothing of 
that sort happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Myburgh? 
MR MYBURGH SC:   Yes and then going back to the 
invitation, Mr Essa does invite him to a meeting, probably 
seen Mr Gama, he gets the address and as things turn out 
it is the Saxonwold compound of the Guptas.  The meeting 
takes place there.  I do not suppose you can dispute that? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I have no personal knowledge of 
this meeting, I am not sure how I can dispute it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please just repeat your answer, it was 
soft. 
MR SINGH:   I said I have no personal knowledge of this 
meeting, so Mr Myburgh wants me to dispute this meeting. 
MR MYBURGH SC:   No ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...to dispute. He wants you to comment 
and say whether that is true or it is not true or what you 
have to say about it.  
MR SINGH:  Well, from what I submit Chair, it is not true 
because the meeting that Mr Gama alleges to have 
20 
happened in my office, did not happen.  So this meeting 
that he alleges that [indistinct – 00:00:19] did the meeting 
in my office would not have happened.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  So ...[intervenes]  
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 68 of 110 
 
MR SINGH:  And Mr Chair, it is interesting to note that that 
paragraph 31.2 which is on page 047, Mr Gama actually 
had his first interaction with Mr Essa at a Regiment’s 
meeting.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I am going to come to that.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So Mr Singh, I do not know if you pick up 
what I pick up here.  the meeting that Mr Gama on his 
version subsequently held, had with Mr Essa either in 
October or November, which he deals with at paragraph 
10 
31.4, is a follow up on the discussion that he says Mr 
Salim Essa had on the day that he had a meeting with you 
in your office, that is Mr Salim Essa and Mr Gama says he 
entered your office and spoke to you briefly and as he was 
leaving, Mr Salim Essa followed him and asked, and said 
he would like to have a meeting with you.  
 
So this is a follow up meeting arising out of that.  
So we spoke earlier on about a follow up meeting that Mr 
Henk Bester talked about with Mr Salim Essa, having had 
on his version a meeting with Mr Salim Essa and yourself.  
20 
So you say you cannot dispute that this October / 
November meeting of Mr Gama and Salim Essa took place, 
but you say definitely the meeting that he talks about, that 
is Mr Gama in your office with Mr Salim Essa, did not take 
place.  
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 69 of 110 
 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, let me put it to you this way.  Mr 
Gama, I think you are correct Mr Chair in terms of summary 
that I deny the meeting that took place in October or 
November, emanated from the meeting that took place in 
my office, and as I said, to confirm whether this meeting in 
my office took place or not, is very easy. 
  
It is a matter of speaking to three individuals.  
Okay.  In terms of the follow up meeting Mr Chair, again it 
is convenient for Mr Gama to say he has met with the 
Gupta 
family 
and 
he 
has 
met 
with 
Mr 
Essa 
and 
10 
conveniently implicate me in terms of the person that 
introduced him to Mr Essa.  
CHAIRPERSON:  No, he does not say that.  He says he 
had met Mr Salim Essa earlier, prior to your, to him seeing 
you with him in your office.  Paragraph 31.2.3, he had met 
him, it was about approximately ten people.  I think it was 
at Regiments. 
 
He had, so he does not have to say you introduced 
him to Salim Essa.  He had met Salim Essa before.   
MR SINGH:  I agree Mr Chair.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm? 
MR SINGH: I see that Mr Chair, and hence I am saying Mr 
Chair, it is convenient as you were pointing out previously 
to say Mr Bester alleges that he had a meeting with you 
and then there is a follow up meeting.  Mr Gama has a 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 70 of 110 
 
meeting where Mr Salim Essa is present and then he has a 
follow up meeting.   
 
I am saying, and this is what I was trying to get to.  
Is that it is very convenient for individuals like Mr Bester 
and Mr Gama, to after the event associate my relationship 
with Mr Essa, on the basis of trying to cover up stuff that 
they have to account for.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I am not sure ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You are not suggesting that Mr Bester 
and Mr Gama came together for, which are stories that 
10 
...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:  No, no, no.  I am not suggesting that Mr Chair.  
What I am suggesting is if you look at the case of Mr 
Bester, I outlined to you the reason why Mr Bester would 
be taking the approach that he is taking, to explain the 
reason why he puts me at a meeting that I was not at.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, you said what you said but one of 
the things you did was you conceded that if I recall 
correctly, that he would not have had a motive to falsely 
implicate you. 
20 
MR SINGH:  No Mr Chair, but beyond that Mr Chair, I then 
went on to say that if you look at the reason why Mr Bester 
may have put me at that meeting, is to conveniently 
explain the reason why [indistinct – 00:05:40] then actually 
ended up being a subcontractor to DSA.  
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 71 of 110 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  And again Mr Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  And where is Mr Gama? 
MR SINGH:  Again Mr Chair, Mr Gama ends up or admits 
going to the Saxon world reason and conveniently it is as a 
result of meeting with me at my office.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, he does not link it to meeting you 
and or meeting with Mr Salim Essa at your office.  But 
anyway, Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Why do you say he conveniently links 
10 
it to you?  What would ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the convenience?   
MR SINGH:  Well Mr Chair, you ... well, as I understand 
what Mr Myburgh and what you are trying to ascertain, is 
this meeting that happened in October flow from the 
meeting that happened in July, August.  So what you are 
trying to say is that this meeting, well what Mr Gama is 
saying is that had this meeting in July not happened, then 
the 15 October / November meeting would not have 
happened.  
20 
 
I am saying it is convenient that you meet someone 
in the office in July and automatically in October then a 
meeting happens that you then attend in Saxon world.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I am not sure that I understand the 
convenience part, but let ... I think we must proceed Mr 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 72 of 110 
 
Myburgh.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you.  So I want to then take 
you to the first time that Mr Gama met Mr Essa.  This is at 
paragraph 31.2.  You have referred to this at page 47.  He 
says that: 
 
“In and during 2015 I attended a meeting with 
representatives of Regiments Capital Pty Ltd 
at 
Transnet’s 
offices. 
 
The 
meeting 
was 
attended by a number of Transnet officials, 
executives 
and 
senior 
consultants, 
10 
representing Regiments as well as consultants 
from McKinsey and company.” 
 
Next sub paragraph: 
 
“Because 
I 
knew 
all 
of 
the 
McKinsey 
consultants, I assumed that the remainder of 
the 
persons 
in 
attendance 
represented 
Regiments.” 
 
Next sub paragraph: 
 
“One of these persons was introduced to me 
as Salim Essa.  I recall that approximately ten 
20 
persons attended the meeting.  Regiments was 
a service provider to Transnet, advising it on 
certain 
transactions 
that 
we 
considered 
entering into.” 
 
Are you able to deny this or dispute this, that Mr 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 73 of 110 
 
Essa was present at your office, at this meeting? 
MR SINGH:  Sorry, at my office? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Transnet’s offices during 2015.  
MR SINGH:  I think Mr Gama would have to define which is 
Transnet’s offices.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  He did in his evidence, he said the 
Carlton Centre.  
MR SINGH:  Okay, that is 50 floors.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I am asking you are you able to 
dispute this? 
10 
MR SINGH:  This is not within my knowledge, I cannot 
dispute it?  I deny that from my recollection, I do not recall 
Mr Essa ever being in Transnet offices.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  That is what I wanted to put to you.  I 
mean on this version Mr Essa came to the offices at the 
Carlton Centre, was it unusual?  You say you never saw 
him. 
MR SINGH:  I have never seen Mr Essa at the Carlton 
Centre.  I think just for the record Mr Chair.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes.  
20 
MR SINGH:  And this is not to create an acrimonious 
relationship with the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
MR SINGH:  I would just like to place on record that we did 
receive a 33 notice for Mr Gama.  
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 74 of 110 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, just repeat that? 
MR SINGH:  I said I just want to place on record that we 
did receive a 33 notice for Mr Gama.  But that was a 
redacted version of the [indistinct – 00:09:46] and it only 
contains paragraph 31.3.   
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
It 
did 
not 
contain 
this 
particular 
paragraph? 
MR SINGH:  We had to request ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR SINGH:  The full affidavit of Mr Gama which was then 
10 
provided.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, oh.   
MR SINGH:  And that comes to the point of Mr Myburgh in 
terms of us wanting to cross-examine.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  Whether we would have or did not, that is 
besides the point.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR SINGH:  The point if I would like to place on record 
that at our request then only were we provided with the full 
20 
affidavit of Mr Gama.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Mr Myburgh?   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes, thank you and do you feel that 
you have been able to answer the questions that I have 
posed to you in relation to those two paragraphs now 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 75 of 110 
 
adequately? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, I think we have covered it 
adequately.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes, you can put that away.  I would 
like to now deal with the FNB account.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we going back to Bundle 5B? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Bundle 5C Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  5C.  I see that we are at quarter to one.  
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes, it is Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But I guess 15 minutes might still be 
used.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I am sure we can use it, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja okay.  Yes.  What is the page on 
the ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Page 1568.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So at 1568 you find an affidavit, a 
short affidavit from Mr Benjamin running to 1572.  You 
20 
have had an opportunity to read this affidavit I take it? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Could I ask you please to go to 
paragraph 6, it is an affidavit of Mr Benjamin.  He is the 
head of the Transnet stream investigation team as you 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 76 of 110 
 
know.  At paragraph 6, he says: 
 
“During November 2018, Fundudzi Forensic 
Services, Fundudzi issued a final forensic 
report commissioned on behalf of national 
treasury style Chapter 3, report relating to 
Eskom investigations.  This report is one of a 
number of reports issued by Fundudzi in terms 
of an appointment by national treasury.” 
 
Then we have the tender number: 
 
“To 
conduct 
forensic 
investigations 
into 
10 
allegations of irregularities, and misconduct at 
Transnet 
and 
Eskom. 
 
As 
part 
of 
the 
commission’s ongoing investigations relating 
to Transnet I reviewed the abovementioned 
Fundudzi 
Chapter 
3 
report, 
specifically 
paragraphs 8.3, 8.4 and 8.6.7 dealing with the 
analysis of an FNB bank account with account 
number 62364926380, the account held by Mr 
Anoj Singh.  Mr Singh, the former group chief 
financial officer of Transnet (July 2012 to July 
20 
2015), and Eskom (August 2015 to January 
2018).  I attach hereto a copy of an extract of 
Findus’s Chapter 3 report as Annexure CB1 
setting 
out 
the 
findings, 
conclusions 
and 
recommendations 
of 
their 
analysis 
of 
the 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 77 of 110 
 
account.  I refer to the relevant Fundudzi 
findings later in this affidavit.” 
 
But perhaps I could take you to this Annexure CB1, 
if I may.  This you find at page 1573 and the relevant part 
for present purposes, you find at paragraph 8.3 which is on 
page 1575.  Then you will see there that there is a heading 
movements in Singh’s FNB bank account number.  It is the 
one ending 308 that Mr Benjamin refers to as the account.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You said 308, you mean 380? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  380, I beg your pardon. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr Benjamin refers to that as the 
account.  8.3.1: 
 
“During the analysis of Singh’s computer hard 
drive, we determined that there were bank 
statements for the period 6 July 2012 to 5 July 
2016 for FNB account number, the one ending 
380 in Singh’s name.  We further determined 
that said bank account was opened at FNB 
Carleton Centre on 5 July 2012 with a cash 
20 
deposit of R200-00.  We analysed the said 
statements, and established the following.” 
And then they deal with transfers in 2012, transfers 
in 2013, transfers in 14, transfers in 15, transfers in 16, 
and then you go to page 1577.  There is a heading the 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 78 of 110 
 
source of credits into Singh’s bank account number, it is 
the one ending 380. 
So from an analysis of Sing’s bank account number 
ending 380 we determined that the description of all the 
credits as reflected as mag tape credit EGR01.  The credit 
[indistinct – 00:16:42] FNB account reflected above include 
what appears to be his monthly salaries from Transnet and 
Eskom.  
Credits further reflected large sums of money 
whose 
sources 
are 
unknown 
and 
suspicious. 
 
We 
10 
determined that the reference ending 136 is reflected in 
both Singh’s Absa account number and FNB account.  
Etcetera, and if I could then take you to the conclusion at 
page 1579, at paragraph 8.6.8 there is reference there to 
the fact that Singh indicated in his responses that all funds 
received in his bank account were received in view of his 
employment at Transnet and or Eskom.  
Then paragraph 8.6.10: 
“Singh may have received funds from other 
sources to service his personal lifestyle as 
20 
there were minimal transactions in his bank 
account.” 
Now can I just ask you to comment on paragraph 
8.6.8?  My understanding and from what I have read is that 
you were asked to comment on an earlier draft of this 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 79 of 110 
 
report in this regard, in relation to this account.  Is that 
correct?   
MR SINGH:  That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And it seems from paragraph 8.6.8 
that the question was asked of you as to what the source 
of the funds in this account were.  
MR SINGH:  That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And that your answer was, it is 
effectively your remuneration from Transnet and or Eskom.  
MR SINGH:  That is correct.  
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  If I could take you back then to Mr 
Benjamin’s affidavit.  At paragraph 7 at page 1569 he 
introduced the extract from the Fundudzi report which we 
have dealt with and then at paragraph 8, he says: 
 
“I was subsequently tasked by the commission 
to conduct an independent analysis of the 
account.” 
 
Under 
the 
heading 
procedures 
performed, 
paragraph 9: 
 
“I 
established 
that 
the 
commission 
have 
20 
summonsed 
Mr 
Singh’s 
bank 
accounts 
including the abovementioned account during 
May 2019.” 
 
Paragraph 10: 
 
“I was provided access to Mr Singh’s bank 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 80 of 110 
 
statements for the account by the commission 
on 26 March 2021.  Copies of the bank 
statements for the account is attached hereto 
as Annexure CB2.” 
 
As you would have seen, they run from page 1580 
all the way through to page 1712.  Would you confirm that?  
1580 to 1712.   
MR SINGH:  1712, that is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Then at paragraph 11: 
 
“I obtained a spreadsheet of Mr Singh’s net 
10 
salary payments from the HR department at 
Transnet 
for 
the 
period 
August 
2010 
to 
November 2015.  See Annexure CB3 attached.” 
 
Now 
that 
attachment 
you 
find 
at 
page 
1713 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  1573?   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  1713.   
CHAIRPERSON:  1713.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You see that Mr Singh? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct.  
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Perhaps you can just keep your 
finger there and then go back to page 1570 and pick up at 
paragraph 12: 
 
“I analysed all the transactions reflected in the 
account on an Excel spreadsheet, on the 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 81 of 110 
 
opening date 5 July 2012, to the closing date 4 
December 2016.” 
 
And he refers to his spreadsheet as CB4.  Now that 
you find at page 1714 through to page 1718.  You see that?   
MR SINGH:  That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Then you can keep your finger there, 
going back to paragraph 13 at 1570: 
 
“I compared the deposits made into 
the account Annexure CB4, to the 
schedule of net remuneration paid by 
10 
Transnet. 
 
I 
compared 
my 
observations, 
based 
on 
my 
independent analysis to the findings in 
the Fundudzi Chapter 3 Eskom report.” 
 
Then under the heading over the page comparison 
independent analysis to findings in Fundudzi report, 15: 
 
“I concur with Findus’s finding in paragraph 
8.6.7 of their report, that the bank balance in 
the account accumulated to 19 million.” 
 
16: 
20 
 
“The balance peaked at R19 884 811-32 in 
October 2015.” 
 
You agree with that? 
MR SINGH:  Should I have reference to this? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Sorry? 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 82 of 110 
 
MR SINGH:  Should I have reference to this? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You go to page 1716 of the 
spreadsheet, at the bottom, number 41.  This is taken from 
the October statement and you will see over the page that 
the balance reflected in bold. 
MR SINGH:  That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Is the R19 884 811-32.  You see 
that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  You said page 1716? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So 1716, you go to item 41, BCJ at 
10 
the bottom.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  That is dealing with, it is taken from 
the October 15 statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And if you go over the page still 
dealing with October 15, you will see on the right hand 
side in bold highlighted.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  There is the number, the 19 million 
20 
that we are speaking of.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Would you confirm that Mr Singh?   
MR SINGH:  I confirm that.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Then if you go back to paragraph 17, 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 83 of 110 
 
at page 1571: 
 
“I concur ...” 
 
Says Mr Benjamin: 
 
“With Findus’s finding in paragraph 8.3.20 that 
Mr Singh did not utilise his salary for the 
period July 2012 to July 2015.” 
 
That is Transnet time.  He goes on to say, 
paragraph 18 and the two paragraphs should be read 
together: 
 
“The total debits during the aforementioned 
10 
period which is July 2012 to July 2015, 
amounted 
to 
R594 596-00 
of 
which 
four 
hundred and fifty thousand was a transfer to 
an Absa account and the remaining R144 596-
00 related to cash withdrawals and point of 
sales transactions over the 37 months period.” 
 
Are you in a position to confirm that or would you 
need to look at the documents more? 
MR SINGH:  I think for now we will take it on face value 
and agree.  
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Paragraph 19.  In paragraph 20.4.2 
Fundudzi states that: 
 
“The credits into the account included what 
appears to be monthly salaries from Transnet 
and Eskom.” 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 84 of 110 
 
 
Paragraph 20: 
 
“This is incorrect.  The credits relate only to 
Mr 
Singh’s 
remuneration 
payments 
from 
Transnet.” 
 
Would you confirm that? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Paragraph 21: 
 
“In paragraph 8.4.2 Fundudzi states that the 
credits further affected large sums of money 
whose sources are unknown and suspicious.” 
10 
 
Paragraph 22 Mr Benjamin says: 
 
“This is incorrect.  There are no suspicious 
credits into the account.  All deposits relate to 
remuneration received from Transnet.” 
 
I take it you would confirm that.  
MR SINGH:  Correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then the last paragraph which 
brings us to the stroke of lunch time, coincidentally, 
paragraph 23: 
 
“I note that despite the accumulated amount of 
20 
19 million etcetera, Mr Singh did not earn any 
interest on the account.” 
 
Would you confirm that? 
MR SINGH:  I will take it at face value at this stage sir.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Chairperson, it is now one o’clock.  If 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 85 of 110 
 
this is a convenient time? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, let us take the lunch adjournment 
and we will resume at two.  We adjourn.   
HEARING ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let’s continue. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  Mr Singh could I just 
ask you please to go to page 1716 of Bundle 5C. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry 1? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   1716. 
10 
MR SINGH:   I’m there sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Are you there, alright, I just wanted 
to confirm with reference to the shading, I think you’ve 
given evidence previously that – and you must correct me 
if I am wrong, that when you were seconded to Eskom you 
were still paid for a time by Transnet, is my recollection 
correct? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Do you want to keep your mask on 
or is it by mistake? 
20 
MR SINGH:   Thank you. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So at item 38 on the left hand side 
there we see in shading your July salary, Transnet, then 
you were at Transnet? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 86 of 110 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then we see a Transnet salary in 
August and September, but in those months you had been 
seconded to Eskom. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then you also see in October it 
seems what happened is that you were then paid out 
Transnet LTI’s, I take it that’s long term incentives on a 
proportionate basis. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you were also then paid some 
10 
leave. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Which then takes us to the balance 
that we had spoken about before.  DCJ I need to point out 
to you that there are some corrections that need to be 
made at page 1718. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You will see that if you look at 1717 
right at the bottom, number 57, there a schedule is dealing 
with February 2017, when you go to 1718 and you pick up 
20 
at March it reflects March 2016, so those years in that 
column should actually be 17. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC  And then the other correction that 
needs to be made is that when you get right to the bottom, 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 87 of 110 
 
and it refers to Transfer Money Market that first account 
there ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I just want to make sure that 
I correct this. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  DCJ I have asked Mr Benjamin to 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
To 
prepare 
a 
supplementary 
or 
replacement ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   He will prepare a supplementary 
affidavit and there will be a replacement page. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that’s fine. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  None of this is particularly material 
for present purposes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then under the heading transfer 
money account ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   On ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   1718 at the bottom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The first of those accounts there 
20 
ends 398 that actually is an incorrect account number, it 
should be an account number ending 607. 
CHAIRPERSON:   607? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, and those fours that you see 
under the heading transfer money account it just needs to 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 88 of 110 
 
be clarified that that is actually the 4 t h of December. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So that should be 4/7. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So what we have here really in 
summary Mr Singh is that in three years or three months or 
so we see an accumulation of about R19million in salary – 
let me call it remuneration, it is not just salary it is also 
incentives and the like and we see outflows of just of 
R700 000, that’s all in those three years and three months, 
10 
so the question that I just want to discuss with you is how 
is that you were funding your day to day expenses and 
your lifestyle during these three years, three years and 
three months? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair at this point Mr Chair the 
discussions that we had with the Chairperson yesterday as 
well as Mr Myburgh and the investigation team obviously 
we have now understood that the team and the Commission 
has access to a number of my bank statements, not only 
this bank statement, and Mr Chair it is concerning for me 
20 
to be requested to answer this question, given the fact that 
you have access to these other bank statements, because 
these other bank statements would reflect the fact that my 
lifestyle was funded from those bank statements, as I 
testified yesterday.   
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 89 of 110 
 
 
The debit orders, credit cards, groceries, electricity, 
water, all my normal expenses would have come off those 
accounts. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, that I understand, but how did 
you pay for them?   Because on the face you weren’t using 
your salary – your remuneration, let me use that lauded 
term, that is really the question I am asking you.  I mean 
obviously you must have like everyone had accounts and 
debit orders and the like.  The question really goes to how 
were you funding that ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   In other words what was the source of 
the money you used to incorporate those other accounts 
from which you were funding your living expenses and the 
like. 
MR SINGH:  Well again Mr Chair it is again concerning that 
having analysed this account in detail that you have, 
having access to the bank statements that we know you 
have that the Commission doesn’t have an answer to that 
question and again Mr Chair the answer to that question 
...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Does that mean you are not going to 
give the answer or what? 
MR SINGH:   No Mr Chair, it goes to the point of the fact 
that the Commission has these documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 90 of 110 
 
MR SINGH:   You have conducted an analysis of this 
account the bank statements that you have indicates that 
as I said to you the lifestyle was funded through those 
bank accounts.   Those bank accounts also reflect salary 
payments, long-term incentives from funds there, and this 
is why I am saying it is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So are you saying your remuneration 
from Transnet didn’t come through one account it went 
through it went into different bank accounts, are you saying 
that the remuneration from Transnet that we see reflected 
10 
in this bank account over that period doesn’t give the true 
picture of the money you were getting from Transnet?    
MR SINGH:   No Mr Chair I have been employed by 
Transnet for over ten years. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Or 12 I think, 12 years by the time I left. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   So for the period from the time I actually I 
think came to Johannesburg in 2003 my salary from 
Transnet were going into a bank account, so that’s the 
20 
source of the funds that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And so the funds that you say you used 
to finance you living expenses and your lifestyle during the 
three years that we are talking about, you say that came 
from your remuneration from Transnet but not from the 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 91 of 110 
 
remuneration during those three years but from prior years. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay so does that mean in the years 
prior to these three years you didn’t – you had enough to 
spend during those years and have a lot of reserves and 
savings or what? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct Mr Chair, I mean if you look at 
this bank statement itself Mr Chair it is testament to the 
fact that I had a saving culture, so similarly Mr Chair the 
Commission had the opportunity to analyse the bank 
10 
statements that are in their possession for a period of 
time, you would have come to a very quick conclusion that 
the money that was in those accounts emanated from 
Transnet, Transnet alone. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So in short generally speaking the 
money that went into those other accounts that you are 
talking about was also money from Transnet, it was your 
remuneration it is just that you saved a lot of money during 
those years and you were able during these three years 
when you didn’t touch the salary that came in during those 
20 
three years, you were able to use whatever money you had 
accumulated over those prior years? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So in short you drew from your 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 92 of 110 
 
savings? 
MR SINGH:   Sorry sir? 
ADV MYBURGH SC   You drew from your savings in these 
years? 
MR SINGH:   In these years in question?   
ADV MYBURGH SC   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC   Alright, and just so that you – that I 
understand it you say all of these other accounts will 
reflect only deposits of remuneration from Transnet, no 
10 
other income? 
MR SINGH:   Well Mr Chair you know you’re talking about 
accounts that go back quite a few  years, I am not exactly 
sure if there are credits that emanate from other sources, 
but certainly the majority of the credits that would emanate 
from 
those 
accounts 
would 
certainly 
be 
from 
my 
employment accounts. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you are saying you can’t be sure 
whether if somebody were to go through the whatever 
monies came in, into those accounts, you can’t be sure 
20 
that there won’t be money that came from somewhere else 
other than Transnet, here and there but mainly it was 
Transnet and it was there anything that came from 
somewhere else it might be a very small percentage? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair maybe let me answer to you this 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 93 of 110 
 
way. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   I think with the exactness of my responses 
that the Commission requires it is difficult for me to 
categorically 
state 
that 
everything 
single 
credit 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, yes, ja. 
MR SINGH:   In all of my bank statements emanated from 
remuneration from Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
10 
MR SINGH:  But what I can say to you Mr Chair is that as 
you said the majority of that if not 99% of them probably 
emanated from Transnet.  There would have been some I 
would assume SARS credits, some SARS refunds, some 
medical aid refunds if I recall, probably interest and also 
Mr Chair it depends on the type of account it would have 
been.  If it was a – how can I call it, if it was Money Market 
account or an investment account there would have been 
you know dividends or something that accrued relating to 
the type of investment. 
20 
 
So Mr Chair but again as I said the analysis was 
done on this account, so the analysis to be done on the 
other accounts will be just as easy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  That’s not, it is not quite as simple as 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 94 of 110 
 
you say because we have been asked as you know to 
produce the summonses in relation to your bank account 
records and in the process of trying to put that together we 
have come to learn that you had many, many bank 
accounts, I mean do I understand correctly that you might 
have had as many as 12 FNB accounts? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair I am not too sure the period over 
which this is, but again depending on whether you had a 
credit card or a debit card or a savings accounts or a 
garage card or a money market account or an I don’t know, 
10 
let’s call it, I don’t know what other accounts they would 
have had, if they allocated different account numbers to it 
then ja you would have had more than one account 
number. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But then you also had multiple 
accounts 
at 
Investec, 
multiple 
accounts 
at 
Capitec, 
multiple accounts at Standard Bank and multiple accounts 
at ABSA. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair again as I have mentioned if you 
have a garage card with ABSA it is an account, if you have 
20 
a First Card with ABSA it is an account, if you have a debit 
card it would have a certain account, so it seems that that 
is how the banks operate, so if I had those accounts then I 
had those accounts. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:      And so as I understand what you 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 95 of 110 
 
are saying is that the Commission can to and analyse all of 
those accounts and then work out how you were funding 
your living expenses but which of these accounts did you 
actually use as a current account, because you weren’t 
using this as a current account.  Which of your bank 
accounts did you use as a functioning day to day current 
account, debit orders for medical aid, bonds, whatever it 
is? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair that would either be the – well it 
would be the ABSA account and it would also be the 
10 
Standard Bank. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the last one? 
MR SINGH:   The Standard Bank. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The ABSA and Standard Bank 
current accounts. 
MR SINGH:   Ja.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright. 
MR SINGH:   The predominant credit card that I used Mr 
Chair was probably the Investec one. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sorry? 
MR SINGH:   I said the predominant credit card that I 
utilised was the Investec one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The Investec account ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I mean when you say ...[intervenes]  
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 96 of 110 
 
MR SINGH:   Sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:   The Investec account? 
MR SINGH:  The credit card. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Credit card, Investec credit card, that is 
the one you predominantly used? 
MR SINGH:   If I could recall Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   Let me take this chance to just 
confirm something.  The payments that you would have 
made to Travel Excellence for your trips, do you remember 
when you were giving evidence under the Exco Eskom work 
10 
stream, you said sometimes you paid by cash, sometimes I 
think EFT and sometimes you used ebucks but which of the 
accounts would you have normally used for those payments 
and for trips? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair I wouldn’t recall offhand right now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You wouldn’t recall, but if you were 
predominantly using the Investec Credit Card there might 
be a good chance that maybe that is where one could look, 
you remember we said we need to look at the bank 
statements and bank record and see ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair recently I would recall that I used 
the Investec credit card. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The Investec credit card. 
MR SINGH:   Credit card, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright.    
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 97 of 110 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You say recently? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But we’re talking about 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh yes, yes.  I thought you said you 
recently recalled that you would have used it.  
MR SINGH:   No, no sir the period that I haven’t gone into 
trying to find records because as I said we don’t have 
access to those records. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja 2014/2015.   Okay, but if one could 
look at your Investec Credit Card and look at the ABSA 
10 
account and FNB, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And the we can find the payments to 
Travel Excellence. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair as I said I don’t recall how and 
when these payments were made, but I would recall that I 
probably did some internet payments and some credit card 
payments but they were predominantly case. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   They were predominantly cash?  
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say they were predominantly 
case the payments? 
MR SINGH   Based on our testimony we had given 
previously yes sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, so there would have been few 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 98 of 110 
 
EFT payments? 
MR SINGH:  If I recall Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay so most were cash? 
MR SINGH:   Yes sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I had not understood your 
evidence like that before, so most were cash and there 
might have been a few that were EFT. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And those that were EFT would either be 
ABSA or Investec account. 
10 
MR SINGH:   Probably Mr Chair but I cannot confirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You see Mr Singh my recollection of 
your evidence when Mr Seleka was questioning you in 
relation to those payments that your evidence was the 
other way round, that you said look occasionally you would 
pay in cash but you explained that you would use a variety 
of different means.  Can we take it now that you’re settling 
on that usually you paid in cash? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair I don’t ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Chairperson I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
I 
think 
not 
usually 
Mr 
Myburgh, 
predominantly, or mostly, mostly, ja. 
MR SINGH:   So what is the proposition that you are 
putting? 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 99 of 110 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, he is asking whether we can take it 
that – he says he understood your evidence when you were 
being questioned by Mr Seleka to be that usually or most 
of the time the payments were in cash but there were 
sometimes when it was through other means, but he is 
saying as he understands you now you are saying – he was 
saying usually, and I was correcting, as you are saying 
most of the time it was cash, that is what you are saying, 
that is what you said, so he was wanting to confirm that he 
understands you correctly. 
10 
MR SINGH:  That is correct Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So predominantly cash.  So the other 
thing I wanted to ask you is this is as these bank 
statements show this was not an interest bearing account, 
you didn’t receive any interest? 
MR SINGH:   Yes that is correct Mr Chair. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And in fact what it shows is that 
there was a time when you transferred out, this is in 2016, 
I think it is R16million into two money market accounts, 
20 
that you see if you would like to look at page 1717, line 
item 15, you see there was a transfer of one million and 
five million into account 608, that is R6million, and then 
there was a transfer of one million and nine million and ten 
million into the Money Market account ending in 607, do 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 100 of 110 
 
you see that? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And I can take you to those 
statements but once you made those transfers on a 
monthly 
basis 
you 
were 
getting 
almost 
R100 000 
in 
interest. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Why did you not put these proceeds 
or the inflow into an interest bearing account, I mean this 
is a huge amount of money, when you did that you made 
10 
R100 000 a month. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair in dealing with this question Mr 
Chair is it possible to just take a two minute recess to 
consult? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I have no objection. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, we will take a let’s say five 
minutes adjournment. 
MR SINGH:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn.

INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let’s continue.  Your mic Mr 
Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Are you in a position to answer my q 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 101 of 110 
 
question.  
MR SINGH:   Can you just repeat the question.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The question was why didn’t you put 
the money into an interest bearing account? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair at the time I had personal reasons 
to need – to have access to these funds. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why would that preclude you from 
putting it in an interest bearing account.  I can understand 
if you say they earned little interest because they were in 
an account that pay you little interest because if you 
10 
wanted to get a high interest rate you would have had to 
put the away for a long time without having access to 
them, but I don’t understand when you use that to say put 
them where you wouldn’t earn any interest at all. 
MR SINGH:   Yes Mr Chair I think when we say that the 
accounts, this was a cheque account if I am not mistaken 
Mr Chair and so the interest on this account would have 
been very relatively low if I recall, I am just trying to check 
if it actually discloses interest, so Mr Chair as I have 
indicated there was a need for me to maintain this account 
20 
to have liquidity and at some point I was approached by 
the private banker at First National Bank who suggested 
that there is probably a better way to still have access to 
the funding and having liquidity and still earn interest, and 
that is the point in time when I then agreed to open up 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 102 of 110 
 
these Money Market account, which then resulted in the 
earning of interest. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, when you say the interest rate 
was relatively low there was no interest in these accounts, 
unless you have a better sense of them than me, but let me 
just take you – and you must correct me if I am wrong.  
Let’s go to the first one, 1580. 
MR SINGH:  No, no Mr Chair I concede because I have 
looked at the bank statement.  
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It wasn’t a matter of being relatively 
low, the interest was zero. 
MR SINGH:   I know, I have seen that.  And I guess Mr 
Chair that is what prompted the private banker at FNB to 
suggest the opening of the Money Market. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Singh you were chief financial 
officer of Eskom, of Transnet, I beg your pardon, and you 
needed a private banker to tell you that ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:    Chairperson is that a question 
or is it a statement, or what is my learned friend trying to 
20 
do? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well Mr Myburgh is quite entitled to put 
what he is putting to Mr Singh, what do you say about that 
Mr Singh?   But you – you are so highly qualified in finance 
how  could you have to wait to e advised by a private 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 103 of 110 
 
banker to put your money into an interest bearing account. 
MR SINGH:   No Mr Chair as I have said I needed to 
reference the bank account to actually see whether interest 
was actually earned on this account or not and I have – it 
was my impression that it was relatively interest that I was 
earning but in actual fact I was actually earning no 
interest.  So Mr Chair would be my reason. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I am not sure that I understand that 
answer Mr Singh because I understood you earlier on to be 
saying the reason why you were quite content, and I know I 
10 
am using my own words now, you were quite content to 
have such large amounts to remain in an account that 
didn’t give you interest was because you needed to have 
access to these funds.   Now that is an answer of 
somebody who was aware that he was not getting interest 
in these accounts, but for certain reasons was – had no 
problem with that because of whatever reasons he had, but 
if you had – if you knew that the account, if your 
impression was that the account was giving you a low 
interest as opposed to zero interest then when Mr Myburgh 
20 
said to you why did you keep such large amounts in an 
account that didn’t give you any interest your answer 
wasn’t going to be that because I wanted to have access to 
the money, your answer would have been no, no, no, these 
accounts did give me interest but it was a low interest, but 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 104 of 110 
 
it is not correct to say it did not give me interest, that 
would have been  your answer.   
 
What do you say to that? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair I think your proposition is properly 
well stated, I should have said if I understood that the 
interest was a relatively low interest bearing I should have 
said my recollection was that the interest was relatively 
low rather than agreeing to the fact that there was no 
interest bearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh? 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Singh perhaps I can just ask you 
this, and you are much better versed in this than I am at 
the moment, but just as a typical man in the street really 
isn’t it general knowledge that a current account would 
bear much lower interest, an ordinary current account, than 
any investment account, than a Money Market account? 
MR SINGH:   That is why I had the perception that this 
account was a relatively low interest bearing account 
compared to the Money Market. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, but that is really I think the DCJ 
20 
is getting at, on your own version you thought it was low, 
we said it was zero, you say you didn’t know that for some 
reason, but if you knew you were in a current account you 
didn’t need to know the interest rate, why didn’t you move 
the money into a Money Market account? 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 105 of 110 
 
MR SINGH:   But that is the reason Mr Chair I was happy 
to forego the interest that I thought I was earning, which I 
was not earning ostensibly now, because I needed liquidity 
regarding cash.   So in my case, because I needed liquidity 
I was saying okay I am happy to forego the interest that I 
would get on a more longer term investment vis-a-vis the 
fact that I needed the money, or access to it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I am not sure I understand why you 
would forego liquidity if you put it into an ordinary savings 
account for example. 
10 
MR SINGH:   Well Mr Chair that was the decision I made at 
the time, and it is what I did at the time. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Singh I am just going to ask you 
one thing, I mean did you pay less or more attention to 
your personal financial affairs than you did the affairs of 
Transnet? 
MR SINGH:   As I told Mr Chair I actually probably paid 
more attention to the affairs of my professional work than 
my own.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well let me ask this question, as I 
understand your evidence you, and you say you needed 
liquidity, that is why you kept these large amounts in an 
account that didn’t give you interest, you mean you wanted 
to be able to draw cash from it or use it if and when you 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 106 of 110 
 
had a need?  
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And did you think you were going to 
have a need for millions? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair in this case as I explained – I say in 
this case, as I explained originally, that the need to have 
this quantum of ...[indistinct] was for a private and 
confidential reason ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Chairperson if we go off line and 
we go in camera I am sure my client will at that stage 
10 
disclose it, right now he doesn’t want to disclose his 
private business for all and sundry to hear. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, not that is fine. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   There is nothing nefarious or 
strange about it, there is a very legitimate reason for it, 
but if you insist we can go in camera and he can tell you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No Ms van den Heever, no please. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   But what I am saying 
Chairperson 
we 
can 
disclose 
it 
to 
the 
Commission 
...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I heard you.  And Mr Singh is equally 
able to say exactly that, and I think in a way he had begun 
to say something, okay, so you are saying there is a 
reason which made it necessary for you to have cash of 
that size, of millions of rands, ready should you need it? 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 107 of 110 
 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is a reason that you would 
rather disclose not publically. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Myburgh?  I believe that Mr 
Myburgh if you want to take ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I am  happy for that to be done 
privately, you would be of a much better sense DCJ of how 
we should go about doing that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Whether we go offline, whether Mr 
Singh should put in an affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   We are in your hands. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think maybe we should do that, he 
should put that in an affidavit and because I think we won’t 
finish with him today. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then I can see that and then we can 
then take it from there.  Okay.   
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Perfect. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright, you will do that Mr Singh? 
MR SINGH:   That is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, Mr Singh I now want to go 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 108 of 110 
 
back to where I started briefly yesterday.   You will 
remember that I said to you ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe just to make sure there is no 
misunderstanding I am not ruling that whatever information 
Mr Singh will give in that affidavit will not be disclosed, but 
I am simply saying initially let me have a look at it without 
it being made public then we can take it from there, okay. 
MR SINGH:   Understood Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you DCJ.  So I said that 
10 
before I deal with the transaction advisors and appointment 
of consultants ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Sorry Mr Chair, is it possible to ask for a 
short recess Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Ten minutes? 
MR SINGH:   That is more than sufficient Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright, let’s take ten minutes 
adjournment. 
 
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise.

INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   I understand that counsel for Mr Singh 
would like to request that we adjourn for the day. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   We wanted to ask if possible at 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 109 of 110 
 
this point to adjourn, we have explained to Chairperson in 
chambers what is the reason, I do not think it is necessary 
to publically broadcast it, I hope you understand the 
reasons and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but I think without going into 
details, it is related to Mr Singh’s health, I think that 
...[intervenes]  
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Put simply. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is my understanding, you confirm, 
ja.   Mr Myburgh? 
10 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
We 
have 
nothing 
to 
add 
Chairperson, we accept that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, we are going to then adjourn 
because of health related reasons to Mr Singh and another 
date will be arranged.   It is just important that we say 
something because the public knows that we don’t have 
time so we cannot be seen to be not using time that is 
available for no valid reason, so – okay we are going to 
adjourn, another date will be determined for Mr Singh to 
continue with his evidence, so we will adjourn for the day, 
20 
and 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
the 
public 
on 
Monday 
the 
Commission will hear the evidence of Mr Gama, Siyabonga 
Gama under the Transnet work stream during the day and 
in the evening Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   In the evening we first will have Mr 
23 APRIL 2021 – DAY 381 
 
Page 110 of 110 
 
Gigaba’s application in relation to Ms Gigaba’s evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then obviously subject to what 
you may or may not rule Ms Gigaba might give evidence 
after that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   After that ja, okay, alright.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 26 APRIL 2021
