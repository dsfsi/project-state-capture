ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes before I ask you to confirm the correctness of this 
document I want you to check if there are any corrections that you would like make on 
this documents? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes there is two corrections we 
would like make. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Please go ahead. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  I would just like to take you to the 
page numbers or the paragraph numbers.  The first one is a grammatical error that we 
would like to fix.  It is on paragraph 19.  It is on page … 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  It is on page MJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 5. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes 5 Chair. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Page 5 I just want to quickly get 
there.  We need to delete a component there that I just would like to say is we need to 
say we need to delete the an.  So the sentence should read:  Whereas prior to 2011 
significant effort was made, the 2011 board was highly successfully in its endeavours.  
So we delete the and, and insert a comma there.  Then I would like to also take you… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just hang on one second.   
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  On paragraph 19 Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  We need to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I have got it.  I am just looking at the sense after the correction.  
You do not want to say what the significant effort was about? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Chair I will deal with it in the rest of 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 8 of 126 
 
the paragraphs that is coming below that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes continue. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  And then… 
CHAIRPERSON:  The I would have put and something else besides something but it is 
okay it is your statement. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Thank you Chair.  Then on 
Annexure MJVR5 which is on pages 52 to 53 to notes the changes… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Was that the only correction you wanted to make on the 
10 
statement?  
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  On the statement itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As such? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And now you are going into annexures?  Okay what page? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes.  Page 52. 
CHAIRPERSON:  32? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  52. 
CHAIRPERSON:  52? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes.  Chair the document that was 
20 
originally submitted in the documents was marked Company Confidential so the best 
way to approach it was to actually make extracts from the document that is also public 
information and so we have – withdrawing the attachment to this covering letter itself 
and then put in 4 diagrams A, B, C, D and E so it is 5 diagrams from 52.2 to 53.6. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us make sure first that we are on the same page.  Page 52 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 9 of 126 
 
says Annexure MJVR5. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes.  Page 53 what… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then there is 52.1 up to 53.6 right is there something we should 
do in that document.   
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Chair I will refer in my statement to 
these documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  And so that is why I just need to 
highlight that we have withdrawn the written document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Because there was information 
including there that is company confidential. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  I can make the document available 
to the commission should you wish that the full document is made available. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  But the relevant information will be 
talked about in reference to these diagrams that has been attached. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so you are not asking us to make any correction of this 
document as such? 
20 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  This document itself but the 
bundles. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say – you say there – there is part of this document that is 
not included here. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes. 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 10 of 126 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  About which you will testify? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair.  Chair if I may be of assistance 
paragraph 29 is the relevant paragraph dealing with this particular annexure. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and Ms Van Rensburg would you please also deal with 
Annexure 7 which is on page 56. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Okay.  Annexure 7… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Ms Buthelezi you have just called her Ms Van Rensburg and I 
10 
want to confirm whether it is Janse Van Rensburg that is the whole – that is the 
surname or only Van Rensburg is the surname? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Chair just to note. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I get confused sometimes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  My long surname has created lots 
of challenges before so that is why a lot of people just refer to me as Martie.  But it is 
actually my married surname if Janse Van Rensburg. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is – okay. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  But you can refer to me as Marie, 
Ms Van Rensburg or Ms Janse Van Rensburg it is fine. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  No we will – we will not be that informal. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Oh, oh I would… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is Janse Van Rensburg and not Van Rensburg okay. 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 11 of 126 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. If you may also deal with Annexure MJR7 it starts 
from… 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Chair on this annexure MJR7 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page is that annexure? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  It is page 57. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  57 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  There was also company 
10 
confidential information included into that document.  We have redacted it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  In order to substantiate to protect 
the information but the rest of the information I will talk to when I talk around 
partnerships. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  Thank you Chair.  Chair this document also if 
Chair would like to have the copy that is not redacted.  We are in possession of the 
document. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  Ms Janse Van Rensburg your qualifications 
how was – were it relevance to Denel’s Audit and Risk Committee? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Thank you.  My background in the 
auditing profession as well as my exposure to commercial enterprises as well as state 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 12 of 126 
 
owned enterprises put me in place to be able to participate and to chair the audit and 
risk committee in a manner that we would be able to match the skills that sits in both in 
management as well as in your internal and external audit.  So that is why it is 
important that audit committees have the right and board compositions and the right 
skills in place to be able to execute its oversight function in such a manner that they 
can interrogate the information that is presented to them appropriately. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  From page 3 paragraph 10 of your statement 
you start dealing with a brief history of Denel.  Would you please give us that brief 
history? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes Chairman I was asked to also 
10 
give a brief history of Denel although it started long before my tenure as a board 
member in 2010. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  But just to note that Denel was 
incorporated as a company in 1992 following the restructuring of Armscor.  The 
functions was split between Denel in the manufacturing capability and Armscor as the 
procurement arm of the SADNF.  The objective of the newly incorporated Denel was to 
conduct all the – of the production and manufacturing activities previously conducted by 
Armscor.  Between 1992 and 2000 with the advent of th 1998 White Paper on Defence 
the equipping of the South African National Defence Force was restructured as a result 
20 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am sorry Ms Janse Van Rensburg. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Buthelezi maybe it is just enough if she confirms that what she 
has written there under the brief history is correct as far as she knows and she could go 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 13 of 126 
 
to 2011. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To page 4 paragraph 16 because it is non-controversial material that 
she is talking about that history is non-controversial.  
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that alright? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  My Lord I would just like – would like to highlight what she 
said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  On paragraph 11. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  You – on paragraph 11 you talk of cumbersome in 
unprofitable obligations that affected Denel in [indistinct] which had a negative effect on 
it.  Would you please just expand on that issue only then we will move to paragraph 16. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Chair I will shorten the component 
at the report on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  With the restructuring the business 
operation was not necessarily profitable and I am aware some previous testimony here 
at the Zondo Commission also dealt with the loss making of Denel. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Over a number of years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  One of the obligations that Denel 
also had was coming from the arms procurement transaction where there is offset 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 14 of 126 
 
agreements and they were in the Denel aero structures producing components for the 
airbus aircraft the airbus 400M which was not done on a profitable basis and it actually 
also let to a drain on the resources of Denel because those type of activities included 
for instance the full development phase, the proof of concept, the testing of it and then 
the commercialisation of that.  So if we look at some of the weak performance areas it 
was an ongoing process that drained the finances of Denel.  If I can refer to that?  And 
then I think what I would like to highlight also in the period of 2000 the restructuring of 
Denel that took place. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Specifically around 2005 to 2009 
10 
because that is where a lot of the strategic equity partnerships was also put in place.  
Where portions of the business was opened up for equity partnerships by Global 
Equipment Manufacturers and the principles that was supplied on how we actually – 
that that return around process was was managed was also then based on criteria 
where you looked at complimenting synergies, global market access, global best 
practice that these equity partners needed to bring and unique and compatible IP.  They 
were also required to spend a certain amount on capitalisation of bettering the facilities 
because it is not just processes but we also have to improve manufacturing equipment 
and processes around that.  So just to note that there was before equity partnerships in 
place in Denel and it was done on a certain set of principles around it.  Just to note the 
20 
Department of Public Enterprises did a review of the Denel Equity Partnerships in 2014 
so should you wish to have more information around it you can actually access that 
information from Denel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Ag from the Department of Public 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 15 of 126 
 
Enterprises. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No otherwise Mr Buthelezi I think what is more important is for 
her to tell us what kind of Denel they found when she became a member of the board 
and whatever history that is relevant to how they found it that is relevant because of 
decisions that they would have taken.  So… 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair.  You then from paragraph 16 of you 
statement which is on page 4 you deal with Denel’s performance from the year 2011 to 
2015.  On the first paragraph you deal with the appointment of the CEO. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Ja. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  That is Mr Riaz Saloojee.  Were you the part of the 
interviewing panel? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Maybe just I will start with 
paragraph 14 because just to note when I joined the board in 2010. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  The strategy was aimed at 
improving revenue optimising efficiency and cost as well as leadership and 
transformation.  I pause to mention this as indicated earlier because at that stage I was 
appointed at the AGM in August 2010 and then a new board was then appointed also in 
20111 which then comprised of various new board members that brought a variety of 
20 
skills and we referred that to the 2011 board.  If we look at the performance of Denel if I 
go to paragraph 16. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  The performance of Denel after 
2011 when the new board came on board the board was tasked with a recruitment of 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 16 of 126 
 
the new Group CEO as the incumbent CEO indicated that he did not want to renew his 
contract.  Mr Riaz Saloojee was appointed as a Group CEO under the leadership of Mr 
Saloojee and the 2011 board revised the prevailing strategy to focus on growing 
revenue optimising cost and optimal management and productivity of efficiency.  And 
just to say the focus on growing revenue was also required because you cannot turn 
around an organising if you cannot increase the order book and convert that order book 
into revenue.  The 2011 board realised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms Janse Van Rensburg. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In paragraph 16 where you say under the leadership of Saloojee the 
10 
2011 board revised prevailing strategy.  My impression is that it creates the impression 
as if Saloojee was the Chairperson of the board, the leader of the board.  I do not think 
that is what you intend? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  No I do not intend to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So with him as the Group CEO maybe that is what you meant he had 
a role to play an important role to play but he was not leading the board. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Just to say that strategy 
development is a very close relationship between the executive management of the 
organisation and the board.  So the executive management does the hard work, digging 
and come up with proposed strategies which the board then deliberate on and actually 
jointly with management go into the direction itself.  So under the management 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 17 of 126 
 
leadership side… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe under the guidance? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Under the management leadership 
[indistinct] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that he led ja. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Executive leadership side. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  But from the board side we also 
gave some guidance in the evaluation of the strategy and enhancement of the strategy 
and the Chairman of the board at that stage was a Mr Zoli Kunene. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair.  Then from paragraph 27 you talk of the 
realisation of the success in the strategy that you adopted.  Perhaps you should turn 
over to page 5 there is a graph that you have  
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  5 yes.  The next page there is a graph that you have 
included on page 5 which explains what you talk about in paragraph 17.  Can you take 
us through the graph? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  The graph on page 5 actually 
indicates that through the period of time Denel was capable of growing the order book 
20 
to a level of 35 billion confirmed orders. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  I am sorry Ms Janse Van Rensburg.  Chair there is better 
copy of this graph on page 83 of the bundle.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you. 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 18 of 126 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I can – I think I can see here.  Okay alright. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  You may proceed Ms Janse Van Rensburg. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Okay.  Right.  To grow the order 
book to about 35 billion which was confirmed orders and just to know when we refer to 
an order book it is orders that will be executed over a number of years because the 
type and nature of the contracts that you are entering into is multi-year contracts.  So 
the revenue would flow in the very different year.  Some of the contracts it is a five year 
contract or even longer.  So we just need to note that.  That revenue is not all 
recognised in the year you sign the order. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  But the – sorry Ms Janse Van Rensburg but these 
10 
were confirmed orders? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  These were confirmed orders. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay you may proceed. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  That would be executed then over 
the next five years.  And then what we – significant opportunities that was not confirmed 
in orders but were explored that was waiting in the wings was another 40 billion.  
Denel’s strategic markets has expanded to the Middle East, the rest of Africa, South 
America and the Far East.  The revenue line which is the green line that you will see 
has grown then over the period of time to a revenue line of above 5 billion per annum. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  So in 2015 it was at 5 billion? 
20 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  It was in 2015, it was at 5 billion. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes, but the growth is noticeable from 2010 going forward.  
That green line is going  
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Ja, from 2010 it grew from about 4 
billion. 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 19 of 126 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  4.5 billion to over 5 billion that helped 
Denel in the process grow the top line.  You would see that some years in that period 
that we have had weaker performance than others. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Around it to be able, because some of 
the projects were in a product development phase which had lower income streams in 
that period. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  In paragraph 18 you compare the historical 
loses that Denel used to experience. 
10 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  I think. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  This is what was happening now between the year 2011 
and 2015.  Can you also take us through the graph that is appearing at paragraph 18? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Ja.  At paragraph 18 this historical 
graph indicates that over the past 10 years that up to 2010 Denel was loss making and 
I need to note that there was, the loss making was quite large.  It was nearly 1.5 billion 
in 2005 and it started to turn into small profits from 2011 onwards.  I need to note that 
Denel was still busy with its turnaround program.  So we were looking at a turnaround 
program till about 2018 to be able to realise the benefits of the strategy itself.  I need to 
note that Government at this stage in 2005 when Denel was making such continued 
20 
losses had agreed to recapitalise Denel and the calculation what was required of how 
much money was required to recapitalise Denel was 5.2 billion and the amount of 
money that was made available in National Fiscus transfers to Denel over the period 
2005 to 2008 was R3.5 billion and the rest of the capital that would be required needed 
to be borrowed by Denel in the capital markets and that also gave rise to Denel 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 20 of 126 
 
participation in the capital markets and the issuance of the Government guarantee of 
1.85 billion.  The balance sheet of Denel was still in a recovery phase.  So in 2011 
Denel engaged again with National Government which is the Department of Public 
Enterprises and National Treasury around filling the gap in the rest of the 
recapitalisation because you would see at that stage we were just entering a state 
where small profits were made. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  That and the justification was that if the 
shortfall and the capitalisation could be met that it would result in a saving of 120 
million per annum more or less that you could add to the bottom line so Denel would be 
10 
financially more healthy at that stage.  However that capitalisation did not take place.  
So that is why Denel then needed to make profits that you slowly bought the equity 
again. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Hm. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  To be able to create a healthier balance 
sheet over the period of time and it was a slow process.  The reason why you could not 
release the Government guarantee necessarily because the markets took comfort from 
Government standing behind Denel.  To note a Government guarantee is not giving 
money.  It is saying if you fail to pay we would actually step in into your shoes to make 
good to the people who made money available to you.  So I think that is just important 
20 
to note.  As I mentioned earlier a big drain on Denel’s performance was that Denel 
Aerostructures losses that were made on the A400N Contract that they were 
manufacturing. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Hm. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Maybe if I then go on to paragraph 19. 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 21 of 126 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  This is just where I refer Chair to say 
that we have started to realise fruits of the labour, but we are not out of the woods yet 
around the turnaround strategy as a Denel company, but Denel also won a number of 
awards and a lot of the awards were also relating to a well governed state owned entity 
and. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Was it around the same time period, 2011 to 2015? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Ja, in that period of 2011 to 2015.  
Denel also received a positive comment from the Minister during her budget votes as 
well as at the, when she addressed the media at the Denel AGMs and we can make 
10 
available the Minister’s budget speech because if I have a copy here of 
Minister Lynne Brown’s budget speech of 15 May 2015. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  We. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on one second.  In paragraph 20 you say Denel received many 
accolades from the Minister during her budget, wrote speeches in Parliament.  Was the 
Minister of Public Enterprises before 2014 not Mr Gigaba? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes, it was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  So. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  We also received positive. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Comments from Minister Gigaba. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay, you received from both? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Ministers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Him as well as Minister Lynne Brown after she was appointed in 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 22 of 126 
 
2014? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Thank you. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  I will read to you a comment in the 2015 
budget speech where she said: 
“Denel continues to show pleasing improvement in financial 
performance.  Over 50 percent of revenues were derived from 
its international business.  The order book stands at over 33 
billion.  The revenue is expected to exceed 5.5 billion.  
Preliminary numbers suggest that more than…” 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry.  Are you reading from a document that is here or is it 
separate? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  No, I am reading from a document that 
we can make available.  This is the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, is that the budget speech? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  It is Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not budget speech, budget vote speech? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Budget vote speech, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  For which year? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  2015/2016. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  The date of it is 15 May 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  I will make that copy available to the Chair.  Thank you. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  And the last item that she also referred 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 23 of 126 
 
to there was: 
“Preliminary numbers suggest more than 200 million in net 
profit after tax.  Denel Aerostructures is on a course to achieve 
break even in the next financial year.  Denel cash facilities 
improved on a scale with allows the company to mitigate 
against any liquidity risk.  In addition banks have also granted 
Denel 10 billion in facilities on the strength of the company’s 
balance sheet.  Thank you Denel.  That is music to my ears.  
Maybe we should second your CEO to Eskom as well.” 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  That was Minister Lynn Brown? 
10 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Ja, in her budget speech. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that was 2015? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  That was 2015 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  From paragraph 21 you deal with the Board 
Evaluation Report that was conducted by Deloitte? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes.  Just to note. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Chairman the full report for 2015 review 
20 
is included from page 23 onwards. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  I am going to highlight a few items out 
of that, but what I can also make available should the Commission require it. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 24 of 126 
 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Is the 2014 Board Evaluation Report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Because in terms of the protocol on 
Governance for State Owned Entities. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  That was issued in 2002 by the 
Department of Public Enterprises. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  The Boards need to, actually under 
Clause 517 the Board should do annual performance reviews around it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  So every year there was a performance 
review done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  So the performance can be track of 
Boards. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  And then secondly I can also make 
available the 2014 review which I have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, please do so. 
20 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  In my possession. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Just you said there are some areas that you would 
like to highlight on this report. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes.  On this report I just need to say 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 25 of 126 
 
that the 2015 on Clause 21 on page 5 that the conclusion of the review by Deloitte in 
2015 it was found as a highly effective Board both in providing the necessary oversight 
as well as direction to Denel and if I go now to the annexure. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  I will take you to the specific pages on 
the overall conclusion.  Let me just get quickly to that page. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Is it page 33, the Executive Summary? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Executive Summary is page 33.  Chair 
on pages 33 and 34 you would see that it was the overall assessment, the Executive 
Summary on that specific page. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  And the one, two, three, I think there are 
two things that I would highlight to you is that the Board was functioning in an effective 
manner. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  That is the third paragraph from the top, 
because it mentions the fact that we were a transitional Board really, because our term 
was just extended for another year at the 2014 AGM.  It also deals with the, in 
paragraph 4 that there is a proper distinction between the Board role and the authority 
and management role and authority.  In other words we stick to the functioning of the 
20 
oversight and strategic direction of the Board and we left management to do the 
Executive work and then the Board, the next paragraph deals with the Board 
Committees who were functioning effectively and efficiently and they reported back at 
the Board Meetings itself, the main Board Meetings and then also you would see the 
fourth paragraph from the bottom that the Board Assessment was also complimentary 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 26 of 126 
 
on the support provided by the Company Secretary. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  There were areas for consideration that 
was included in there and I think what I would also like to note there was that most of 
the Directors believed that we need to increase the formally qualified financial and 
auditing skills. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  As well as defence skills.  So there is a 
gap that we could fill in the new Board according to that because if you go back I was 
the only qualified CA on the Board itself and then some of the Directors commented 
10 
also that the Board is overweight on legal skill. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  And then one Director commented also 
that gender representation could be improved. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and Ms Janse Van Rensburg if I may also refer you to 
page 41 of the bundle that is when the evaluation of the Audit and Risk Committee was 
recorded? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes Chair. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  The last paragraph there could you please read that 
last paragraph into the record? 
20 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  The last [intervenes]. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Those are the [intervenes] there of the auditors. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Okay.  The last paragraph also then 
raised a concern or the improvement that can be done in the next Board composition, 
when we look at the Board composition going forward.  That we can add on additional 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 27 of 126 
 
skills in the financial side, but that also then that last paragraph says that: 
“They also noted that there is only one person on the Audit and 
Risk Committee who has got a formal financial qualification.  
Although the other Directors are financially astute and apply 
good financial judgment this concern was raised during the 
interviews with Directors.  It was also noted that no second 
opinion is obtained with regards to accounting and auditing 
matters.  So it would be beneficial for the Committee to appoint 
an additional member with financial qualifications.” 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and if they say financial qualification.  What sort of 
10 
qualification are we talking about here? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  The qualification. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Will a BCom Degree qualify as a financial qualification? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  BCom Degree is a good start as a 
financial qualification. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  But as I mentioned earlier on that you 
are dealing with Chartered Accountants both in your Executive Management as well as 
in your internal audit as well as in your external audit.  So to be on par with a debate to 
be able to interrogate the information that was placed on the table it would be helpful 
20 
and it is actually required in my opinion that you should have a Chartered Accountant 
on that Audit and Risk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would a reference to a requirement for a financial qualification 
normally be regarded as somebody who is a Chartered Accountant generally speaking 
in company Boards and so on? 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 28 of 126 
 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Chairman in my experience base where 
I have served on company Boards as well as in other companies that I observed is yes.  
A Chartered Accountant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what one would be talking about? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  A Chartered Accountant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Who prepared this review? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Chairman this review is done by an 
external party.  Deloitte was retained to do the 2014 and 2015 [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it would be done by an external firm of auditors and so on? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes.  You can use an external firm of 
10 
auditors.  There is more than one service provider in the market. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  That does this.  The Institute of 
Directors for instance also do Board Assessments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Or you could use audit firms that 
specialises governance reviews. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and once it has been prepared obviously it is given to the Board, 
but is it given to the Executive Authority as well in the case of an SOE? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Chair the. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Like the Minister? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Chair the process usually is that they 
base the process when they actually do the review.  The focus of the review is agreed 
with the Company Secretary and the Chairman of the Board, but usually it covers all 
aspects.  It is just usually if you look at the scope of the review to increase any specific 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 29 of 126 
 
requirements if you want to add on.  Then when the process in which they execute it.  It 
is a combination of questionnaires and interviews.  The external party then conducts 
interviews with the Board Members, individual Board Members and individual Board 
Members complete questionnaires. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, I understand that.  I am. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  And then after that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  The report is then handed back to the 
10 
company and the Company Secretary sends it through the Shareholder Department 
which in this case is the Department of Public Enterprises. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it would be directed to the department/ 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I imagine that the Minister would be the primary target. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of the person who should be aware of the report? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then obviously the Board also is given the report as well or not 
really? 
20 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  The Board is also, yes the report is 
shared with the. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Board and the? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  The results with the Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 30 of 126 
 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Because there is usually a discussion 
specifically where you identify areas. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Of improvement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  And then if you do individual Director 
assessments because we also do peer reviews, those results are shared with the 
Chairman of the Board and the Chairman then shares those results individually with the 
Directors individually. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  Ms Janse Van Rensburg would you please 
also turn to page 32 of the report. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Those were the recommendations. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Hm. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Would you please also pace those on record? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is 32 of the report or 32 of? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  32 of the. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The exhibit? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Of the exhibit, yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Page? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  It is page 10 of the report. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Page 10 of the report? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 31 of 126 
 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  “The effective and timely 
implementation of the recommendations by the Board and 
management is important for maintenance of a reliable 
governance and internal control system.” 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Is it that portion? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes that portion.  Does it suggest that the Minister will 
have sight of this report? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay.  You may proceed from paragraph 22 you deal with 
10 
this later on when you deal with the removal of the 2015. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  So I [intervenes] in the document with 
the removal of [intervenes]. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes, but now let us move to 23 where you deal with the 
financial position of Denel as at 2015. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes Chairman.  If I just continue with the 
financial performance. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Was then as I said we just go in a little 
bit more detail which is on the specific annexures, but where we say: 
20 
“…is as demonstrated by the 35 billion order as in 2015 and the 
preceding five years of profitability.” 
Those are the graphs that we referred to in paragraphs 18 and 19. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  I also attached a copy of the group’s 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 32 of 126 
 
balance sheet which is in annexure MJVR3 which is on page. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  It is on page 50. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  50? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  49, page 49. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Page 49? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  And I think the only item that I would like 
to highlight there are two old items and it goes to the business model of Denel on how 
we operated. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
10 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  If you look under assets there are two 
parts.  If you look at one, two, three, four, let me just have a look.  If we go to cash and 
short term deposits which is from under assets the fourth last item.  We mentioned that 
Denel had 1.9 billion of cash in the bank at that stage. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Just to note some of that cash was 
earmarked and ring-fenced for future contracts, because the way you conclude 
contracts for this long term contracts that you need to develop and then procure certain 
groups and services.  There is an advanced payment included in that the customer 
makes.  So those cash included in, which is ring-fenced in there then will be applied 
20 
towards that contract specifically.  So we call it ring-fenced cash, because it must only 
apply to that.  So although it looked like we had quite a lot of, or Denel had quite a lot of 
cash to redeem its debt it was earmarked for future projects as it was rolled out.  I think 
that is the main item that I would like to indicate, because we do, we also under equity 
and liabilities I can just say the total equity been a Denel standard stood at 1.9 billion at 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 33 of 126 
 
2015. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  If you look under equity and liabilities it 
is the one, two, three, four, fifth, sixth line. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  But you would see we were still working 
down.  The line above that is R4.2 billion loss that we were working down from the 
accumulated losses that were made in prior years. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Hm, and on the next annexure is there anything you would 
like? 
10 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Annexure MJVR4. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  It is at page 51. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  I just deal quickly on page 51.  The item 
I would like to highlight there was on this consolidated statements of cash flows.  It says 
taken from the published annual report. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  What I would like to highlight is the top 
line, first line that we said: 
“Net cash flows from operating activities was 220 million.” 
So it means that we did generate cash from our operating activities which was in 
20 
contrast to years prior to 2011. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Where we did not necessarily generated 
cash from our activities. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and MJVR5? 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 34 of 126 
 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Chair if I then go to the, I just, before I 
go to MJVR5. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  I think I would rather prefer to go to the 
graph on the statement itself.  It is the table on page 7 under item 26.  Item 26 in the 
main statement on page 7.  This is a forward. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is the one on paragraph 26 at page 7? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes, 26. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  That is the forward looking forecast that 
10 
was included in the corporate plan that Denel submitted February 2015 to the 
Department of Public Enterprises. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Looking forwards on how that order 
book and then the strategies and activities of Denel is forecasted to be able to bring in 
revenue profit as well what the equity position would be and what the cash position 
would be.  To note number one is this cash flow forecast or this projected performance 
did not include the acquisition of what is now known as DVS, Denel Vehicle Systems. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Or the Land Systems SA that was 
20 
bought from BAE, because at that stage the transaction was not fully concluded.  In 
February 2015 there was still outstanding matters and one of them that important was 
the PFMA approval that was only issued in April 2015. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  So if those two transactions were included the figures here 
would be higher than would be [intervenes]? 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 35 of 126 
 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Ja.  So the reason why I note that so 
then to say is that if you look for instance 2015/2016 revenue was 6.3 billion. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  In the forecast year.  If you would have 
added at that stage the planned revenue for Denel Vehicle Systems of around 1.3 
billion you probably would have then realised for that full financial year roundabout 7.7 
billion of revenue which is then forecasted and you would have realised also a different 
profit number that as closer to, I have got this somewhere here.  I can quickly give you 
the sum.  It would have given you a profit of roundabout 400 million after the 
transaction was concluded assuming 100 percent ownership of BAE, but we will get to 
10 
the discussion around land systems at a later stage, but just to highlight that was on the 
forecasted information that was included in our corporate plan. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Covering the period 2015/2016 to 
2019/2020 Denel was still on a path of improved performance, improved liquidity.  So 
that is the main item that I would like to highlight there. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and on Annexure MJVR5 which appears from page 53, 
3.1 to 53.6? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Okay.  Are we getting now to the 
component of the information that was included in our handover report? 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  So the Handover Report obviously 
included some of the information you would see, the strategy information. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Is that the information that is covered in paragraph 28 of 
your statement? 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 36 of 126 
 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  28. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Okay.  So there we start with paragraph 
28. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  The full narrative component around it.  
So Chair I need your guidance if you want me, it is written up in quite a lot of detail 
here.  I can just broadly touch on it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you can tell us the important features. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Okay. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Right.  If you look at the, the one item 
we have left out on the performance Chair that I just need to check. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Was also our performance against out 
KPIs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Would you like me to go there? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Before I? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just deal with it, yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  I go into the Handover Report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes let’s do that. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  It’s included in MJVR6 which is on 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 37 of 126 
 
page 55. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Chair if you look at our KPI’s, Denel 
has met all but three of the key performance indicators that was agreed in the 
shareholders compact for the specific year.  The areas where we did not meet the KPI 
was the cell phone research and development as a percentage of revenue of – we 
contracted for 3%, we achieved 2%, just to note if you look at the amount budgeted for 
research and development that money was spent but the denominator if you do the 
sum, changed, it became more and that we need to note was research and 
development that was only funded by Denel, we had limited financial resources and it 
10 
excludes the research and development that clients pay for, so there’s also research 
and development that takes place that we – that was paid for by clients.  
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes, in fact this Annexure MJVR6 if it can be read with 
paragraph 38 of the bundle because some of the concerns were raised by Minister in 
that paragraph. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Would you prefer me to complete it 
here Chairman or would you like me to complete under paragraph 38? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think we should just highlight some features here in MJVR6 but I 
can just see that most of the contracted targets were exceeded and in some cases 
were exceeded by far. 
20 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  That is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In relation to security of supply and retention of capabilities in areas 
required by the DOD and MV, the key performance indicator retained strategy 
capabilities in support of the DOD and MV’s requirements you contracted for 100% and 
you achieved 100%.  The next one is on problem delivery and the indicator was going 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 38 of 126 
 
to be milestone achieved per DOD contract, deliverables your target was 85%, you got 
97%, you can if you want you can just mention some of the features but it’s clear that 
the Board exceeded either achieved or exceeded most of the targets.   
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes, Chair I think significant is then 
the increase in revenue on a year on year growth, the contracted was 12%, we 
achieved 28%, Denel achieved 28% in that year, the EBIT margin was contracted for at 
4.5% Denel achieved a 7% margin.  Cash flow from operating activities before working 
capital changes as a percentage of revenue, the contracted percentage was 60%,  
Denel achieved 77%.  The operating expenses, in other words the costs as a 
percentage of revenue was contracted for at 23%, it was achieved at 16%, so it was 
10 
lower than contracted for, quite obviously revenue is also a bigger denominator that you 
divide with.  The total appointments in the designated groups the contracted was 75%, 
87% was achieved, women as a total percentage of appointments was contracted for 
20% where Denel achieved 30%, local procurement was a little bit below the target, 
70% target, 67% was achieved and we can deal with it later. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Procurement from black owned 
suppliers as a percentage of local procurement the target was 20%, Denel achieved 
22%, BEE recognised as percentage of local spend, so in our procurement processes 
did we procure from BBBEE entities, the target that was contracted for was 70%, we’ve 
20 
achieved 96%.  The spend is also further diversified to make sure that we procure from 
black-owned women businesses, women-owned businesses, the percentage there was, 
the target was 3% and we’ve achieved 9%, Denel achieved 9% and also on your youth-
owned entities there was a lower achievement, the target was 3% and achieved 1%. 
 
Looking at smaller and emerging enterprise suppliers developed to supply to 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 39 of 126 
 
the core business and core business is more than supplying catering and office 
cleaning services so it’s core business activities, is contracted for 20 enterprises, the 
achieved was 25 enterprises.  The BBBEE level contributor level contracted was level 
3, Denel moved to a level 2, training spend contracted as a percentage of employee 
cost, the contracted was 3%, what was achieved was 4%.  Number of engineering 
trainees, which is bursaries and internships contracted for was 90, we achieved 92, 
number of artisan trainees I know the person from DPE who was making a statement 
yesterday also emphasised this part of our developmental role to wider and put more 
skills into the market.  Total of artisan trainees, the contracted number was 100, 
achieved was 167, and 9 technician trainees and there was none contracted for.  Denel 
10 
also had a technical training academy and the training provided there the number of 
people contracted for was 300 and achieved was 355, an increase in number of jobs if 
you look at direct jobs created, contracted for 100, achieved was 275 and corporate 
social investment spent contracted for 1% and achieved was 2% so overall it was 
achieved that KPI’s was achieved. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I don’t know whether you ever took the trouble to calculate but  
my impression looking at this performance is that if it was an examination for a degree 
you would, your Board would have got not even summa cum laude but much more than 
that because sometimes the target would be 100 and you would be getting 200% you 
know sometimes you’d be getting 150% you’d be getting quite much more.  It’s true that 
20 
there are areas where you didn’t achieve the target but they are very limited and they 
would be easily made up compensated for by the ones where the – you got much more 
than the target and it seems to me that you probably would have got, I don’t know if 
there’s anything beyond summa cum laude but you would have really you know got 
something excellent.  That’s the impression I have when I look at the overall 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 40 of 126 
 
performance. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Thank you Chair, I think I worked 
with a Board that was hard taskmasters, and – but I think it’s and we need to note the 
journey was not completed yet, there was still much to do on the turnaround of Denel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes and I take it that the executive management was also 
playing a very important role in the success. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Chair they are critical because they 
execute, they need to make it work, we have an oversight role. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  ...to encourage, to help sometimes 
10 
with advice and strategic redirection, so all the hard work sits in the executive team to 
deliver on these strategies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you, and do you confirm then that on paragraph 28 
you deal with your strategic position at 2015, as from paragraph 28? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Counsel yes I confirm that, just to 
note the Annexure 5 that we withdrawn and replaced with graphs dealt in a lot of detail, 
this information was included in a handover report for the new Board because as an 
outgoing Board you have responsibility to place the new Board in the best possible 
position to be able to take up the relay stick and to be able to run and complete the 
20 
journey. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Because if you’re already on a 
journey of strategic redirection and the turnaround, so you need to put that Board in a 
position an outgoing Board to tell what’s on top of mind of the outgoing Board for the 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 41 of 126 
 
new Board to know and have enough information around how to start. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And Denel Asia project it’s not part of what is featured here 
on paragraph 28? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  No at 28 Denel Asia was never 
contemplated by the 2011 Board or the outgoing Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The handover report would it have been a confidential document? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Chairman this is a company 
confidential document, I can make a copy available to the Commission itself but I do 
not think it’s for public consumption because there’s certain sensitive information in 
10 
here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that’s fine, maybe we should not have it, unless there is a 
compelling reason let’s leave it alone, it would have been, it may have been interesting 
to look at what the new Board was told by the outgoing Board where the important 
issues that needed attention and against the background of what we – of the 
performance, of poor performance that we were told about yesterday by the Director 
General, Mr Tlhakudi, it would have been important to see which of the matters that the 
outgoing Board highlighted to the new Board needed attention were really taken 
forward, but if it is confidential maybe we should not look at it.   
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Chair I am under guidance there, I 
20 
can make it available to you if it’s required, we can do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no I think let’s not make – I also want to try and only know what 
everybody knows otherwise if I know things that other people don’t know I can make 
decisions that people won’t understand then it’s because of something I know that they 
don’t know, so I think for now maybe there’s no compelling reason, it just would have 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 42 of 126 
 
been nice, but it’s okay. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  There is also maybe with the 
approval from the Minister from Public Enterprises and Denel I think, you can see it’s 
old information that they state, you know it’s already four years down the line so maybe 
if you wish to see that, that can be cleared. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, it may well be that it might have been sensitive then and four or 
five years later it’s not sensitive, maybe the legal team will just apply their mind but if 
the Ministry of Public Enterprises considers that it’s got sensitive information we can do 
without it, but if they say they are happy to make it available that’s fine, okay, thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes, Ms Janse van Rensburg without going into details 
10 
that may be company confidential, would you please just give us an overview of what 
was our plan going forward. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  So on abbreviated paragraph 28 
matters on page 7 – sorry page 7 of the document item 28.1 was obviously the 
conclusion of the acquisition of the LAN System South Africa that was acquired from 
PAC Systems.  At that stage, and we will deal with it also on the – I must check there to 
say to you – from paragraph 31 on so I will give you more detail on the status of that 
under paragraph 31. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  But it was – we were at the verge of 
20 
concluding and finalising the transaction so then 28.2 the acquisition of Command and 
Control capability, now Command and Control capability was identified as a sovereign 
capability in the defence review of 2012, and Denel has been exploring the possibility of 
acquiring SAB C2 capability for a number of months, so that was a transaction that was 
in the process of being considered and Denel already appointed legal, independent 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 43 of 126 
 
advisors to perform financial and legal due diligence on the business as well as to 
provide independent valuations, and the PFMA application for that transaction was 
submitted to the shareholder, which is the Department of Public Enterprises and 
National Treasury on 11 May 2015. 
 
Under 28.3 I deal with the Airbus Optronics shareholding, the Airbus Denel 
shareholding and just to note that Denel at this stage had a if I can just recall correctly 
had a 30% shareholding in Denel Airbus.  Now this equity transaction where – which 
was concluded in the strategic turnaround in the period of 2005 to 2008 around this 
transaction was concluded in 2007, Denel had a 30% interest and Airbus had a 70% 
interest and discussions was underway to improve Denel’s shareholding to 51% 
10 
because if you go back to the defence review that functioning was also considered as 
strategic capability and the then 70% shareholder was prepared to sell off certain 
shares to Denel to improve the Denel shareholder to 51% shareholding, that gives you 
the majority shareholding and gives you control of the company.   
 
Item 28.3 this was in the media also around looking at Rooi Valk, you would 
recall that the Rooi Valk Combat helicopter has been developed and Denel was the 
original equipment manufacturer for that so there was discussions and there was 
announcements that there would be an upgrade and eventual development of Rooi Valk 
2 so work would have started on that, so that’s included in here so just to that it would 
be if the – it was proceeding that it would have been a catalyst to revive capabilities 
20 
including technology development, manufacturing enhancement in the local industry, 
because what I also need to note Denel did not manufacture each and every 
component in the equipment or the vehicles that they manufactured, there was a big 
spread of business where they bought from private sector, parties in the defence 
industry locally as well as certain components that needed to be imported or raw 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 44 of 126 
 
materials imported in the industry so the functioning of Denel was like a high level 
systems integrator. 
 
On page 9 I deal with the formalisation under 28.5 of the relationship with the 
Department of Defence and just to say that the defence spent, if you look at the 
budgetary allocations for the Department of Defence and for the South African National 
Defence Force was dwindling over the number of years, and with that also came 
haphazard manner of timing when orders were placed, so there was a process in place 
to finalise a Memorandum of Cooperation between the Department of Defence, the 
Department of Public Enterprises, Denel and Armscor on going forward and this what 
we call Memorandum of Cooperation was signed by the Minister and Denel and it was 
10 
the outstanding signature at the time of us leaving was the signature of the Department 
of Defence but it was an item that was long time in the process of making. 
 
My understanding is that since we left this Memorandum of Cooperation was 
signed by the Department of Defence and I am sure they can make that available to 
you should you require it but I think just one of the things was also how to 
constructively work better with the limited money that’s available because you would 
know a lot of equipment also needed refurbishment and maintenance of the South 
African National Defence Force.  It also focused on the areas of capability which is 
sovereign and which is of strategic importance for the South African Defence Force, so  
- and it’s closely aligned to the defence (indistinct) that was adopted by Cabinet itself. 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes then on 28.6? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  28.6 just to note as we said Denel 
Aero Structures was a manufacturing for Airbus so it had an advanced manufacturing 
capability, the type of materials and the technology used in the manufacturing of the 
components was very well developed and Denel was even at a stage commended by 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 45 of 126 
 
Airbus of being a well-performing supplier to Airbus in building their A400N. 
 
Now at that stage South African Airways and SA Express were in a process 
of procuring additional aircraft and there was a discussion to see what was the role that 
Denel can play because usually with your procurement of large sums of capital 
equipment and investment side is there’s an offset program under the Department of 
Trade & Industry which we call the National Industrial Participation Program and there 
was discussions to see whether there would be any additional work in the aircraft that’s 
coming from the procurement processes of S A Airways and S A Express that Denel can 
manufacture some of those components seeing that they’re already doing some of that 
advance manufacturing.  The – so that paragraph deals with that and that is part of the 
10 
issues that we’ve put because it was not concluded, and just to say that part of that 
processes was also that the Denel was also then discussing obviously also with other 
aircraft manufacturers, the ability to become their local manufacturer for certain 
components, such as Boeing, Emperor and Bombardier because we didn’t know what 
the outcome of those procurement processes of those stated entities would have been, 
okay, because that was then part of the initiatives to bring more work to the Denel Aero 
structures that you can increase revenue and increase performance and also make 
sure that it turns out that performance.  Then at page 10 I deal with the Denel Maritime 
diversification and just to note that once again the Denel integrated systems and 
Maritime Division was created, we first had a Denel Integrated Systems Division, so we 
20 
added the Maritime Component to that and it was established to be able to participate 
in procurement for further plans of the SANDF around extending their maritime 
capability.  
 
Once again the role in the maritime capability side and some of the 
capabilities that would sit in Denel was also then classified under the sovereign 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 46 of 126 
 
capabilities in the defence review component. 
 
Page 28 – sorry 28.8 on page 10 then deals with the Pretoria Metal Pressing 
Plant, I am sure you have had a rundown of all the Denel business units yesterday, the 
– just to note that the plant was already 40 years old with some equipment dating as far 
back as the sixties and what was happening is that there needed to be a structured 
program to enhance the manufacturing and do a renewal program of that plant and 
there was a program on the table that the Board has approved but it was a program 
over five to seven years to make it affordable to Denel, because we didn’t have 
necessarily all the additional resources to be able to do it in a onetime process to 
upgrade that facility. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay, was this based in Attridgeville, Pretoria? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  This is based in Attridgeville, 
Pretoria. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes, then on – then this report was handed over to the 
Minister on the 4th of June 2015, you confirm that? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes, this report was then handed 
over to the Minister, forwarded to the Minister on 4th of June 2015. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes, then on paragraph 30 you mention two milestones, 
can you give us more details on that? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  The milestones we mentioned here 
20 
that it demonstrates the actions taken by the 2011 Board as part of its turnaround 
strategy for Denel and it demonstrates many  aspects of the projects undertaken by the 
2011 Board, which I call the outgoing Board, as part of the turnaround strategy has 
been commenced but not yet completed. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 47 of 126 
 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  This meant that there was a need 
for continuity within the Denel Board, to ensure that these projects would be completed 
successfully by retaining some of the Denel Board members from the 2011 Board with 
the knowledge of projects in the new Board that was appointed in 2015. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes, and then from paragraph 31 you are focusing on the 
LSSA contracts or transactions and its financial impacts on Denel.  We are – we have 
heard evidence of Mr Tlhakudi yesterday and more evidence will be led to the effect 
that this transaction led to the removal of the Executive members of Denel.  Can you 
give us some background on this transaction? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  I will do so Chairman.  Just maybe 
10 
to contextualise I am going to take you through the highlights that was written in the 
statement. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  The 2011 Board concluded the 
transaction for the acquisition of the BAE LAN Systems South Africa Company a South 
African subsidiary, it became known as the Denel Vehicle Systems after it was 
purchased, just to highlight a few items, the Board considered the transaction at its 
meeting in 2014, 22 May of 2014 but to highlight the context in which the transaction 
was considered and it was that Denel had already certain capabilities in the production 
of firepower like missiles and protection equipment.  The opportunity to acquire 
20 
landward systems from BEA systems in 2014 was an ideal fit for Denel to enhance its 
landward equipment capabilities.  Denel was the prime contractor for significant vehicle 
programmes like the G5 and the G6 in prior years, the Rooikat and Caspers that is all 
past equipment that was manufactured and was still manufacturing.  LSSA which I call 
the LAN systems transaction has always been responsible for the production of the 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 48 of 126 
 
vehicles on which those equipment was fitted.  Whereas Denel was responsible for 
overall concept design firepower and integration.  Furthermore the acquisition would 
have bettered the position of Denel for future acquisition programmes by the SANDF, 
Saches Wistella and Sapula estimated at R14 billion so we were acquiring all their 
capabilities.  And it would also enable Denel LAN systems and LNT in which Denel had 
a 51% shareholding to mitigate production risks on some bigger programmes as it 
would bring on board a mature manufacturing capability.  The acquisition of the LAN 
systems was supported by the Department of Defence and as such a letter by the head 
of the SANDF General Shoke on 14 May 2014 addressed to BAE indicated that they 
would like to see Denel play also a role and that it is in a local – that there is a local 
10 
buyer for the business itself.  The defence revue policy also advocated the return of 
strategic capabilities under the ownership of the state so that is why we were looking at 
that.  The transaction was implemented with the full support of the minister who 
provided upon application and through thorough engagement the necessary approvals 
in terms of the Public Finance Management Act and also supported approvals required 
from the Competition Commission and the South African Reserve Bank. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and the Minister you are referring to here is it Minister 
of – the DPE Minister, Minister Brown? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  It was if you look at the time it was 
Minister Brown. 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  At the Department of Public 
Enterprises. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  But these type of transactions what 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 49 of 126 
 
is quite substantial National Treasury also plays a significant role. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Because the PFM a approvals 
would be signed off by both the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Public 
Enterprises and they usually attach some conditionality’s to that. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes so you had approval from both Ministers? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Thank you.  You may proceed. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  The feasibility of the transaction 
was predicated on the inclusion of the strategic equity partner who would bring in an 
10 
amount of at least 450 million as an investment equity and also provide significant 
access to market and orders.  Upon our DE partner as the 2011 board we already 
commenced the process through a closed bidding process to secure such a suitable 
strategic equity partner.  The process was at an advanced stage and there was a few 
strategic partners considered with the right qualities including the financial means to 
acquire the equity for the 450 million.   
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  On July 3 2015 I addressed a letter 
to the Minister in which I explained the rationale for the strategic equity partner and 
updated the Minister on the entity that has been identified by the 2011 board as offering 
20 
the best strategic fit as an equity partner and a copy of that letter is attached in NJVR7 
it is attachment 7 and it is on page 57. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes it is on page 57. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  I can take you to page 57.  This is 
the letter that was addressed to Minister Brown that is after the board considered the 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 50 of 126 
 
partner and the portion that I would like to highlight to you specifically is on page 58. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Is to say that the – as a board we 
evaluate the offer based on – the offer is based on the set criteria that included the 
following criteria and it is the bullet points on top of the black blocks which included 
sound financial investment proposal, additional revenue and markets the party will bring 
to the organisation.  Access to funding, working capital and bank facilities.  Access to 
experienced human resources.  Tested business processes and track record.  Access 
to established research and development capabilities.  Support of national strategic 
objectives for example transformation and Department of Defence objectives.  Strategic 
10 
fit and synergies with the Denel Group.  So based on that basis we selected the 
partner.  It was at an advanced stages of finalising the final negotiations but that was at 
the stage when we exited.   
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes I am sorry Ms Janse Van Rensburg was it – the 
strategic partner how much percentage of this was it going to have? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  The strategic partner was looked at 
at 49%. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  So that Denel can maintain control 
over the Denel vehicle systems which is then the 51% that will remain with Denel. 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  And the cancellation of this though what impact 
would it have on Denel? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  In paragraph 37 I deal with my 
understanding that the 2015 board, the new board just cancelled or discontinued the 
participation of the strategic equity partnership. 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 51 of 126 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  And the impact of that would have 
been that it will put considerable financial strain on Denel. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Because the balance sheet was not 
strong enough to repay the loans that was entered into to be able to pay for the 
acquisition of the Denel Vehicle Systems entity. So paragraph 37 Chair mainly deals 
with that. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and the acquisition of LSSA would you say it was 
value for money for Denel? 
10 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes the value of money of Denel – 
to Denel was number 1 around enhancing the strategic capability of having more 
product offering but it was also that it already was an established business that would 
actually increase the revenue flow and as I indicated earlier in my remarks around if 
you looked at the Denel Forecast and Performance under paragraph 26 although 26 
only deals with the Denel Core Business before the LAN system acquisition you would 
have seen that it would have brought about 1 – for 2015 about 1.4 billion of additional 
revenue and of that revenue you would have had an additional profit of – nett profit of 
about 148 million that it would have brought to Denel for that financial year. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and the involvement of the equity partner was it one of 
20 
the conditions that was of the approval of this – of this transaction? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Ja the PFM – the PFMA approvals 
that was received in April. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  The National Treasury PFMA 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 52 of 126 
 
approval was received on 2 April 2015 and the Department of Public Enterprises 
approval was received on 10 April 2015.  
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  And the conditionality of that was 
that we revert and bring in an equity partner.   So that was one of the conditions of the 
approval. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Thank you.  Let us move forward to 
paragraph 38.  You have already dealt with I think it is MJR6 which you indicated what 
you managed to achieve in terms – as per your shareholder compact and what you 
could not achieve which is out of I will say about 20 items you only – you could not 
10 
achieve three items and those were raised by the Minister in your Annual General 
Meeting in 2015.  Could you please highlight those and the reasons as to why you 
could not achieve in those three areas? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Chairman on page – I will just deal 
with the items as on page 13 of the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Under paragraph 38.  The one was 
the spend of 2% of its revenue on research and devel – own research and development 
which was not the 3% which was the target agreed.  Just to note we have had a budget 
of R89 million to spend of own research.  The actual spend was R119 million so you 
20 
look at you know rand amounts spent there was an increase but if you actually look at 
the increase in the revenue line obviously we had a lower spend and as we had scarce 
resources we needed to manage own spend quite carefully versus the spend that on 
Research and Development that clients will pay for.  The second item that we did not 
achieve the target was the local content procurement where Denel achieved 67% 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 53 of 126 
 
versus the target of 70%.  Just to note that a total amount of 3.1 billion was spent on 
local procurement which made up the 67%.  So it was noted by the board and – but it 
was just a factor of circumstances also on what programmes and contracts you were 
actually in the process of rolling out.  And then the last item was Denel achieved a 1% 
procurement spend from black youth owned companies against a target of 3%.  We 
have also noted that an effort would have been put in place to be able to include that 
but the overall BBBE spend was exceeded.  So this is just a sub-category on that to 
make sure that we create capacity to spend on youth owned businesses as well as 
woman owned businesses.  So in respectful opinion the failure to meet these targets as 
important as they are paled into the insignificance to the overall success that Denel has 
10 
achieved for that period under review.  So I am [indistinct] statement earlier. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Chair I am not sure if it would be convenient for us to stop 
at this time when we come back we will deal with the Denel Asia issues 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will take the tea adjournment and resume at half past eleven.  
We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may proceed Ms Buthelezi. 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Ms Janse Van Rensburg we are on the establishment of 
Denel Asia.  You have given us your comments from paragraph 41 of your statement.  
Firstly your evidence is that your Board did not have this project in its plan.  Is that 
correct/ 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes.  Chairman the 2011 Board or the 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 54 of 126 
 
outgoing Board did not consider the establishment of Denel Asia.  So that is just, I am 
confirming that. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Looking at the fact that by October 2015 there was 
already pre-notification that was been sent to the relevant Ministers.  How much time in 
your experience would it be required in order to reach that stage in facilitating the 
project of this nature? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Chairman in my opinion if you would like 
to actually establish such a type of subsidiary in another country there is a lot of market 
intelligence homework that needs to be done.  Also the feasibility of that needs to be 
evaluated and prepared and considered by the Board and before the proceeds could 
10 
actually go forward in order to notify the relevant shareholder departments of 
establishing such an entity.  So I think the new Board assumed their functions by the 
end of July I think it is 24 July. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  So it was a relative short period that 
transpired between assuming functions, getting to know the business because just to 
say if you are appointed to a Board and a business that we did not [background noise] 
to the Board your induction together with getting to grips with the business usually 
takes a period of time and I will also deal with it under rotation of Board around what is 
best practice around it.  So where I am is for the Board to meaningfully consider that 
20 
that transaction or the establishment of that, I do not know I have not been on the 
Board on what information that decision was made, but my experience in other 
organisations would be that you would need to spend quite a lot of homework to be 
able to get to an investible case and a banking case that makes business sense to be 
able to make the decision as a Board to proceed with that. 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 55 of 126 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  At paragraph 42 you deal with the issue of withdrawal 
or the tenure criminal investigation that Denel had in India being resolved? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Ja. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Would this be viewed as a way or, yes a way in which 
now the opportunities for Denel were opening up in India considering the fact that 
Denel was a global company? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Thank you.  Chairman yes at paragraph 
42 where we are is there has been a long standing dispute between Denel and India 
and in August 2014 the criminal investigation by the Indian Prosecuting Authorities was 
closed out after many years of efforts.  So that was a significant milestone because it 
10 
barred Denel from doing meaningful business with the Government of India and India 
has been considered as a strategic market.  You would note in my review of the 
performance we see at Middle East/Asia was one of our, one of Denel’s key markets 
that they were into.  So yes this started to open the door.  There was however still some 
legal, some civil cases that needed to be brought to conclusion and I understood that 
was done roundabout 2017. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and further down in your statement you give an 
example of a contract that you had with a company that was outside South Africa 
Tawazun Dynamics.  In entering into such an agreement how much of the State 
involvement of the other country is expected to be?  Would you enter a transaction of 
20 
this sort without involving the State of the other country as Denel? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Chair I am using a Tawazun as an 
example, because that was a company that Denel established off shore.  It is in the 
UAE and in my statement I deal with it in a way that it was a joint venture.  It was 
concluded with the state owned arms company for the UAE at Tawazun and the joint 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 56 of 126 
 
venture also flowed out of a contract that was signed between Denel and the 
Government of the UAE buying armaments, missiles from South Africa or from Denel 
itself and I think just to note that the way it was structured it was part of an offset 
agreement, because obviously like most countries have a certain component of local 
manufacturing that they would like to see happening in any major procurement program 
and secondly if you look at the type of venture that was entered into was it was done 
with a capable state owned arms company or defence company from the Government 
of UAE in process there. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  And so that was the main difference.  
10 
So it was an established company.  It was Government linked in relation to that.  So I 
think it is a little bit different from my public understanding of Denel Asia. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and what would be your comment on the fact that from 
the information we have that VR Laser had no footprint in India? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Chair my understanding was and as I 
set out in my statement the joint venture with VR Laser was, VR Laser was a local 
company.  It did not have the footprint and at that stage in Asia or in India specifically.  
So and it is a private sector company that it was, the joint venture was entered into and 
if I look at the publically available information the structure of the transaction had two 
parts and the one was Denel Asia that was created as really a holding company and 
20 
then underneath that they will also then create other joint ventures and if the 
transaction was structured in a way that Denel would have 51 percent of Denel Asia, 
but that is only a holding company.  If you then structure a further company underneath 
that in the countries that do business with it where they also need to look at 
establishing a joint venture.  Eventually the amount of money that will flow through to 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 57 of 126 
 
Denel would be then quite a small component, because then if it did lead Denel would 
have had for instance if a Denel India was created to satisfy the local procurement 
requirements in India Denel would have had an effective 25 percent shareholding in 
that entity. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  So at the end of the day there was no value for money for. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  To make economic sense for Denel to. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Enter into such an agreement? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes Counsel.  Just maybe to note that 
10 
ton the publically available information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  And the evaluation of the structure of 
that it did not make commercial sense. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  And strategic sense around the long 
term relationships that needed to be built between Denel and the Government of India 
as well as the commercial returns that would be coming from such a joint venture. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Using your knowledge and expertise as a Chartered Accountant and 
the experience you had as a member of the Denel Board and as Chair, Interim Chair at 
20 
that time, when you look at that transaction are you able to say who would have 
benefitted from it if Denel was not going to benefit much from it?  Who would have 
benefitted more from it, because from what you say it looks like Denel was not going to 
benefit much. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Now if we go back to the bottom in the 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 58 of 126 
 
country of presence you would have then say a 49 percent return on the joint 
manufacturing or joint capabilities that you manufacture there.  So that local joint 
venture would have actually benefitted by 51 percent of the profits coming from that 
company.  Then you have an intermediate company which was then Denel Asia that will 
have received that 49 percent and of that 49 percent it would be split then 51 percent 
Denel and 49 percent VR Laser and so it all depends what the local company would 
have been as a joint venture.  I am not privy to any information on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  What the local company would have 
been. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  So on the holding structure the benefit 
would have been VR Laser. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would have been? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  VR Laser would then benefitted from it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  Then you at paragraph 47 you deal with the 
removal of the 2011 Board.  You mention in paragraph 47 that a good practice are for 
Board Members could have been scattered terms.  In your case your terms, the whole 
Board the 2011 Board had expired around the same time.  Can you give us some 
20 
background on what led to this? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Thank you for that question.  Chairman 
on page 14 paragraph 47. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  I just start with paragraph 38.  First I 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 59 of 126 
 
start with good practice and maybe at paragraph 47 I would like to also highlight that 
this governance protocol, Protocol on Governance in Public Sector Entities of 2002 
there was also a component around Clause 5.1.6 deals with the Appointment and 
Removal of Directors in State Owned Entities and 5.1.6.4 deals with continuity which is 
fundamental to the success of the SOE and this requires that an ongoing skills 
identification process to be performed by the Chairperson of the Support and 
Nominations Committee, but the emphasis is on continuity of skills on a Board that you 
need to also look at how you put that together.  Best practice is that you have a 
scattered term.  That you have one third of a Board’s term in their third term.  One third 
in their second term and one third in their first term.  This is how you manage continuity 
10 
of skills on a Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and that document on governance that you just read from. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think is one of the documents that Minister Gordhan testified about.  
Either Minister Gordhan or one of the witnesses from National Treasury, but I think it 
must have been Minister Gordhan, is a document that had been issued or sponsored by 
the same department, it is not, Department of Public Enterprises or was it National 
Treasury that had issued it or sponsored it? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Chair at the time of my appointment in 
2010 the document was issued in 2002 and it was issued by the Department of Public 
20 
Enterprises. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  There was quite a lot of noise around 
the review of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 60 of 126 
 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  But I think the revised one was only 
issued quite recently. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  14:47 And I am not sure whether 
National Treasury issued the revised one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  But at the time when I was on the Board 
this was the protocol that was in place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So it would be fair to say that a Minister of the Department of 
Public Enterprises would know that document and what the guidelines are, because it is 
10 
a document issued by his or her department? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes Chair and had supporting technical 
skills in the department itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You would not know however I think whether since that 
document was issued there had been compliance with its guidelines over the years 
before your Board was removed? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Chair in the case of the Department of 
Public Enterprises this was my first exposure as a shareholder department in my 2010 
appointment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  My understanding was that there was 
compliance to that because for instance when I was appointed to the Board in 2010 
there was retention of old Board Members or continued Board Members and we were at 
that stages four members who actually joined the Board in 2010. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well. 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 61 of 126 
 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  As new members. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The [intervenes]. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  So it gives indication on how it was 
applied that you did not replace the Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  100 percent or 99 percent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  In that period. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  By practice.  I previously at my days 
10 
when I was at the Trans Caledon Tunnel Authority earlier years it was also applied quite 
stringently, but I think departments, shareholder departments started to deviate from 
that and how Ministers actually appoint Boards.  So I think there was also a practice of 
deviating from that at some stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  I think Ms Buthelezi, Ms Gcabashe and the whole legal 
team attempts must be made to get somebody who can look at the level of compliance 
with that, with the guidelines contained in that document from the time the document 
became operational in the early 2000s up to now and not only in those public 
enterprises under the Department of Public Enterprises but also under other 
departments, because my understanding is that it was issued and approved by Cabinet 
20 
for purposes of giving guidance to all, to among others the appointment of Board 
Members, in regard in all the public enterprises.  So it would be good to see to what 
extent there had been compliance for a certain number of years and in particular 
around certain specific years when Boards of various public enterprises were changed 
to see to what extent at that stage there was still compliance and if there were 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 62 of 126 
 
deviations to what extent those deviations were marked deviations.  Thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  And maybe Chair what I would like to 
also add in support of paragraph 47 was that the Denel Memorandum of Incorporation 
in Clause 13. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Also deals with the composition of the 
Board and the terms of Boards that you are looking at the maximum of three terms and. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  The taking continuity into consideration. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and I guess that if you as a Government department issue a 
document that is supposed to be a guideline and guide people you should be 
exemplary in trying to comply with those guidelines.  So one will need to look at all of 
those things and see to what extent they were substantial deviations. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Just to note the Memorandum of 
Incorporation or MOI is a document that is actually the way Denel functions and it was 
in terms of the Company’s Act dated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  So it is also within terms of the 
Company’s Act that we compliant in our MOI. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And does it address this issue we are talking about as well? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes.  It addresses it in Clause 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 63 of 126 
 
[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, thank you very much. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Chair if I may refer to Chair to the relevant document 
is in our reference file, W5A. 
CHAIRPERSON:  W5. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Section 13 starts on page 21. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the memorandum she is talking about? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine.  Thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  Looking at the Clause 13 of the same 
10 
memorandum, of the MOI, the members who were on the Board, your Board the 2011 
Board and if not all of them.  It is on page 21. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Page 31? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  21. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  21? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of EXHIBIT W5? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  W5A. 
CHAIRPERSON:  W5A.  Just look on the spine Ms Janse Van Rensburg. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  W5A. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the spine of the lever arch file to check whether you are looking 
at the correct file.  On the spine it should be marked EXHIBIT 5. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  I think I found it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A W5A.  Have you got the right one? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  I found it.  I just need to get to the 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 64 of 126 
 
specific clause in this evidence bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Clause 13 appears on page 21. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes, 21. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  If you look at 13.1.2 the Non-Executive Directors 
should be appointed for at least three years or for the maximum of three years and 
such terms or consecutive terms should not be longer than three terms.  Look at the 
Board Members, the 2011 Board Members none of you have served the maximum 
period stipulated in that paragraph.  Is that correct? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  I am under correction there. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  The one person, Dr Gert Cruywagen. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Was at the start of his third term, 
because he was appointed in, let me quickly get to his term.  He was appointed in 2008 
for his first term. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  So he was then reappointed for a 
second term. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
20 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  And then the reappointment that was 
happening for the one year only period in 2014 would have been a first year.  So it 
would have been a first year in, but. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  But it was just an extension merely of 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 65 of 126 
 
the second term. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  He also could still serve for another two years 
[intervenes]? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes, he could serve for another two 
years. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But he would have been a good candidate to be allowed to go, 
because of how long he had already served.  Is it not? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes.  He could have been replaced. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  But all the other Board Members except 
for me and; was at that stage in their first term.  They completed their first term in 2014 
and they were then reappointed just for that one year extension to be able to give the 
Minister time to put a Board together, but I will deal with it in my statement, because at 
the 2014 AGM Minister Brown said that she just walked into the Portfolio at the 
Department of Public Enterprises and that she would like to take her time to get to 
know the organisations and then look at the appointment of Board Members.  So that is 
why she requested that the current Board in place at that stage to stay on for another 
year or until such time she appoints a new Board. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
20 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  To give her space to consider 
candidates for the Board that is appropriate. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and then at paragraph 51 of your statement you deal 
with a letter that you sent to the Minister upon learning that the Minister was intending 
to review the Board. 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 66 of 126 
 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Ja. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Can you take us to that letter and what issues did you 
raise with the Minister? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Hm. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  It is attached as EXHIBIT MJVR8. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And it is on page 61 of EXHIBIT W2. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Page 61 deals with the letter that 
Minister Brown had sent to Denel to inform us of the rotation of the Board Members and 
within that she requested the Handover Report. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  From that.  The Board has sent 
correspondence to her. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  A report.  Yes.  It is. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Under. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  MJVR9 that starts from page 64.  Sorry, it is tabbed sorry. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  74. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Page 74 is then the letter that the Board 
has sent to Ms Brown after learning that on the rotation of the Board that there was not 
20 
continuity in place. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Now you must understand that as the 
shareholder has the full right to appoint a Board it can be seen that you are trying to 
make a case for you to be reappointed.  So you must be very careful on how you 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 67 of 126 
 
communicate also to the Minister but what we; when we have learnt that there was only 
one Member of the Board of the old Board going through to the new Board. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  We have sent a letter and we referred to 
the letter of the Minister dated 25 May which was then in Annexure MJVR8. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  That we respond to and number one we 
thanked her for the opportunity to be able to serve on Denel Board.  We also assured 
her because her letter asked that we need to make sure that we handover appropriate 
and continuity of functions.  So we said as professional Board Members our fiduciary 
10 
duty as a Board Member will continue until the AGM where we will handover and we will 
continue to provide the highest cooperation in maintaining leadership as the company 
finalises its 2015 annual report, financial statements and ongoing matters such as 
implementation of the recent Land Systems acquisition.  I refer to her that the Board 
met on 28 May 2015 to agree on the content that should be included in the Handover 
Report which we dealt with at Annexure 5 which we actually only extracted certain 
information from and graphs from and we said that that report would be provided to her 
by 3 June and then the Board noted the bottom paragraph there. 
“The Board acknowledges the right of the shareholder to rotate 
Board Members, but need to register our concern that the lack 
20 
of continuity in the Non-Executive leadership may put Denel at 
risk.” 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  “A 90 percent change in 
Non-Executive Board Membership inherently increases the risk 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 68 of 126 
 
of instability and diversion of focus in this critical period of 
Denel’s turnaround.  We refer to Good Corporate Governance 
Practice including King III warns against it that you thus do 
such a major replacement and since the 2014 Annual General 
Meeting the Board has been contemplating the imminent 
change and for this reason considered it prudent to review the 
term of the Executive Management’s contracts to ensure that 
continuity on this level in the Executive Management will be 
maintained.” 
And we said that the separate level will follow on that in that regard, but we needed to 
10 
voice our concern around the lack of continuity. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Ms Janse Van Rensburg the only member who was 
retained from the 2011 Board was Mr Motseki.  Were you aware of his qualifications? 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  I have served with Mr Motseki on the 
Board. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  For four years.  So yes we were aware 
of his qualifications. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And what qualifications did he have? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  I’m just going back to that.  Motseki 
20 
had been appointed to the Board in 2011, his relevant skills was Policy Develop 
experience and Intelligence Security and other media liaison.  I did not have the details 
of his academic qualifications. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes did he serve on any of the committees – sub-
committees that  you had? 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 69 of 126 
 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Mr Motseki didn’t serve on any of 
the sub-committees of the board. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay and on the same paragraph…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   One second what would make – what would bring about a situation 
where some members of the board serve on committees and others did not serve.  Was 
is a question of choice, was it – and maybe some might have served on more than one 
committee, I don’t know, what would inform that normally, not talking about any 
particular individual, just in general? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Chair, in practice you would like to 
allocate the relevant qualifications and experience to the right Board committee, in any 
10 
organisation where you are.  So you have a combination of reasons, maybe it goes 
around skills set fit, if a person is not allocated to a specific committee.  If you have a 
larger Board, not all of the members have to serve on a committee, so I must also note 
that and sometimes it’s by choice of the individual.  If I can recall in 2014 going to 2015, 
I think Mr Motseki had some health challenges, so maybe for that reason he was not 
also on a committee but it can be verified on the choices from further interrogation with 
the Department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  On the same paragraph, 55, you also addressed a letter 
that is on Annexure NJVR11, can you state for the record what was the purpose of you 
20 
sending this letter to the minister? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  As mentioned in the Board letter on 
the rotation of the Board in Annexure 10, that was – which I referred to on page 74, we 
were looking – and 75, we were seeing – we were recommending to the Minister to look 
at the extension of the group’s CEO contract to ensure that there’s at least continuity at 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 70 of 126 
 
executive management level and Chair you may recall when we had the discussion 
earlier on about the role between the Board and the executive management.  Executive 
management is quite key in rolling out the agreed strategy to be able to achieve the 
financial results.  So if you maintain some continuity at least at the executive level it will 
enable the Board also to fulfil its responsibilities if they’re an incoming Board and they 
have – do not have continuity in place, that will help them to breach that period for the 
Board to come – become fully au fait with the organisation itself.  So the document that 
is in the pack from 77 to 81 is then the letter, dated 1 June by the Board to the Minister 
where we recommend the review of the group’s CEO terms because the group’s CEO 
term would have come to an end, I think, January 2016 – no January 2017 and we 
10 
recommended that she needs to re-look whether she would give approval to extend it 
for a longer period of time to bridge the continuity and we dealt with the performance of 
the group CEO over that period in that letter. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Sorry Ms Janse van Rensburg you – this was in 2015 and 
according to your evidence the term of the CEO was only coming to an end in 2017, 
was there a reason for your concern at that stage, that his term might not be extended 
or was it just ad hoc. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words, why were you not leaving it to the new Board to make 
that call at the right time because it seemed there was still quite some time? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Chair, usually recruitment of 
20 
replacement of a CEO takes around 12 months in advance that you actually need to do 
that because the process and the search takes a long time to be able to get the right 
person in place.  We were concerned that his contract may not be renewed, that was 
the one part but we were more concerned about continuity and the strategy in the 
turnaround of Denel that, that will not be able to be followed with the right executive in 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 71 of 126 
 
place. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was the fact that your Board may have worked with the group CEO 
for a longer time than the new Board would have worked with him before having to 
make the call, also a factor or not? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes it would be because we have 
appointed him, he started his term in 2012 – January 2012 Chair and so we have 
worked for him for a period of three years at least – three and a half years at least so 
we have seen performance coming to the fore as demonstrated in the financial results 
and the growth in the order book and the cohesion in the executive team, also 
transformation in your executive employment where you started to see that we’re 
10 
actually achieving transformation for black senior managers and executives.  So we felt 
that he was doing a good job. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:    Thank you, then from paragraph 57 you talk about the 
skill set of the 2011 Board, can you take us through the skill set as it sits out from 
paragraph 57 up to paragraph 59 of your statement? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes, I will do that, Chair, if I just 
quickly go through the skill set, just to note, I have not listed all of the current Board 
members, it doesn’t mean that they didn’t contribute, I just highlighted a few but the full 
CV’s of all the other Board members are also available because the ones that I have 
20 
not dealt with here was also doing their job on the Board quite well, as you could have 
seen from the Board review so I have not dealt with Ms Matenjwa and I have not dealt 
with advocate Ntsoleka and I have not dealt with Mr Ngwenya but it does not mean that 
they did not added value in the Board deliberations.  Just to note, on paragraph 59 
some of the Board members that – at the highest respect as professionals and 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 72 of 126 
 
business people in their fields was 50.1 Mr Mavuso Msimang, he was a veteran of 
South African Politics Anti-Corruption Champion and experienced corporate executive 
he had spent a number of years, both in the State owned entity environment, like South 
African National Parks CEO as well as CEO of the State Information Technology 
Agency where – and then also where he was responsible for turnarounds in that space 
and he was also then a member of the Social and Ethics Committee.  59.2 is Professor 
Stella Nkomo was at the time Professor and Deputy Dean at the faculty of Economic 
and Management Sciences at the University of Pretoria.  She was an accomplished 
expert in Human Resources and Leadership with a vast international experience.  Dr 
Gert Cruywagen that we dealt with earlier on, Dr Gert Cruywagen is a senior executive 
10 
with the Tsogo Sun Group, responsible for risk management.  At the time he was also a 
longstanding member of the King Committee on corporate governance and was 
involved in several international structures on matters of mismanagement and 
corporate governance.  Paragraph 59.4, Mr Matotsi Ratchenbelani brought over 20 
years of legal experience, practiced as an attorney and director in some of South 
Africa’s top legal firms and he helped the Board greatly in dealing with many legal 
issues, in particular, in matters of corporate governance, company law, merges and 
acquisitions and contracts and he had considerable experience in advising some of 
South Africa’s major State owned entities on the various legal matters.  On page 17 we 
also deal with – and paragraph 59.5 with Advocate Ghandi Badela, that had many 
20 
years of experience as an engineer.  He completed his legal studies and joined the bar 
during his tenure as a director at Denel.  He is currently an Advocate at Duma Nokwe 
Group, he served as Chief Executive Officer at SAAB Grintech Technologies, Sonkwe 
Computer Services and Masana Technologies.  He holds an MSC in engineering 
management from University of Johannesburg and an MBA from the University of 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 73 of 126 
 
Pretoria.  Advocate Badela brought a rare combination of law and engineering, these 
skills helped the 2011 Board to navigate intellectual property matters from a legal and 
an engineering perspective.  Prof. Tshilidzi Marwala in paragraph 59.6 we deal with 
Prof. Tshilidzi Marwala which is currently the vice chancellor of the University of 
Johannesburg, renowned for his knowledge and passion in matters of technology and 
the fourth industrial revolution, having obtained his PHD at the University of Oxford in 
the field of artificial intelligence.  Just to note that when Minister Brown asked the Board 
to renew the tenure in 2014 for one year, Professor Marwala, at that stage indicated 
that he’s not available for that period. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
10 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Okay but he’s back on the Board 
now if you look at the current Board of Denel but at that stage he stepped into his new 
role at the university and it took up some of his time so it was a time/availability matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so when the Board was – when the 2011 Board left he had 
already left? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  He left in 2014 together with Mr Zoli 
Kunene who was the previous Chairman of the Board and he already, in 2014, served 
three terms of three years so he reached his nine year limit in terms of the MOI but he 
also brought quite a lot of experience, if we look at the period of time involved in that. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Yes, in paragraph 61 of your statement you make a 
20 
comparison between the 2011 Board and the 2015 Board and you highlight that the 
2015 Board lacked – members lacked in certain critical skills.  We are already aware 
that there was a recommendation by the auditors on the Board evaluation report that 
we have dealt with earlier that recommended that someone – or members with some 
financial skills should be appointed to the Board.  What do you take of this, the fact that 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 74 of 126 
 
2015 Board lacked or didn’t have a chartered accountant as a member? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Chair on that matter, I must just 
note, it’s very difficult to criticise from the outside so that’s why I limit my comment to 
the composition of the Board relating to the skills for the audit and risk committee and 
the statement here is that they did not have a member with the relevant CA qualification 
that would be able to bring the knowledge base in – on the level of a chartered 
accountant to give to both executive management and the auditors and as counsel has 
referred to that the Board evaluation report, both in the 2014 one, that said they need o 
strengthen because we only have one CA on the Board and the 2015 review said that, 
you know, we need to strengthen financial skills. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So was it not strange that in the 2011 Board, you as the Board 
considered and those who reviewed your performance also considered that having one 
chartered accountant was not enough and there should be another one appointed but 
he Board that followed you didn’t have even one chartered accountant, it was strange. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  It opens up the organisation for risk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I know that you left when the new Board started but maybe you 
do know how long it took before they – before a chartered accountant was appointed so 
that there could be somebody sitting in the risk committee – risk and audit committee or 
do you not know. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Chair I don’t have that knowledge. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not know yes okay alright, thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Looking at your financial position in 2015 and the contracts 
that you have already secured at that time, if one considered your order book when you 
left the Board of Denel, will some of your work – performance be exhibited in the years 
that follow? 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 75 of 126 
 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes definitely as I said the nature of 
the business of Denel is multi-year contracts, so with multi-year contracts and if you 
have an order book of which the work has not started, you’ve already contracted, so 
you will see the financial results coming through in one, two, three years, it depends on 
the length of the contract at a later stage.  So that order book – but just to note that the 
information set out in paragraph 26 reflected the work of that order book flowing 
through the forecast of the future results.  So it already starts to indicate that you will 
increase their revenue from Denel only from 5.3 billion to 6.3 billion in 2015/2016.  In 
2016/2017 it will go to 7.3 billion, now that is without the revenue that the acquisition of 
Denel Vehicle Systems would have added on, which was, as I indicated previously of 
10 
roundabout 1.3 billion in 2016, 1.4 to 1.5 billion in 2017, with the resultant follow-
through of profits.  So the subsequent results – it’s always difficult you – in a business 
where you’re not in retail and it’s buy and sell situation that you sit with a business 
where you enter into long-term contracts.  The mistakes or the good decisions of today 
will only be seen at a later stage because the profits flow over and the revenue flows 
over the five year or longer term period of the contract.  So obviously the order book of 
35 billion, the benefit of that, you will see then in the results of future years. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you and then in conclusion what would be your 
comment on the Minister’s decision to change the Denel Board and replace them with 
the 2015 Board in the manner in which it transpired in this case? 
20 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  I must say my concluding remarks 
on page 17, paragraph 62, unfortunately, I cannot speculate on the Minister’s reasons 
for making the changes as she did.  I am, however, compelled to state that the 
Minister’s decision to remove the 2011 Board and appoint the 2015 Board does not 
appear to have been reasonable.  I say this for the following reasons, good corporate 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 76 of 126 
 
governance dictates that the rotation of the Board members should seek to achieve 
continuity of members.  Historically only one third of Board members would be rotated 
at a time, this will ensure continuity of Board members and stability in the company 
whilst also bringing in new members.  The 2011 Board has been highly effective there 
should have been no reason, based on the performance of the Board, for the removal 
of the full Board (indistinct) and the 2011 Board was in the midst of a successful 
turnaround strategy which included various projects that were ongoing.  The removal of 
the 2011 Board and its replacement with members who had no knowledge of these 
projects would, and in fact, did jeopardise these projects.  The 2015 Board lacked 
people with necessary skills, for instance a chartered accountant. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  And as I reiterated quite a few times 
was Denel was still in a turnaround period and you only reap the fruits over a period of 
time of a turnaround strategy.  I need to note that our forecast for improved 
performance audit and growth and audit cover, revenue and profitability was 
demonstrated in that information that was included in paragraph 26. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and from your knowledge and experience, was there 
any – was there a Board, Denel Board that was ever appointed before without an 
accountant? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  I can only comment on the Board I 
20 
joined because I replaced a chartered accountant on the Board, I know I had 
specifically as Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee meeting, I had also a hand-over 
meeting with the outgoing Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee in 2010 to make 
sure that I pick up all the issues that’s front of mind for the Audit and Risk Committee at 
that stage that we make sure that we continue the good work that the previous Board 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 77 of 126 
 
was doing. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair that will be all for this witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  What would have been the impact of the absence of a 
Board member with financial skills and expertise by way of (indistinct) chartered 
accountant, what would have been the impact of the absence of such a member of the 
Board on their Risk and Audit Committee in your opinion? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Chair it is the insight into the 
financial matters as you would note that Denel was still in a turnaround strategy, 
number one, so the financial performance and interrogation of financial performance, 
understanding how the underlying contracts were working and how it relates to the 
10 
forecasted and achievement of results, both in revenue as well as a nett profit.  
Secondly Denel was also in the process of managing cash quite tightly because cash 
was always a big problem, you know, as I said – as you may receive advanced 
payments from your customers but that money is ring fenced and secondly – so you 
need to make sure that you manage cash appropriately.  Number three there was a 
process in place that we’re looking at acquisitions so it’s looking at the valuation of the 
businesses that you were looking at acquiring and the standard contracting around that 
and then also, how do we deal with the findings of audits, both from your external 
audits and your internal audits and making sure that you’re managing your risk in that 
regard.  So the Audit Committee, in most instances is the filter for Boards to make sure 
20 
that you interrogate numbers, controls and risks quite deeply. 
CHARIPERSON:  Would it be correct to say it’s a critical committee in any Board, in 
any Company? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes Chair. 
CHARIPERSON:  It is? 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 78 of 126 
 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:   Yes Chair. 
CHARIPERSON:  And in the absence of a Board member with that kind of expertise 
would the position have been that the Board would have had to rely on executive – 
members of the executive management for advices in regard to risk and auditing 
matters? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:    Yes Chair. 
CHARIPERSON:   And how desirable is it that the Board should rely on that advice 
without the advice of an independent person such as would have been the case if there 
was a member of the Board who is not an executive who had the skills and expertise to 
advise the Board? 
10 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Chair you’re running the risk that 
you do not know the deeper details and that you do not identify the risks, you cannot 
interrogate that’s been put in front of you in an appropriate manner. 
CHARIPERSON:  At this stage I don’t know as to when – after the Board had been 
appointed somebody was appointed who had the financial expertise who may have 
been a chartered accountant and the legal team must look at that, that we must know 
exactly when that gap was filled, so I don’t know.  To what extent would that challenge 
have had an impact on the job – in the financial performance of the company that we 
were told about yesterday after 2016, are you able – is that something you are able to 
say that it would have had an impact or is that something that you would be unable to 
20 
say? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Chair, there may be – maybe from 
an outsider point of view that I can give you some views.  An Audit and Risk Committee 
interrogates also strategic decisions so for instance, the decision to turn around and not 
to continue with the equity partnership with the land systems or the DBS acquisition, 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 79 of 126 
 
you needed to run the numbers to understand the impact on the financial position of 
Denel by making that decision.  For instance in the 2014 May Board meeting where the 
Board decided to proceed with the transaction, the Audit and Risk Committee was 
tasked with reviewing the valuations, interrogating the numbers that were put on the 
table.  So the Audit and Risk Committee was the filter for the Board on an ongoing 
basis as required to be able to interrogate those type of transactions and the impact on 
Denel itself.   
 
So I would foresee that if there is not a suitably skilled Audit and Risk 
Committee they could not fully fulfil that type of mandate from a Boards side, so you 
open up the port to take the wrong decisions.  So I just tried to contextualise it in the 
10 
history but looking forward, I would say there was a risk, I don’t know if it’s true but I 
think there was a risk that they could not have probably applied their minds 
appropriately or were not tasked to actually interrogate that type of information and 
other transactions.  To note at the Denel Audit and Risk Committee we also dealt, in 
depth, with progress on key programmes that Denel was busy with.  For instance all the 
long-term contracts that Denel entered into, there was detailed reporting done around 
progress to date, costs to complete, what are the challenges, are you making suitable 
progress against the base line programme around it.  That information was then also 
included in the quarterly report that was submitted to the shareholder and I think the 
representative from DPE yesterday, also referred to quarterly reports submitted by 
20 
State owned entities.  So if you are interested to see, I think the DPE can also make 
such a report available to you to see what is the type of information – I know (indistinct) 
the 2015 and before that one look like but there was detailed reporting.  Going back to 
that is the Audit Committee needs to apply their minds and what they need to say is, do 
we need different action to bring this back on track, we need to report back to the Board 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 80 of 126 
 
and say, we need to have specific dedicated action because we see problems arising in 
a specific programme and we needed to alert the Board to that, so that was part  of the 
Audit and Risk Committee function also in that and then secondly, obviously it was also 
then necessary to see,  how over the period of time, you look at revenue recognition of 
a contract as well as the profit recognition because over a multi-year contract you do 
not take the money upfront into the results and the profits upfront into  the results, it’s 
spread over a period of time.   
 
So it is technical accounting but that is part of the role of the audit and risk 
committee specifically Denel in my time we looked at that too. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well we have been speaking about the removal of the 2011 board 
10 
but I just want to check with you was it a removal in the strict sense in the sense that 
people were removed before the expiry of their terms or was it a situation simply that 
their terms came to an end and it was up to the Minister to extend and she did not 
extend and because of the context in which this happened we refer to it as a removal? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Chair I think it is probably a little bit 
both and the reason why I am saying that is if we look at the majority of the board 
members was appointed then in 2011. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  So their term came to an end in 
2014. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  The members that was appointed 
before that on the 2000 – that was appointed in 2010 it was myself and Advocate 
Badela. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 81 of 126 
 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  That was left from that board that 
was appointed during that period of time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  So our terms were extended.  Just 
to note Ms Paledi was in the 2010 appointment we had four members.  It was myself, 
Ms Paledi, Advocate Badela, Professor Marwala and Advocate – no sorry those were 
the three of us that actually joined the board in 2010.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  All the other board members joined 
in 2011 which was the majority. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Of the board.  As I said Doctor 
Cruywagen’s terms was already he was appointed in 2008.  So just to note in 2013 the 
terms – my term specifically was extended for one year only by Minister Gigaba.  
Minister Gigaba I did not think was a big supporter of 3 term boards. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of – a free supporter of? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Of boards that served three terms. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  So – but at that stage I was – my 
term was renewed for one year and then in the 2014 AGM my term was extended for 
20 
another year.  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  By Minister Brown? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  By Minister Brown. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  So what was happening was that 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 82 of 126 
 
the term of  board members that could have gone longer so if the 2003 term was not 
one year extension was not one year but a three year extension my term would have 
then ended in 2016/17 – 17 so it is 2013 plus another three years. So it was by how 
can I say I do not know if it is by design I cannot say it is design I cannot speak a bit on 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  But we were in an unfortunate 
situation that the board’s terms all of them ended at the same time.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  And it was because the process was 
10 
not management appropriately also when other board members term expired or 
terminated the three year term terminated in the years before 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did the date of leaving let me call it that of some of the board – 
members of the board coincide with the date when the one year extension that had 
been effected by Minister Brown came to an end anyway in regard to some of them at 
least. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes he did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or not really. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  That is where Ms Paledi and 
Professor Marwala indicated that they are not available for that one year extension.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but now I am talking about later.  The extension was effected for 
one year by Minister Brown. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I take it that that may have the extension might have affected some 
of the members and not all – but not all because maybe some of the members without 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 83 of 126 
 
the extension would have had to go but others would have been able to continue for 
some time even without that extension? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  The person that was affected by 
that was Doctor Cruywagen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Because he was in the first portion 
of his – his third term. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So but every board member left because his or her term either 
as extended or not extended had come to an end. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And nobody had his or her term terminated before it came to an end 
and when I say term I include the extended term.  Is that right? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes Chair because… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that would be correct? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Minister Brown indicated at the 
2104 AGM where all the terms came to an end. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  And I think there is documentation 
in – within the Department of Public Enterprises. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Also that deals with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Was that at the end of the three 
year term was then for a majority of the board members. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But the fact of the matter I would imagine you would be saying 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 84 of 126 
 
is that when the term of a number of board members came to an end in 2014 their 
terms could have been extended by a full term of three years? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it was not done like that. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  It was not done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  So what I am indicating here is that 
there was a number of board members – there was nine of the board members 
available for the term. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  That could have been extended. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  For a three year period. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and such extension was not given to them? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes.  They were illegible with our 
memorandum of corporation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  To be extended. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  My recollection is that the 2011 board had seems to have a 
reasonable mix in terms of race, is that correct? 
20 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes Chair we had to diversity in 
skills and diversity around representation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And in terms of gender I guess that may have been – it may 
have been lacking a bit there? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Chair we were 2014 board we were 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 85 of 126 
 
four females. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Four females and five males? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Ja, ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Five, we were five females. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Five females. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said the total was nine. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Ja but then Ms Paledi left so we 
were left with four. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  And the original appointment of the 
2011 board we had five females. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Then we have the extension from 
2014 AGM. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Ms Paledi left so then we were only 
four females. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But would it be fair to say both in terms of race and in terms of 
20 
gender. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  It was represented. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was no big complaint? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  There was not a big complain no 
Chair. 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 86 of 126 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was no big complaint ja.  And in terms of the new board the 
2015 board how was it in terms of representation of different races and how was it in 
terms of gender representation? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Chair I have not analysed the 2015 
board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you have not looked at that. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Professional … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Approach to be a professional 
director you do not criticise people that come after you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine, that is fine.  We can look at that ourselves.  I 
thought you might have a notice.  So but certainly in terms of the 2011 board you are 
able to say you do not think that the reason why it may not have been allowed to 
continue might have been to advance transformation in terms of race or gender? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  No Chair we… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because it was quite… 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Out of the board members we had 
one white male, one white female and the rest of the board members were black. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  And as we said the gender 
20 
diversification was four female and five male. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  So it was technically balanced in 
that way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so it might be difficult to say the need for not retaining it or most 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 87 of 126 
 
of its members was based on the need to transform in terms of race or the need to 
transform in terms of gender and it would be in the light of its performance to which you 
testified this morning to which the Deputy Director General testified yesterday also 
testified in terms of skills and performance it has done quite well.  In terms of skills he 
only noted area was that maybe they should be more than one Chartered Accountant 
but other than that in terms of performance and in terms of the mix of skills and 
expertise in terms of gender in terms race everything seemed to be fine? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes Chair your summary is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay thank you.  Anything? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes Chair.  Looking at what the questions that came from 
10 
the Chair looking at the fact that the 2015 board decided on the Denel Asia transaction 
the fact that they did not have someone with the financial skills would that have –would 
that have exposed Denel into making a wrong decision seeing that they did not have 
someone I am borrowing from your words to interrogate the numbers at the time? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Chair my consideration of that yes it 
could be possible that they could not – or did not necessarily consider all the aspects if 
they had not all the skills in place so it could have played a role. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Defintely. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And one last question is that the Audit and Risk Committee 
20 
how does it get appointed?  Does it get appointed by the Minister or is it done after your 
deliberation as board members? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Okay the process of appointing 
Audit and Risk Committees is the board makes proposals to the Minister but at the 
shareholder meeting in terms of the Company’s Act and in terms of our MOI the 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 88 of 126 
 
shareholder at the AGM appoints the members of the Audit and Risk Committeee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now that is interesting I assumed that committees of the board would 
be appointed or decide upon by the board because they are board committees but what 
you are saying is that certainly in relation to the Risk and Audit Committee it is not just 
the board.  The board may have a role to play but ultimately it is the Minister who 
appoints that committee? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Ja.  Ja it is true.  And just not – 
even in private sector your shareholders appoint the Audit Committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The other committees of the board? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  No. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  They are appointed by the board itself? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  By the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By way of voting? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  By voting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  You know there is a deliberation 
process not all of the state owned entity boards have a nominations committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  If you have a nominations 
committee it is usually the chairman of the board that is the chairman of the 
20 
nominations committee, the company’s secretary gives input as well as the MD or the 
Chief Executive Group Executive gives input and other members of the board sits on 
the nominations committee,  In instances where you do not have such a nominations 
committee it is a consideration process of allocation of resources to the appropriate 
committees and it is brought back to the board to approve. 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 89 of 126 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so the Risk and Audit committee is the only committee of the 
board of Denel that was required to be appointed by the Minister? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes by the shareholder yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I assume that might be because of its singular importance? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  It is a very important committee? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes Chair as I said even in private 
sector. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  It plays quite an important role. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  And so that is why there is a 
shareholder vote on it and in the instance for public sector entities like state owned 
entities it is appointed by the Minister and her role as shareholder or his role. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am sure – I am sure we will hear from the Minister in due 
course but it makes it all the more stranger why in appointing the members of the board 
she did not make sure that there was at least one person who had the right expertise 
and skills to serve on the Risk and Audit committee such an important committee. But 
we will hear from her in due course and I do not think you would be able to say much in 
that regard? 
20 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes Chair I could not read the 
Minister’s mind. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Ja no thank you. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair that will be all from my side. 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 90 of 126 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  You have something you want to say? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Chair just one aspect that I forgot to 
deal with under the paragraphs 31 to 37 on the LAN systems or the Denel Vehicle 
Systems Acquisition. 
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  YEs. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  And if I can recall correctly from 
public comment there was remarks made around the nature of the funding that was put 
in place because some it was longer term and some shorter term.  And just to note that 
the consideration there was if you put longer term funding in place for the full purchase 
10 
price by the time the equity partner that was planned and sought and in the process of 
being put in place if you have to repay a long term loan before its due then there is 
penalty charges.  So you would pay breakage cost in that type of things so that is why 
there was a shorter term funding leg approved and not all of it long term funding.   
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine.  I know that you said that when there is a review of 
the board to see who must continue who must not continue you – no-one wants to or 
you would not want to create the impression that you want to have your term extended 
but when your – when the 2011 board had to leave were you available and willing to 
continue if you had been asked to? 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes Chair I was as well as a number 
20 
of the other board members. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And you were the only Chartered Accountant in that board and 
if you had been asked you would have been able to actually serve in that – or Risk and 
Audit committee I would have imagined. 
MS MARTIE JACOBA JANSE VAN RENSBURG:  Yes Chair. 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 91 of 126 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you very much for coming to give evidence we 
appreciate it.  For now you are excused.  If later on we should need you to come back

Capital with an I instead of an E. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  And where Issar Capital appears as E can you correct it to I.  
20 
I do not know whether you want us to go through each and every paragraph. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  We can go through I see it in paragraph 33. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Well let us start with 29. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Paragraph 29. 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 94 of 126 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  And paragraph 30 and paragraph 33. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  And paragraph 35. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is two times in paragraph 35. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It looks like there are two areas in paragraph 35 where the correction 
should be made, line 2 and line 3 or is it different people? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  No, it is different people Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
10 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which one of those should be corrected? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  We are correcting Essar Capital as Essar to Issar. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Line 2 of paragraph 35. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Thank you. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  That is the first correction. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  What will be your next correction? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  My next correction is on page 17, 1-7. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
20 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Paragraph 5-6 where it reads West Dawn I want it to be 
corrected Westdawn Investments as one word, Westdawn Investments. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  So where it says Western Dawn? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  That is correct. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  It should be West Dawn. 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 95 of 126 
 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Westdawn as one word, Investments. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and that appears twice in that paragraph? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  That is correct. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  It is on. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Paragraph. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  The third line from the bottom of the paragraph. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Paragraph 56, ja. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  In paragraph 56.  Thank you. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  My next correction is on page 1-8. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
10 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Paragraph 6-0. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Where it reads “at various” on the first line.  Can that be 
changed to “at one management meeting”, not meetings? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  So the S that is on the second line we also delete? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Also to be corrected. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay.  Are there any other corrections? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Yes.  The last two is on page 21. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  In paragraph 73. 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  I want to change that subsequently to read as follows: 
“Subsequently VRLS was shortlisted and engagements directly 
with Denel commenced.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we should delete the tender came out and? 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 96 of 126 
 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Replace it with the following Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  VRLS. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  VRLS was shortlisted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was shortlisted. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  And engagements directly with Denel commenced. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we deleted the words “the tender came out and” and we deleted 
the words “included in the entities tendering for the project” and the sentence now 
reads after the correction: 
“Subsequently VRLS was shortlisted and engagement with 
Denel commenced.”? 
10 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  The next one is in paragraph 74.  It is just a small change.  
When it came out to completing the tender, I just wanted to change to say offer. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  So tender should be offer? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Should be offer. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  And that applies also in paragraph 76. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
20 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  The first sentence and the last sentence.  Those are the 
only corrections Chair.  My apologies for the corrections. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  So now this statement incorporating these changes do you 
the contents of this statement? 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 97 of 126 
 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Yes I do. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Mr Jiyane I want you to give us your personal history as to 
who you are and your education background?  Shortly, be as crisp and short as you 
can. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Thank you.  My name is Madoda John Jiyane.  I am also 
known as Benny which is my nickname which I also use as my business trading name.  
I am an adult male entrepreneur or businessman and currently a shareholder and 
Director of SVI which is Special Vehicle Innovation and SME which is Specialist 
Mechanical Engineers amongst other directorships.  Both companies involved in the 
Engineering, Steel and the Defence Industry.  I do not know whether you want me to go 
10 
through my educational background until when I started to work in 1985. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not really, just what you consider important you can mention, but you 
do not have to go through all of that. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  I do not think, probably I think it is better for us to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  To get straight to the matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  Do you confirm that you were one of VR Laser 
20 
South Africa shareholders starting from 2007? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Yes, I confirm together with my wife.  We own shares at VR 
Laser Services at that time and the shares were transferred from my name to my wife’s 
name for strategic reasons, but we are both married in community of property.  So it 
does not matter who holds the shares. 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 98 of 126 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And how much was your stake at VR Laser? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  At the beginning it was 30 percent and later it was reduced 
to 25.1 percent. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and you confirm that Mr Gary Bloxham and 
Mr John Van Reenen were your? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Partners. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Core shareholders? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Yes, I confirm and I just want to bring to the Chair that 
John Van Reenen passed away last week. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And other than being a shareholder at VR Laser what 
10 
other role did you play in this company? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  I started as a Marketing Director when I joined on 
1 April 2008 as an Active Executive Director and my role started in marketing running 
the business in terms of growth and later on I became the CEO, Chief Operating 
Officer. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  We are now aware that around 2013, 2014 VR Laser 
was transferred to the Gupta linked companies.  I want you to tell us as to how you got 
introduced to the people who negotiated the sale of your shares. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  The background is that at the time when I was in charge of 
VR Laser Services my other co-partners we were negotiating the reduction of the value 
20 
of the price of the business at a time when I bought in and part of those negotiations 
were about their exit package.  So we negotiated until we found a deal together as the 
three shareholders but if I can raise 120 million to buy them out I could have their share 
of the business together with the property of the company. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  In which year was this? 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 99 of 126 
 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  This was in 2012. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and when did you get introduced then to the Gupta 
linked companies? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  So the background to that, I went around looking for a 
financier to finance this 120 million shareholder buy out.  Unfortunately I did not come 
right, because at the time the economy was not that well and most of the banks were 
averse to financing such deals.  I then also went around to look for other partners who 
can assist me to buy that share.  Hence I also went to SSAB which is Swedish Steel 
Mill which was our major steel supplier and together with Denel because I had known 
Denel and some of the Executive Members for many years.  To me it was making sense 
10 
to have VR Laser probably being bought as a partner by Denel because we are doing 
quite a lot of work for [indistinct] at that stage with the casspir problem. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Do you confirm that VR Laser was a South African 
company?  You had no other business interest outside South Africa? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Yes.  VR Laser was a South African company and it was 
owned by shareholders who are South Africans.  I can confirm that. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And how much value did you attach to this company? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  This business as I reflected in my statement it comes from 
an era of the old rooinek hostel business which was the defence company in South 
Africa prior to 1994.  It was unbanded from that time, but unfortunately it did not take its 
20 
stage in terms of manufacturing of defence equipment.  So when I joined I made sure 
that we can grow this business back to its glory days and to make sure that all the role 
players in the defence industry have this available to them.  So we regarded this 
business from other quarters that it is quite important as a sovereign capability in terms 
of manufacturing armoured vehicles in South Africa. 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 100 of 126 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  In paragraph 27 of your statement you mention the 
names of the Denel Executive Members that you contacted.  One of which was 
Mr Riaz Saloojee, Mr Zwelakhe Ntshepe and Mr Stephan Burger. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  That is correct.  I had always direct links with the following 
people:  Rias Saloojee was the Group CEO of Denel at the time.  We have been 
members also of the Board of AMD.  So we know each other very well and 
Zwelakhe Ntshepe was the Business Development Executive of Denel and also we 
knew each other very well and Stephan Burger who was the CEO of DLS at the time.  
We also knew each other very well.  So I shared this with them to understand the 
importance of VR Laser that if it has to go to other shareholders who are outside the 
10 
country it will be a shame to South Africa to lose that capability. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  By them you are referring to the three? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  I refer to the three gentlemen who I met on separate 
occasions. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Oh, it was on separate occasions? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  It was on separate occasions. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  In February 2013 just take us to what happened 
there? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Ja, in February 2013 we were exhibiting as VR Laser in the 
IDEX Show in Abu Dhabi in UAE and Denel was also exhibiting there.  Zwelakhe came 
20 
to me and said he wants to introduce me to a gentleman [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is Mr Ntshepe? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Yes, Mr Zwelakhe Ntshepe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Ntshepe, ja. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Sorry Chair. 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 101 of 126 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  He said to me he wants to introduce me to a gentleman by 
the name of Salim Essa who might assist me in terms of my acquisition. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Did you know this person?  Did you know his business at 
first? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  I did not know at the time.  So I met him briefly for about five 
or 10 minutes.  Just a quick chat and he said to me should rather meet in South Africa 
when we are back in South Africa to carry on with the discussions. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  The two other people who you mentioned from 
Denel, Riaz and Burger what did they say to you when you approached them regarding 
10 
this/ 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  They also agreed that it is very important to keep VR Laser 
as South African owned because it was a key player not just for Denel but for the entire 
defence industry.  We are the manufacturers of all defence equipment in terms of 
armoured vehicles for the whole defence industry in South Africa. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay.  What made it special? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  What made it special was that it had high tech equipment.  
It had high tech people who were working for the company and the expertise which 
usually in a country like South Africa we would not find very easily.  If I can just 
compare our only competitors who were from the first world countries.  We had other 
20 
two companies.  One was DEMA in USA and the other was called MLT in the UK and a 
German company called Quanto Steel.  So we were really a world class business in 
terms of that competition and we were recognised internationally at that time. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay.  Then take us to what happened in March 2013.  
You deal with that from paragraph 30 of your statement. 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 102 of 126 
 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Just before I say that I just want to emphasise how 
important we were.  At the time BAE Systems which was the major manufacturer of 
armoured vehicles which was subsequently acquired by Denel was our major customer, 
because all their products were cut and burned at VR Laser Services for their South 
African operations and for the US operations. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay.  Thank you Mr Jiyane.  Then you may proceed and 
tell us what happened in paragraph 30. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Okay.  I then met at the time when I returned back to South 
Africa with Mr Salim Essa and he introduced me to his partner Iqbal Sharma.  They 
were both owning Issar Capital.  That is why I was making that correction earlier. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Which was an investment company.  They were keen to do 
the deal with me.  I explained the whole deal to them.  I explained that we wanted to 
increase our shareholding from 25.1 to 30 percent again and also we want to 
participate in the property company of which I was not a participant earlier on and they 
all agreed to that and that I was going to be the CEO of the company as I was already 
running the company, because the CEO then Gary Bloxham had almost semi-retired 
because he was not well and John Van Reenen was not a participant in the business.  
So it was important for me to clear that first with them to understand whether they want 
to be partners or not and we all agreed and they all agreed that we should do the deal. 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Did you know Mr Sharma? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  I did not know Mr Sharma.  I was introduced to him by 
Mr Salim Essa. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Were you aware of his business interests? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  I was not aware to be honest with you.  I only later found out 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 103 of 126 
 
that he was also a Non-Executive Director of Transnet. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Of Transnet? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Of Transnet. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you and your negotiations with Essa and 
Mr Sharma did they go anywhere?  Did they yield any results? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Yes.  They introduced me to Ernest & Young who were their 
transaction advisors.  We submitted information for them to do the valuation of the 
business of which they came back with very positive results in terms of valuation of the 
business and I was waiting for them to put an offer on the table.  They delayed a bit.  
We were just getting worried that what was happening and towards the end of 
10 
September or second week of September I got a call again from Mr Salim Essa to say 
we should have a meeting at Michelangelo together with Mr Sharma and with the new 
people they want to introduce to us who are going to do the deal.  I was introduced at 
that meeting to [indistinct] and Jonathan Loeb of Regiments Capital who were the 
transaction advisors.  I was together with my advocate, I mean my lawyer at the time 
[indistinct] Attorneys to do a transaction. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and then at paragraph 35 you attach the two 
attachments MJJ1 and MJJ2 which are the agreements that were for the sale of. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  VR. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  VR Laser Properties and VR Laser. 
20 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Services. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Services. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  That is correct.  They put the offer on the table.  We 
negotiated that offer.  We had a little changes to make and they signed that 
subsequently about two days or three days later and emailed that to me for us to 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 104 of 126 
 
introduce that to John Van Reenen.  I did not want to introduce them to the two other 
shareholders at the time, because I was the one who was offered the shares and I did 
not want them to go behind my back to talk to the other shareholders without me being 
in control of the process.  Hence I made sure first that we both agree and understand 
the transaction and we all agree how the transaction will pan out.  After that we agreed 
and then I introduced them to the other two shareholders. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Was this deal finalised? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Yes.  The deal did eventually go through and the transaction 
was concluded at the end of December.  I was not privy to that transaction, because 
they did the transaction now directly with the other two shareholders. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Hm. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  But bearing in mind that we had an agreement that after 
that transaction has been completed we will go back and do my deal as we have 
agreed upon. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and that was in December 2013? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  That was December 2013.  The company shut down 
roundabout 16 December.  We went away on holiday and I assumed that everything is 
still intact. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And you were still holding on to your stake at VR Laser? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  I was still holding on to my 25.1 percent there. 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Who owned VR Laser Properties? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  VR Laser Properties was owned by Nyati Blade Processing 
an entity which was later converted to VRLS Properties.  The owners were both Gary 
and John Van Reenen who were the shareholders with a 74 percent shareholders in VR 
Laser Services. 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 105 of 126 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  So you had not stake? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  I had no stake in the property company. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay, thank you and the deal was finalised in December.  
You stil l held your stake on VR Laser Services? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  That is correct. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  I had the 25.1 percent together with my wife. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes, but you had negotiated with Essa and Sharma that 
you will buy back your 4.9 percent? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  That actually we agreed that I will get back my 4.9 percent 
10 
because it was already in the value which was offered to me. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Was he value offered to me at a discount.  So we agreed 
that I will get back to 30 percent as when we start back with the transaction with the 
hope that with my performance we can always increase my shareholding based on the 
performance rules. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay and then you attach the contracts that were signed 
with Bloxham and Van Reenen? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  That is correct. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  It is MJJ3 and MJj4? 
20 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Correct. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  From paragraph 42 you deal with being introduced to 
new management at VR Laser Services. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Ja that. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Just take us through this?  What happened here? 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 106 of 126 
 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  I was a little bit upset because I got a call from my Financial 
Manager as the company opened roundabout 6 January 2014.  She called me to say 
there are gentlemen here who she does not recognise but they say they are the new 
owners of the company and she said to me what should I do.  I said put them into the 
boardroom.  I will make a plan to leave home, because I was still on leave then to arrive 
and talk to them.  I then arrived at the office and I found four gentlemen. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Two of them I recognised because they were involved 
during the due diligence.  Their names were J P Aurora who is late now and 
Jacques Roux and the other two gentlemen introduced themselves as Mr Nath.  The 
10 
other one said I am Tony and I was a little bit agitated because Sharma or Essa did not 
call to let me know that there are two people or there are four people who are going to 
arrive and they wanted to talk to me.  So I then excused myself and phoned Sharma at 
the time. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  I said I do not know these people.  Will you let me know 
what is going on here?  Then his reply was that no they represent the shareholder.  So 
just work with them.  I was a bit agitated at the time. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second.  Thank you, you may proceed. 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  So this Tony did you get to know who Tony was. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  I later found out that Tony is actually Rajesh Tony Gupta. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  When you were in [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  So when these gentlemen came your percentage what 
was it? 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 107 of 126 
 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  It was 25.1 percent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  25 percent. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  25.14 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and during the negotiations was a stage where 
Sharma or Essa told you that they were negotiating this deal on behalf of someone 
else? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Not at all.  Even when I introduced them to the other two 
shareholders that did not come out at all. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  So all along you were labouring under the impression 
10 
that you have entered into a contract with these two gentlemen 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  That is correct. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  That is Essa and Sharma? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  That is correct. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Then what happened then?  These four people came 
to your offices and take us from there. 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  They came to the offices obviously after having a discussion 
with them after I have called Sharma that I must talk to them.  Then they asked me a 
few questions about the business.  I explained a little bit about how the business 
operates and there after the other two gentlemen left and the two which is J P Aurora 
20 
and Jacques Roux remained.  They then wanted to address the staff which is my 
Executive Team.  I said with no problem you can address them, but they did not want 
me to be involved.  I got a little bit worried again.  That what are these people doing in 
the company and what is their role in the business.  At the time I got feedback from my 
staff that they said they actually have to report to them now and that was what started 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 108 of 126 
 
upsetting me, because now my role as COO and still as a shareholder was being 
eroded by people I do not even know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you said Mr Sharma said that you must deal with those people.  
They are new shareholders or? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  He said they represent the shareholder. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They represent the shareholders and who were the shareholders just 
remind me again? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  At the time the shareholders was Elgasolve which was 
owned by Salim Essa.  He was the only shareholder of that company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, at that time? 
10 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you had that 25.1 share? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he was the majority shareholder? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  He was the majority shareholder. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So there were only two share? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Shareholders. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, shareholders? 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So in effect he was saying to you they represented him? 
20 
MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Ja, but it was not him telling me.  I was told by Mr Sharma, 
Iqbal Sharma. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh Mr Sharma yes, yes, yes, but that was the effect of that 
discussion? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  That was the effect of the discussion. 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 109 of 126 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and as at that time there being no discussion that had given you 
an indication that some new people would be coming here and wanting to talk to staff 
about the company and so on? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Nothing at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  The last time I conversed with them was in December, 
Mr Sharma and Mr Essa and the first time I conversed with him is when I phoned him 
after I had these gentlemen in my office and asking who are these. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  And I was still waiting for him to actually have a meeting 
10 
with me as shareholders to discuss how we’re going to move forward with the business. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, okay thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Did you at any stage then meet Essa or Sharma to discuss 
this? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  After ...(intervention)  
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  After the incident yes. 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  After the January – not at all, I never even saw them 
after that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  These two gentlemen spoke to your staff? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Yes they spoke to my staff. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  In your absence? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  In my absence ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you got feedback from your staff about part of what they had 
said? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Yes, that they have to report to them on a day to day 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 110 of 126 
 
basis. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, were you in the building? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  I was in the building, yes I was in the building. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you have any discussion with the two gentlemen after they had 
met with the staff on that day? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  I think probably I had after a day or so after, because I 
just, I was getting more actually irritated because I could see there was a little bit of 
hostility because I think I was being seen as being not cooperating of some sort. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but you hadn’t done anything to show any unwillingness to 
cooperate had you? 
10 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  No I didn’t do at all and I even advised my staff to 
cooperate with them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, okay, thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And then from paragraph 45 you said, you’re saying you 
were very, you became very uncomfortable and you later deal with your reason for your 
unease, can you tell us why were you uncomfortable? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  I was uncomfortable because I was the director of the 
company,  these two gentlemen were not even directors of the company at all and my 
responsibility as a director and a shareholder was being eroded without recourse in any 
way, and that’s why I was a little bit uncomfortable.  Not a little bit, I was really upset. 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and then did you then iron out your issues with these 
guys? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Eventually after I think about a week or two I then got 
really, really to a point where I could see that we are getting nowhere, because those 
other two gentlemen are not coming back because they said they will arrange a 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 111 of 126 
 
meeting to have with me and they were not coming back, so I decided to confront JP 
Aurora and Jacques Roux to say I need to get out of this, because this is not what we 
negotiated and I am uncomfortable with this deal, I rather want to know who I should 
speak to, to sell my shares, I want to exit, otherwise I still have a recourse to unwind 
the whole deal because I still had calling of (indistinct) as a minority shareholder. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  But was it – what were your options as a minority 
shareholder? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  The options were obviously limited but I think the law 
still protects you in terms of certain things which were negotiated and they were not 
10 
met.  I could go that route, and that’s why I wanted to know what is their standpoint, do 
they want me to be part of the business or do they want me out, and it was very clear 
that they wanted me out. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes, and then from paragraph 52 ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Before that, prior to these two gentlemen coming to the company that 
you didn’t know your relationship with the majority shareholder how had it been up to 
that point? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Which shareholder, the previous shareholder or the new 
shareholder? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No the one as at the date that the two gentlemen came to the 
20 
company, you said there was a majority shareholder. 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  It was Salim Essa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, how was your relationship with him? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  There was no relationship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, he just bought the shares ...(intervention)  
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 112 of 126 
 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  He just bought those shares and he disappeared. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He just bought the shares and then there was nothing? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay, thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you, and then from paragraph 52 you deal with the 
sale of your shares? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Yes I go through that sale of my shares, the first thing I 
was upset because I’m now being betrayed now I’ve got to negotiate with people I don’t 
even know, because JP Aurora said to me you’ve got to negotiate with me, so I then put 
down my negotiation points because the point at the time was that at least I should be 
10 
compensated the same as the other two shareholders which they bought out, so that 
was not even the starting point, he didn’t want to go that route he said you are not 
going to get that money which you want, and we really got into a lot of arguments and it 
was really uncomfortable, it took me a couple of days and it really affected me because 
form a health point of view it started really working on me.  I had to sit down with the 
family and decide that I think we should just accept what they offer and get out of there 
and that’s how I eventually sold the shares. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And when was this? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  It was sold probably roundabout the middle of February 
when we signed our agreement. 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  2014? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  2014 ja, just two/three weeks after all this. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  But your initial intention was never to ...(intervention)  
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  The initial intention was never to sell, I was very 
passionate about that business, I had built that business literally from just a steel 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 113 of 126 
 
service centre to be a world class manufacturing facility. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes, and who then bought your shares? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  The shares were bought by a company called Crashaw 
Investments, when I looked the company as a shelf company, that was my first reaction 
because I was concerned that who is buying my shares, if it was being bought by the 
other majority shareholder I would have understood because he was the majority 
shareholder and there’s a new entity now which is buying my shares, then I got 
assurance from the JP Aurora that no you shouldn’t be worried, the shareholder of 
Crashaw Investment is Westdawn Investments of which is a company which is well 
known because I think it owned JSC Mining at the time, so I was comfortable that I will 
10 
get my money. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes, and if you look at Exhibit W5A, Westdawn Investment 
was owned by Duduzane Zuma and Tony Rajesh Gupta at the time, in 2014? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You didn’t say what page number? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Oh sorry, it’s W5A at page 142. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, I don’t really need to look do I? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Not really Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
20 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  That is correct, they were the ... 
CHAIRPERSON:  They were the shareholders? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  They were the shareholders ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Do you confirm that Mr Jiyane? 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 114 of 126 
 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  I confirm that. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And then you attest the agreement that you entered into 
with Crashaw is MJJ5? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  That is correct, that’s the Sale of Shares Agreement 
which also includes my employment contract which I had to sign in terms of the Sale of 
Shares Agreement. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Then did you have any dealings then with V R Laser South 
Africa after the sale of your shares? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  I didn’t at all, the last day I finished was the last day of 
February and they did me a small for all my staff and that was the last time I saw V R 
10 
Laser. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Because I was also barred from talking to any staff for 
at least two years or doing any business related to what V R Laser was doing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was that all about, why was it necessary for you to be barred 
from talking to staff? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  I don’t know, maybe they thought I could probably start 
another company and then come and recruit the staff and probably compete with them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes, you said you left at the end of February which year? 
20 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  2015. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes, then from February 2014 when you sold your shares 
and February 2015 what were you still doing at V R Laser? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  I was still as a registered COO and a director of the 
company, they then started involving me a little bit in terms of asking me for my opinion, 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 115 of 126 
 
which I did give because I was still passionate about the business and I was also very 
concerned about the staff, because it’s important for the transition of the business from 
one shareholder to another that there is stability, so I really cooperated in terms of 
making sure that whatever the business requires I make sure that it’s done and I was 
also concerned because there was no real CEO which was being handed down to the 
company to run the company.  I raised that with JP Aurora and eventually I think the 
second half of the year they brought in a gentleman, Pieter van der Merwe, to become 
the CEO, so I then got comfortable that I can then take him around to go and meet the 
stakeholders of V R Laser, all the customers, all the suppliers and all the other 
stakeholders in terms of what we deal with in terms of the arms industry. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  By saying they involved me a bit what exactly, how did 
they involve you? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  They involved me the first I think roundabout April they 
invited me to go to China with them, to China South (indistinct) with my technical 
director. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  What was the reason for that? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  The reason was that we were just going to explore and 
see Chaneroll does and see whether V R Laser can be incorporated into that kind of 
manufacturing facility. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay are there any other international trips that you 
20 
made? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Yes I made another trip but that was in terms of Denel 
inviting all their suppliers to Malaysia for another problem which V R Laser was 
involved with so I travelled also to that. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes, the China trip was in which year? 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 116 of 126 
 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  It was in 2014, roundabout April if I’m not mistaken. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  April 2014? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and when last did – sorry, when did you resign as a 
director of V R Laser? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  I resigned at the end of February 2015. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  2015? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  That is correct, it is 12 months from the day I signed the 
agreement. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And how much loss did you incur by selling your shares? 
10 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Just from the face value from what they paid the other 
shareholders versus what they paid me the difference was close to R8million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And did the difference in time between the sale of the other, the 
shares, your shares and the time when they bought the other shares was about how 
long? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  It was just about a month, they closed the deal in 
December, I sold my shares in February. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  So it’s about a month. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And there is nothing of any significance that had happened 
20 
...(intervention)  
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Nothing of any significance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...which could affect the value to these shares. 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  To affect the valuation yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and you have – did you know why they would have been 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 117 of 126 
 
prepared to buy the other shares at a higher price than yours, or you don’t know? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  I just think that they were probably up to some other 
ways of maybe getting rid of me because they thought maybe because of the structure 
of the deal previously that they can force me out because they called for the 
shareholders loan which was always outstanding between the two entities, which was 
the old company, when I bought in, versus the new company, which was over 
R200million of which they thought that if they put that on my head then my shares will 
be worth nothing, but they forgot that during the negotiations which I had with the other 
shareholders that loan was also offered to me, so I had control of that loan, so that’s 
why then it was in writing and they actually went, they tried to threaten me that I can 
10 
walk without anything then I revoked that and showed them that they cannot do that, 
otherwise I will reverse the whole deal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  But I think the intentions were becoming very clear that 
actually I was not part of what they wanted, eventually. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Mr Jiyane will you please try and give names instead of 
using they or their. 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Okay, when I say they I’m talking about the other two 
shareholders or I would say actually Salim Essa because he was the shareholder of the 
20 
V R Laser Services. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  Then from paragraph 60 then you deal briefly 
with your interactions with the Gupta family. 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:   Correct.  
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  During the 12 months in which you were at  V R Laser. 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 118 of 126 
 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Which I was at V R Laser Services, I said I met Ajay 
Gupta at one of the management meetings. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  It was the first time he addressed a meeting, it was the 
first time I saw also somebody from the Gupta family coming to address V R Laser 
management team. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes, before the sale of your shares at V R Laser did you 
know anything about the Gupta family? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  I would have probably read through the newspapers 
about some of – I think they had AN7 and I think there was that wedding which was 
10 
creating a lot of interest from a news point of view, other than that I didn’t know 
anything about them. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Did you know of any links that Mr Essa or Mr Sharma had 
with the Guptas? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  I didn’t not at all, if I knew that I would have probably 
had a different view altogether. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And why?  
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  I would have then really had a different view in terms of 
if somebody is a proxy for somebody and he doesn’t declare that when you have 
negotiations then definitely the trust doesn’t exist at all, because you’re dealing with 
20 
somebody who is already not sure whether he should be representing himself or not, 
and I would have had a problem.  That’s why I do say that if I had at least the 
opportunity to meet the Guptas and they said offer me the business then I would have 
had the chance to find out why they want the business. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes, and then who took over your position when you left V 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 119 of 126 
 
R Laser? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  It was taken over by Peter van der Merwe. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And who was Peter van der Merwe? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  He was their attorney, he used to be the attorney from 
Van der Merwe & Associates, he became their CEO. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Their meaning who? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Meaning their – when I say their attorney, excuse me he 
was representing the other shareholders I would just combine it like that. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Essa ...(intervention)  
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Essa and Crashaw now because I would have sold my 
10 
shares by then.   
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay then on page 20 of your statement you deal with the 
Hoefyster transaction which was awarded to V R Laser, can you give us some 
background? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Some background, okay.  I don’t want to bore the 
Commission but the Hoefyster Project is quite a very important project in the defence 
industry in South Africa.  It’s one of the replacement of an infantry fighting vehicle of 
which there has been a lot of discussions from a land mobility point of view that South 
African Defence Force requires that vehicle.  So as part of building the capability and 
capacity of V R Laser one of them was to position V R Laser to be able to supply as a 
20 
key supplier to that contract.  So the background to that I had already made a lot of 
marketing efforts to make sure that I raise the profile of V R Laser to all stakeholders to 
understand that there is this capability.  I still remember when Denel was also providing 
some of the input for the decisions to be made they showed also the capability of V R 
Laser as part of being the capability residing in South Africa to be able to execute this 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 120 of 126 
 
program, so I was also passionate about that program, that’s why I worked so hard to 
make sure that V R Laser becomes part of it eventually and it gets awarded part of that 
contract to execute. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and in paragraph 73 where you made a correction 
there is a contract that you were given in 2014, can you give us the background as to 
how this came about? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  The background to that is as I’ve corrected on 
paragraph 73, I say subsequently V R Laser Services was shortlisted, there was a letter 
which came from Denel which is I think what you’re referring to as MJJ9271/05.1. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Chairperson based on the correction that was made at 
10 
paragraph 73 Mr Jiyane gave us some documents which I beg leave to hand up, we will 
insert those documents just behind Annexure MJJ5 to make the statement to flow and I 
have numbered ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  But the documents are not referred to in the statement are they? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  No they’re not referred to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You should know. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  They are not referred to in the statement, but I would like 
the Chairperson to have these documents, I may add them to our reference 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe what we can do is we can take them as separate exhibits and 
20 
he talks to them, or he later on does a supplementary affidavit and refers to them but 
can testify about them now, so it can be one of the two.   
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  I think we will ask him to do a supplementary affidavit and 
attest to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 121 of 126 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  But for now I will beg leave to hand up these documents 
where Mr Jiyane speaks to that.   He has a copy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we – you will ask him questions about them, he will testify about 
them but we want to make them separate exhibits, maybe a supplementary affidavit to 
which they will be attached. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  Mr Jiyane the document that I have handed p 
to the Chairperson what is this document? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  This document basically explains the process which 
10 
was followed to request V R Laser to put a proposal for the Hoefyster platform 
components.  
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes, the letter on page 1? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  The letter on page 1 is dated the 6th of June. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry which one?  What I have here is first the letter, you marked 
it MJJ51 for what it’s worth and then there is another letter after that and then there is – 
I don’t whether that is a separate document or it’s part of that letter, so is the sequence 
I have is my sequence correct, is it the same as yours? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes, it’s the same as mine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright, why don’t we start with the letter then? 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes, let’s start with the letter that is ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  It doesn’t seem to have a date that letter? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  There is a date ... 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  There’s two letters Chair, ja I think. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes there is the top letter. 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 122 of 126 
 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where do I see, where’s the date for the letter? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  It is on the top right hand side, on line probably 3. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  It’s line 4. 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Line 4. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  On the top right hand side corner, it’s in very small init  
CHAIRPERSON:  At the address? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes, there’s a date of the 6th of June 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the date? 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  6th June 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes it’s very hidden, okay ja, so we can refer to that as the letter 
of the 6th of June. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and that letter is signed by Mr Henk van der Heever. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, why don’t you first identify – oh the next one is also 6th of 
June. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But are they addressed to the same person?  No? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Yes, correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  They are both addressed to the same person. 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  That is correct. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay the one is, the first one is one page, the second one is 
...(intervention)  
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 123 of 126 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Is three pages. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Two is three pages, so that’s how we will refer to them to make a 
distinction for the reader of the transcript.  Okay, you want to ask questions about the 
one page letter dated 6th June. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes, the one page letter that is on the first page of this 
document what does it inform us? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  It informs us that they request us to update a proposal 
which we submitted in April 2012 regarding the Hoefyster Platform components and 
they required us to make sure that we cover the following; the price of the armour steel 
excluding mine protection, the price for mine protection only, and the prices should 
10 
exclude any jigs and fixtures which will be free issued by Denel.  Then the second letter 
...(intervention)  
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  It requests for the Hoefyster Platform components, it 
gives a background of how they are going to evaluate the successful bidder, and it 
gives the quantities of the number of vehicles required and it goes through the whole 
process how we are going to be evaluated as suppliers in that letter.  I just want to 
make that correction because on my statement I said it was a tender and it was not a 
tender, it was an invitation to offer a price. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, I may have missed, are you making a correction on the 
20 
one page letter? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  No, I made correction on my statement Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I remember that. 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  That was the reason why I made the correction because 
I was going to refer to these matters. 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 124 of 126 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and you confirm that by making this offer Denel did not 
follow the prescribed tendering processes that ought to be followed? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  I am not sure how they were going to do their process 
but I think as the process or the complexity of the acquisition I’m sure that they had to 
agree on some way how they’re going to invite certain companies which probably 
qualify to manufacture this. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes, and this letter came from the division of Denel, from 
Denel Land System? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  It came from Denel Land System, which is the division 
10 
which is in charge of the Hoefyster Project. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes, do you know who was in charge of the procurement in 
this division? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Henk van der Heever was the procurement officer and 
at that time I think it was Celia Malapela was the executive in charge of procurement. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And who was heading this division? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  It was Stephan Burger who was the CEO. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  Then on paragraph 77 you deal with your 
resignation, yourself and your wife and you attached two annexures, MJJ6 and MJJ7. 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  That is correct, that is my official resignation and my 
20 
wife as directors of V R Laser. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  After this did you have any dealings with V R Laser? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  No dealings at all with V R Laser. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Do you know anything about V R Laser, Denel Asia 
transaction? 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 125 of 126 
 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  I do not know anything about Denel Asia, Denel Land 
System Asia or V R Laser Asia because I was not part of that, it was after I have left. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Mr Jiyane I have nothing further. 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Thank you so much. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Sorry Chair, there is just question that came to me, can I 
just ask one more question to Mr Jiyane.  This offer that we just spoke about in 
paragraph 73 do you know if it was made to other service providers or tenderers? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  I think it was because at one of the technical meetings I 
attended together with my engineers there were other role players who were our 
competitors. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And the offer itself do you know if it was made to other 
people, other than V R Laser? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  I assume that because they were invited to these 
meetings that they would have also been submitted their offer. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  But you have no personal knowledge? 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  I don’t have any personal knowledge. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Mr Jiyane.  That is all Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Thank you very much Mr Jiyane for coming to give your 
evidence, we appreciate it.  If there is a need to call you to come back you will be 
contacted but thank you very much.  I think the legal team will arrange with you for a 
20 
supplementary affidavit to be done, but thank you very much, and you are excused. 
MR MADODA JOHN JIYANE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chairman, that’s the evidence that’s to be led 
today, we will start again as you have indicated at half past nine tomorrow morning with 
19 MARCH 2019 – DAY 69 
 
Page 126 of 126 
 
the evidence of Mr Saluji.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, had we known we would have made sure that that witness was 
here today so we could have used another hour. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Indeed so Chair, but believe me we have quite a bit of 
work on our plates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sure you do. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And we appreciate going back to the office to do that work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I am sure you do.  How many witnesses have we got tomorrow? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Just one, I think it will be all day, he is quite – there is a lot 
that he has to tell the Commission. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but do we need to start at half past nine or should we amend 
that and start at ten? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  It would be more convenient Chairman to start at ten, if 
that’s ... 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, well as long as we will finish, we don’t want to start early and we 
then finish early, we will rather start early if we are going to be able to use the full, the 
whole day but it’s sometimes difficult to say so what’s your judgment? 
MS ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Chairman so that I don’t incur your wrath let’s start at half 
past nine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright, we will adjourn then and start at half past nine 
20 
tomorrow.  We adjourn. 
MZ ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 20 MARCH 2019
