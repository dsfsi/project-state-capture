PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 14 JANUARY 2021 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Seleka, good morning 
everybody. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
Morning 
Chairperson. 
 
Morning 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see there is no file here.  Are you 
ready? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I am ready Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay go ahead. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Chairperson to – 
10 
today we have got three witnesses scheduled to testify.  
The first witness is Ms Matsietsi Mokholo.  And Chair 
because there are three we will in due course if the 
Chairperson does agree on the time allocation for them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well luckily this witness should not be 
long. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us just start and we will see how it 
20 
goes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Chair I have – I believe she 
is ready to take the oath or the affirmation. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 4 of 274 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay maybe do you not want to 
just tell the public for their benefit where her evidence fits 
in.  Where this witness’ evidence fits in. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Where it fits in now Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes just so that they will follow her 
evidence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Better. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes I did not – it is because I did not 
hear the last word.  Yes the Ms Mokholo is the former DGD 
of the Department of Public Enterprises.  She has provided 
the commission with evidence that shows or affidavit in 
which she deals with her position at the time assisting 
Minister 
Lynne 
Brown 
in 
matters 
pertaining 
to 
the 
department and SOE’s.   
How she accompanied the Minister to a meeting 
called on the 11 March by Eskom.  The board of Eskom at 
the time dealing with the suspensions.  She would also – it 
20 
features also in regard to the secondment of Mr Brian 
Molefe. 
 
It 
features 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
position 
and 
appointment of Mr Richard Seleke at the Department of 
Public Enterprises.  And it features insofar as she was part 
of the war room that was established at Eskom. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 5 of 274 
 
 
So it – it is not an evidence in regard to the 
transactions which we have been busy with.  Chairperson 
she had been called – we had hoped to lead her evidence 
last year but we ran out of space so she – it is mainly 
about the suspensions in that regard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Her evidence will include what she knows 
about the postponement of the meeting of the 26 February. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2015 is that right? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  the 26 February? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  26 February 2015 was she not the acting 
DG who got a call. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From the former President Mr Zuma to 
say the meeting of the board of Eskom which was 
scheduled for the 26 February should be postponed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or cancelled. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct.  You are absolutely correct 
Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is quite an important feature of her 
evidence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  As the Chairperson was talking 
about it came to mind that she also talks about the call she 
received from the President at the time asked her to call 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 6 of 274 
 
Mr Tsotsi in order to cancel that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and of course she was with the 
Minister at the meeting of the board. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That happened between the Minister and 
the board on the 11 March 2015. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course I have had a lot of evidence 
about the content of that meeting.  She might just confirm 
certain things but I have heard quite a lot of evidence on 
10 
that and if her evidence is not different there might not be 
any need to spend too much time on it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes thank you Chair that is – that helps 
us in guiding her – how to navigate her evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  She may take the… 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
You 
can 
administer 
the 
oath 
or 
affirmation. 
20 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MS MOKHOLO:  Matsietsi Mohkolo. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
MS MOKHOLO:  No I do not. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 7 of 274 
 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry your voice is very soft please 
raise it Ms Mokholo. 
MS MOKHOLO:  Apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Start afresh. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Matsietsi Mokholo. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
10 
MS MOKHOLO:  No I do not. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes I do. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give 
will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the 
truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help 
me God. 
MS MOKHOLO:  So help me God. 
REGISTRAR:  Thank you. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  Chairperson 
the bundle we are using is Eskom Bundle 10 Exhibit U22. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ms Mokholo you will have the same 
bundle in front of you – Eskom Bundle 10 Exhibit U22.  
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 8 of 274 
 
Your affidavit is marked Exhibit U22 and it is found on 
page 420 of that bundle. 
 
Now you know if you have been following the 
commission we referring to the pagination – the black 
pagination – top left hand corner.  You are there? 
MS MOKHOLO:  Thank you I am there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  So that is the first page of 
the affidavit.  I the undersigned Matsietsi Mokholo you 
confirm that to be your name?  You confirm that to be your 
name? 
10 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes it is my name Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  The affidavit runs up to page 436. 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  On page 436 there is a signature of the 
deponent on 25 September 2020.  Is that your signature? 
MS MOKHOLO:  It is my signature Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you so you confirm the contents 
of your affidavit? 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I know you have mentioned that you 
20 
needed to make some corrections you want to raise that 
now? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Thank you.  Chairperson just two minor 
edits. The first one it is found on paragraph 19. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chair that is on page 425. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 9 of 274 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOLO:  The last – the sentence of that paragraph 
Chairperson where it indicates that the allegations of the 
phone call he had received from me on the evening of the 
25 February 2020 the date should be 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOLO:  The next one Chairperson it is on 
paragraph 48 and that will be on page 431. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry what paragraph is that? 
10 
MS MOKHOLO:  Paragraph 48.  It is the correction of the 
PNG Committee members Ms Venete Klein instead of Ms 
Venter Klein Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Say again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will the technicians just adjust the 
aircon.  It is just too noisy. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I will ask everybody to try and raise 
their voices.  Yes so what paragraph 46 did you say 46? 
MS MOKHOLO:  48 Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  48 yes.  What do you want to correct in 
that paragraph? 
MS MOKHOLO: The name of the PNG Committee member 
Ms – it must be Ms Venete. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 10 of 274 
 
MS MOKHOLO:  Instead of Ms Venter Klein. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Instead of Venter Chair. 
MS MOKHOLO:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who was it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  She – it reads Chair Venete. 
MS MOKHOLO:  Ms Venete  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it B or V at the beginning? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is V. 
MS MOKHOLO:  V. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  V-e-n-e-t-e. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  V.   
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes thank you Chairperson that will be all 
the edits. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you recall – do remember to have a 
small supplementary affidavit done to [00:10:08] these 
corrections. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  Let me check 
with the Chairperson the – the other alternative Chair 
would be for her to initial our affidavits where she has 
made these corrections. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No she cannot initial it. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 11 of 274 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now because this is an affidavit she did 
before a Commissioner of Oaths. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She cannot change it – she cannot 
change anything on it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because that would be a different 
affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We will do so. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is why it is necessary to do a 
supplementary affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja we will do a supplementary for her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see if we – if we leave it on the 
basis of the corrections she has done orally you have to 
make sure that everyone who reads the affidavit goes to 
the transcript. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In order to see the correction.  But that is 
risky.   
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is better to have a supplementary 
affidavit that would be put in so that anyone who will have 
to 
see 
that 
supplementary 
affidavit 
in 
saying 
what 
corrections have been made. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 12 of 274 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja and we can resend it to also. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  To the parties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She can do the supplementary affidavit 
later today or after today.  Just one paragraph. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Saying I just want to – I have picked up 
that 
there 
were 
certain 
mistakes 
in 
the 
following 
paragraphs.  These were the mistakes.  The corrections 
are the following.  Ja. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is perfectly in order Chairperson.  
Then I may proceed.  Ms Mokholo thank you for your 
assistance to the commission.  Much of your evidence has 
been put to the witnesses who – some of the witnesses 
who came before the commission already. 
 
So we will try to advise you on what was put to 
them and how they reacted to it.   
 
Firstly 
just 
by 
way 
of 
introduction 
tell 
the 
20 
Chairperson who you are and relative to your evidence to 
the commission what was your position at the time – where 
were you employed? 
MS MOKHOLO:  Thank you.  Chairperson as indicated in 
my affidavit I am currently the Deputy Director General in 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 13 of 274 
 
the Presidency and I am in the main responsible for 
corporate management.  By qualification background I am a 
qualified lawyer and an admitted attorney.  But when I 
joined the Department of Public Enterprises it was in 2007 
as the Chief Director then who was responsible for legal 
counsel and governance. 
 
And in my capacity as the Chief Director I reported 
then to the Deputy Director General the DDG who was the 
head of legal and she subsequently resigned and I started 
acting in her position as the DDG from the 12 January 2011 
10 
until the position was advertised for which I successfully 
applied and was appointed as the DDG responsible for 
legal governance risk and transaction at the time from the 
31 May 2011.   
 
And I remained in that position until I was still 
contracted to act as the Chief Executive Officer at SA 
Express which is one of the entities within the portfolio of 
the Department of Public Enterprises. 
 
And that acting was from December 2017 until 
August 2018 where then I took a lateral transfer to – to the 
20 
Presidency with effect from the 1 September 2018.  
 
So I am still in that position currently.  But during 
my tenure as the DDG at DPE I was also appointed as the 
acting Director General and I have acted in that position 
from time to time including the period between September 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 14 of 274 
 
2014 and September 2015 during the tenure of Minister 
Brown and this is when the position of the DG became 
vacant when Mr Matona resigned to take a position as the 
CEO at Eskom. 
 
So since my appointment as the DDG I have acted 
as the DG on various occasions in the Department during 
the tenure of both Minister Gigaba and Minister Brown. 
 
So that would be the background. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So your – yes your acting – you are 
permanently appointed in the position of DDG from – you 
10 
say from 31 May 2011? 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   31 May 2011.  You then have acting 
stints during the time of your permanent office as a DDG – 
acting stints as an acting DG. 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And that is after what you say Mr 
Matona had left the DPE. 
MS MOKHOLO:  Indeed Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That period of acting is between 
20 
September 2014 to September 2015. 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So in March – in February, March, April 
2015 you  would have been acting as a DG? 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes.  Yes Chairperson. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 15 of 274 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And who was the Minister during this 
time in 2015? 
MS MOKHOLO:  It was Minister Lynne Brown. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Minister Lynne Brown.  Yes now as I 
said your evidence has already been put before the 
witnesses.  If this position was – when this position was 
vacant where – was there a time in which the department 
sought to fill that position?  The one in which you were 
acting the DG position. 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes Chairperson when I – Minister 
10 
appointed me to – she indicated as well that she would like 
to fill the position in the department because this was also 
a standard that we were trying to uphold that we do not 
want a too long vacancies as similar in the SOE’s.  
Because at that time a lot of SOE’s were having vacancies 
so the principle was as a shareholder department we must 
uphold the principle that we do not want two vacancies that 
are extended for a long period of time or actings that are 
extended for a period of time.  So there was an indication 
and the intent to fill the position. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So tell the Chairperson whether or not 
did you – was there an advertisement for the position 
during the time when you were acting?  Did you apply for 
this position?  Did you succeed if you applied? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before that can you confirm the 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 16 of 274 
 
period during which you were acting DG?  Was it only the 
month of September 2015? 
MS MOKHOLO:  Before then there were other – as I 
indicated Chairperson that I would act from time to time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but just before – just after Mr Matona 
had left for what period did you act as DG? 
MS MOKHOLO:  It was for a year from the September 2014 
to the end of September 2015. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh – oh by the way he left – it was in 
2014 that he left the Department of Public Enterprises to 
go to Eskom that is Mr Matona. 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes.  So I started acting in September so 
that I can – he can do at least the month handover on 
critical matters that a DG would persist with and then he 
started his position in Eskom in October.  So my acting 
was September 2014 to September 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In September was he still DG but not 
working maybe on leave or had he ceased to be DG – Mr 
20 
Matona in September 2014? 
MS MOKHOLO:  He was still the DG.  He was doing his 
handover to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MS MOKHOLO: Yes. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 17 of 274 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MOKHOLO:  And preparing to take over. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOLO:  So he was serving like notice he had 
resigned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so he was not actually at work? 
MS MOKHOLO:  He was not actually at work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So that is why you – somebody had 
to be appointed to act in his position. 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you acted from September 2014 
until when? 
MS MOKHOLO:  Until September 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright.  No that is the clarity I 
wanted. 
MS MOKHOLO:  The tenure of twelve months. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then somebody else acted as DG in 
October and November 2015 and Mr Seleke was then 
20 
appointed with effect from 1 December 2015? 
MS MOKHOLO:  2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  We make sure that we make a 
clear distinction between Seleke and Seleka. 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes, yes Chairperson I have trained 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 18 of 274 
 
myself on that yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I – I do not think there is anything 
wrong Mr Seleka for you to insist that you are Seleka not 
Seleke. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I also insist that I am Zondo I 
am not Zonde.  So both in the case of Seleka and Seleke 
10 
and Zonde and Zondo the difference just one alphabet. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And it can make a huge difference too. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it can make a big difference. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And indeed Chair my recollection is that 
20 
Mr Matona was appointed as the CEO at Eskom effective 1 
October 2014.  Yes Ms Mokholo you were answering that 
question about the advertisement for the post and whether 
or not you applied for this position of DG. 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes I had an interest in the position 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 19 of 274 
 
Chairperson.  I applied and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it advertised? 
MS MOKHOLO:  It was advertised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  When was it advertised do you 
remember? 
MS MOKHOLO:  I think the first advert Chair should have 
been in – towards the end of the year but it was closing I 
think it was around February the following year – February 
2015 it was – that should have been the first advert. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright. 
10 
MS MOKHOLO:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you applied for the position? 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes I did Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Continue. 
MS MOKHOLO:  And then the – I had – when I was 
appointed acting DG I – we appointed another colleague to 
be the DDG to be responsible for the legal governance and 
risk and so the idea also was that I should not be 
20 
conflicted 
in 
dealing 
with 
two 
positions. 
 
Because 
sometimes you can act as a DG and but still do your main 
responsibility from your original position.  But in this case 
we deviated those two.  Again because I did indicate it to 
the Minister my interest I would be applying for the 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 20 of 274 
 
position so that then as the DDG legal you do not have to 
be advising at the same time your HR which would be then 
be ceased with the adverts and the [00:23:16] relating to 
the position.  So for that reason there was somebody else 
who was the acting DDG for legal governance and risk.  So 
I applied for the position the first time around.  Then the 
advert closed and with time I did not even make a contact 
that much with HR so that [00:23:40]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  The aircon continues to make 
some noise but I must check.  Is it quite hot? I think your 
10 
junior nods because positively. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chair I do not feel particularly hot. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So maybe -   
ADV SELEKA SC:  As the last two days. 
MS MOKHOLO:  Let us see if there are other nods.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  The heat came from everywhere tell us 
changes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you see you not getting a lot of 
support.  Maybe switch it off for now.  Let us see how it is 
later on.  And your junior must just ask you to indicate to 
20 
me when she thinks it is becoming unbearable and then we 
will see what can be done.  It is just that it makes it 
difficult for me to hear what the witness is saying as well 
as Mr Seleka.  Okay alright.  So I hope somebody has gone 
to adjust it.  It may be they do not need to switch if off they 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 21 of 274 
 
just need to adjust it.  I am not sure exactly what needs to 
be done technically.  But if they switch it off let us see and 
your junior will indicate. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright.  I am sorry I interrupted 
you Ms Mokholo.  Do you want to continue? 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes thank you Chairperson.  So yes and 
then I had applied for the position and I left it there.  And 
later 
on 
then 
I 
received 
communication 
through 
HR 
indicating that the position is going to re-advertised again 
10 
and the reasons were that the 
1.  The first one was that the department did not follow 
the proper prescripts laid down by the Department of 
Public Service and Administration and Advertising of 
the position.  
2. And the second one was that the – there was an issue 
relating to my qualifications.  There was a course that 
one course that was outstanding that would definitely 
confirm an LLB to me.  So I needed to do an oral of 
some sort with the University of Durban Westville.  So 
20 
– and they indicated that because the position 
required that confirmation of the Post Graduate 
position the advert.   
The position would have to be re-advertised.  And then all 
the other candidates that had applied they must re-apply 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 22 of 274 
 
again. So then it was advertised for the second time and 
then it was advertised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That would have been around when in 
2015 when it was re-advertised? 
MS 
MOKHOLO: 
 
It 
would 
have 
been 
by 
– 
around 
March/April we can confirm the dates Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes, ja.  So that was the second advert.  
Then we… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you proceed.  What did you think 
10 
of the reasons that were given for re-advertising the 
position when you were told about them? 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes Chairperson as I say it was the first 
was relating to the outstanding course – a short course 
and then the one was the fact that the department did not 
comply with Public Service Administration in issuing the 
advert. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Were 
you 
told 
in 
what 
way 
the 
department had not complied? 
MS MOKHOLO:  No they did not indicate in what way.  It 
20 
was just that the department did not comply with the DPSE 
prescript in advertising the position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  And then the other one relating to 
you why – was what about a course?  What was the 
position? 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 23 of 274 
 
MS MOKHOLO:  The position was that they – it would put – 
it puts me not as a qualified – I do not qualify even in the – 
the short round or even to be shortlisted in the position 
because of that course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was the position?  What course was 
it?  Was – did it – what were the requirements of the 
position in the first advertisement? 
MS MOKHOLO:  In the first advertisement … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Minimum requirements. 
MS MOKHOLO:  Ja it did not require the Post Grad or the 
10 
Masters as it was put in the latter qualifications or in the 
latter adverts.  It was just a degree. 
MS MOKHOLO:  A Bachelors Degree. 
MS MOKHOLO:  A Bachelors Degree ten years’ experience 
in the public service especially at SMS level.  And a full 
understanding of the department.  Its state owned entities 
within its portfolio.  The understanding of the PFMA. The 
Companies Act.  Just the way the department operate and 
the environment within which the SOE operates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So at that stage what were your 
20 
qualifications – academic qualifications? 
MS MOKHOLO:  They… 
CHAIRPERSON:  At a stage you applied in response to the 
first advertisement. 
MS MOKHOLO:  It was the B.Proc and – and LLB that 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 24 of 274 
 
needed – that the oral – the oral which was subsequently 
given.  But by the time when the advert was or the reasons 
were given to me it was B.Proc. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so you had a B.Proc. 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which is a four year junior degree. 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You had study towards your LLB. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But had not yet completed it. 
10 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes.  It had one course left. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was one subject left.  Is that right? 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.    The reason then that they gave 
with regard to your qualifications was what? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Was that it - I would – it does not put me 
in the race, based on the fact that I – they did not comply 
with Public Service and Administration.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But did they say that the prescripts of the 
Department of Public Services and Administration required a 
20 
senior degree or a certain degree for this position? 
MS MOKHOLO:   No, Chairperson.  That is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That is not what they said. 
MS MOKHOLO:   No, that is not what they were saying.  That 
is - the initial advert did not have that. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 25 of 274 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS MOKHOLO:   And the second advert did not have that as 
well.  I think it was – the position was advertised three 
times. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS MOKHOLO:   So I think it was for the – on the third 
advert that the masters was put in as a requirement for the 
position. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you know who the other candidates 
were who had applied in response to the first advertisement 
10 
or do you not know? 
MS MOKHOLO:   No, I do not know Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOKHOLO:   As I have indicated also.  I – even the HR 
Department – I made sure I did not make myself, not even to 
ask questions relating to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now.  So this story, when you were being 
told the reasons why the position would be re-advertised.  
20 
The story about your qualifications exactly what about this 
outstanding course?  Just repeat that.  I am trying to follow.  
Maybe advert that had been – the job advert said you must 
have a bachelor’s degree. 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 26 of 274 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the minimum in terms of academic 
qualifications.  And it required you to have at least ten years’ 
service in the Public Service at senior management level. 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that right? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So what were they saying?   
MS MOKHOLO:   It came across Chairperson to say, they 
cannot proceed because the DPSA requirement was that, 
that initial advert in the first place was defective, basically. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And who told you this? 
MS MOKHOLO:   The HR ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Who at HR? 
MS MOKHOLO:   It was ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Can you remember? 
MS MOKHOLO:   It was Ms Henriëtta Strauss. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Ms Henriëtta Strauss. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then, in any event, the position was 
then re-advertised. 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And were the minimum requirements for 
the position in – as stipulated in the second advert, the same 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 27 of 274 
 
as the minimum requirements for the position as had been 
stipulated in the first advert? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes, Chairperson.  The first and the second 
advert, they were almost similar.  There would have been 
minor but it was – there was no material differences between 
the first and the second.  Hence, I still remained in the race.  
I only withdrew with the third advert because with the third 
advert, definitely, I did not qualify or – for the position. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  I am not sure that I am following.  
Try and remember what the minimum requirements of the 
10 
position for GT or DPE were as contained in the first advert.  
And you have already told me what those were.   
 
As far as academy qualifications were concerned, you 
said that it required a bachelor’s degree.  It did not require 
the candidate to have a senior degree or a master’s degree.  
Okay.  And then there were other minimum requirements.   
 
As far as the second advert is concerned.  Did it have 
the same minimum academic requirements that it called for 
with regard to those who wanted to apply? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes, Chairperson it had the same.  There 
20 
would have been changes.  I just cannot recall exactly what 
would have been different but it had – in the main it was still 
the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS MOKHOLO:   It was the third advert that then had 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 28 of 274 
 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, there was a third advert? 
MS MOKHOLO:   There was a third advert. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MS MOKHOLO:   When the advert, that is – then I withdrew 
because I then indicated to HR that I was not qualified on 
the basis of the new advert of the position. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now, you said the first advert, the closing 
date for applications was sometime in March 2015 or 
February.  Is that right? 
10 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They started that? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then the second advert was issued 
around April/March, April.  You are not sure but somewhere 
there. 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MOKHOLO:   And the closing date was also around the 
middle of the year.  And then there was a third advert and 
20 
which then had closed slightly after the – I think it was 
July/August.  Something like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Somewhere around July, mid-year? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the third advert? 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 29 of 274 
 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now, what – how different were the 
minimum requirements specified in the third advert compared 
to the minimum requirements specified in these first and 
second adverts? 
MS MOKHOLO:   The third advert had – on qualifications it 
added – the first two they said post-graduate – something 
like an added advantage. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would be a recommendation? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or would be recommended? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes, it would be an added.  It was the first 
advert.  It said it would be an added advantage if you have.  
But in the third one, it was a mandatory requirement.  So a 
master’s or any other. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now the first one and the second one.  
What did they say – what do they say, a second degree or 
did they say a senior degree would be an added advantage?  
Or, did they say a master’s degree would be an added 
advantage? 
20 
MS MOKHOLO:   They said...  Yes, the post-grade would be 
an added advantage. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, a post-graduate degree? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 30 of 274 
 
MS MOKHOLO:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which could mean it could be an honours. 
MS MOKHOLO:   Honours, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or LLB. 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or whatever.  Okay.  And then the third 
one? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes.  Ja, the third one was very – was – 
that is the one that was prescriptive in terms of making it 
mandatory, not an added advantage. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did it say post-graduate degree or did it 
say master’s degree? 
MS MOKHOLO:   I cannot recall Chairperson whether it is 
post-graduate or master’s but I think it was Masters.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But we have the advert – the third – all 
the adverts here by any chance? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, Chair we do not have it presently. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And I am just passing a note to my 
investigators to check 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Ja, I think it will be important to get 
all three of those advertisements.  But you are saying that in 
the third advert, the position of – and you cannot remember 
whether it said a senior degree or second degree or post-
graduate qualification or a master’s was compulsory.  Or are 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 31 of 274 
 
you able to remember whether it said a master’s? 
MS MOKHOLO:   It had post-graduate and I think there was 
also a master’s there.  A post-graduate or a master’s was – it 
was a mandate – it was mandatory compared to the previous 
one but the word post-graduate was there...  
CHAIRPERSON:   So is your evidence, therefore, the 
following?  I just want to make sure I get this clearly.  It is 
just a pity that we do not have the adverts but I am sure we 
will get them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   That whereas the first and second adverts 
said a post-graduate qualification or degree would be an 
added advantage, the third advert said one of two things and 
you cannot remember which one.  Either it said a post-
graduate degree is compulsory or it said a master’s degree 
is compulsory. 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You just cannot remember which one it 
said? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes, I cannot remember which one was it, 
20 
ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then, because on your LLB, you had 
one 
post 
outstanding. 
 
You 
then 
did 
not 
meet 
the 
requirements? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes, Chairperson. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 32 of 274 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is why you decided to withdraw? 
MS MOKHOLO:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Ms Mokholo, in the 
first time around when you were told that the DPSA 
requirements have not been met, were you told in what 
respect? 
MS MOKHOLO:   No, Chairperson.  As I said, it just said the 
– that advert did not meet the standard of the DPSA.  But it 
would be reissued and all the candidates that had previously 
10 
applied, they can still apply.  And indeed, in the advert it 
said that you can still apply if you had applied before.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What we will need Mr Seleka, if this has 
not been done already. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We need to obtain all the three adverts, 
number one.  Number two, we need to obtain the Public 
Service prescripts relating to the position of DG. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do recall that in the Department of 
20 
Labour, somebody who was appointed as DG, even though 
he did not have a degree - and there was a query – and this 
is something that has been here in the Commission, a query. 
 
Because it was said the – in terms of the Public Service, 
the – I mean the requirements for the position of DG is that, 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 33 of 274 
 
at least he should have a bachelor’s degree.   
 
Now I want to know also.  So to the extent that the 
advert, third advert may have said you – candidates should 
have a master’s degree.  I think that will be very strange.  
 
I 
would 
like 
to 
have 
that 
compared 
with 
other 
government departments, whether it was a requirement for 
DG’s and other government departments.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or whether this department specifically 
decided that for this position they wanted somebody with a 
10 
master’s degree.  So we will need to have that comparison. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I must also ask Ms Mokholo.  
Mr Matona, that is now the previous DG, do you know 
whether, when he was appointed as DG, he had a master’s 
degree? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Chairperson, maybe we need to explain 
how ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or rather, I should be saying.  Whether -  
how holding a master’s degree was a requirement. 
20 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes, Chair.  Mr Matona’s case was slightly 
different because his appointment into the department was a 
lateral transfer from the Department of Trade and Industry 
then.  So he was already a DG in another department. 
 
So the Public Service Act and Regulations, they do allow 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 34 of 274 
 
that you can transfer laterally.  So he transferred laterally to 
the department. 
 
But I do know that it does – I am not sure of his 
qualifications in terms of masters but I know ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Anyway, we have got his affidavit and 
CV.  But that might not tell us what ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...the requirement for the position was 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...when he got appointed or transferred.  
But I would have thought, also, that to the extent that 
different 
departments 
might 
have 
different 
minimum 
requirements for the position of DG.   
 
I would imagine that you cannot transfer somebody from 
one 
department 
who 
meets 
the 
requirements 
of 
that 
department into a position in another department which has 
got different requirements.  You cannot just transfer.  They 
will have to meet the requirements for the position to which 
they are transferred. 
20 
MS MOKHOLO:   Correct Chairperson.  It is the same as 
transferring a DDG to another department.  I transferred 
from the Department of Public Enterprises as a DDG, 
meeting the requirements of a DDG...  [Speaker’s voice trails 
off – unclear.] 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 35 of 274 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja, ja. 
MS MOKHOLO:   [Indistinct] [Speaker’s voice trails off – 
unclear.] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Even after the third advert, 
you never got to know who the other candidates were for the 
position? 
MS MOKHOLO:   No, Chairperson.  I only got to know the 
successful candidate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.   
ADV SELEKA SC:    
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Did you have any 
conversation with the minister, Minister Lynne Brown, during 
this time of your application for this position? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Not during the process.  As I said that it 
was also to delineate, because it would have created 
conflict.  But it was before.  When I was still acting.  When 
she indicated that she would want to fill the position, she – 
then we did have a conversation.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay that is...  So the third time around 
20 
the advert is issues, it requires a master’s or a post-grade.  
You cannot recall.  Can you recall what was the end result in 
the second – the third time around? 
MS MOKHOLO:   So.  Yes, I withdrew from the position but 
then also then indicated to the ...[intervenes]  
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 36 of 274 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You mean, you withdrew from the 
application? 
MS MOKHOLO:   From the application, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS MOKHOLO:   But still retained the acting.  So on the 
basis of – after the advert, the minister indicated to me that 
she realised – she was informed by Legal that I had 
withdrawn.  And then I explained that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, please look this side when you 
...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS MOKHOLO:   My apologies Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes, she – she said she learnt after the 
closing date that I withdrew my application.  I indicated that 
but I would like to still remain as acting so that I can prepare 
the handover and for the coming DG.   
 
And this conversation, we were having in line(?) when 
minister was indicated to me that she would like to rotate the 
acting within the department to bring another colleague to 
20 
act.   
 
So I indicated that giving the fact that the minister 
intends to fill the position as early as November/December.  
There is no point to bring somebody to step in for a month or 
two.   
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 37 of 274 
 
 
I might as well continue so that it gives me enough time, 
because I falling out of the race but I am still active.  Give 
me enough time to prepare and handover the post for the 
incoming DG.  Rather than I prepare the post and there is 
somebody who acts for two months, they still have to 
prepare a report.  Or the new DG can have two handover 
reports.   
 
So that is the conversation that I had then with the 
minister. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but can you tell the Chairperson, 
10 
what was the outcome of the third process to look for a 
person to fill the DG’s position? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes, we were informed through the news 
flash that the recruitment process has been completed and 
there is a new DG that will be joining the department as of 
the 1s t of December, Mr Richard Mogokare Seleke.   
CHAIRPERSON:   What did the minister say when you 
suggested 
that 
there 
should 
not 
be 
another 
acting 
appointment for – in the position of DG for one or two 
months before the DG, new DG came in, that you should 
20 
continue so that you can properly prepare a handover 
report? 
MS MOKHOLO:   She indicated that she understood my 
reasons but she still felt that deportations to another DDG 
would serve the department good.  And there were many 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 38 of 274 
 
challenges the department was facing.  I was under pressure 
in terms of work and therefore she still believes that there 
must be somebody else that [Speaker’s voice trails off – 
unclear.] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  And he did – she appointed 
somebody else? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes, she appointed another colleague, a 
DDG to act for those two months. 
CHAIRPERSON:   For October and November 2015? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes.  The intend – because the process 
10 
was so advanced.  The intend was just that the colleague, 
the DDG colleague would just act for a month.  Hence the 
letter that was sent, because we normally sent the letters to 
all the other – to the other departments.  We also sent 
letters to the state-owned companies within the portfolio to 
inform them that there would be an acting DDG.   
 
Even when I was appointed, the cluster was informed.  
The SOE’s were informed.  So in this case as well.  The 
minister had to inform them that there would be another DDG 
that would be acting.   
20 
 
So that letter was only for a month to say the DDG would 
act as acting for the month of October.  My understanding 
was that the intend was that the process was so advanced 
that the new DG could even start in November.   
 
But I think in the process of going to going and then 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 39 of 274 
 
dealing with other matters, could not be November.  Hence, 
the DDG colleague acted for two months.  It was October 
and November.  And the new DG started.. [Speaker’s voice 
trails off – unclear.] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Thank you, Chair.  So the person 
who is appointed to act in this position you have been acting 
is another colleague of yours within your office? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Within the department? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Within the department. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the suggestion that you remain acting 
until the next person formally appointed, was not taken? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes, the minister did not oblige me on the 
request and then we agreed that I will start... [Speaker’s 
voice trails off – unclear.] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So then there is the acting – I mean an 
acting person again for two months, you say.  And we have 
put your evidence to the other parties that Mr Seleke then 
gets 
to 
be 
appointed 
as 
the 
DG 
with 
effect 
from 
1 December 2015. 
20 
MS MOKHOLO:   Correct Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think you had also...  When does he 
get to be introduced to you after his appointment?  Sorry, 
when I say you, I mean the officials in the department. 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes.  We – he joined on the 1s t and on that 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 40 of 274 
 
first week, he only met with the Executive Committee to the 
department, the Exco just to introduce himself to Exco.   
 
Then he was formally introduced by the minister to the 
entire department mid-December.  He was at the year-end 
function of the department which was held at Denel.  So that 
is when minister – it was just before the 16t h of December, 
because normally by then, most people take on leave.   
 
So the – in terms of the calendar of activities, it was 
agreed that the introduction of the DG to the entire 
department must happen before the mid-December.   
10 
 
So he was introduced to the department around that 
period in 2015 or also and 14 or so of December at the year-
end function. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   This is December 2015? 
MS MOKHOLO:   December 2015.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you know whether Mr Seleke had a 
master’s degree? 
MS MOKHOLO:   The ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   If you do not know, you do not know. 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Whether you know. 
MS MOKHOLO:   At the year-end function, the minister did 
elude to that when she – she read the short bio of the DG 
and then indicated that he is also a seasoned – a senior 
official in the department in possession of a master’s degree 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 41 of 274 
 
and... [Speaker’s voice trails off – unclear.] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, you swallowed your words towards 
the end of your last sentence.  Just repeat that answer, 
please and face this side.  I do not know whether you need 
to bring the mic a little closer to you or you...  Ja.  H’m? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Thank you, Chairperson.  I was saying that 
the minister, when she introduced the DG, she had – she 
read the short bio of the DG and indicated that indeed he 
was in possession of a master’s degree and is also a 
seasoned public official who has been also a DG at a 
10 
provincial level.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay. 
MS MOKHOLO:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The Commission has heard evidence in 
regard to an email address of infoportal1@zoho.com.  And at 
the 
initial 
stages 
of 
those 
who 
testified 
before 
the 
Commission.   
 
Their version was that that email address belongs to Mr 
Richard Seleke and some emails had been exchanged with 
that email address prior to December 2015.   
20 
 
And yet it was said to be his email address as the DG at 
the 
department, 
at 
your 
department, 
DPS... 
 
DP 
...[intervenes]  
MS MOKHOLO:   DPE. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   DPE.  Do you have any comment on 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 42 of 274 
 
that? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Chairperson, the email address in the 
department, there is a specific email that is used for a DG.  
So the DG would have – for example, I would have an email 
as the DG matsietsimokholo@dpe.gov.za.   
 
But there would be an email, an additional email address 
that can be used to send correspondence to the DG and it is 
managed by the DG’s office and it is definitely not the 
infoportal or the zoho.  That email is dg@dpe.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
MS MOKHOLO:   So that will be the email address that 
should be used. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, you are talking about an official 
email address.  You are not talking about a personal email 
address that might belong to a particular DG? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes.  Then there would also – all the DG’s 
has sent(?) Mr Matona with myself as well and even with 
Mr Seleke, 
there 
would 
be 
private 
emails, 
because 
sometimes our server is down.  We needed to communicate 
with the minister 24/7 actually.   
20 
 
So even at home, you would need to be able to have.  
So we would be allowed personal addresses that we would 
apply permission with the IT Department of the department 
that we can use.  Mister...   
 
As I have said, Mr Matona had one, Mr Seleke had one 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 43 of 274 
 
but it was not that infoportal/zoho.  Mr Seleke actually used 
a different private email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say that you would need to apply 
to somebody in the department to have – for permission to 
use your personal email address for work purposes? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes, Chairperson for security reasons.  So 
I would – for my private email, the iCloud email that I would 
use, I needed to get permission from the IT to say, so that it 
can be loaded because it was – to be private but I would still 
receive work related information. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOKHOLO:   So I would – it is a requirement.  At 
least(?), our IT informed us it is a requirement and it is 
something that SITA encourages.   
 
I know even in the presidency that I had to project that 
request through our IT that my private iCloud email address 
can be used for official business in the event my email is 
down or... [Speaker’s voice trails off – unclear.] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was it the policy of the Department of 
Public Enterprises that for any employee or official of the 
20 
Department of Public Enterprises to use his or her personal 
or private email address for work purposes, they would need 
to apply to the IT Department or whatever or section?   
 
They could not just use their private email addresses for 
work purposes without that arrangement having been made 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 44 of 274 
 
with the IT Section? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes, Chairperson you would have to inform 
IT. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOKHOLO:   Because remember, he has to load it for 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOKHOLO:   So you would have to inform the IT. 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes.  You would not just use it.  Then...  I 
specifically remember because there was a form, at least 
10 
that I was given.  You just complete and you indicate and 
then you give the reason. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MS MOKHOLO:   The same, as I am saying, in the – if I am 
to 
correlate 
that 
with 
what 
happens 
currently 
in 
the 
presidency.  It is the same thing, that you even apply for 
what we call remote access because you need it to be – you 
are outside the server.   
 
So you needed to be brought in because you have been 
receiving information that relates to the department.  So 
20 
there is a form that you just complete and then you apply for 
this person to be given that kind of remote access. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was this policy a written policy or it was 
not written but was known?  In other words, is there a 
document that one could find which had this policy? 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 45 of 274 
 
MS MOKHOLO:   I think, Chairperson, it was more of a 
standard operating procedure, it is something that we knew 
that when you – even when you are a new employee, when 
you receive those forms you would be told that if you were 
to use a private, what would the rules and norms if you use 
your private email.  So it will not be prohibited but you 
would be told what would be the steps to be followed if you 
want to use a private email.  Definitely it was something 
that is known, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you, in other words, saying you do 
10 
not know if it was a written policy or a written rule but you 
would know that it was known that this what was expected? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Ja, Chairperson, I would not say there is 
a document that it is written specifically with a, b, c, d law 
but you would know that if you joined the dept, you were 
given the department email address and then you would 
indicate that is it possible for me to use my private email 
and then you would be told what are the conditions and 
circumstances under which that could happen and that also 
applied to tools like iPad, there was a process and you 
20 
would not just put everything on your iPad that is work-
related.  So I had to take my iPad in and request that this 
is my private email bought by my own money but I use it 
for work so can I – can it be used and then – because 
there is a serial – they will ask you for a number or here is 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 46 of 274 
 
the number of iPad or something like that.  So there were 
those kind of practices that we would know. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
What 
is 
your 
– 
what 
was 
your 
understanding 
at 
the 
time 
of 
how 
well-known 
this 
requirement was among employees and officials of the 
department? 
MS MOKHOLO:   If I am to use the level of – this SMS 
level from let us say director, Chief Director, DDG and DG, 
I would say it was well-known because most of us use 
gadgets.  There is even colleagues who received emails, 
10 
official emails on their phones and you needed to go to IT, 
needs the phone, for them to put their email – could be a 
DPE email but on your phone, there was a procedure for 
that as well.   
So it was not something that you would just do and 
IT would have to be brought in and for them to do that, 
they would sign some forms.  When I – I was doing the 
exits from DPE, there was a form that I was given.  When 
you hand over your access card, you hand over your 
access and they would ask you if you were using an 
20 
external email address, were you on the network of the 
department, the server and everything.   
 
So I would if from Director, Chief Director, DDG, 
DG, it was a well-known because we used smart phones 
most of the time for work-related circumstances. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 47 of 274 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   With regard to people at secretary level 
or PAs, what is your thinking, do you think it might have 
been less known among them or not? 
MS MOKHOLO:   It will be different.  For those, for 
example, that would work in my office, when I was the 
Acting DG, they would know that when they send an email 
especially after if hours or sometimes it is during the day 
but because we are inundated with meetings they would 
then copy my iCloud and I then they went send even a 
message, a Whatsapp, please check urgent email and it is 
10 
also copied on your iCloud so that even if I leave Eskom’s 
meeting very late I do not have to come to the office, I go 
straight home, I can still access that email. 
 
So the PA’s office managers that worked with SMS 
members they would also know because they would know 
they would have access to those emails, our emails, we 
will give them our private emails so that they know where 
to send.   
 
The office of the administrator would have my 
private emails so that if there is something urgent that they 
20 
needed to bring to my attention, where there is holidays 
and then they know where to get hold of me, they can 
always send. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The PA to the minister, would you expect 
her to know, to have known such or not? 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 48 of 274 
 
MS MOKHOLO:   Definitely, Chairperson, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She would have known that requirement.  
Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And what about the DG and the DDG?  
Would they know each other ’s private email addresses? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes, Chairperson, as I indicated I knew 
Mr Matona’s private email, I know Mr Seleke’s private 
email because I would send things after I was – that 
matters that are urgent and then I would also send them 
Whatsapps, say please check your email, there is an 
10 
urgent matter.  So I would know their particular [inaudible 
– speaking simultaneously] 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Do 
you 
know 
that 
it 
was 
infoportal1@zoho? 
MS MOKHOLO:   It was not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It was not that email address.  Do you 
know where Mr Seleke came from prior to his appointment 
at DPE?  Where was he employed In other words before 
coming there? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Before coming as a DG? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, as a DG at DPE. 
MS MOKHOLO:   Employment, I know he was a board 
member at the point at Transnet because he was part of 
the batch that we appointed in December 2014 when we did 
the Transnet and the Eskom board appointments. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 49 of 274 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   At Transnet 2014?  Okay.  Tell the 
Chairperson, if there is a protocol because, you see, the 
evidence that was presented in regard to this info portal 
email dealt with the Chairperson of the board at Eskom 
interacting 
directly, 
if 
you 
listened 
to 
his 
evidence, 
interacting directly with the DG.  If you could tell the 
Chairperson during your acting stint, how did you interact 
with the SOEs?  How did you interact – ja, let me say 
SOEs, whether at board level or executive level, what was 
the chain of interaction between the two entities? 
10 
MS MOKHOLO:   So, Chairperson, we had – DPE in the 
main because it is a department that had unlike other 
departments that would also have a policy role, regulatory 
role, we always had one mandate of shareholder function, 
so we were not like Department of Transport that will also 
have regulators, that will also have the function of 
developing policy, ours was a shareholder management 
function. 
 
So we had over the years to try to perfect that 
because we were teaching the department as going to be 
20 
the centre of excellence when it comes to shareholder 
management.  So we had what you call a communication 
protocol 
between 
the 
department 
and 
SOE. 
 
The 
Chairperson corresponds and interacts in the main with the 
minister because the minister is there, executive authority 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 50 of 274 
 
and then the Chairperson of the board is the head of what 
is called the accounting authority, which is the board, so 
then the communication would be between Minister and the 
Chairperson.   
 
On exceptional cases then the Minister can give you 
an instruction to call the Chairperson but I not write to the 
Chairperson.   Letters are to be prepared, it is the Minister 
that will sign off on those letters. 
 
And then, as the DG, the DG will interact with the 
CEO and the rest of us, the DDGs will communicate with 
10 
other executives or prescribed officers within the SOE.  It 
is a protocol that finds itself in a way partly from the PFMA 
but we had to keep perfect it because the PFMA was not 
dealing with the shareholder issues in the main, it was 
more financial management issues.   
So we perfected that as a tool in the department 
and we will communicate that through the – when we do 
board inductions we would indicate.  There was always 
slide that we would put in there that deals with the 
delegation of roles between the Minister, even Minister 
20 
step-in rights, intervention rights vis-à-vis the board and 
then how the board must interact with the executives so 
that 
the 
board 
does 
not 
become 
an 
executive 
and 
management as well. 
So 
there 
was 
that 
protocol 
in 
terms 
of 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 51 of 274 
 
communication between the Minister and the Chair, the 
CEO and the DG and the other executives, with the other 
officials as well. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so the Chairperson of the board – 
currently the communication protocol will interact directly 
with the Minister. 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is the Chairperson of the board.  
10 
The CEO of the SOEs would then be engaging directly with 
the DGs – the DG.  Just speak for the Chairperson to hear? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  And at DDG level you will 
deal with other executives. 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes, at DDG level you will deal with your  
- what will be your prescribed officers because the CEO 
and the CFO are ex-officio members of the board, so in 
most cases those are the ones that would deal with the 
state owned – deal with the DG or at times with the 
20 
Minister, those specific meeting but then at our level we 
will deal with other.  Only in exceptional cases that I 
indicated that the Minister can indicate, can request that 
must he call the Chairperson who – but it was not really a 
norm, always the Minister that communicates the [inaudible 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 52 of 274 
 
– speaking simultaneously] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  But also in this case what we 
have is that the Chairperson would say I am communicating 
with the DG.  Would that be the norm? 
MS MOKHOLO:   I would not be a norm, Chairperson, it 
would have to be under exceptional circumstances and 
cases as I indicated.  One of the forums that we used to 
also ensure there is communication protocol we establish 
what 
we 
call 
the 
Chairperson’s 
forum. 
 
In 
those 
Chairperson’s forum, they will be led by the Minister but it 
10 
will be the Chairperson of each and so – and their CEO 
and in those meetings it will be to encourage those kind of 
protocols as well.    
One of the reasons why we wanted to do this was 
also to address the concern that was coming from a lot of 
CEOs where they felt that the Chairpersons will also be 
coming through executive and also the concerns that 
sometimes the ministers – that other Chairpersons will 
complain that the ministers are becoming executives, 
Minister communicates directly with the CEO and the CEO 
20 
does not feed back to the Chairperson, therefore the 
Chairperson is not aware of things that are happening. 
So we wanted them to try to correct that and craft 
this communication through the Chairperson’s forum and 
then we will encourage this kind of a protocol. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 53 of 274 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   During your acting …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
I 
think 
we 
must 
take 
the 
tea 
adjournment. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Tea adjournment, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We will take the tea adjournment.  It is 
quarter past, we will resume and half past eleven. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Ms Mokholo, 
you are still under oath.  Just before the lunch adjournment 
– I mean, the tea adjournment, I was asking you about – 
you were, rather, testifying about the protocol and the 
communications between the DPE and the various SOEs.  
Now let me be direct in regard to how you dealt with the 
SOEs.  During your tenure as an acting DG, that year 
September 2014 to September 2015 did you have any email 
exchanges sent to you directly from Eskom Chairperson? 
20 
MS MOKHOLO:   No, Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Be it Mr Tsotsi or Dr Ngubane? 
MS MOKHOLO:   From their official...? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, not from their official, from the 
private email address to your private email address. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 54 of 274 
 
MS MOKHOLO:   No, Chairperson, I have not had that kind 
of interaction with them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did they approach in regard to Eskom 
is seeking to provide – it has been approached by a 
supplier or various suppliers and it is concluding contracts 
with them and asked for your view in regard to the 
awarding of those contracts? 
MS MOKHOLO:   No, Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you have to deal with them in 
regard to which newspaper houses, Sunday Times or City 
10 
Press, you name them, that they could deal with or not 
deal with. 
MS MOKHOLO:   No, Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And that is the position to the end of 
your acting as the Acting DG. 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes, for the whole total 12 months, no, 
ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In the beginning of 2015, February 
2015 – and we have put this – rather, we have heard from 
Mr Tsotsi that you made a telephone call to him.  You made 
20 
a telephone call on the eve of a meeting that the board of 
Eskom had to have on the 26 February 2015.  Could you in 
a nutshell just relate to the Chairperson how did that call 
come about? 
MS MOKHOLO: Thank you, Chairperson, so …[intervenes] 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 55 of 274 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    I am sorry, before you proceed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The noise again. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, I suspect that your junior 
took 
the 
opportunity 
during 
the 
tea 
break 
to 
make 
representations to the technicians. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think they [indistinct] 3.13. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But is it still fine?  Is it tolerable?  If 
they can – okay, alright, but do say when it is too much for 
you.  Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She never feels the heat, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Ms Mokholo, you can continue, I 
interrupted you while you were giving evidence. 
MS 
MOKHOLO: 
 
 
Thank 
you, 
Chairperson. 
 
Yes, 
Chairperson, so as the DG or as the Acting DG, it is a 
norm especially when parliament is in session that you 
would work between two offices, you would work between 
the Cape Town office and we would work within the 
Pretoria office.   
On this occasion, it was around the 25 February 
2015.  I was in Cape Town working from our Plein office in 
20 
Cape Town and when I am in Cape Town I tended to work 
until late in the office because then there is no family to 
rush home to so I spent more time in the office. 
So I had left the office late that evening and the 
Minister – I remember the Minister was travelling out of the 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 56 of 274 
 
country.  I think it was with Denel, I cannot remember the 
exact country they were travelling to but it was for an HO.  
So I remember that vividly because during that time I would 
also, you know, make mental note and also notes of things 
that I would have to keep a record of so that on Minister ’s 
return I can be able to provide update on events that took 
place in her absence. 
As I say in my affidavit, I had returned to the hotel 
where I was staying at the Strand hotel and it was around 
eight, so after eight.  Then I received a call, it was from a 
10 
landline number 021 and again I remember vividly that 
because I received it on my mobile and my first reaction 
was probably something that I have forgotten in the office 
or I did not log properly because I left the office late or 
something that the security in the office they wanted to 
bring to my attention.   
So when I answered the call there was a male voice 
on the other side of the line which greeted me and then 
they wanted to confirm my details whether they are 
speaking to me as the Acting DG in the department and 
20 
then I confirmed those and then they asked me to hold on 
for the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, just repeat exactly, as far 
you can recall, what the voice on the other end of the line 
said.  Did it say something – is it Ms Mokholo or whatever?  
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 57 of 274 
 
Just say exactly what the other person said and what you 
said in response.  I want the content of that conversation. 
MS MOKHOLO:   Okay, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As it happened, as far as you can 
remember. 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes, Chairperson, as I indicated it was a 
male voice and he asked if – are you Matsietsi Mokholo?  
To which responded in the affirmative, yes.  The Acting DG 
in the DPE?   And I said yes.  Then the person – I cannot 
recall whether they gave me their name and then they said 
10 
please hold on for the President. 
 
So, without thinking, Mr Chairperson, I then said to 
the caller which President?  And the male voice then 
replied, he said President Zuma.  And then I then 
apologised and I say oh, thank you, and then they put me 
on hold. 
 
A few seconds later it was the President on the 
other line, Mr Zuma.  He greeted me in Zulu, so the 
conversation that I would have with him, that I would 
narrate now, was a combination or a mixture of Zulu and 
20 
English but he greeted me in Zulu, sawubona ntokazaan, 
which means hello, or good evening young lady, and I said 
– we exchanged pleasantries with the President and then 
he then informed me that I have been trying to get hold of 
your Minister and your Deputy Minister but I have not been 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 58 of 274 
 
successful and I indicated that yes, Mr President, the 
Minister is not available, she is travelling.  And then the 
President then said so you are the Acting DG?   I said yes, 
Mr President.  He said so you are in charge.  And then he 
went on then to say there is a board meeting tomorrow at 
Eskom to which then I replied that Mr President, I would 
not be aware of the meeting because we do not normally 
know the board meetings and indeed we do not get the 
calendar of board meetings, in the calendar of activities.  
If I may then explain, Chairperson, that the norm is 
10 
that at the beginning of the year every time we do what you 
call a calendar of activities in the department with the 
SOEs so that we can know if they have events that they 
would want the Minister to attend, to do opening remarks 
or address a particular – so that then at least we can then 
plan Minister ’s activity. 
But in that calendar of activities we do not get 
board meetings at all, so I indicated that to the President 
because I wanted to explain that we do not get involved in 
board meetings so I would not be aware that there is a 
20 
board meeting the following day. 
Then to which the President responded that he was 
not asking, he was actually informing me that there was a 
meeting the following day at Eskom and because he is 
unable to reach the Minister and the Deputy Minister and I 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 59 of 274 
 
am the Acting DG, he would like me to call the Chairperson 
and ask him to postpone the meeting until the Minister is 
back. 
So then I said to the President I suspect, Mr 
President, that the Chairperson would want reasons for this 
postponement.  Then the President said no, just inform the 
Chairperson that he must postpone the meeting and await 
further instructions from his shareholder minister.  So then 
that was the end of the call with the President. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say that he was asking you, that 
10 
is Mr Zuma, he was asking you to communicate with the 
Chairperson of the Eskom board and ask him to postpone 
the meeting that was scheduled for the following day or 
was he saying you must do that but he also was going to 
speak to the Chairperson of the board.  Is it both or he was 
asking you to call the Chairperson of the board and ask 
him to – I do not know whether you said cancel the meeting 
or postpone the meeting. 
MS MOKHOLO:   He  - he did not inform that he was going 
to call the Chairperson himself. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   He did not inform you that. 
MS MOKHOLO:   He did not inform me that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, oaky.   
MS MOKHOLO:   He told me to place the call.  As a matter 
of fact, as I say that, the conversation was in both Zulu 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 60 of 274 
 
and English.  On this part he said [indistinct – speaking in 
Zulu]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MOKHOLO:   And then that is when I asked that… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MS MOKHOLO:   But I suspect he is going to ask for the 
reasons for the postponement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   yes. 
10 
MS MOKHOLO:   He said no, no, no, tell him to await 
further instructions from the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat that, what did he say when 
you said the Chairperson I suspect might ask for reasons? 
MS MOKHOLO:   He said no, just inform the Chairperson 
that he must wait for further instructions, reasons from the 
minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   From the shareholder minister. 
MS MOKHOLO:   From the shareholder minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Just say in English the Zulu 
20 
part that you just said because you know what it means. 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Regarding – you said he said? 
MS MOKHOLO:   He said – in English it will mean inform 
the Chairperson that he must postpone the meeting and I 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 61 of 274 
 
await further instructions from his shareholder minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, well the – I do not know if this 
might be important.  On the Zulu version I think you say he 
used:  You must xela. 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which would be you must ask the 
Chairperson, but I do not know whether on the English 
version you are saying he asked you to inform the 
Chairperson to cancel the meeting.  Obviously – well, I do 
not knows whether isiZulu is your – how well you know it, 
10 
whether it was your understanding of what he said in Zulu, 
that he was saying you must inform the Chairperson to 
cancel the meeting or postpone the meeting or whether 
your understanding was that he was asking you to ask the 
Chairperson to postpone the meeting. 
MS MOKHOLO:   Chair, it was clear that he was saying 
inform him in a sense that the meeting should not proceed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOKHOLO:   Ja, the meeting should not proceed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MS MOKHOLO:   Because if he was able to locate the 
minister, that is what the minister would have been 
informed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOKHOLO:   So he was – my understanding was that it 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 62 of 274 
 
was really an instruction to say – to tell or inform the 
Chairperson, not that the meeting should not proceed but 
await further reasons from the – take instructions from the 
shareholder. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  It may be that the Zulu part that 
you said he used, it may be that that part in isiZulu meant 
he was asking you to ask the Chairperson to postpone.  It 
may be that in the end it might make no difference at a 
practical level whether it was a request or an instruction 
but to the extent that there might some significance in 
10 
whether he was giving an instruction that the meeting be 
postponed or it was a request.  There might be those 
differences.  But the long and short of it is whether it was 
an instruction or a request, the idea was that the meeting – 
the Chairperson should postpone or cancel the meeting.  
Was it cancel or postpone. 
MS 
MOKHOLO: 
 
 
It 
was 
postpone 
because 
the 
conversation in me particular, Chairperson, asking for the 
reasons was that I suspected the Chairperson would want 
reasons for the postponement. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  In any event, he was saying 
until further instructions from the shareholder minister. 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  So we have heard 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 63 of 274 
 
Mr Tsotsi’s evidence that you did call him, you did convey 
the message of the President to him.  Can you recall what 
you said to him?  Maybe is it something the same along the 
lines you have just explained to the Chairperson?  If it is 
then we do not have to traverse it again. 
MS MOKHOLO:   But I think it is important, Chairperson, 
maybe to explain that I did not – and it links to what the 
Chairperson 
was 
asking, 
whether 
the 
President 
then 
informed me or told me that he would be also going to call 
Mr Tsotsi.  Immediately after that I did not call the 
10 
Chairperson immediately and first thing that I did, I tried 
calling the minister understanding that - you know, our 
understanding was that even if she is out, travelling 
abroad, but if there are emergencies I can always get in 
touch with her.  She did not pick up and then I followed by 
a text message.  She did not respond. So there was a time 
lapse between when I received a call and before I placed a 
call to the Chairperson. 
 
But I also thought of – because the President in the 
conversation indicated that he also tried the Deputy 
20 
Minister.  So I was mulling in my head whether I should 
also give the Deputy Minister a call but I thought that was 
going to be an exercise in futility because – and the reason 
is that in the department we had delegation of authority 
between the minister and the Deputy Minister.  In the 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 64 of 274 
 
seven SOEs that are within the portfolio of DPE, the 
Minister had delegated the responsibility of the three SOEs 
to the Deputy Minister and those SOEs, it was Alexkor, 
Denel and SAFCOL.  So I thought of even if I give the 
Deputy Minister a call, he is not going to assist much 
because his delegation did not extend to Eskom-related 
matters.  Although those delegations they are limited in 
nature because they are still – they do not absolve 
ministers from the full accountability in the those SOEs 
that are delegated because there will still be matters like 
10 
your PFMA applications that will require the executive 
authority being the Minister.  But in this one, in my head I 
was trying to think whether should I give the Deputy 
Minister a call to check with him if I should place – and 
how I should approach this call to the Chairperson. 
 
Why I was reluctant about the call directly again to 
the Chairperson was just at the beginning of that month we 
had just done an induction to the board, as the department, 
so Eskom will do its induction as an SOE to the new board 
and we will do our own induction as the DPE department. 
20 
 
In our induction, it is like I have referred it to you 
earlier on, that talks about the delineation.  We had made 
it very clear that there is a step-in right, matters that the 
Minister can step in into, but they have triggers.  So in my 
head I was trying to think if I am going to call this 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 65 of 274 
 
Chairperson that I have just inducted them few weeks ago 
and breach this governance gap myself, so – and I was 
already thinking the conversation I was going to have with 
Mr Tsotsi.   
 
So I was – that is why there was time lag, I did not 
call the Chairperson immediately and I did not even call 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But, of course, even in terms of your 
own induction to the board you did not have to worry about 
that because that induction also said that the interaction 
10 
should be between the Chairperson and the minister was a 
general rule to which there were exceptions. 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you did not have to worry about that.  
This was an exception, the Minister was not there. 
MS MOKHOLO:   The conversation was going to be in 
relating to the message itself, that the meeting should not 
take place because this is a board meeting, it is not a 
shareholder, it was not like a shareholder intervention 
matter that would have …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, to the extent that you were 
concerned about the content of the message, that I 
understand, I was simply saying I do not understand why 
you would have been concerned about you giving the 
Chairperson a call in the context of the induction where 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 66 of 274 
 
you 
told 
the 
board 
members 
that 
the 
minister 
communicates 
with 
the 
Chairperson 
and 
the 
DG 
communicates with the CEO and so on because it was 
accepted that there can be exceptional circumstances 
where something different happens. 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes, indeed, Chairperson, it was more in 
the messaging of – the message that I am conveying. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MS MOKHOLO:   Against those governance that we had 
said to them that – because that was the board, it is a 
10 
board meeting, it had nothing to do with the meeting of the 
department, it was something that was within the purview 
of the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOKHOLO:   So that is the dilemma that I had and 
hence I wanted to have a conversation, I was hoping that if 
I was successful to get hold of the minister, it would be the 
conversation I would have with the Minister so that then 
the Minister can then be able, if I was successful, to get 
hold of her.  The minister can then impress upon the 
20 
President the difficulty of the shareholder telling the board 
to postpone a board meeting, how – what – how it then 
puts against our own system. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, in terms of governance. 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 67 of 274 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, but ultimately you called the 
Chairperson.  
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes, I called the Chairperson and then I 
indicated to the Chairperson - we exchanged greetings as 
well and I referred it to him, I mean, [indistinct] 22.33 to 
say 
[indistinct 
– 
speaking 
African 
language] 
the 
Chairperson, that is how I always referred to him.   
Then I indicated to him that I am aware that you are 
having – you have a meeting tomorrow and then the 
Chairperson indicated yes.  And then I said to him can you 
10 
please move your meeting and then the Chairperson said – 
his response was immediate to me that no and then he 
asked why I must?  I indicated that the Minister would call 
and give your reasons but the Chairperson was very 
persistent in wanting the reasons.  He actually stated to 
me that, Mati, remember this meeting has already been 
scheduled over a period of time with all the board members 
and some of these board members they are coming out of 
the province, not from Gauteng, all of them, so people are 
already here.  As I said, it was in the evening.  So and 
20 
then I indicated to the Chairperson that no – at the end, 
because he was adamant, he wanted to understand why he 
must move or postpone the meeting then I said to him, 
Chairperson, this is very difficult, the President has 
requested that the meeting be postponed.  And then that 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 68 of 274 
 
was the end of the call with Mr Tsotsi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So is it fair to say you did not want to 
tell him that the President had anything to do with his 
request unless you were pushed to a corner? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes, Chair, that is the first statement.  
Actually, I do state in my affidavit that my intent was not to 
mention that the President had requested. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, but ultimately you told him 
that. 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   The President – did you say the 
President had called you and this request was coming from 
him? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Was coming from him but the President 
indicated that Minister will provide the reasons. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Reasons, ja. 
MS MOKHOLO:   I did inform Mr Tsotsi that the President 
indicated that the meeting be postponed but Minister will 
provide the reasons. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Once you had told the Chairperson that 
20 
it is the President who had made – who had called to make 
this request, what was his response? 
MS MOKHOLO:   He just said okay and then we ended the 
call. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja and that is how the conversation 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 69 of 274 
 
ended. 
MS MOKHOLO:   Ja, it ended. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Did you have the 
opportunity to tell the Minister about that call from the 
President and what you conveyed to Mr Tsotsi? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes, Chairperson.  As I indicated earlier 
on that these – it is a norm that when minister returns then 
I would do a report, a feedback of some sort of matters 
that would have transpired during her absence, so indeed I 
10 
had an opportunity again, you know, Cape Town office, I 
then briefed the minister this – the first issue on the item 
on my list of issues to discuss with her was this call from 
the President and I informed the minister that I had 
received this call and the President had requested that the 
meeting be postponed and I also told Minister what I have 
done and had a brief conversation with the minister, the 
same governance that – to say, Minister, even tried to call 
you, I even sent a message.  I was even saying to her I 
was sweating because it was my first time receiving a call 
20 
from the President so I wanted to make sure that I do the 
right thing and then the minister engaged on the other 
matters that were on the report but on the issue of the call, 
she just said sharp and just said “Eish, Matsi” and we did 
not have a conversation about that. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 70 of 274 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat that, Mr Mokholo?  What was 
the minister ’s reaction, what did the minister say? 
MS MOKHOLO:   She just shrugged and said “Eish, Matsi.”  
And we did not have a conversation.  So I would not know 
even whether she had the reasons from the President, 
whether she had a conversation with the Chairperson and 
that is where we left it, the conversation with her. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I do not hear as in part of what you 
are saying, did she say you should not have had that 
conversation with the President or did she say the two of 
10 
you, that is yourself and the minister, did not have this 
conversation about the President having called? 
MS MOKHOLO:   I reported but her response was “Eish, 
Matsi” and then we did not have any other conversation, it 
was not like – so what transpired after did – Minister, did 
you speak to the Chairperson?  Did you speak to the 
President?  And so I would be lying if I say, Chairperson, 
there 
was 
a 
conversation, 
we 
did 
not 
finish 
the 
conversation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So what was your understanding of what 
20 
her attitude was towards the fact that the President had 
called and asked that the board meeting be postponed, 
what was your understanding of what her attitude was to 
this development? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Chair, this led me to believe that – in my 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 71 of 274 
 
mind that either she knew what had transpired in her 
absence of that she had had already had that conversation 
either with the Chairperson or with the President. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not get the impression that she 
was wishing this development had not happened? 
MS MOKHOLO:   She – what I – was very clear was that it 
was not a conversation that she was going to have with 
me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, ja.  Okay, alright. 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fair enough.  So you had a 
difficult time when the President called and made his 
request and you had a difficult time when you had to report 
to the Minister about this call? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes, Chair, and I had a difficult time 
subsequent to that and maybe at the end, Chairperson, I 
would like to do – just few – make a few remarks because 
it has been a call that I have been asked in so many 
quarters to explain. 
CHAIRPERSON:   About that call? 
20 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that so?  
MS MOKHOLO:   And …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Well, if you choose to say 
something about that and other matters at the end then 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 72 of 274 
 
that is fine.  Mr Seleka.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Ma’am Ms Mokholo, 
how long after you know from a day’s time point of view, 
your call with the President did you have this opportunity 
to report to the Minister? 
MS MOKHOLO:  Immediately on her return from Dubai 
which was few days. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  A few days after? 
MS MOKHOLO:  A few days after.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course did you hear either on the 26 t h 
10 
or after that the board meeting was postponed? 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes, it is subsequent I learnt that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh alright.   
MS MOKHOLO:  And I subsequently learnt that the 
President called the Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Chairperson. 
MS MOKHOLO:  Because even in my conversation the 
Chairperson did not mention that, that he had already 
received the call from, from the President.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  And we understand 
from the evidence already presented to the Commission, 
that the board had a meeting on the 9 t h of March, after the 
meeting of the 26 t h had been cancelled or postponed.  And 
it had this meeting as a reaction to the meetings Mr Tsotsi 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 73 of 274 
 
had with the President and others, at the President’s 
residence in Durban, official residence in Durban.   
So the meeting of the 9 t h take place and the Board 
is told about what the President has asked Mr Tsotsi to do 
and the Board itself to do.  That meeting was short lived 
because no decisions were made.  And the Board wanted 
to meet with the Minister.   
They were able to secure a meeting with the 
Minister two days later on the 11 t h of March 2015.  The 
Minister did attend the meeting of the Board.  You have 
10 
indicated or stated in your affidavit that you attended with 
the Minister.  Could you explain to the Chairperson how 
you got invited to that meeting? 
MS MOKHOLO:  So Chairperson I was contacted by Ms 
Kim Davids who was the Minister ’s personal assistant.  
Because I had firstly I received the call directly from the 
Minister requesting me to attend the meeting at Eskom with 
her.   
So I then contacted Ms Davids to establish the 
purpose of the meeting, because normally there would be 
20 
an agenda for, for the meeting.  And also because I always 
wanted to go into this meeting prepared and to know what 
is going to be discussed.   
Because normally when you attend a meeting with 
the Minister, you are also there not only as an aid to have, 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 74 of 274 
 
but also to, also provide support and advise on, on 
matters.  So I wanted to know what was going to be 
discussed.   
So Ms Davids informed me that the meeting was 
going to be with the, the Board Sub-Committee of the 
people and, and governance.  And so they are going to 
give some report to the Minister.  And I then proceeded 
then to attend the meeting with the Minister the following 
day.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  So just to understand, you are told that 
10 
this meeting that is going to take place on the 11 t h of 
March 2015, is going to be with the Sub-Committee?  The 
Board Sub-Committee?  Not the Board? 
MS MOKHOLO:  Not the full board.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  They do not say to you it is the Board? 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes.  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay, proceed.   
MS MOKHOLO:  And I think Chairperson it may be it is 
important that why the, if it is the Sub-Committee of the 
Board, similar to the protocol I spoke about that the 
20 
Minister will always interact with the Chairperson and if 
there are matters that the report is going to be made, the 
Chairperson can bring one or two board members, for 
example if we are going to discuss issues that risk the 
finances, there could be the Chairperson of the audit or 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 75 of 274 
 
Audit and Risk Committee.   
So there would be those.  I was not really surprised 
when it was the meeting of the – when she, Ms Davids said 
it is the meeting of the PNG.  Because we do meet with the 
sub-committees of the board when they give reports on 
their, their activities of the committees.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  So are you saying those meetings will 
be, will include the Minister?  If a meeting with a sub-
committee it will include the Minister? 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes.  There would be meetings where the 
10 
Minister can be invited.  For example as I am saying, there 
will be a meeting of the Audit and Risk Committee, they 
wanted to give a report.   
Will receive annual, quarterly reports, so maybe we 
want to, they want to give a quarterly report on the work of 
the Audit and Risk Committee.  Yes, and those meetings 
they can have.  So the Chairperson he can bring other 
members of the committees of the board that … 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
Please 
remember 
to 
face 
the 
Chairperson.   
20 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, just carry on.  I think I will ask you 
other questions as we go along.  You are informed about 
this meeting, so you are invited to it.  You are told by Kim 
Davids is that the Minister ’s PA?   
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 76 of 274 
 
MS MOKHOLO:  PA, yes.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  Is she telling you on the day of 
the meeting or the day before? 
MS MOKHOLO:  The evening when I called.  Immediately 
after receiving the call when I asked her, is there 
documentation, is there an agenda.  Is there something 
that I can read to prepare for the meeting.  And then she 
indicated 
that 
no, 
it 
is 
the 
meeting 
with 
the 
PNG 
Committee. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay, so you are communicating with 
10 
her the evening before? 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Take us to the day.  You go, the next 
day you go to the meeting? 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes so the … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Do you go with the Minister or you meet 
with the Minister at Eskom? 
MS MOKHOLO:  I drove.  We drove separately.  We met at 
Eskom.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Was the Minister expecting you from 
20 
your observation of her? 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  Take us into the meeting.   
MS MOKHOLO:  So we get to Eskom.  We are ushered to 
the board room and then I notice as we enter that, it is the 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 77 of 274 
 
full board that is present.  Not only the members of the 
PNG, including the executives.  In this case it was Mr 
Mathona(?) and Ms Zulu Molefe as the ex-officio members 
of the board and so then we, we entered the board room.  
Then I sat next to the Minister.   
And then the Minister began actually we were 
sitting to address the meeting that there are bugs in the, in 
the room.  And that this, the boardroom should be swept 
before the meeting could begin.  In this case she was 
referring to that there could be surveillance devices which 
10 
would then allow other parties access to what is being 
discussed and what is transpiring at the meeting.   
So the Minister was assured, I cannot recall exactly 
who I think headed, it was the CEO, or assured the 
Minister that the room was clear and there were no bugs.  
And, and then we proceed, Eskom proceeded by then to 
and then standard norm to call some, one of the executives 
to do the safety drill and evacuation procedure and date it 
at and then the meeting began.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  We understand from the evidence that 
20 
prior to the Minister and the board’s dealing with the 
issues 
for 
which 
the 
Minister 
was 
called, 
that 
the 
executives were excused.  Do you recall anything? 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes.  So Chairperson so firstly maybe the 
beginning, the Minister started by talking to a few issues of 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 78 of 274 
 
the war-room and the challenges that we are facing, the 
war-room at that point in time.  Because I was also a 
member of, of the Eskom war-room for which I was the 
convener 
of 
the 
Eskom 
war-room 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
department, working together with the Presidency.   
And so some of the issues that were then being 
discussed related to the issue of switching off the non-
paying municipalities that were not servicing Eskom, their 
Eskom account.  The issues of the director ’s liabilities.  
There was issues relating to the mishandling of load 
10 
shedding by Eskom and its executive and the sabotaging of 
Eskom Power Stations.   
So there were a lot of matters that were sitting that, 
that the Minister started addressing also from her own 
speaking notes.  So then I realised that the way this, the 
ready operational issues if I may say that … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So just saying Ms Mokholo, just before 
that I was asking the question, you have heard from the 
evidence that before the Minister and the board discussed 
the issues for which the Minister was called for.  That the 
20 
executives were excused.  Can you recall whether that took 
place? 
MS MOKHOLO:  Not immediately.  They were not excused 
immediately.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 79 of 274 
 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I see. 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes, hence I was saying there were a lot 
of operational matters.  Minister started first by addressing 
the war-room. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh I see. 
MS MOKHOLO:  And issues.  So we did, we did not shoot 
straight to have the executives excused.  So it is a later, at 
a later stage that then the executives were asked to be 
excused.  And then Minister proceeded.   
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  So at what stage?  Are you at that 
stage now or not yet? 
MS MOKHOLO:  It was at the stage – so as the Minister 
was, 
once 
Minister 
has 
engaged 
on 
the 
war-room 
challenges, the results, that is when the executives were 
asked to be, to be excused.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Can you recall who is asking them to be 
excused?  Or who asked them? 
MS MOKHOLO:  Minister asked that the executives be 
excused. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  So what was further discussed 
then in their absence? 
MS MOKHOLO:  Then there was the discussion that the 
executives they would, they would, there would be made to 
do a deep dive into Eskom.  And so it may be necessary for 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 80 of 274 
 
the executives to be asked to step aside and there were a 
number of – there were a few terms that were used Mr 
Chairperson.   
Though 
stepping 
aside, 
take, 
guarding 
leave, 
suspensions, so it was a mixture of terminologies that 
were, that were being used.  And there was also a 
discussion around if the executives are to step aside, who 
would act in their position.   
And I cannot recall exactly at that particular point 
which 
board 
member 
was 
talking, 
but 
there 
was 
a 
10 
discussion that took place while we were still there with 
the Minister.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Was there a clear indication as to the 
executives that would be required to step aside or be 
suspended?  Or take this forced leave?  Well in your 
recollection? 
MS MOKHOLO:  Ja.  No, not the names of the people but 
there was a discussion around the, the challenges that 
Eskom was faced with during that time because of load 
shedding and, and the fact that there were concerns also 
20 
coming from the war-room that Eskom is not furnishing 
adequate information and the reliability of that information.   
And the state of the power station at that point in 
time, the issues relating to Eskom finances and the fact 
that we, we had just actually sort of wrecked(?), we were 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 81 of 274 
 
working on a letter that we had received from Eskom 
indicating that there may be requiring further equity 
injections.  So but we did not discuss that, the names of 
the people in particular.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Well I think that evidence is been 
established before the Chairperson.  It is interesting that 
you say the Minister mentioned issues of mishandling of 
load shedding and sabotaging of power stations.  Did you 
understand what she meant about that? 
MS MOKHOLO:  To the extent that I was part of the war-
10 
room, I understood that because of load shedding as there 
was a view coming from certain quotas that this load 
shedding could be orchestrated and so it – there is a 
sabotage taking place at Eskom.   
So it is manufactured, it is not as purely by the 
state of the infrastructure or operational for instance.  So 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
there 
had 
been 
those 
kinds 
of 
discussions previously, I read sabotage to mean something 
like that.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  And then she is now communicating 
20 
with the board about this? 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And the board is engaging with her on 
this?  Do you recall whether the boards or at least some 
members are because most of them are new, there is two 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 82 of 274 
 
that have been there before.  Do you recall whether there 
is confirmation that, yes we also suspect the sabotage or 
that we know there is sabotage? 
MS MOKHOLO:  It – I would not say there was a yes or no, 
but there was the loadings and then there was concurrence 
in terms of some of the other discussions for example to 
say, some of the board members indicating that yes 
Minister we are aware.  And there is a credibility issue on 
us as the board, if these matters are not being handled 
swiftly.   
10 
And, and also gave the results of the concerns that 
they are some of the board members indicated they are 
having with the quality of the reports that would come from 
the, from the executives.   
And Chairperson maybe it is important also to 
mention that this meeting came at the back of the war-room 
meeting that we had a few days ago and Eskom had 
actually made a presentation in the war-room at IMC and 
where the CEO was indicating the plans that they are 
putting in place.   
20 
How to deal with load shedding, how to deal with all 
the finance and, and all of that.  So my view sitting there, I 
was really of the view that if we in the war-room had been 
made and we had received that presentation, at some point 
to the board should have been also briefed on the same 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 83 of 274 
 
information, because this was the presentation that was 
made at the ANC level.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Well, you know, now that you have 
mentioned this that you – the meeting came against the 
backdrop of a meeting you had a few days before of the 
war-room, the Minister ’s version seems to convey in her 
affidavit which you have been provided with, seems to 
convey the impression that on that day, on the 11 t h of 
March 2015, she was in fact coming from the war-room 
meeting which she was unpleasant about.  And she had to 
10 
go to this meeting of Eskom.   
MS MOKHOLO:  It would not have been Chairperson on the 
same day.  It would not have been on the 11 t h.  So if you 
allow me Chairperson just to maybe to in a few sentences 
to explain how the war-room worked.  The war-room was 
made of three layers if I may say.   
You had the technical level which was made of us, 
the Technocrats.  Then you had what we called the 
strategic level, which would be the ministers.  So the 
ministers in this case would be the Minister of Public 
20 
Enterprises and the Minister of Energy, policy departments 
that are relevant.   
National Treasury and others.  Then the third layer 
would be the inter-ministerial committee which was chaired 
by the then Deputy President.  And so what would happen 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 84 of 274 
 
is that at the technical level we would sit with the Eskom 
executives to prepare for the two tiers, prepare for the 
strategic level and the IMC.   
And then we would then make comments on the 
Eskom 
presentation, 
how 
it 
should 
be 
strengthened.  
Issues that may come from the ministers as we go to the 
next level.  And then, the ministers once they have been 
briefed as well, they would make their own comments in 
preparation now of the IMC, which will be checked by the 
Deputy President.   
10 
So the technical meetings, we held them every 
Friday morning with no fail, seven o’clock at the Union 
Building, every Friday.  And then those, there would be the 
precursors to the meeting of the ministers and then the 
meeting of the ministers would then lead into the meeting 
of the IMC.   
The IMC that we had behind this meeting of the 11 t h 
of March was the IMC that we had had the week before, I 
think it was in Cape Town on Tuesday.  Because I 
remember it was in Cape Town at the boardroom of the 
20 
Deputy President there.  So it would not have been Chair 
on the same day, the war-room.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Well you will recall from her 
affidavit, the Minister is saying Chairperson, just to read 
from her affidavit.  On 11 March 2015, 11 March 2015 was 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 85 of 274 
 
a Wednesday she says. 
“I 
had 
attended 
another 
frustrating 
war-room 
meeting.  From there my team being the then Acting 
DG of the Department of Public Enterprises and 
other officials and I dashed to Eskom board meeting 
which was already in progress.” 
 
That is the Acting Director General that would be 
you? 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes it will be me Chair.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  And she say, and other officials.  Were 
10 
there other officials with you in that meeting? 
MS MOKHOLO:  No.  The meeting of the 11 t h? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The meeting on the 11 t h of March? 
MS MOKHOLO:  No, no.  I was the only official for the 
department that particular day. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So you are saying there would not have 
been a war-room meeting on that day? 
MS MOKHOLO:  No.  Chairperson it would not have, there 
would not have been a war-room.  The meeting of the 11 t h 
was in the morning.  So we would not … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it would have been around nine 
o’clock. 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If I am not mistaken.   
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes.  So if we had the war-room, war-
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 86 of 274 
 
rooms there would be, there would have been at lunch of 
that – yes.  And as I said, my – the request for me to 
attend the meeting, I received it from the Minister the night 
before about the meeting.  So there would not have been a 
war-room.  I think probably it is the confusion of the dates. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  When reference was made to a meeting 
of the war-room, would that mean all the three layers that 
you talked about of the war-room?  In other words if she 
said she had been at a war-room meeting, would she be 
10 
talking about all these three layers?   
The technocrats, the strategic leadership and the 
committee that was lead by the Deputy President?  Or 
could she talk about having been to a war-room meeting, 
even if she was speaking simply about a meeting of those 
who were at strategic level, namely the ministers?   
MS MOKHOLO:  If there would have been a war-room then 
it would have been a strategic one.  But I would have 
attended that war-room meeting with her as I said that I 
was the co-convener of the war-room for the department, 
20 
so.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  If it was a meeting of the whole 
war-room you would have attended there as well?  If it was 
a meeting of the whole war-room, all three layers.  Is it 
not?  You would have been expected to be there as well. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 87 of 274 
 
MS MOKHOLO:  On all the three layers I would attend. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOLO:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If it was a meeting only of those who 
were at strategic level, namely the ministers, would you 
ordinarily have accompanied the minister to such a meeting 
or not necessarily? 
MS MOKHOLO:  I would also still be part of that because 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will be part of that. 
10 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes, because at the technical level … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MOKHOLO:  It is us who are presenting to the Minister.  
CHAIRPERSON:  She would depend on you for check and 
support? 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MOKHOLO:  So the technical team, the entire technical 
team is us, we are presenting to the ministers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The ministers. 
20 
MS MOKHOLO:  Together with Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MS MOKHOLO:  And then the ministers would take that 
presentation, if they endorse the contents or will make a – 
and it will go to the next tier.  
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 88 of 274 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MOKHOLO:  So both, the first tier minister would not 
take part of it because it is only us, at the technical level, 
the officials.  But at the strategic and the IMC, both 
meetings I would be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So is your evidence that since you did 
not, since you know that you didn’t attend any war-room 
meeting that morning, the Minister is probably mistaken 
about having been to a war-room, or war-room meeting 
before going to the Eskom board meeting? 
10 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes Chairperson.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Insofar Ms Mokholo 
you say the Minister talked about the issues that the war-
room and Eskom, not furnishing correct information.  Are 
you able to say anything about that because you are the 
co-convener of the war-room you say at Eskom?   
You attend as you have just said all the meetings of 
the three tiers of the war-room.  You would be, you would 
have been at the core of the functionings of the war-room.  
20 
What do you, what do you say about that comment? 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes Chairperson, there were areas of 
concerns and there were times indeed where members of 
the war-room complained about the quality of information 
that was coming from Eskom.  For example there would be, 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 89 of 274 
 
Eskom 
would 
indicate 
that 
there 
would 
be 
no 
load 
shedding, and all of a sudden you are informed that we are 
going to into stage 2, went into stage 3.   
There was a time Eskom would indicate that they 
have sufficient money for diesel and in two days time you 
receive a letter from Eskom that says, we are running out 
of money.  There would be a time when that Eskom would 
give assurance that there is still enough supply of coal and 
then in a day, few days’ time you are told that there is 
issues or challenges relating to coal.   
10 
So there were incidences and times when indeed 
they, the information we would, as members of the war-
room and then the technical level would have concerns 
about the information.  But the essence of the Friday 
meetings was precisely to give those at the technical level, 
so that we are then able to get the status quo of Eskom, 
because it was based on the five point plan.   
So we would do a dashboard of looking at the 
issues precisely so that then we can try to address this 
whole issue that there is no, there is lack of information.  
20 
And then we can assist Eskom executives in time, prior 
going to the strategic meeting and going to the IMC on the 
issues of information.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you and the Minister went to the 
Eskom meeting on the 11 t h, had the two of you not had 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 90 of 274 
 
have any prior meeting to talk about what was going to be 
discussed at the Eskom meeting? 
MS MOKHOLO:  At this meeting of the 11 t h? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am talking about the meeting of the 
Minister with the board of Eskom on the 11 t h, on the 
morning of the 11 t h of March 2015.  The question is 
whether prior to the two of you attending that meeting, you 
had not the two of you had a meeting to discuss what was 
to be discussed at the meeting with the board? 
MS MOKHOLO:  No Chairperson.  We did not have that 
10 
opportunity.  As I indicated, I was informed by the Minister 
of the meeting the night before the 11 t h.  And when I 
inquired from the PA, from the PA, what would be the 
issues to be discussed or the agenda, it was we were 
going to receive a report from the PNG.   
So there was no conversation or the opportunity 
then to have a conversation with the Minister about the 
meeting of the 11 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let us go, let’s go to the actual 
meeting at Eskom, between the Minister and the board.  
20 
Evidence has been lead that the Minister identified all 
areas, or put for use at Eskom that needed to be subjected 
to an inquiry.  There, is that, is that your recollection as 
well? 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes Chairperson it will be my recollection 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 91 of 274 
 
in – I tried to have my hand written notes also attached to 
my affidavit because I was trying to take notes as the 
issues were, were being discussed.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes.  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you got your notes?  Do you know 
by there?  Are they the ones at page 442, black numbers 
442?   
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes Chairperson, that will be those ones. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
10 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you – but what are you saying to the 
question that I have just asked?  Is that your recollection 
as well or do you need to look at your notes? 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes.  That will be my recollection as well 
and also looking at my notes Chairperson, because as I 
say, it was not a structured meeting from my point of view.  
It is a meeting that I was just, that I used in my affidavit, 
the word ambushed that I went in so as Minister was 
talking I was making notes of what was coming.   
20 
And as the board members were talking I was making 
notes.  But insofar as the areas, yes there was a issues 
that I would say that the evidence that was lead, it is, it is 
correct that Minister mentioned those areas in addition to 
the investigation by, by ...[indistinct – word cut-off] which 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 92 of 274 
 
has the concerns that has now led to this deep dive and 
then the issue of the stepping aside of the executives or 
garden[?] leave, or suspensions and the areas that would 
need to – that the Board would need to pay, focus on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The areas that were to be investigated 
were four, is that correct? 
MS MOKHOLO:  Chairperson in my notes I wrote a whole 
lot, so they could be covered, I would not say specifically I 
was writing ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You would not recall. 
10 
MS MOKHOLO:   These four areas ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MS MOKHOLO:   But I was just making notes as the 
Minister was giving her address. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, yes, well there was evidence that 
the Minister said to the Board that she could not instruct 
the Board what to do or what decisions to make and there 
was evidence before this Commission to the effect that 
although the Minister said that it was quite clear or it was 
– one could read between the lines that the Minister 
20 
wanted the relevant executives to be suspended.   
Would you say that is a fair understanding of the 
interaction between the Minister and the Board on that 
occasion?      
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes, Chairperson and in my affidavit I do 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 93 of 274 
 
allude to that as well to say hence the words that were 
used was that the executives they should be put – they 
should take garden[?] leave, they should step aside, be 
suspended.  So the understanding was that yes something 
must happen during the deep dive but they should not be 
there.   
Whether they step aside and what – those are the 
issues that the Board would have to deal with.  Whether 
they are being suspended or they take garden leave to 
allow the deep dive.    
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Seleka.      
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair, in so far Ms Mokholo 
as you say that you were attending all the meetings of the 
war room whichever level or tier I was.  Can you recall how 
often the Minister Lynn Brown attended the meetings where 
either the Ministers were required to attend or where she 
was required to attend?   
MS MOKHOLO:   Frequently Chairperson, the Eskom war 
room was the main focus of what cabinet had given the 
department as a mandate.   
20 
So hence the Minister was the Chairperson of this 
strategic team and then I would be the co-convener 
together with the presidency because the meetings were 
taken place in the presidency and to give it even implies 
hence the decision was taken that the deputy President 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 94 of 274 
 
would lead and then the IMC.  So the Minister would attend 
frequently because it was part of her core function as the 
shareholder Minister responsible for DPE.  So she would 
attend the meetings frequently.      
ADV SELEKA SC:   So she was a regular attendee.  
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Would you say that or she attended 
every meeting or some meetings? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Some meetings it would not be there 
would be times when she is not able to attend but it would 
10 
be on a regular basis as I say given that it was our 
mandate as the department.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now looking at the contents of what 
was being discussed with the Minister which you have set 
out operational issues of Eskom.  Is that normally what 
would the Board do discuss operational issues with the 
Minister the shareholder representative? 
MS MOKHOLO:   No Chairperson in the meeting proceeded 
I listened and when I realised that some of indeed some of 
these issues are matters that actually the Board could 
20 
deliberate 
on 
and 
then 
decide 
and 
make 
a 
proper 
resolution and report it to the Minister you do not need 
shareholder when you discussion that kind of detail.   
I noted that and I made a note to a Minister 
indicating that factor that the issues that are being 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 95 of 274 
 
discussed in this meeting are way to operational.  So both 
of us should not be in the meeting, I made that note to the 
Minister to that effect as a matter to say maybe let us 
excuse ourselves we need to leave because that are being 
discussed are way to operational for us.  Even the 
suspension for executives it is a matter that the Board 
must deal with and then just come to the shareholder 
because Minister anyway does not appoint executives.   
Ministers powers of appointment is limited to the 
official members of the Board which is the CEO and the 
10 
CFO and even in those circumstances and in the past and 
even given the other experience how we dealt with other 
SOE’s the Board would be the one that go through the 
process and then they would pass a resolution, they would 
table it to the Minister and then Minister Lynn can 
deliberate on.  So I did indicate that to the Minister in the 
meeting.           
ADV SELEKA SC:   And what was the Minister ’s reaction to 
you?  
MS MOKHOLO:   The first note that I handed to the 
20 
Minister, the Minister looked at it, read it and noted to me 
as I handed it over because she was on the podium and 
then but she continued to proceed and engage with the 
Board on the trajectory of the war room issues, again that 
there must be an investigation or a deep diving to all of 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 96 of 274 
 
those issues including the affairs of Eskom and the 
executives.  So as the conversation ensued I made a 
second note to the Minister but then the conversation 
continued.  It was later now I then raised my hand to 
request an opportunity to speak engagements were going 
on and I was afforded that opportunity then I addressed the 
Minister and the Board.   
I indicated that I do not think its proper for us to be 
sitting and matters that are really operational that the 
Board must be dealing with that the Board must be sit with 
10 
and what the Board must do they must deliberate on their 
own, make their own report, give it to the Minister and then 
the Minister can then engage us as her officials to say how 
do we approach the issues.   
But it is no way that we could be sitting and 
discussing operational matters and then at that point then 
the Minister indicated that it is correct and that is right the 
Board must deliberate on all the issues that I have raised 
however I would hang around and I would await feedback 
from the Chair.       
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would it be a fair comment given the 
operational nature of the matters that the Minister was 
discussing with the Board as you have said, would it be 
fair comment to say when the Minister said that after 
leaving the Board the meeting she would hang around that 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 97 of 274 
 
in effect she was meaning that she would still be around to 
give guidance or advise in case the Board needed to talk 
to him about some of this issues  
MS MOKHOLO:   Well Chair it would be fair, however it 
would be also difficult in a sense that given the magnitude 
of the issues you would want to give that Board time to 
deliberate and then they must do a proper report to her 
because on the basis of what the Board has been 
presenting to the Minister then she would be able to act.   
So when I raised that point in the meeting I was not 
10 
expecting that we would get that report on the same day.  
It was – now that we had what the Board is saying what 
Minister had put it to the Board.  They can deliberate look 
at all the ramifications, make a proper report and then only 
then Minister can have something in writing to say the 
Board deliberate this is where the issues they looked into, 
these were the pros and cons of every decision that they 
are thinking and then only on that then she can act.   
When we left that meeting with the Minister the 
Chairperson walked us out and we did brief at the coffee 
20 
station, Eskom has some it is like a holding room of some 
sort where we get the Ministers as it.   
We went there myself and the Chairperson and the 
Minister to debrief even in that debrief I indicated to the 
Chairperson that the Minister must get a report, I said 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 98 of 274 
 
Minister you need to get a report it was all on the basis of 
a report the Minister should then be able to see what were 
the issues that the Board were conversing and where it 
come to and issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But having said all of that you do say it 
would be fair comment to say that what I have said.             
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes, I am saying Chairperson it would be 
called fair when you are saying when you looking at the 
magnitude of the issues but the fact that the Minister would 
sit at Eskom wait for the report itself that is why I am 
10 
saying for me it would not be, it does not sound reasonable 
because you still have to allow that same Board to deal 
with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but the bottom line is it goes back to 
what your concern was as the meeting was going on 
namely 
that 
the 
Minister 
was 
involving 
herself 
in 
operational issues that was your concern, is it not?     
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is why you kept on notes to say 
let’s leave and she was not disagreeing with you that you 
20 
should leave because I think you say in your affidavit she 
was nodding that these are not the types of issues that you 
know should be discussed in your presence, in the 
Ministers presence she should not be participating in that.   
But obviously when she said she would hang around 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 99 of 274 
 
for some time if that hanging around was meant to enable 
further interaction between herself and the Board it could 
only have been intended to be an interaction between 
herself and the Board on the issues that had been 
discussed at the meeting.        
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   It could not have been something else, 
ja.  
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Seleka.  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair and the Minister said 
she will hang around tell us what happens, what does the 
Minister do after that where do you go after that as you 
leave the meeting? 
MS 
MOKHOLO: 
 
 
Yes, 
after 
those 
few 
minutes 
debriefing…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or maybe before that I am sorry Mr 
Seleka.  At the meeting between the Minister and the 
Board when the issue of the suspensions of the executives 
was discussed they use different terms interchanging the 
20 
suspension or step aside or special leave when it was 
discussed 
where 
names 
of 
the 
affected 
executives 
mentioned.   
MS MOKHOLO:   No Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON:   The names were not mentioned? 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 100 of 274 
 
MS MOKHOLO:   Names were not mentioned.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But it was understood that the officials 
who would need to step aside or to be suspended were the 
executives who were head of the particular portfolios that 
were going to be subjected to an enquiry.  
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
MS MOKHOLO:   And those were the same people that 
were part of our team at the technical level in the war 
room. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  So the question was 
the Minister sys I will hang around to the Board and if you 
need further discussion I am around.  What exactly 
happens as you leave the Board meeting, where do you 
go? 
MS MOKHOLO:   So I left the holding room I went back to 
the office, I left Minister at Eskom – at some point actually 
when we were in the holding room there was whether 
Minister will still stay physically at Eskom or she will go by 
20 
to the next centre around but she will be around but I left 
her at Eskom.    
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you left the Minister at Eskom?  
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So she actually literally hanged around 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 101 of 274 
 
at Eskom? 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes, Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON:   You were not prepared to do that?  
MS MOKHOLO:   No Chairperson there was a lot of things 
acting.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now Ms Mokholo is this also the way 
the Minister was invited to the meeting, you and the 
Minister.  Is that the normal way in which the Minister 
would be invited to a Board meeting?  
MS MOKHOLO:   No, Chairperson there is two main types 
10 
of Board meetings that the Minister would engage with the 
SOE’s on.  The first one is obviously the annual general 
meeting the prescribed meeting in terms of the company’s 
act we’ve covered within detail in terms of explaining it in 
the MOI’s with all the State owned companies and actually 
the process that is – you know we’ve choreographed that 
parties to the T in the department.   
The second meeting so the first meeting of the 
annual general meeting were all the strategic issues no 
having discussed this particular intent.  Ministers plan with 
20 
the SOE for the year and matters that she would have 
observed in the year and what the Board could do in the 
new year or if there is changes of the Board that is where 
those changes would be allowed so it’s a serious meeting.   
The second one that is also provided for is a 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 102 of 274 
 
statutory meeting is the special general meeting.  This is to 
cater from those meetings that are not your annual general 
meeting but you could have urgent matters that we need to 
bring to Ministers attention and he cannot wait for the 
annual general meeting.  For example, the Board wanted to 
they were concerns relating to one of their own and they 
were one of the Board members to be removed.  That could 
fall under general meeting because then they would have 
to be a process of resolutions and all of that.  If there is a 
serious matter that relates to the conduct of one of the 
10 
executives or there is a serious operational matter that has 
serious implications to the entity and even to government 
that could not wait for the annual general meeting and 
those would fall under the general special meeting.   
So if it is a special general meeting there is a 
procedure for those there would be a request coming from 
the company secretary if the meeting is triggers by the 
company.  If it is triggers by us it would be us preparing 
and resolution for the Minister the Board the shareholder 
resolution calling for a special general meeting.   
20 
In terms of the Companies Act then the special 
general meeting you must in the resolution give the agenda 
on the issues that are going to be discussed.  So those are 
the two meetings where Ministers engages the full Board.  
The other meetings that could happen then the 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 103 of 274 
 
Minister will engage as I indicated earlier on that there is a 
matter on a financial matter that the Chairperson wants to 
bring to the attention of the Minister they will bring the 
CEO and the CFO and maybe one Board member and 
maybe the Chairperson audit and risk or the Chairperson of 
social and ethics.   
So those would be those kind of meetings that are 
being requested.  So this particular one on the 11 t h it I very 
difficult for me – I could not put it as an annual general 
meeting, it did not meet the requirement, it was not a 
10 
special general meeting because it was not triggered by 
from my side or from our side as a department Minister 
wanting to discuss certain things with the Board.  It was 
not triggered by the company secretary requesting through 
the SGM.  So it was one of those meetings. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  Ja just quickly and 
will move on to the next point I see that from paragraph 48. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We are at seven minutes to one.   
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I take it that we are at the end.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   At a near – we are nearing the end 
Chair, thank you Chair.  Page 431 just quickly on that I will 
read from the affidavit that you say that PNG member, PNG 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 104 of 274 
 
committee member you have corrected the name to be 
Veneta, Ms Veneta Klein began by giving a report that on 
the work that was mandated to the sub-committee that 
there needs to be an investigation around the face of 
Eskom and she proceeded with details.   
As discussions were proceeding I sent a Minister 
second note which has stated we should leave and so you 
go into that.  So you recall Ms Veneta Klein addressing the 
meeting about the investigation?  
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes, Chairperson yes before and hence I 
10 
said earlier I was not perturbed when Ms Davis said they 
were meeting the PNG.  There were a lot of matters that 
this 
committee 
they 
were 
dealing 
with 
around 
the 
executives not only this executives that were in the war 
room but other executives of prescribed officers in Eskom 
that they were dealing with.   
So there were a lot of contestation amongst certain 
executives.  So she started also talking about the work of 
the what the people in governance is doing around just 
cleaning up the governance within Eskom.          
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So just two aspects I want you to 
address the Chairperson on.  The one which you deal with I 
your affidavit is the secondment of Mr Brian Molefe from 
Transnet to Eskom the secondment of Mr Anoj Singh as 
well from Transnet to Eskom.  Just briefly explain to the 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 105 of 274 
 
Chair person or relate to the Chairperson what you know 
about the secondment firstly of Mr Brian Molefe and how it 
came about?    
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes, so Chairperson I cannot remember 
the exact date but I know it was around between March 
2015 and April 2015.  I was requested by the Minister to 
accompany her to a meeting at Eskom and the meeting was 
to deal with the secondment of Mr Molefe.     
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you know that beforehand? 
MS MOKHOLO:   I did not know that beforehand I learnt 
10 
that on my way to the meeting.   
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Sorry 
what 
did 
you 
not 
know 
beforehand? 
MS MOKHOLO:  That the meeting at Eskom was going to 
discuss the secondment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What it was going to discuss?   
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes, yes I learnt that on my way to the 
meeting actually the Minister is the one that informed me.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   The Minister is the one who informed 
you.  
20 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Were you with the Minister in the car 
or are you again driving separately? 
MS MOKHOLO:   No we travelled separately again.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   You travelled separately.  
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 106 of 274 
 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So how did you – you say you learnt 
about it on the way so how did you learn, did she 
telephone you?  
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes Minister telephoned and requested 
that she is meeting with the Chairperson at Eskom, actually 
she is meeting with both Chairperson’s at Eskom and that 
she would like me to accompany her to the meeting and 
then on the way she called to indicate that she is going to 
be there earlier than me and the meeting is going to take 
10 
place at the Chairpersons office and is to discuss the 
transfer not the transfer the secondment of Mr Molefe to 
Eskom.   
We had the brief discussion around the challenges 
she was remarking that Eskom is giving me grey hair and 
really I need to sort out the issues.  We need leadership in 
that entity and then I said Minister I would join the meeting 
yes.      
ADV SELEKA SC:   And who is the Chairperson at this 
time? 
20 
MS MOKHOLO:   It was Doctor Ngubane was now the 
acting Chairperson at that point.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Of the Eskom Board.  
MS MOKHOLO:   Of the Eskom Board, yes Sir.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, let us go into the meeting.  
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 107 of 274 
 
MS MOKHOLO:   And then in the meeting we were which 
went by Mr Sithemba Khoza who was by then now the 
acting CEO as well as the Chairperson of Transnet Ms 
Linda Mabaso and then of course it was myself present 
together with the Minister.   
Mr Dlamini who was in the office of the Chair at that 
point came into the meeting but was not part of the 
meeting so there were no formal recordings or minutes 
being taken, everybody was taking their own notes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what transpired at this meeting 
10 
about the secondment of Mr Molefe?         
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes and then the Chairperson, the acting 
Chairperson Dr Ngubane is the one that opened the 
meeting by indicating that Eskom – they wanted to check 
with the Minister the ability of seconding Mr Molefe from 
Transnet to Eskom and hence both the Chairperson are 
there.   
The Minister indicated that the reason she has 
asked me to join the meeting was not only because of the 
acting DG but also from my role as the DG responsible for 
20 
legal governance and risk.  To be able to advise the Board 
in terms of are the things that needs to be looked into if 
the secondment is to be considered.   
So in that meeting Dr Ngubane indicated that Mr 
Molefe is regarded as the ideal candidate because of this 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 108 of 274 
 
is going to be a temporary position while the Board is 
embarking on a selection and a recruitment process for a 
permanency because Minister had written to the Board 
prior to say they must start looking at the strengthening 
leadership within the company.   
Now the proposal was then supported by the 
Transnet 
Chairperson 
because 
both 
Chairperson 
then 
agreed that Minister Molefe was a perfect candidate for the 
position.  Even Mr Charm[?] and Gravitas[?] in the market 
place 
his 
relationship 
the 
banking 
sector, 
his 
past 
10 
experience with having been a senior official at National 
Treasury and his role with the PIC and also just the 
reputation that he has built with the Transnet within a short 
space of time he has been able to build a good relationship 
with Transnet and other stakeholders.  So those were some 
of the reasons that were put why him, then…[intervene]      
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry Ms Mokholo you want to carry on 
just do not forget, did it appear to you in that meeting 
whether or not the persons in the meeting were discussing 
this issues for the first time?    
20 
MS MOKHOLO:   No Chairperson it did not come out as a 
matter 
of 
fact 
it 
was 
clear 
that 
at 
least 
the 
two 
Chairpersons they have had this conversation before and I 
think then they did try prior to the meeting to raise it to the 
Minister hence the meeting was requested because in the 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 109 of 274 
 
meeting Minister when she introduced my attendance as 
well was we would need it to look at the do ability from 
whether we needed to – is it a matter that would require us 
to go to cabinet or not.  
But also Mr Molefe had a contract with Transnet 
that was due to terminate within a year and a few months’ 
time and Mr Matona by then and this is when I was given 
the opportunity just to then express my view in terms of the 
proposal.  That once the two Boards would meet from the 
governance side is that they must engage as the Board 
10 
because there would have to be resolution that would have 
to be drafted that concerns us.  But also some of the 
issues that they need to take into account includes the fact 
that yes Mr Molefe’s contract as a year and a couple of 
months to run with Transnet but Mr Matona is still the 
standard with full packs.   
So for purpose of PFMA and fruitless and wasteful 
and irregular expenditure is something that the Board 
would have to look into because you are going to be still 
paying him and you going to bring somebody into act and if 
20 
you going to be paying the acting allowance you will be 
paying two people.   
But also the Board must look into Transnet itself 
who is going to act in Transnet and to that it was 
responded Ms Mabaso responded is that the good thing 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 110 of 274 
 
with Transnet is that it does not have challenges like 
Eskom and it said that there is many executives at 
Transnet that could step in, in the acing positions.  The 
one issue was maybe we look at the issue of the 
remuneration we could consider Transnet continuing to pay 
Mr Molefe’s salary even if he is seconded at Eskom.   
But 
then 
it 
needs 
to 
be 
considered 
carefully 
because if you are going to bring somebody to act in Mr 
Molefe’s position as the CEO at Transnet it is additional 
responsibility for that divisional team so they would need 
10 
to be paid an acting allowance as well.  So you are going 
to, Transnet to pay the money on services rendered 
somewhere else and at the same time they are paying 
somebody.  So there were all this dynamics that we 
requested then the two Boards will have to sit and then 
debate and then put a proposition and then to be 
considered by the department.                    
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja so then the rest is history because 
then on the 17 t h of April 2015 the Minister did announce 
her decision to second Mr Molefe to Eskom.  You were 
20 
present at that conference?  
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes, at the press conference I was.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   That took place at Eskom? 
MS MOKHOLO:   It took place at Eskom.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   And how and you also state how Mr 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 111 of 274 
 
Anoj Singh got to be seconded to Transnet.  We could just 
read paragraph 69 of your affidavit.   
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes, so it was – immediately once Mr 
Molefe came through some of the major challenges that 
Eskom was facing as we call [00:00:03] was then a 
precarious financial position and they were actually Eskom 
was working on submitting a request to the Minister of 
Finance and our Minister to – so it will be to the Minister but 
with the concurrence of the Minister of Finance for an Equity 
injection and that requires an appropriation bill.   
10 
So then the Minister – the chairperson indicated that 
having discussed with Mr Molefe Mr Molefe believes that he 
needs somebody with a firm hand on the finances and the 
person that he believes can help him navigate this process 
at Eskom is Mr Singh and that is how Mr Singh then was also 
recommended to come over to us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was Mr Molefe’s motivation for Mr Singh to 
be brought to Eskom in writing? 
MS MOKHOLO:  The – the letter that was from the 
chairperson 
but 
the 
– 
in 
the 
conversation 
with 
the 
20 
chairperson and the Minister it was that Mr Molefe feels that 
having looked at all the financial challenges he feels that the 
[00:01:20] that he has needs to be augmented and Mr Singh 
can do it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So there was a letter from the … 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 112 of 274 
 
MS MOKHOLO:  From the chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Acting chairperson or chairperson on one 
of the Eskom board to the Minister – Minister Lynne Brown. 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Asking that Mr Anoj Singh be seconded to 
Eskom in the position of Financial Director or CFO. But the – 
in some conversation you understood that the actual person 
who put Mr Anoj Singh’s name forward was Mr Molefe? 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes Chairperson because he – he had done 
the scanning of the landscape financially. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOLO:  As the acting CEO now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOLO:  And his reasoning was that he would have 
to be supported as somebody who is stronger financially if 
he is to do this application, the appropriation and all of that 
and work on the Eskom plan. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Chairperson that concludes the 
issues in her affidavit.  I should just point out to the 
20 
Chairperson that there is an issue not contained there which 
Ms Mokholo has agreed to provide us a supplementary 
affidavit on.  It arises from her handover report to the 
Minister and deals with – it alludes to the investigation that 
had taken place at Transnet in regard to what I have 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 113 of 274 
 
considered is of interest to the commission regarding 
irregularities there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Having? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Regarding irregularities in the acquisition 
of certain transactions.  She will – she cannot testify about it 
now but she will do an affidavit and maybe in due course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We could call her to do this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Other than that … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are done. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is the end. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just before we – well I know that you 
wanted to make some – to say something towards the end I 
will give you that chance.  But before that you were acting 
DG from September 2014 up to September 2015. 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right?  But apart from the time that 
you were acting DG you were basically part of the senior 
management of the Department for a number of years. 
20 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At DDG level. 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now did you at any stage prior to 
2015 or during 2015 or even 2016 have occasion to meet 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 114 of 274 
 
with Mr Salim Essa? 
MS MOKHOLO:  No Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Did you hear of him within the 
department at any stage? 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes Chairperson.  As a matter of  - 
Chairperson there is another work stream of the commission 
that have asked that I depose an affidavit that talks to the 
board appointment processes.  So I came across Mr Essa at 
first when he was nominated at first for an Eskom board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS MOKHOLO:  In 2012 and – but subsequently he was not 
appointed but he was appointed into another SOE. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOLO:  To [00:05:04] so that is when I came to 
know of his name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so you say there is an affidavit in which 
you deal with your interactions with him? 
MS MOKHOLO:  Not him interactions with him but… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But his interactions with the department. 
MS MOKHOLO:  With the department and how he was 
20 
appointed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you became aware of. 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes and appointed.  How he was appointed 
into one of the boards. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 115 of 274 
 
MS MOKHOLO:  Of the SOE then. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have not seen that affidavit do you know 
about it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  She has told me about the affidavit Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you do not have it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I do not have it here with me.  I – ja I do 
not have it here with me currently. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja because to the extent that she might 
have knowledge of certain matters relating to Mr Salim Essa 
those may be important.  Do you have a recollection of how 
10 
long that affidavit is? 
MS MOKHOLO:  It is quite long Chairperson I think it is 
about forty pages or so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is quite extensive? 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes it is extensive.  It is not – it is just the 
final stages of being… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh it is still being prepared? 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes to do the other work stream but it is .. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you have not delivered it to the 
commission yet. 
20 
MS MOKHOLO:  Not yet Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Which work stream – is it this 
work stream that is working with you on that or that has 
requested it or is it another work stream of the commission? 
MS MOKHOLO:  It is another work stream of the commission 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 116 of 274 
 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Transnet? 
MS MOKHOLO:  The – it deals with the board appointment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay no, no that is fine.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will you liaise with whoever let us 
establish who in the commission is – has requested it 
because I was going to have some questions for her but if 
she is preparing an affidavit that deals with these matters I 
would rather see the affidavit first so that as soon as it has 
10 
arrived I could have a look.  So probably you would need to 
come back to the commission to deal with those matters. 
MS MOKHOLO:   Yes Chairperson I have been informed so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay no that is fine.  So I am not 
going to ask you any further questions about Mr Salim Essa.  
But I want to give you now the opportunity to say something 
because you wanted to say something.  Because you said 
everybody is asking you about this telephone call that you 
received from Mr Zuma. 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes Chairperson.  It has been almost six 
20 
years now since the events of 2015 when I started acting 
including the matters that relates to the suspension of the 
executives.  And – I – we – you are went as the evidence has 
been led went into a meeting Chairperson of the board to go 
and support the Minister.   
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 117 of 274 
 
Little would I know Chairperson that we will walk out 
of the meeting few minutes time.  People’s lives would have 
been turned and changed massively mine included.  Because 
subsequent to that I had to explain to a lot of people what 
role did I play in having Dan Marokane, Mr Matona, Mr 
Molefe being fired from there and I could not give those 
answers to date Chairperson because I went into literally 
what I believed it was going to be a meeting and it turned 
out that led to other events.   
But I remain grateful to Mr Matona and Mr Marokane 
10 
in particular that even Mr Molefe when I explained to them 
subsequently that you know I had – because the question 
would always be even from my parents that what happened? 
What role did you play in having these people fired?  So they 
understood and they accepted my explanation that I went 
into a meeting that I did not know that we were going to 
discuss that the suspension and all of that.  Understanding 
governance the way I understood I would have advised 
differently in terms of how the matters could have been dealt 
with.   
20 
The same goes with the telephone call Chairperson.  
Most of the DG’s because I was the – the acting DG I was 
the – not only the convenor of the war room but also the – 
the coordinator of the outcome 64 for the economic cluster.  
I was the call chairperson of the cluster so I have [00:10:05] 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 118 of 274 
 
a lot of questions around the role – my role and the 
governance.   
And to the extent that there has been a perception 
that says I am – I am not a diligent public servant I have 
aided capture by working with the Ministers who are seeing 
to have been the architect of capture and it changed my own 
life as well.  I have lost friends along the way.  It has made 
my life very difficult.   
Other people they have been kind enough to explain 
why they had to distance themselves from me because of the 
10 
belief that there was no way I could be so close to the 
[00:10:47] and still remain dry.  So I am hoping with this 
process Chairperson that we – we would be able to get some 
of the answers that even myself I could be able to 
understand what really transpired.  But it is not only those 
executives that are lacking.   
Some of us are also our lives was affected and in a 
way that we are still living with those repercussions today.  
Thanks Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I know that I said I was not going to 
20 
ask you any further questions about Mr Salim Essa because 
your affidavit is coming but I have decided to ask you 
anyway not many but one or two.  Do you know whether 
during 2015 there were any interactions between Minister 
Lynne Brown and Mr Salim Essa? 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 119 of 274 
 
MS MOKHOLO:  Not formally Chairperson, ja not formally. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well when you say not formally it gives the 
impression you say maybe you know informal interactions. 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes I have heard – I know that sometimes in 
the Minister’s office through the PA there was some kind of a 
whether telephone conversations or what there would be – 
there was some kind of maybe let us a relationship but I 
would not know the extent of the relationship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You see when one talks about the 
suspensions of the executives at Eskom on 11 March 2015 
10 
one of the issues that is quite intriguing is the inclusion of 
Ms Tsholofelo Molefe among the executives who were to be 
suspended.   
As you remember she was the Financial Director of 
Eskom at the time.  So the financial portfolio or financial 
department at Eskom was included among the portfolios that 
the Minister said at the board meeting on the 11 March who 
needed to be the subject of an enquiry.  You remember that? 
You see the evidence that I have heard is that on the 
8 March 2015 there was a meeting in Durban at Mr Zuma’s 
20 
official residence and that meeting was attended by Mr 
Tsotsi, Ms Dudu Myeni – there were two meetings actually. 
The first one was attended by Mr Tsotsi, Ms Dudu Myeni and 
Mr Linnell and Mr Jabu Maswanganje and well it has been 
said that Ms Dudu Myeni’s son was also there but she was – 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 120 of 274 
 
he was not participating in the meeting but he was there. 
And at that meeting there was a discussion of the 
suspension of executives at Eskom.  But at that stage it was 
only three portfolios and they did not include Ms Molefe’s 
portfolio the finance.   
Then there was another meeting after that one and in 
the same venue, same day which was attended by Mr Zuma 
with the same people that I have mentioned for the earlier 
meeting 
and 
that 
there 
to 
the 
discussion 
about 
the 
suspension of executives related to three portfolios and 
10 
therefore three executives to be suspended.  And Ms 
Molefe’s portfolio was not included.  That is on the 8t h.   
Then it is the 9t h, then it is the 10t h but on the 11t h it 
would appear the evidence seems to suggest that it was the 
Minister who in talking to the board on the 11t h talked about 
four portfolios instead of three.  And she included Ms 
Molefe’s portfolio and therefore in terms of the principle that 
was followed she would need to be suspended too because 
her portfolio would be the subject of the inquiry.  
 Then there is evidence that on the 10t h March that is 
20 
now the day before the 11t h Mr Koko Mole – Mr Koko – 
Matshela Koko from Eskom called had two meetings at 
Melrose Arch at certain offices.  One involved himself Mr 
Abram Masango who was from Eskom and Mr Salim Essa.  
Another one involved Mr Koko, Mr Salim Essa and Ms 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 121 of 274 
 
Daniels at Melrose Arch on the same day but separately. 
Now if I recall correctly both Ms Daniels and Mr 
Masango say that the discussion which took place or what 
they were told either by Mr Koko and Mr Salim Essa 
separately was that there were four executives to be 
suspended.   
And then on the 11t h the Minister speaks about four 
portfolios.  But one of the two namely either Mr Masango or 
Ms Daniels I think it is Mr Masango if I am not mistaken says 
that Mr Salim Essa either intro – ja introduced himself as… 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is Ms Daniels Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If I am not mistaken. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is to Ms Daniels. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is – is it Ms Daniels? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is Ms Daniels. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh Ms Daniels said Mr Salim Essa 
introduced himself as an advisor to Minister Brown.  Now Ms 
Koko has denied that there was such a – there were such 
two meetings involving him.   
But if it is true that those meetings did take place 
20 
then there is this issue that at the Durban meeting only three 
executives were contemplated as executives who would be 
suspended. 
 
The 
earliest 
we 
hear 
about 
four 
being 
suspended seems to be on the 10t h in these meetings that Mr 
Salim Essa or Mr Koko had with Ms Daniels and with Mr 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 122 of 274 
 
Masango separately.   
And the Minister comes the following day also talks 
about four.  It seems rather strange so that is why I am – I 
was asking whether you were aware of any interactions 
between the Minister – Minister Brown and Mr Salim Essa 
around that time. 
MS MOKHOLO:  No definitely not Chairperson.  What I can 
even confirm is that at least I know having worked in the 
department even before Minister appointed me acting DG 
she had four advisors at any particular point in time others 
10 
leaving.  Mr Essa is – was not one of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was not one of them.  
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you see Ms Molefe there is evidence to 
the effect that prior to this namely March 2015 much earlier 
when the CEO of – or acting CEO of Eskom was Mr or Dr 
Matjila. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Colin Matjila. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Colin Matjila that she had had 
interactions with Mr Salim Essa in meetings where Mr Colin 
20 
Matjila had I think arrange to have meetings with Mr Salim 
Essa or Mr Salim Essa had come to whatever meetings with 
Mr Matjila and Ms Molefe was there.   
And Ms Molefe had resisted the awarding of a certain 
contract to Mr Salim Essa’s company or entity and refused to 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 123 of 274 
 
sign the contract and all of that. So it seems strange if the 
evidence that Mr Salim Essa mentioned or included Ms 
Molefe when she – he was talking about the suspension of 
four executives at Eskom already on the 10t h because Ms 
Molefe had not been included as one of the executives to be 
suspended at the meeting in Durban.   
And then it would be quite interest – quite interesting 
if that is true it would be quite interesting that when the 
Minister came to the meeting with the board she talked about 
four and not three portfolios which would be subjected to the 
10 
inquiry. 
MS MOKHOLO:  No I think… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if Mr Salim Essa also introduced 
himself as an advisor to Minister Brown. 
MS MOKHOLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To Ms Daniels. 
MS MOKHOLO:  No as I said Chairperson I am also would – 
I am very interested in the Minister at some point to explain 
the meeting of the 11t h because the whole issue of the 
suspension how it unfolded.  Me attending the meeting with 
20 
her and us not even having discussed the materiality of that 
issue at least even before the meeting and it is something 
that as I said that it stays with me till today that I have no 
answers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 124 of 274 
 
MS MOKHOLO:  Other than the fact that I attended that 
meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. Ja.  Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there anything arisen? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chairperson? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there anything arising from that? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh yes, yes.  Just to add to your 
collection of information there Chairperson Mr Tsotsi when 
he – when he is doing the composition of the sub-committees 
10 
remember he says he received an email from Mr Salim Essa 
how to compose the sub-committees.   
He says I quietly ignored his submission and he sent 
his to the Minister.  Obviously the Minister denies what I am 
about to say.  He says whereupon the Minister responded 
with the exact submission I had received from Salim Essa.  I 
kept going back and forth with this process of chopping and 
changing the allocation of the Minister until she called me to 
the meet – to a meeting.   
At the meeting was Salim Essa and Tony Gupta.  She 
20 
merely informed me that the board allocations will be the 
way she had sent them to me.  This she did in the presence 
of these two gentlemen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and of course he also said the Minister 
gave him her composition of the committees of the board 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 125 of 274 
 
that was identical to the composition of the board of the 
committees of the board that had been proposed or emailed 
to him by Mr Salim Essa. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this would have been I think either in 
December 2014 or January 2015. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I seem to think it was December. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The exchanges are right at the beginning 
. 
MS MOKHOLO:  It must be January. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is December the 1s t and then it spills 
over to January 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but [00:25:04] before March. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2015 ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Ms Mokholo I thank you very 
20 
much for coming to assists the commission.  You probably 
will come back because there is still some affidavit that you 
are preparing for the commission.  So we should see you in

14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 127 of 274 
 
here last time Chairperson to talk mainly about the fore 
knowledge in regard to the removal of the ministers.  She is 
here now today as a former employee of Regiments, later 
Trillian to talk about the relationship Regiments/McKenzie 
had with Eskom.   
 
How Regiments gained its way into Eskom because they 
were first at Transnet with McKenzie.  Gained its way into 
Eskom.  What the offer was made by McKenzie and Trillian 
and Regiments to Eskom.  Where there was a contract in 
place for the services that were subsequently rendered, if 
10 
they were at all rendered. 
 
What money was paid by Eskom in regard to that at the 
time she remained an employee at Regiments/Trillian.  She 
will also highlight to the Chairperson the officials of Eskom 
who were involved in the discussions and the transactions 
between Eskom and McKenzie, Regiments, Trillian. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is her evidence today Chair.

ADV SELEKA SC:   14(B). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Exhibit U-32.

ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Mothepu, you have ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Are there legal representatives who need 
to be placed on record?  No? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I think...  Yes.  Thank you Chair for 
reminding me.  I think the thing is making noise for me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, the aircon? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think the reverend keeps on pushing it 
down our throats even if there is only one person who wants 
it here.  I think that he is more persuaded by her arguments 
10 
than ours.  [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Ms Mothepu is indeed legally 
represented. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And I will ask Mr Daniel Witz to place 
himself on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  And you may do so from where you 
are but you will have to switch on the mic. 
MR 
WITZ:

of 
Ms Mothepu.

CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Mothepu, your affidavit is in that

zero.  Now you are familiar with the page numbers here? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Are we using the black or the red? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Use the black ones. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Always the black. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Thank you. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You have it? 
MS MOTHEPU:   I have it in front of me.  Thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Ms Mothepu...  Chair, I have 
spoken to Ms Mothepu.  This is their approach.  Ms Mothepu, 
you have heard my summation to the Chairperson of your 
evidence.  How you – the first is.  How you became 
employed by Regiments.  When was this was?  Who 
approaches you for this employment?  And what are you told 
about Regiments?  So let us start here.  And ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just in case she has something else but I 
20 
would imagine they are better today than last time.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs]  
MS MOTHEPU:   Much better.  Thank you.  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  I think that will help her to relax. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 131 of 274 
 
MS MOTHEPU:   [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then you can start. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [Indistinct] Ja.  And always address the 
Chairperson. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thanks.  Ja.  Let us start. 
MS MOTHEPU:   May I start?   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Thank you.  By way of background and 
context Chairperson.  I was employed at Regiments in 2007 
10 
up until 2010.   If you recall my last testimony ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You said 2007? 
MS MOTHEPU:   2007 up until 2010.  If you recall my last 
testimony in December.  And then I left in December 2010 to 
go to Transaction Capital and then eventually KPMG.  So 
sometime in May 2015 while I was an Associated Director at 
KPMG, I was called by Eric Wood who was a Director of 
Regiments Capital and also one of the three shareholders.   
 
He called me, actually, at ...[indistinct] [00:07:10] on the 
same day and he wanted us to meet for coffee.  And we met 
20 
for coffee at Aucklands at a coffee shop called Europa.   
 
And he – essentially, he told me about the goals of 
Regiments Capital.  When I left there were 50 people.  Now 
they had 250 people within their employ, they were working 
with McKenzie.  At that time McKenzie was one of the best 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 132 of 274 
 
reputable consultancy consultancy firms globally.  And also, 
what he expanded on was that they have all the, what I call 
the Blue-Chip Public Sector clients, the Department of Public 
Enterprise, namely, they were working on Denel.   
 
They were working on SAA Express.  They have 
previously worked with McKenzie at SAA.  And they were 
working with McKenzie at Transnet on the 1064 Locomotive 
transaction as financial advisors.   
 
And so he told me that they wanted a senior resource 
which they had identified.  I should be the candidate 
10 
because they – I had worked with them previously and they 
knew what I was capable of.   
 
And Eric, essentially, went on to say that they want to 
duplicate the work that they did at Transnet to Eskom.  So if 
you would recall the contracting of McKenzie and Regiments 
at Transnet.  It was via consignment.  And McKenzie were 
the lead contractors.  And then Regiments was the sub-
contractor, supplied development partners.   
 
So they wanted to duplicate that model from Transnet 
and take it into Eskom.   
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, just before you move on.  Tell the 
Chairperson, how did Mr Eric Wood – or is it Dr Eric Wood – 
know you? 
MS MOTHEPU:   At the time, he was still Mr Erich Wood but 
now he is Dr Eric Wood. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 133 of 274 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  How did he know you in order to 
contact you? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Remember, I have worked there previously 
at Regiments.  And in the three to four years that I was 
there, I worked primarily with him. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes.  So he knew what I was technically 
capable of and my work ethic. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see.  So what?  You have this meeting 
with him, with Mr Tebogo Leballo? 
10 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, it was quite interesting because after 
my coffee with Eric ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   ... Mr Leballo called me.  And I did not even 
greet him.  I asked him:  Did Eric just called you too?  And 
then we laughed.  And then he said:  Yes, he wants me go 
back to Regiments.   
 
Mr Leballo also worked at Regiments during the same 
period that I did.  And Eric also requested him to return.  
Yes. 
20 
 
So I started working on the 15t h of June 2015 and the 
first 
thing 
Eric 
gave 
me. 
 
He 
asked 
Mr 
Mohammed 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Now when you started the 15t h of June.  
This is now working for Trillian? 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 134 of 274 
 
MS MOTHEPU:   Pardon? 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said you started working, I think you 
said on the 15t h of June. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, we started working on the 15t h of June.  
If you recall, I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   2015? 
MS MOTHEPU:   2015.  If you recall, our coffee was in May? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, that was ...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPU:   2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But through Regiments? 
10 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, at Regiments. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, ja, ja. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So I was employed at ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Trillian was to come in 2016? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So I – we spent, I think, a week or two 
going 
through 
the 
– 
my 
remuneration 
and 
the 
final 
20 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But just before you get there.  Let us go 
back to the telephone call.  I know you testified about this 
earlier, but there are lots of evidence that we are hearing. 
MS MOTHEPU:   [laughs]  Yes. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 135 of 274 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] Dr Wood gave you a call and he 
asked that you go and have coffee or he said already in the 
telephone conversation that he wanted you to come back? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, he did indicate that he wants to 
discuss an opportunity at Regiments. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes.  So I went to that coffee, knowing what 
was on the agenda. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the – that call would have been 
roundabout when? 
10 
MS MOTHEPU:   May. 
CHAIRPERSON:   May 2015? 
MS MOTHEPU:   2015.  Correct, Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  And how soon after that call did 
you have the meeting or coffee with him and with Mr 
Leballo? 
MS MOTHEPU:   I think a week or two lapsed and then we 
had the coffee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  And that meeting over coffee, the 
discussion was that he would like both of you to come back 
to Regiments? 
MS MOTHEPU:   We only talked about myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 136 of 274 
 
MS MOTHEPU:   But remember when Eric ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Was it the two of you or Mr Leballo was 
not there? 
MS MOTHEPU:   It was just the two of us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, it was the two of you? 
MS MOTHEPU:   If you go to the main call, he had told me 
that there is an opportunity and then before we had coffee, a 
few weeks after, that – within five minutes of Eric dropping 
the phone, I got a call from Mr Leballo.  And then that is 
when I said:  Did Eric just call you as well?  Yes.  But when 
10 
we had the coffee, we only spoke about myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was just the two of you? 
MS MOTHEPU:   But Eric did indicate that he has also 
reached out to Tebogo Leballo.  Mr Leballo. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:   And he is also trying to negotiate his return 
as well.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Remember, either it was Mr Wood, 
20 
Dr Wood and Mr Leballo. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Pardon? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Remember, it is Mr Wood or Dr Wood and 
Mr Leballo. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Oh, sorry. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 137 of 274 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Thank you for the correction.  [laughs]  I 
think it is a bit confusing because in our office we used to 
call each other on our first names. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you are used to call.  First name, ja. 
MS MOTHEPU:   But I take the correction.  Thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Mothepu, I think you did testify but 
the Chairperson wanted to know, whether at the – when you 
met for coffee, was it the three of you? 
MS MOTHEPU:   No, it was just the two of us.  It was 
10 
Mr Wood and myself. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  So he makes an offer to you. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So he makes an offer and it was very 
generous.  At KPMG, I think I was on 1.3 million.  Then he 
raised it to 1.7 million.  And a R 500 000,00 sign on bonus.  
So he really wanted me to join.  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   He was quite keen.  [laughs] 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes.  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So I started on the Monday.  Okay, no.  The 
20 
15t h.  I think it was a Thursday because the 16t h was a 
Friday, which is June, 16t h.  So the first document that he 
asked, Mr Wood asked Mr Mohammed Bobat to send me, was 
a draft proposal which McKenzie and Regiments had sent to 
Eskom roundabout April/March 2015.   
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 138 of 274 
 
 
And it had McKenzie’s Master Service Agreement Top 
Programme and the Cost Savings Initiative but also, it also 
had Regiments’ financial leg, if I can call it, called Allan 
Sheet Optimisation and Cash Unlocking Initiatives.   
 
So he wanted me to eventually climatise myself with the 
proposal that they had sent but I did not – he did not tell me 
who it was sent to at Eskom.   
 
Yes.  So I spent the first week or so just going through 
the proposal and asking questions with regards to – if I can 
get more information about it.  So at the time ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry.  Sorry, Ms Mothepu.   
MS MOTHEPU:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Regiments, what services or company of 
the sort was Regiments? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Regiments were a – I think I can say was 
because I think they have gone into liquidation. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes? 
MS MOTHEPU:   They were a financial services company but 
they had various divisions.  You had Regiments Properties. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja? 
20 
MS MOTHEPU:   Which dealt with properties.  If you recall, if 
you have been watching the media.  They had bought some 
property about the Gautrain Station to build a mixed(?) use 
development.  I think that is subject to litigation.   
 
They had Regiments Fund Management and they had the 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 139 of 274 
 
Transnet Pension Fund, was one of their clients.  And the 
City of Joburg Sinking Fund was also one of their clients.   
 
They had Regiments Advisory and it was split into two, 
Management Consultant and Financial Advisory.  So I was 
the Principle in the Financial Advisory.   
 
And then it had Regiments Securities, where they traded 
bonds and financial instruments just like derivatives on 
behalf of the Transnet Pension Fund and the City of Joburg 
Sinking Fund. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So you were appointed into the 
10 
position, Principle at the division, Financial Advisory? 
MS MOTHEPU:   That is correct Mr Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  So then, your evidence has to be 
understood in that context.  When you are dealing with the 
proposal that you have been asked to look at which had 
been submitted to Eskom, it will deal with financial matters. 
MS MOTHEPU:   That is correct.  If we go to my paragraph 
16 of my affidavit, I ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   16? 
MS MOTHEPU:   16. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So the – as I said, McKenzie was the main 
contractor 
under 
the 
Master 
Service Agreement 
which 
included cost savings on procurement, generation, primary 
energy 
and 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
Top 
Engineers 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 140 of 274 
 
Programme.   
 
Now it was envisioned that McKenzie would be given 
70% of the fees that would be paid.  And as the supply 
development 
partners, 
Regiments 
would 
get 
30%.  
Ms Coetzee will – this was her area.  She will elaborate once 
– I think she is due to testify after myself.   
 
And then there was Regiments financial work stream, if I 
can 
call 
it 
that. 
 And 
it 
was 
called 
Balance 
Sheet 
Optimisation and Cash Unlocking Activities.  Because they 
were a financial advisory firm, we took the lead.   
10 
 
So that was the leg that I led.  And where we would get 
fifty – I mean, 95% of the fee, McKenzie would get 5% of the 
admin – just administrative fee because it was envisioned 
that Eskom would pay McKenzie and then McKenzie would 
pay Regiments. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So they charged 5% administration fee. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So that proposal you have referred 
to earlier, does it relate to this Balance Optimisation and 
Cash Unlocking Initiatives? 
20 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, that was just to give you a background 
and context where Eskom was at the time so that I can – you 
can see why there was a need of balance sheet optimisation.  
At the time, if you recall Mr Chair, Eskom had liquidity 
concerns.  Its balance sheets were heavily in debt and they 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 141 of 274 
 
were struggling to collect revenue.   
 
On top of that, the Credit Rating Agencies, Fetch 
Ratings Moody’s and Standard and Poor because if you 
recall, after the suspension of the four executives, they were 
downgraded.  And the new built, there was a lot of delays 
and costs overruns.   
 
Eskom, I think, they had a funding deficit of something 
like 50 billion a year.  So what this cash – this Balance 
Sheet Optimisation And Cash Unlocking Initiative essentially 
says, let us look at Eskom’s balance sheet.  How do we know 
10 
use this?  What – where are the low-hanging fruits?  Where 
is the fat in this balance sheet?   
 
So they had identified these initiatives that might 
essentially unlock cash because of their liquidity constraints.  
But also one of the – the requirements of the cash injection 
from the Sovereign which is I think R 400 million, was that 
they had to sell non-coal assets from their balance sheet.   
 
And none of Eskom’s non-coal assets was a company 
called Eskom Finance Corporation, where essentially, it was 
a 
company 
that 
provided 
mortgages 
to 
the 
Eskom 
20 
employees.  Hence, it was not a coal asset.  So they needed 
to sell that.  So I will just go to ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, my question ...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPU:   ...acting.  Yes, h’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   My question was the proposal you 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 142 of 274 
 
referred 
to 
earlier 
related 
to 
that 
Balance 
Sheet 
Optimisation? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, it did. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Unfortunately, it was on the Regiments’ 
server. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  
MS MOTHEPU:   And I only had access to Trillian’s server. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay that is alright.  Regiments at the 
time with McKenzie was rendering services to Transnet. 
10 
MS MOTHEPU:   That is right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So they were discontinuing on the tra-
loan(?) [00:22:13]  So I led the tra-loan.  I will give you more 
information as I close(?).  And then also, they – because of 
the – the forecast were overly optimistic at Transnet.   
 
So they had ordered 1064 Locomotives and the forecast 
was a positive economic trajectory but we know that the 
commodity market will sell.   
 
So as Transnet had all these trains that were ordered, 
20 
they had incurred that but the volume and the customers 
were not going to be there.   
 
So was – it is quite interesting that the same people, the 
same consultant who worked on the forecast of the business 
plan, were the same consultants that were asked to assist us 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 143 of 274 
 
in the same cash optimisation and unlocking, I mean cash 
unlocking opportunities.  So ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   And the same consultants.  That is 
McKenzie and ...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPU:   It was the same consultants.  So they were 
the ones who worked on the business plan and Regiments 
assisted them with the China Development Bank loan and 
the tri-loan/tra-loan(?) [00:23:26].   
 
And now they had to back-track and say we were overly 
ambitious in the forecast.  How do we know find fat in the in 
10 
the balance sheet so that we do not incur further debt and 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see. 
MS MOTHEPU:   ...and to the detriment of the credit rating. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Yes.  Now please tell the 
Chairperson. You have this proposal you have been given 
which is a proposal, you say, was submitted to Eskom.  But 
first listen to my question. 
MS MOTHEPU:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So what – I think you need to tell the 
20 
Chairperson, what develops after that and particularly in 
relation to that proposal to Eskom?  How do you engage 
Eskom going forward and who do you engaged with at 
Eskom?  Tell the Chairperson about that. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Thank you.  So before I go into the 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 144 of 274 
 
transaction.  We and Mr Anoj Singh had been seconded from 
Transnet and he was seconded to Eskom as the Chief 
Financial Officer.  So ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry.  You are in June 2015? 
MS MOTHEPU:   So we are now in June.  And I remember 
the first time I formally met Mr Singh was in Maboneng. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, but in June 2015 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Where was it where you first 
met him? 
MS MOTHEPU:   It was in a conference facility centre at 
10 
Maboneng.  So he had been seconded at Eskom and he was 
working with Regiments and McKenzie on his first hundred 
days  So, essentially, Regiments and McKenzie were 
assisting him with regards to, what does he have to 
accomplish in the first hundred days of his appointment.  And 
we also assisted him with the Funding Plan.   
 
So we met at various venues.  So the first one was at 
Maboneng.  And the other was in the airport.  There is a 
hotel by O.R. Tambo Airport.   
 
So we used those facilities as well.  And then the other 
20 
facility was in a Boutique Hotel on Wonder Boulevard.  Now 
it was quite interesting.  If we go to...  Just give me a minute 
so that I can get the reference. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [No audible reply]  
MS MOTHEPU:   Mister – Advocate, if you can just help to 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 145 of 274 
 
find that paragraph that I had the dates in it and the various 
venues. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, look at paragraph 22, page 574. 
Chairperson.  And you need to clarify to the Chairperson 
whether these meetings were before or after his secondment. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Okay.  So I am not sure when he was 
seconded but when I arrived on the 15t h, he had already 
been seconded but it was before he was officially appointed 
as the Eskom Chief Executive – I mean, Eskom’s Financial 
Officer, 
Chief 
Financial 
Officer. 
 
So 
specifically 
10 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You mean that at that time he may have 
been acting CFO or acting Financial Director as opposed to 
having been permanently employed at Eskom? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes.  If I recall, Minister Lynne Brown made 
an announcement in October 2015 that he was appointed a 
permanent CFO at Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So we met at – if we go to paragraph 22. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
20 
MS MOTHEPU:   We met on the 8t h of July 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   8 t h of July. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So McKenzie used to book the venues and 
we used to work together with McKenzie, which myself, 
Mohammed Bobat and the Advisory Team.  And then we – so 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 146 of 274 
 
one meeting was on the 8 t h of July 2015.  And then the 
meeting was on the 24t h of July 2015.   
 
So these are the only two that I could find on my – in my 
documents but there were many others but I could not find.  
And quite interesting Mr Chairperson is that, it was called 
Project Pandora.  And when the meeting invites were sent 
via email, the CFO was not emailed.  
CHAIRPERSON:   When you say the CFO? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Mr Anoj Singh was not emailed.  He was 
contacted telephonically. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And everybody else was emailed? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:   But I suspect because he was – he did not 
have an Eskom email address.  I am not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
MS MOTHEPU:   But there was quite a secrecy because it 
was called Project Pandora. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Like Pandora’s Box. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who had come up with this name, do you 
know? 
MS MOTHEPU:   No, I think they came up with it before I 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 147 of 274 
 
joined.  It was already there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, it was already known as Project 
Pandora? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So, next time ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And jus basically, that was the project of 
doing what? 
MS MOTHEPU:   That was the – what I have just outlined.  
The Master Service ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can you summarise ...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, the Master Service Agreement, where 
they looked at cost savings initiatives on procurement, on 
generation and establishing the Engineers Top Programme.  
And then on the financial side, the initiatives that would 
optimise the balance sheet and unlock cash. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So, essentially, all of that was Project 
Pandora. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now did you get a sense – did you get 
the sense in mid-June when you started at Regiments that 
this Project Pandora had been around for quite some time 
or did you get the sense it was a new thing? 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 148 of 274 
 
MS MOTHEPU:   I got the sense it had been around for 
quite some time because if you recall my earlier evidence, 
they had already submitted a proposal in April/March 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   And McKinsey and Regiments already 
knew and had information on Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   That is why they were able to assist him 
on what his priorities will be on the first hundred days what 
Eskom’s challenges were.  So I know he would give us 
10 
information like minutes from the finance and investment 
committees, he would give us copies of the credit rating 
reports.  He would give us any information that we could 
assist him with.  So I think I just – I got there in the middle 
of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Just to …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, one second? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It would be important to establish how 
20 
far back this Project Pandora had been initiated in relation 
to June, mid-June when Ms Mothepu started at Regiments.  
The reason why it would be important to establish that is 
that it may well be that it would reflect that it is a plan 
which preceded the suspension of the executives and that 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 149 of 274 
 
it may well be that its execution would require that certain 
key positions at Eskom be occupied by persons that the 
people who were driving Project Pandora knew would play 
along in order to ensure the success of, among other 
things, Project Pandora. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it is important to check that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Mr Chair, from the evidence that I have 
10 
seen previously, I got the sense that Anoj knew that he will 
eventually be appointed permanent …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who is that? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Mr Anoj Singh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MOTHEPU:   The fact that we were planning his first 
hundred days, in his mind and our understanding was that 
he is going to be appointed permanently. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So there was – it was never a sense that I 
20 
am just… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, a temporary. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Temporarily. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   And then I am going back to Transnet. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 150 of 274 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Yes, yes, yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I think that would be consistent with 
logic to anyone who has listened to what I have listened to.  
Yes.  Okay, alright. 
MS MOTHEPU:   I would like to take you to annexure – I 
think it is 14/588.2. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  That is …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, what is the page number? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   At the top of the page. 
10 
MS MOTHEPU:   The black numbers.  It is 14/588.2.  
Correct, Mr Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MS MOTHEPU:   So if you look at the subject, it is: 
“Invitation Project Pandora discussion with CFO, 
July 8, eight o’clock.” 
And they need to be confirmed …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are too fast because you know the 
document. 
20 
MS MOTHEPU:   Apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Invitation at the top. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Project Pandora discuss with CFO, July 
8, eight o’clock in the morning, location venue TBC.  Okay 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 151 of 274 
 
and this is what, start on the 7 August 2015. 
MS MOTHEPU:   I think it is the 7 July 2015.  It was July. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, do you mean 8 July? 
MS MOTHEPU:   July is the 7 t h – ja, sorry, the 8 July, 
correct.  Yes, 8 July. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:   And …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, alright. 
MS MOTHEPU:   And then show time as – so it is 
Wednesday 8 July at one o’clock, so it was scheduled from 
10 
8 a.m. to one o’clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is quite a long time. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes.  So this venue to be confirmed, it 
was either at the Mabuleng Conference Facility of the 
Airport Hotel Conference Facility or the Boutique Hotel in 
Rivonia’s Conference Facility.  I do no remember. 
 
And then if you go the next page …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, before you go to the next page, let 
us finish with it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was sent on the 3 July 2015, is it not? 
MS MOTHEPU:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who was it sent by? 
MS MOTHEPU:   It was sent by McKinsey.  The organiser 
was …[intervenes] 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 152 of 274 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  [indistinct] 06.41. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, he always organised the meetings of 
McKinsey. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Tomori Butsi.(?) 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes and if you see in all the invitations Mr 
Singh is not there but all the subjects you can see it is 
discussion with CFO. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So there was a little bit of …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Some secrecy. 
10 
MS MOTHEPU:   Secrecy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Now that I – in hind - insight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you mean, you did not appreciate it 
then? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, that is correct, Mr Chairperson.  And 
then if you go – are you ready to proceed to the next one? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you can go to the next one. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So it is page 588.3. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
20 
MS MOTHEPU:   So this one is the subject.  Are you there? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, the subject is the same, is it not? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes: 
“Invitation Project Pandora, discussion with CFO” 
This is now the 24 July, one o’clock p.m. venue to – and 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 153 of 274 
 
then it is location, venue to be confirmed.  This time it 
started at 1 p.m. and it ended at 6 p.m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Any significance to the reference to 
short time? 
MS MOTHEPU:   I think – no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MS MOTHEPU:   This is just a printout of my emails, so... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  So was it issued by the same 
person as the previous one? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, he always organised the meetings. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  So this would have been a follow-
up from the previous one. 
MS MOTHEPU:   That is correct, Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did the meeting – see the show time is 
indicated as tentative on both emails.  Did these meetings 
actually take place? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, these meetings did take place. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did take place. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To you know what TDC stands for? 
MS MOTHEPU:   To be confirmed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To be confirmed.  Oh, venue to be 
confirmed? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Correct. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 154 of 274 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, I see. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Remember it was either Mabuleng or the 
Airports Hotel venue or it was Boutique Hotel in Rivonia. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, I see, okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  And when the meetings did 
take place was Mr Anoj Singh present? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, Mr Anoj Singh was present, he was 
the key figure of the meetings, as I said previously.  He 
essentially told us what kept him up at night. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, before you do that, let us separate 
between the two, let us talk about what was discussed at 
the first one and then you can move to the second one. 
MS MOTHEPU:   The first one was …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the one on the 8 July. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, I think it was his first hundred days 
and because I was new, this is just from memory, he was 
not impressed with McKinsey and Regiments, so I think he 
interrupted the presentation I think within ten minutes and 
then he – you asked about his participation.  He took a pen 
20 
and he said no, it is quite obvious that McKinsey and 
Regiments do not understand Eskom.  It is quite obvious 
that they do not understand the key challenges he has to 
face so he essentially on a white board put: 
“These are the things that are keeping me up at 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 155 of 274 
 
night.” 
So I want you to focus on what solutions to these 
problems.” 
So he completely scrapped the presentation.  Ja, it is like 
your primary school teacher saying you can do better, see 
me.   So we took notes and I think he gave us two weeks 
or a month to essentially work on the points that he had 
provided us. 
 
We asked for additional information, hence he gave 
us credit rating reports, he gave us minutes of the finance 
10 
and investment committee meetings and any other relevant 
documentation. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that of Eskom? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Of Eskom, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So at this time he is still at Transnet. 
MS MOTHEPU:   He is still at Transnet, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And he is able to provide you with 
information …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No. 
MS MOTHEPU:   He is seconded at Eskom. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, he could not have been at Transnet. 
MS MOTHEPU:   He is seconded to Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He had been seconded to Eskom. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he probably was acting CFO at that 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 156 of 274 
 
time. 
MS MOTHEPU:   That is correct, Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MOTHEPU:   because at Transnet the acting CFO was 
Mr Gary Peter.  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I thought the secondment was in 
August 2015 but I will check. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you must check but I – my 
impression was that he was brought to Eskom about a 
month or two after Mr Brian Molefe started there but I 
10 
could be wrong. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I will check the dates. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Will check, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  So that he was acting CFO of 
Eskom in June or July, in July 2015. 
MS MOTHEPU:   ’15. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I subject to being checked.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if he was not at Eskom in July when 
20 
he had these two meetings, he was still at Transnet but 
already having these meetings discussing Eskom matters, 
that would be quite interesting. 
MS MOTHEPU:   I think we need to just get an official date 
when he was officially seconded. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 157 of 274 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, somebody should be able to check 
quickly, maybe Mr Seleka’s junior could try and check that.  
We can continue in the meantime. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So and then there was another meeting 
the 24 July.  There we …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So to complete the picture in regard to 
the first meeting… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   …8 July 2015, you are saying that a 
presentation 
had 
been 
prepared 
by 
McKinsey 
and 
10 
Regiments or McKinsey only?   
MS MOTHEPU:   McKinsey and Regiments. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
 
And 
Regiments. 
 
Was 
it 
one 
presentation to be presented by one person or McKinsey 
present their own and Regiments their own? 
MS MOTHEPU:   It would be McKinsey would present their 
part, that portion of the presentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MOTHEPU:   And Regiments would present that 
portion. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   The other portion, okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Remember, that is supply development. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So it would give the subcontractor skills 
also to present in front of the client and to lead some 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 158 of 274 
 
transaction. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
He 
was 
not 
happy 
with 
their 
presentations. 
MS MOTHEPU:   He was not happy at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he basically said let us start afresh. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Stop, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Stop. 
MS MOTHEPU:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   These are the issues that are keeping 
me awake at night.  But if you are saying they were 
10 
keeping him awake that seems to be consistent with him 
being at Eskom. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, he was seconded to Eskom but I am 
not sure if it was official, that is my uncertainty because 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja but you remember that he spoke on 
the basis that at that time these were Eskom issues that 
were keeping him awake at night. 
MS MOTHEPU:   That is correct plus …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is how he spoke. 
20 
MS MOTHEPU:   That is correct, Mr Chairperson.  Plus on 
the other side, I was also involved with Transnet and we 
were meeting Mr Gary Peter as the acting CFO. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 159 of 274 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So if that is factually true then he 
probably was acting CFO at Eskom. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, he was acting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but they will just – somebody will 
double-check. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, then how did that meeting end, 
the first one on the 8 July. 
MS MOTHEPU:   The first meeting, he gave us two weeks 
or a month to …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   To go and do your homework. 
MS MOTHEPU:   To go and do our homework. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   And to come back to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Yes and then there was then the 
next meeting of Project Pandora. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Correct, on the 24 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the 24 July. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I guess this was the occasion when 
20 
then Regiments and McKinsey were given a chance to 
make presentations and show that they understood what 
they were told they should deal with. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes and I remember this meeting was at 
the airport. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 160 of 274 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, it was at the airport. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Now I recall that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, talk about the content of that 
discussion so far as you can remember, obviously only the 
main features. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So the meeting went better than the first 
meeting because we had had time to do our homework and 
he had given us the information, so …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So these students learnt faster. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes.  So we learnt fast and I think we had 
identified some key points that keep him up at night and 
we had prioritised them and one of them was the funding 
plan …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I am going to interrupt you 
just to make sure.  Would it be correct to say the context 
of the discussion at the first meeting of Project Pandora 
was on – was that he was saying to Regiments and 
McKinsey these are the serious challenges that I am faced 
20 
with at Eskom, you people must go away, do your 
homework and come back and tell me how you can help 
solve these problems.  Is that a fair comment? 
MS MOTHEPU:   That is exactly right, Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 161 of 274 
 
MS MOTHEPU:   And he wanted both low hanging fruit so 
that when he is finally appointed… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MOTHEPU:   He is shy within the first hundred days, he 
can say this is what I have accomplished in such a short 
period of time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But are you saying that because he did 
say that himself at the meeting or he …[intervenes] 
10 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He said that at the meeting. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Absolutely, absolutely, he wanted that 
hundred day plan, he wanted to prioritise which key areas 
that he wants to focus on and those low hanging fruit that 
he can eventually implement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So that at least he has a good track 
record in his first hundred days. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright.  Yes, now you are at 
20 
the second meeting then. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
McKinsey 
and 
Regiments 
make 
representations. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, we made …[intervenes] 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 162 of 274 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   The meeting went much better than the 
first one. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, it went much better. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, continue. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, so we took him through the 
presentation and we also took him through the funding 
plan.  Eskom – I think they had a funding deficit of 
between 70 and 80 billion a year so I recall it was Eric 
Wood and Mr Tewodros Gebreselasie and his team which 
had Mzwane and Justin Kubal and they presented the 
10 
funding plan.   
Once again Mr Singh was not happy and he 
interrupted the presentation by Regiments.  At this time I 
was still just an observer and he said we have not shown 
anything new, there is nothing innovative, there is nothing, 
there is no out of the box thinking, his treasury can do it, 
why should he pay us what his treasury can do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I thought he was a soft-spoken man.  
MS MOTHEPU:   Pardon? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I thought he was a soft-spoken man.  
20 
MS MOTHEPU:   Oh no, he is not.  Definitely not.  So he 
interrupted that presentation and once again there were 
certain things – I mean because Eskom essentially is a 
state owned company it can only issue bonds and rands in 
Euros and dollars, it can go the development institutions, it 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 163 of 274 
 
can go to the banks.  So it does not have – it cannot issue 
equity on the stock exchange.  So there is only a few 
instruments that it can use when it raises debts.  So for 
him to say it is not innovative, the PFMA is quite – it 
depicts what you can and cannot do.  So we had to stop. 
 
The next meeting was at Rivonia.  I do not have the 
invitation to that.  So …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you, at the second meeting, did it 
end on the basis that McKinsey and Regiments had not 
impressed him? 
10 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, on the funding plan. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In terms of the final plan. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He did not think that you came up with 
anything that his Treasury department could not come up 
with. 
MS MOTHEPU:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So did it end on the basis that there 
would be another meeting later? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, he – so he also told us what features 
20 
he wanted to see on this funding plan and I think an 
important point was Eskom has a R350 billion government 
guarantee.  So he wanted to find out how much have we 
used in terms of that guarantee and he wanted to see a 
five year profile, which loans are going to be paid off that 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 164 of 274 
 
will make room so that we can raise more debt because I 
think the – I think Eskom had – it was close to – it had 
issued almost R300 billion, so it had something like R60 
billion left of the guarantee.  So he wanted a profile, 
probably five years, ten years, to see which loans will be 
repaid now to have room for the new loans. 
 
We had not put that in our funding plan so we spent 
I think two weeks getting information from Mr Singh and 
there was a subsequent meeting at Rivonia in a Boutique 
Hotel and we presented the amended funding plan and he 
10 
was happy with it.  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Ms Mothepu, there 
seems to have been various plans for him, is the funding 
plan also part of the first hundred days plan at Eskom? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, it was …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Or are there various plans? 
MS MOTHEPU:   It was because Eskom has to submit a 
corporate plan to the shareholder. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   And so it is the corporate plan which is a 
20 
strategic document but, of course, with strategy, how are 
you going to fund it?  So with it there is a funding plan. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that is why I wanted you so that 
you can explain the distinction to the Chairperson.  The 
corporate plan is what Eskom needed to submit, you say to 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 165 of 274 
 
who? 
MS MOTHEPU:   To the shareholder, the Department of 
Public Enterprise and to National Treasury. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, part of the corporate plan is a 
funding plan. 
MS MOTHEPU:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You were tasked to work on the 
funding plan. 
MS MOTHEPU:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which will be part of the corporate 
10 
plan. 
MS MOTHEPU:   That is correct, Mr Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you also have to work on the 
corporate plan? 
MS MOTHEPU:   I only worked on the funding plan, I think 
Ms Goodson will testify if she assisted. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You do not …[intervenes] 
MS MOTHEPU:   No, she would not have because she only 
started in …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In March. 
20 
MS MOTHEPU:   In November 2015.  So I suspect it was 
Mohamed Bobat and Mr John Rossouw. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, so you …[intervenes] 
MS MOTHEPU:   Who were in Regiments Management 
Consulting who maybe would have worked with McKinsey 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 166 of 274 
 
on the corporate plan …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You personally do not know. 
MS MOTHEPU:  I personally do not know. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Chairperson, in regard to the 
date 
of 
the 
secondment 
in 
his 
submission, 
written 
submission to the parliament Portfolio Committee Mr Singh 
writes: 
“I assumed my role as CFO of Eskom on 1 August 
2015 on a secondment from Transnet.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, that is interesting and I guess that 
10 
date has to be correct.  He should know when he started at 
Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It therefore would mean that in July he 
was meeting you on Project Pandora while he was at 
Transnet and not when he was at Eskom. 
MS MOTHEPU:   It appears so, Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So looking at your affidavit we see – 
well, let me build into this.  There is the first meeting, the 
20 
second meeting, the third meeting you are being asked to 
make a proposal, proposal plans to Mr …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Were you able to get an idea at the 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 167 of 274 
 
meeting of the 8 July 2015 of Project Pandora whether Mr 
Singh was attending such a meeting for the first time or did 
you get any impression that this Project Pandora was 
something that the and the others may have been involved 
in for some time? 
MS MOTHEPU:   I got the impression that he had met with 
McKinsey and Regiments previously because, if you recall, 
they presented to him and he was not happy with their 
presentations.  So got the impression that they had met 
previously, they discussed what he wanted to see at that 
10 
meeting before.  So it was not a kick-off meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, where did you get the information 
that he had met with McKinsey prior to the 8 July 2015? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Because in the presentation it was like 
McKinsey already knew Eskom and they had information 
about Eskom and Regiments as well, so it was not a – like 
a kick-off meeting where you say hello, this is Mr Singh 
and I want you guys to assist me with x, y, z.  The fact that 
when I arrived at that meeting McKinsey was already 
presenting to the CFO.  I got the sense that there were 
20 
previous engagements before then. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, at any rate – well, the invitation to 
that meeting was a discussion with the CFO. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
But 
you 
say 
the 
context 
of 
the 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 168 of 274 
 
discussion made you believe that he was not meeting them 
for the first time about this project. 
MS MOTHEPU:   That is correct, Mr Chairperson.  Plus, 
about two days before the actual meetings McKinsey would 
send the slides and then we would also incorporate our 
slides and then – so that they are consolidated and then 
they would print.  So when I read McKinsey’s submission it 
was very, very clear that they had inside information with 
regards to Eskom and it was not just a desktop analysis 
that was very shallow. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Plus they were very familiar with each 
other. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, is that so? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So it was quite evident that they… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   They knew one another. 
MS MOTHEPU:   That is correct, Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   What we have not asked you and it 
might be important to the Chairperson, from Regiments’ 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 169 of 274 
 
side, apart from yourself, who else was there? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Okay, it was Mr Mohamed Bobat before he 
was seconded to National Treasury, it was Mr Tewodros 
Gebreselasie, it was myself, it was Eric Wood, it was an 
analyst called Justin Kubal and transactor called Mzwane 
Mangu.  So that is on paragraph 23. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   From McKinsey Mr Vikas Sagar who was a 
partner, Behrens – that is German surname, which I cannot 
pronounce. 
10 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
I 
think 
it 
is 
fine, 
Regiments 
…[intervenes] 
MS MOTHEPU:   No, this is McKinsey and there was Dr 
Alex Weiss, so they were both Germans and Mr Vikas 
Sagar who was  – so they were both – all three of them 
were partners. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So to be clear from your 
testimony, this meeting is taking place in July, they are not 
taking place at Eskom offices. 
MS MOTHEPU:   No, not at all, they took place in venues 
20 
that I have outlined. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Private venues? 
MS MOTHEPO:   Private venues. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you ever have to meet at Eskom at 
any point with Mr Singh? 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 170 of 274 
 
MS MOTHEPO:   No if I just fast forward my evidence, we 
started meeting at Eskom after October when he was 
officially appointed as the CFO by Minister Lynne Brown, 
that is when we started going to Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so  you – it is again the same, is 
it again the same team, personnel from Regiments? 
MS MOTHEPO:   It is exactly the same team from 
Regiments, and it is exactly the same team from McKinsey. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Meeting with Mr Anoj Singh at Eskom? 
MS MOTHEPO:   Yes, that is correct Mr Chairperson.  
10 
Before we go in there can I take you back to paragraph 18, 
I just want to take the Chair just to outline the initiatives 
that we had proposed but I will go into a little bit more 
detail later on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.    
MS MOTHEPO   So it was ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What page do you want us to go to? 
MS MOTHEPO:   573 paragraph 18. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright. 
MS MOTHEPO   So, if you go to 18.1, so Insurance Trains 
20 
Management the Duvha unit three recovery project, 18.2, 
rebuild Duvha unit three recovery project to recover 600 
megawatt capacity loss, online vending, I think there was 
some 
online 
vending 
evidence 
yesterday. 
 
18.4, 
optimisation of fibre optic cable capacity.  18.5, insurance 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 171 of 274 
 
claim management in relation to the Hitachi settlement 
offer.  18.6, Escap capital structure optimisation.  18.7, 
overall insurance claim management.  18.8, arrangements 
and 
negotiations 
of 
long-term 
facilities. 
 
18.9, 
arrangements and negotiations of working capital facilities.  
18.10, sale of Eskom Finance Company business and 
mortgage book and if you recall, Mr Chairperson,  hybrid’s 
issuance – 18.11 from last year, the hybrid capital 
issuance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
10 
MS MOTHEPO:   Yes, there it is again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I remember that.  Now, were these 
elements of projects Pandora.  
MS MOTHEPO   These were elements of project Pandora 
and I think I made a mistake here because some of these 
initiatives were added later.  So – by Mr Matshela Koko 
and Mr Anoj Singh so you may find that the original 
proposal had fewer initiatives, but I think – I based this on 
what I had and if you recall I don’t have the original 
proposal but my testimony going forward, I’ll let you know 
20 
which ones were added on by Mr Koko and Mr Singh, thank 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, some of these elements or all of 
them were issues that Regiments and McKinsey were 
discussing with Mr Anoj Singh at different stages, including 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 172 of 274 
 
July 2015 and later, maybe even after he had been 
permanently appointed as CFO of Eskom? 
MS MOTHEPO:   That’s correct Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair, Ms Mothepo. 
MS MOTHEPO   Thank you, so, in October the Minister of 
the Public Development – Public Enterprise, Ms Lynne 
Brown formally appointed, I think, on the same day, Mr 
Brian Molefe as the CEO and Mr Anoj Singh as the CFO.  
So, that is when now, we were able to work at Eskom.  He 
10 
introduced us to a colleague of his, Ms Maya Bana, Mr 
Matshela Koko – so I’m on page 575, paragraph 26 under 
heading, work performed by Regiments and TCP at Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, and as you go there Ms Mothepo, 
just clarify to the Chairperson, whether, at this stage – 
because you previously said you are submitting a proposal 
as Regiments Trillion, Regiments and McKinsey, it’s a 
proposal submitted to Eskom, you mentioned the services 
were to be rendered under a master service agreement. 
MS MOTHEPO:   Yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And how the allocation of percentage 
was broken down into 70/30 percent, 70 in favour of 
McKinsey, 30 percent in favour of Regiments.  We need to 
be clarified, whether, when you say you’re starting to work 
at Eskom, was that agreement concluded? 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 173 of 274 
 
MS MOTHEPO   You know, I’ve been a consultant in the 
public 
sector, 
municipalities, 
state 
owned 
companies, 
there’s always a difficulty where the public sector will say, 
we need work urgently, but the procurement is taking long.  
So, as I alluded earlier, they had anticipated a confinement 
and they were supposed to get – McKinsey was supposed 
to get 10% - 10.8% on the saving.  So, for example, if they 
could not have any savings, if their initiatives on, for 
example, procurement or primary energy which is coal and 
fuel – diesel, if, within I would say a year, let’s say Eskom 
10 
spent R5billion and McKinsey’s initiative saved Eskom, 
let’s say now it’s R4billion, so they would get 10% of the 
saving which is R1billion.  So that is why, I think, Mr Anoj 
Singh said, because of your – because of that model it will 
be a confinement and he undertook to get this confinement 
to be approved by the Board and also get National 
Treasury approval, but he wanted us to work concurrently 
while he was getting these approvals.  Yes, so there was 
no contact in place and we worked on risk with the 
anticipation that the Board will approve the master service 
20 
agreement 
and 
National 
Treasury 
will 
approve 
the 
confinement, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, not everybody knows what you 
mean by confinement, so you may want to explain briefly – 
well just one sentence. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 174 of 274 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think the public has heard quite a lot of 
it because there have been a lot of evidence here about 
confinement. 
MS MOTHEPO:   So, if you say you are the sole source of 
that innovative solution but…[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, without following a competitive. 
MS MOTHEPO   Yes you don’t have to – but the 
requirement is that your offering should be innovative, 
nobody else should have it, you should be the sole 
provider, but this was not the case because all the other 
10 
consultants and firms could do exactly the same thing. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, you start working then at Eskom 
once Mr Anoj Singh is appointed permanently but the MSA, 
Master Service Agreement, is still not concluded? 
MS MOTHEPO:   Yes, they were negotiating with Mr Anoj 
Singh, 
so 
Eric 
Wood 
was 
negotiating 
on 
behalf 
of 
Regiments, Mr Vikas Saga was negotiating on behalf of 
McKinsey and Mr Anoj Singh and Mr Matshela Koko were 
negotiating on behalf of Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I wanted to go back to the question 
I had raised with you earlier on about whether you got the 
impression that – at the meeting of the 8 t h of July 2015, 
project Pandora, whether you go the impression that 
McKinsey and Regiments people and Anoj Singh knew one 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 175 of 274 
 
another, like, well but actually it had to be so because he 
was from Transnet, McKinsey and Regiments had been 
involved in Transnet if I recall correctly. 
MS MOTHEPO:   That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And there was evidence of, was its Mr 
Bester? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Henk Bester, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Bester, about a meeting he had with Mr 
Salim Essa and Mr Anoj Singh, during 2014 in regard to 
certain Transnet contracts.  Ja, so I’m sure they knew each 
10 
other quite well. 
MS MOTHEPO:   Yes, you’ve just jogged my memory, Mr 
Chairperson.  When we were having coffee, he had told me 
that they are working…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s Mr Wood? 
MS MOTHEPO:   Mr wood had told me that they are waiting 
– they had submitted a proposal to Eskom, they’re awaiting 
Board approval, but he was 100% certain that the Board 
will approve it, that’s why he gave me that generous 
package because he wanted me to be there to lead that 
20 
team. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that’s quite important, ja, okay, 
alright, continue Mr Seleka. 
MS MOTHEPO:   So, as soon as Mr Anoj Singh was 
appointed, so we started working at Eskom.  We were 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 176 of 274 
 
given consultant access cards, so we were given a form to 
sign and complete and so we were given a consultant 
access cards.  I have a picture of mine, but I don’t 
think…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’ve seen it. 
MS MOTHEPO:   You’ve seen it, so I don’t think it’s that 
material that we have to go there and also Mr Singh gave 
us a designated boardroom for us to work at Eskom.  So, 
we worked together with McKinsey and the Regiments team 
in this boardroom.  Our main contact person was a Ms 
10 
Maya Bana, so she’s the one who organised the boardroom 
and the logistics, the acquisition of the access cards.  So, 
in addition to introducing us to these people, he gave us – 
he also introduced us to Mr Prish Govender who was a 
project Director, Mr Matshela Koko who was Head of 
Generation, Mr Andre Pillay, he was not the Treasurer at 
the time, Ms Caroline Henry was the Treasurer and Mr 
Edwin Mabelane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let’s go back to the time when you 
were given a designated boardroom at Eskom.  Did you 
20 
work from Eskom on a daily basis, why did you have to be 
given a boardroom? 
MS MOTHEPO:   I wasn’t working at Eskom on a daily 
basis, but I was there sometimes.  Myself and my team 
were also working at Transnet on the 1064 Management 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 177 of 274 
 
Consulting area, I also led the R12billion club loan, I was 
also working – my team and I were also working on SA 
Express and we were also working at Denel but McKinsey, I 
think, they were – being a large international organisation, 
I think they had something like – between 10 and 20 
people who were always there.  So, we would come in and 
out depending on what we needed to do but I had spread 
my time and resources on the other clients. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
So, 
a 
particular 
boardroom 
was 
designated as the boardroom that Regiments and McKinsey 
10 
would use? 
MS MOTHEPO:   That’s correct, Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you say, the Regiments team, which 
– of which you were part, wasn’t there on a daily basis, 
wasn’t at Eskom on a daily basis because you had to 
attend to other projects, but you say McKinsey by and 
large were there on a daily basis? 
MS MOTHEPO:   That’s correct, Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, did you ever get an understanding 
why, whether it’s Regiments or McKinsey or both, why they 
20 
needed to be given an Eskom boardroom or use, it seems 
on a long – for a long time? 
MS MOTHEPO:   Anoj would come in and out of the 
boardroom, we would ask him questions…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Singh? 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 178 of 274 
 
MS MOTHEPO:   Sorry, apologies, Mr Anoj Singh would – 
so he wanted close proximity to the team. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MS MOTHEPO:   Yes, so he would give us certain things to 
do, sometimes we’d call him and say, no can we meet – I 
don’t know if it was the same floor as his office or a 
different floor, I think it was – the Executive wing, I think, 
is on the top floor we were in the middle.  So, he would 
just come down and explain, so he wanted the close 
proximity. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, no that’s fine, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  Ms Mothepo – ja 
let’s see here because in your affidavit you were on page 
575, paragraph 26, you’ve mentioned the names of the 
people at Eskom who you interacted with and you say, 
“Each initiative steering team would meet regularly 
and 
with 
designated 
Eskom 
representatives 
at 
Megawatt Park”, 
 
And then you deal with what you say are the 
additional initiatives that were added to the original 
20 
proposal in the next paragraph, if you could just tell the 
Chairperson about that because you were saying you would 
come back to it. 
MS MOTHEPO   Thank you, if we go to page 575, Mr 
Chairperson, paragraph 27, so it was – we had, if you 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 179 of 274 
 
recall, we had the original proposal that was submitted in 
March/April of 2015 and Mr Anoj Singh and Mr Matshela 
Koko had a copy of this proposal and they added three 
more initiatives or I’ll call them initiatives or transactions 
that were not on the original proposal and these were, 
online vending and it was the Duvha Three Insurance claim 
and rebuild and the Hitachi Insurance settlement.  So, 
these were there – I would say Mr Anoj Singh and Mr 
Matshela Koko said, these are the top initiatives that are 
keeping us up at night and we require your assistance with 
10 
them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPO:   And the key figures that we dealt with was 
Mr Singh and Mr Koko.  If we go to my Annexure which is 
MM4 and MM5, let me just give you the page reference, it’s 
page 588.1. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that the black number? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPO:   Are you there okay, so it’s from Mosilo 
Mothepo, sent the 30 t h of November 2015, I’m not sure 
20 
who’s email is that…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...[indistinct] @eskom.co.za? 
MS MOTHEPO:   Yes, and it’s copied, Matshela Koko and 
the 
subject, 
Balance 
Sheet 
Optimisation 
and 
Cash 
Unlocking 
Financial 
initiative 
stream, 
so 
I 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 180 of 274 
 
say…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry, the term, Project Pandora, I 
assume that was just an informal term that was used 
among yourselves? 
MS MOTHEPO:   That’s correct, there was no need for the 
secrecy because now he was now appointed CFO and now, 
we could officially name…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, what was the official name now, was 
it this one here, Balance Sheet Optimisation and Cash 
Unlocking? 
10 
MS MOTHEPO:   That’s correct, Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, but I guess privately you didn’t 
seize to refer to Project Pandora? 
MS MOTHEPO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright yes. 
MS MOTHEPO:   So, this is an email from myself to Mr 
Koko, 
“Good day, Matshela I hope this email finds you 
well.   It was a pleasure meeting you last week.  I 
had a chat with Eric Wood regarding additional 
20 
financial initiatives but needs to be included as part 
of 
our 
balance 
sheet 
optimisation 
and 
cash 
unlocking financial initiative stream, these include 
sale and lease back on the optic fibre network, pre-
paid electricity vending, that’s online vending, EFC 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 181 of 274 
 
disposal, that’s Eskom Finance Company disposal, 
Hitachi claims, replacement of boilers and Duvha 
insurance claim.  We are currently compiling a 
business case for each initiative and require some 
information from you and your team.  I would like to 
set up time, early next week, with yourself and your 
team to source the additional information in order to 
complete the business case by the end of the week.  
Kind Regards, Mosilo Mothepo, Principal”. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now, was …[indistinct]@Eskom.co.za Mr 
10 
Koko’s email address? 
MS MOTHEPO:   I’m not sure who’s email address that 
would be because the fact that I sent it directly to him and 
I copied Mr Matshela, it doesn’t have a name but if I recall, 
I met Mr Koko…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, why would you address the email 
to him when he was not the addressee, but he was simply 
being copied? 
MS MOTHEPO:   I think now my memory is jogged, 
remember I said, it was a pleasure meeting you last week.  
20 
So, he introduced me to this gentleman, I forgot his name 
and I spent about 30 minutes on these proposals.  So, 
what I needed Matshela to be aware of, is, that I have 
spoken to your team, but I need information from you, and 
he was a gentleman from Indian descent, I forgot his name 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 182 of 274 
 
yes, but it was Mr Koko who introduced me to him, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So,  would this email address be that 
gentleman’s address – email address? 
MS MOTHEPO:   That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Ms Mothepo, I see there’s 
another email on page 588.5, of 5 December 2015. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so let – that email was the 13 t h of 
November and then – okay so between that date, indeed 
my team and I were given information, we were introduced 
10 
to some of the Eskom officials and so we were able, now 
to, put weight on the business case because if you recall 
the additional initiative, we were not – we didn’t have 
information on them.  So, we spent that week or two 
interviewing the Eskom officials, getting the information, 
understanding the challenges, proposing some solutions so 
that we can include them in the final proposal and this 
proposal, by the way, had to go to Board for approval.  So, 
if we go to page 588.5, so now it’s from myself, Ms Mosilo 
Mothepo sent the 5 t h of December 2015 at ten past nine, to 
20 
Mr Koko and I copied Eric Wood and the subject, Eskom 
Initiatives and there was the final updated financial 
initiatives, so it reads, 
“Hi Matshela, attached please find the financial 
stream initiatives for your review and comment. I’m 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 183 of 274 
 
available on my mobile phone should you wish to 
contact met and I can come into the office to 
discuss, should you wish.  Kind Regards, Mosilo 
Mothepo”. 
 
And page 588.6 is the attachment, I’ll just, later on 
just give you a brief outline of what each transaction 
entails. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPO:   So, if we go now to…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You don’t want to do that now in terms 
10 
of what the main features of the attachment? 
MS MOTHEPO:   Because where I cover it, I go on a brief 
outline and the people responsible from Eskom and from 
Regiments and McKinsey, so I would prefer to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that’s fine. 
MS MOTHEPO:   Thank you.  So, if we go to page 588.26, 
so the previous communication was the 5 t h of December, 
now it is the 7 t h of December, Mr Koko had – and Mr 
Mabelane had a chance to go through the updated proposal 
and so I was sending it to him.  So, this is – this is sent on 
20 
the 7 t h of December 2015 to Mr Matshela Koko, subject, 
updated proposal, and there’s the attachment, 
“Good Morning Matshela, attached please find the 
updated 
proposal 
for 
your 
consideration, 
kind 
regards, Mosilo Mothepo”. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 184 of 274 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And the attachment is on the next 
page? 
MS MOTHEPO:   Yes, and the attachment on the next 
page. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Titled, balance sheet optimisation and 
cash unlocking initiatives. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The attachment starts at 588.27, up to 
what page, it’s not just a one pager. 
MS MOTHEPO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Up to what page does it go? 
10 
MS MOTHEPO:   Pardon, can you repeat? 
CHAIRPERSON:   The attachment it starts at page 588.27 
up to what page does it go, I take it it’s not a one page? 
MS MOTHEPO:   No, it’s very long. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I just want to know what constitutes 
part of the attachment. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, I think it is 588.49. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay. 
MS MOTHEPO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you. 
20 
DV SELEKA SC:   And on the next page? 
MS MOTHEPO   And then on the next page. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There’s another email. 
MS MOTHEPO:   We were very busy but it’s on the same 
day…[intervenes]. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 185 of 274 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   When  you say on the next page, you 
mean 588.50? 
MS MOTHEPO:   Yes, so the previous email I sent at nine 
minutes past eight, I had time to go to meet with Mr 
Matshela Koko, he had made updates and reviews and so I 
sent him the updated proposal at – the same day, the 7 t h of 
December, this time at 12h33, so it reads, 
“Dear Matshela,  attached please find the updated 
financial proposal document for this afternoon’s 
meeting 
at 
2 
o’clock. 
 
Kind 
Regards 
Mosilo 
10 
Mothepo”. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We don’t see emails from them to you. 
MS MOTHEPO   I’m going to – there’s …[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Replying to your emails for the sake 
of…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, for the sake of completeness, 
mention again up to what page that attachment goes, 
starting at page 588.51n does it go up to 588.209? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think it goes up to 588.74, 
Chairperson. 
20 
MS MOTHEPO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it’s important, because otherwise, 
sometimes it can be difficult to see in the Bundle whether a 
particular document is still part of an attachment or it’s a 
stand-alone document. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 186 of 274 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, it’s from 588.51 to 588.74.  Ms 
Mothepo take us to the next email. 
MS MOTHEPO   So, I’m taking you to the next email, Mr 
Chairperson, 588.75. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you. 
MS MOTHEPO:   If you recall, the previous email I 
mentioned a meeting at 2 o’clock, so that meeting had 
happened.  So I sent an email at the same day now at 21 
past 8 in the evening.  We had met Mr Mabalane and Mr 
Matshela Koko so it is to Mr Mabalane and Matshela Koko 
10 
have copied Mr Eric Wood.  Mr Vikas Sagar, my team was 
Asanda Smith, 
Fahiema Badat, Grant 
Joseph and 
Mr 
Mohammed Bobat and the subject is Eskom Cash Unlocking 
Initiatives. 
 
So it reads: 
“Dear Matshela and Edwin.  Attached please 
find the revised cash unlocking initiatives for 
your review and comments.  As per your 
request we sat with your technical team who 
provided 
us 
guidance 
and 
additional 
20 
information to the document.  We have 
incorporated their inputs and comments to 
the body of the document.  Kind Regards 
Mosilo Mothepu.” 
 
And so that attachment is 55.76 and then goes onto – 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 187 of 274 
 
it ends on  
ADV SELEKA SC:  588.100. 
MS MOTHEPU:  100. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Now the – the email Ms Mothepu on page 
588.50 – 588.50 7 December 2015 at 12:33 to Mr Koko it 
alluded to a meeting in the afternoon at 14H00.  Did that 
meeting take place? 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes that meeting takes place.  If you go to 
page 588.75. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
10 
MS MOTHEPU:  It says remember I said Hi Matshela and 
Edwin as per your request as in. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:  During that meeting at two o’clock we sat 
with your technical team and provided – and they provided 
guidance and information.  If you see that after that two 
o’clock meeting we met with the team hence we worked – we 
worked through the night and up until almost 8:30 in the 
evening to incorporate the … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The proposals. 
20 
MS MOTHEPU:  The proposal. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So this is still at the drafting stage of the 
proposal.  You have not rendered services yet? 
MS MOTHEPU:  Not yet. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you get to render services? 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 188 of 274 
 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You did? 
MS MOTHEPU:  In January 2016 I will get there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  In January 2016. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes.  Plus after this my team started 
working on the online vending and the Duvha 3 and the 
funded plans so I will go into that detail. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:  What is important Mr Chairperson if we go 
to any of the attachments – let us go – I will take you to 
10 
page 588.51.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  This is one of the proposals. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes. So if… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Or a version of it. 
MS MOTHEPU:  If you look at – so our contract was in – it 
was supposed to be on a success base.  So if you go to 
page 588.53 it is the arrangement – okay let me wait for you 
to get there. 
CHAIRPERSON:    I am there. 
MS MOTHEPU:  You are there.  So it is the arrangement of 
20 
long term facilities.  So that is long term loans.  So if we 
could arrange Eskom let us say R2 billion – if you go to the 
next page 1. – so it is page 588.45 1.3 project cost.  So what 
Regiments … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you said 45 you meant 54? 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 189 of 274 
 
MS MOTHEPU:  Sorry 54. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MOTHEPU:  And you go to 1.3 the project cost.  So that 
is how much is it going to cost Eskom.  So let us say we 
arranged R2 billion in long term facilities.  Once Eskom gets 
that money they would have to pay – if you go Eskom will be 
charged a capital raising fee of 1.5% - 105 – 150 basis 
points for the successful origination negotiating and raising 
of funding.  So all of these initiatives were based on risk and 
once they are completed all of them have a different fee. 
10 
 
So if we did not raise – even if you worked there for a 
year and we did not raise a cent you would not be incur – 
Eskom will not pay us.  So that was in all of these initiatives 
I will not take you through each one but that was the promise 
of the contract. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes the intended contract. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes the intended contract. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That never. 
MS MOTHEPU:  That never happened.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But Ms Mothepu I know you are going to 
20 
take the Chairperson through other things there that you feel 
strongly to draw to his attention.  I want us not to lose the 
bigger picture so that when we do that exercise.  So you are 
at the proposal stage.  You say you started rendering the 
services in 2016.  That will be the services contemplated in 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 190 of 274 
 
these proposals. 
MS MOTHEPU:  That is correct and if I correct – if I can 
correct myself. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:  We started rendering services in 2015 
probably November/December. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So that is even prior the finalisation of 
these proposals? 
MS MOTHEPU:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And there is no contract? 
10 
MS MOTHEPU:  There is no contract at the end I say it is 
still being negotiated so there was no contract. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:  :  It was in anticipation of the finalisation of 
the contract and board approval and National Treasury 
approval. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So what services do you start rendering 
as Regiments?  Can you recall? 
MS MOTHEPU:  I can recall it was the online vending and it 
was the Duvha 3 insurance claim.  We went to their insurer 
20 
which was Marsh and we negotiated the – the boiler in I 
think it is in Mpumalanga had exploded and they were 
negotiating an insurance claim with Marsh.  I think they were 
– they were the independent insurance assessors. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So your services were to do what in 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 191 of 274 
 
respect of that? 
MS MOTHEPU:  I have to say something and I – it is in my 
observation which I make at the end but I think it is 
important now.  Now with hindsight.  
 
Eskom was capable of all of these initiatives on their 
own.  The fact that others were added.  So when we started 
working with Eskom’s team the – the officials were the lower 
ranking technocrats who were actually working on these 
transactions already had the capacity, the expertise to do it.   
 
I remember even on the Duvha 3 insurance I know 
10 
nothing about insurance and I told Eric I do not have any 
inkling about a boiler and insurance.  But we were shoved 
down the throats of the Eskom officials and of course with a 
lot of resistance. 
 
So – I mean in my observation I say that a lot of part 
of state capture essentially is just appointing consultants 
unnecessarily and siphoning off very large seeds while the – 
the internal team has the capacity and expertise to perform 
them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja okay. 
20 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Of course that is important. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In that case of course where some 
individuals within an entity give work to outsiders to do for 
the entity that can be done by people employed within the 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 192 of 274 
 
entity. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Hundred percent Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is a case of you just want to give 
those people money. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Precisely.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja because there is no need. 
MS MOTHEPU:  :  There is absolutely no need. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MOTHEPU:  :  Because Eskom had an insurance division 
who it was headed by somebody who is an expert at 
10 
insurance.  We – my team and I knew nothing about 
insurance.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MOTHEPU:  :  The treasury team can negotiate long 
term and short term loan facilities.  They had relationships 
with the banks.  They had relationships with asset and asset 
managers and the pension funds.  All they had to do was if 
they issued bonds is obviously they would have to appoint a 
lead manager on the – which are the local and international 
banks registered in South Africa and they would pay them a 
20 
marginal fee.   
But all of these initiatives Eskom already had teams 
working on them.  We came in as McKinsey, as Regiments 
and eventually Trillian in the middle of the implementation of 
these transactions.   
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 193 of 274 
 
And I mean a total of R1.6 billion was paid which was 
completely unnecessary because Eskom had and still does 
have the capacity to do them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja but that begs the question Ms 
Mothepu.  Did you know these things at the time and what 
was your attitude in regard? 
MS MOTHEPU:  Our attitude was I think I told Eric we do not 
have any expertise in this so I am not comfortable to 
continue.  And also getting a lot… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it – that is [speaking over one another]. 
MS MOTHEPU:  I mean Mr Eric Woods. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In respect of insurance. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes insurance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Only in regard to other things as well. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes. And the insurance and… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja just understand the question.  
Because we want to know – well my question really related 
to everything whether in respect of all these initiatives are 
you saying Eskom had people who were already working on 
20 
them and they could do that or are you confining that 
comment only in respect of the insurance part? 
MS MOTHEPU:  All of them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  All of them yes and that is my question. 
MS MOTHEPU:  All of them. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 194 of 274 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And my question is, if you saying now 
that – well you could observe but Eskom has people they 
were already implementing these things and it parted with 
over R1.6 billion all for nothing my question was but did you 
not – what was your attitude at the time?  Were you not 
aware of these things at the time? 
MS MOTHEPU:  Well my attitude at the time was to 
essentially – my reservation we were not needed and I – we 
do not have the expertise and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well that is the part I was asking. 
10 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You whether … 
MS MOTHEPU:  And then… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on, hang on. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether when you said you did not have – 
your team did not have the expertise you meant in regard to 
insurance that you have talked about or are you talking 
about everything that were asked to do for Eskom? 
MS MOTHEPU:  The only expert. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or some? 
MS MOTHEPU:  Some elements 
CHAIRPERSON:  Elements. 
MS MOTHEPU:  The only expertise we had were two which 
was the negotiation of the short term loan facilities and the 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 195 of 274 
 
negotiation of the long term loan facilities.  We were experts 
at that.   But the insurance cyber optic I do not know.  There 
were the Hitachi settlement.  There was an insurance of 
Duvha 3 and the rebuild as well.   
So we were completely – our heads were under the 
water and I expressed my reservations that is why... 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
To 
whom 
did 
you 
express 
your 
reservations? 
MS MOTHEPU:  To Mr Wood.  That is why Mr Edwin 
Mabalane and Mr Matshela Koko brought in the teams that 
10 
were already working on these transactions.   
So to explain to the consultant this is what we are 
doing and we were asking very elementary questions 
because we were completely clueless about insurance and 
boilers and it was quite embarrassing I have to say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But now it is quite interesting one would 
have thought that if you were supposed to have this 
expertise maybe you were supposed to have better expertise 
than the internal team one would have thought that you 
would secretly go and get experts to tell you exactly what is 
20 
happening where you could ask all the questions and then 
come 
back 
you 
know 
– 
you 
know 
feeling 
more 
knowledgeable. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Empowered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it is interesting that Eskom actually 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 196 of 274 
 
brought its own people to explain to you. 
MS MOTHEPU:  To the consultant who are getting paid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now do you remember the – the people 
that Mr Matshela Koko brought to explain these things to you 
because that is important from Eskom? 
MS MOTHEPU:  If you recall I said it was that – a gentleman 
of Indian descent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MOTHEPU:  So he brought his team but I had forgotten 
his name. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well was it a Mr Govender by any chance? 
MS MOTHEPU:  No it was not Prish – it was not Prish – Mr 
Prish Govender it was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  And who else or you cannot 
remember others? 
MS MOTHEPU:  I do not – I do not recall because he just 
brought his colleagues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So – so they explained these things to 
20 
you. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And were they made to be like your team 
and them to be like one team working together or they were 
brought in to explain whatever needed to be explained and 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 197 of 274 
 
then go back and leave you to continue? 
MS MOTHEPU:  The earlier we were supposed to work 
together with the internal team. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So that you would be seen to have 
done the job but actually they are the ones who would have 
actually either done the job or guided you to do the job. 
MS MOTHEPU:  That is correct Mr Chairperson.  All of these 
initiatives had – had commenced. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Obviously at – they were all at various 
10 
stages of completion.  Some had board approval, others 
were still – had to be submitted to board.  So we just came 
in – in the – somewhere in between. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So now when you – when your team and 
the team that Mr Matshela Koko brought to you to explain 
certain things worked together the products was it then 
presented as your team’s product? 
MS MOTHEPU:  No the product was presented as Eskom’s 
product. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh but now were you not going to charge 
20 
for it? 
MS MOTHEPU:  Remember we would only be – charge 
Eskom upon the successful. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:  So we were not like auditors or lawyers 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 198 of 274 
 
where they – we charge per hour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh but still you were going to charge for a 
product that basically Eskom did for themselves? 
MS MOTHEPU:  That is quite correct.  I mean it is – we can 
even go back to the Transnet China Development Bank loan 
where Regiments was paid R190 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:  R189 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:  And Transnet Treasury had the capacity and 
10 
expertise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:  To negotiate and originate even the former 
Transnet treasurer said it is too expensive we do not agree 
and then Regiments was brought in – she left the former 
treasurer Mr Petro Saboody [?] came and he appointed 
Regiments and the – his team had the capacity to negotiate 
but R190 million went towards the consultants.  So it is – it 
is a cut and paste everywhere. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  But when you – when you realised this 
20 
whole thing you could not feel good about it could you? 
MS MOTHEPU:  At the time I think because I came in in the 
beginning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MOTHEPU:  And when the – in the middle plus I was a 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 199 of 274 
 
principle even in as much as I think my stance takes a 
different view when I am now CEO in March 2016.  So I 
would have a reservation and communicate it to Mr Wood.  
He would say no do not worry about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it would end there. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Just work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So until when did you remain there Ms 
Mothepu? 
MS MOTHEPU:  There is some events at Eskom or at 
10 
Regiments? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No as an employee of Regiments which 
later becomes Trillian.  You see all these things happening; 
these transactions or services rather that are being rendered 
by Regiments/ - well we have not come to Trillian yet that 
could competently be rendered by the onsite employees who 
do not even share in the percentage when you do get the 
money.  So how long did you stay there?  When did you 
leave? 
MS MOTHEPU:  I left in last day at Trillian was the 31 May 
20 
2016.  I had been at the job – as the Trillian CEO for three 
months and I officially resigned 22 June. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja so you are nearly a year with this 
team whether it is under the name of Regiments or under the 
name of Trillian you were there for about a year. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 200 of 274 
 
MS MOTHEPU:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And what made you leave?  We will come 
back to the details of what happens but what made you 
leave? 
MS MOTHEPU:  I think … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Well were you… 
MS MOTHEPU:  First of all I... 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Were you fired? 
MS MOTHEPU:  A lot of – no I was not – I was not fired I 
wrote a letter to Eric sometime in – my lawyer on the 31 May 
10 
essentially saying my – these are my views.  There was a 
unilateral change in my employment and then also I had 
raised flags that – red flags with regards to the fact that we 
were working at Eskom without a contract and the other 
trials – the other state owned companies Regiments was 
supposed to cede those contracts to Trillian and that did not 
happen. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja face the Chairman. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Oh and that did not happen and I was kept 
in the dark.  Mr [00:20:50] told me about it then I realised 
20 
that as a director I was liable.   
So I wrote a letter to – through my lawyers to Eric on 
the 31 May 2016 and then he asked me not to return to the 
office.  And we tried a mediation he refused.  He refuted 
every allegation and he said I am complaining because I am 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 201 of 274 
 
not performing.  I am overwhelmed by the job and I resigned 
and I took him to – Trillian to the CCMA for constructive 
dismissal.   
So I did try and change the way we worked but it – 
my concerns fell on deaf ears up until it was – I needed to 
leave. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I think it is better to go back to the 
story. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I will – yes, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because that is at the tail end. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  No indeed Chair.  I was… 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes you asked. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes I did mention. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I know he asked you but it breaks 
the sequence. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes it does. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The chain. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It breaks the sequence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, no that is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well that is we will reach – we will reach it. 
20 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes we will. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   So this  - these services then were 
being rendered by you – you say from November 2015 
onwards.  You are still drafting the proposal.  The agreement 
has not been signed.  The master service agreement.  We 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 202 of 274 
 
are in 2016 maybe you could take us through 2016 because 
there is an important event in March you need to deal with 
that as well. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Thank you very much. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Which is – sorry together with that is how 
Trillian became Trillian. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Okay 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because we have been referring to 
Regiments all the time. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes I think let me start there. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But remember she did cover that last time 
how Trillian came about. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How she moved from Regiments to Trillian.  
She did cover that. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes but I think there is an important 
development that is specific to Eskom.  So if you recall my 
earlier testimony I said that McKinsey and Regiments were 
supposed to move from Transnet to Eskom via confinement.  
20 
Regiments 
was 
already 
McKinsey 
Supply 
Development 
partner.   
So in December 2015 Eric Wood alongside [00:23:17] 
and Niven Pillay the other shareholders and directors of 
Regiments said we are parting ways.  Eric and his – and a 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 203 of 274 
 
black businessman or BEE partner – he never said Mr Salim 
Essa were – they are going to acquire purchase Regiments 
advisory 
which 
is 
financial 
advisory 
and 
management 
consulting.   
So in December we were already aware that on the 1 
March 2016 there is going to be the split.  Now there is – 
there was a complication.  Eric now told Mr – Mr Eric Wood 
told Mr Anoj Singh that McKinsey has – is replacing 
Regiments with Trillian as the supply development partner.  
So what needed to happen was something McKinsey called a 
10 
credit risk review – a due diligence of the new supply 
development partner.   
So from January 2016 they – McKinsey had a whole 
list of questions about the new supply development partner 
and I will eventually go into the outcome of the credit review 
committee.   
So in 2016 January they – there was a steering 
committee that was established between Eskom executives 
and mainly Mr Singh.   
I am now on page 576 paragraph 29 and I think I 
20 
have mentioned these individuals before and how I was 
introduced to the various – various executives.  I am going 
to… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is it not paragraph 44 you are looking for 
on page 579? 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 204 of 274 
 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes but I think it is a repetition.  Oh so we 
have the first steering committee.  It was chaired by Mr Anoj 
Singh.  It took place – so in this chairing committee we 
would Regiments and McKinsey would essentially flash out 
the initiatives.  And initiative was allocated an official from 
Eskom who would champion it, an official from McKinsey and 
an official from Regiments.   
So what in my employee at Regiments and Trillian 
there was steering committee meetings.  One was on the 9 
February 2016 and the last one was on the 31 March 2016.  
10 
They were always at Megawatt Park.   
 
Okay so I am going to now go through – I am going to 
– I think I will skip paragraphs 31 to 34. I will come to that 
earlier – later on.  But now I would like to focus on the – the 
transactions we worked on.  So this is now page 577 
paragraph 35.  So it is R1.6 billion guarantee in favour of 
Tegeta Exploration and Resources Limited from ABSA bank.  
Now Eric and I used to work very closely together. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on one second.  The Dentons Report 
you skipped because you – it is move convenient to deal with 
20 
it later? 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka is that okay? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is correct – that is fine Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 205 of 274 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes continue. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes.  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you are now talking under the R1.68 
billion guarantee? 
MS MOTHEPU:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:  So Eric and I worked together and I think we 
were working on the trab loan at Transnet.  So the banks 
especially ABSA bank knew that Eric and I worked closely 
10 
together.  
CHAIRPERSON:  It looks like I will never succeed to get you 
to … 
MS MOTHEPU:  Oh my goodness I am so sorry.  Mr Wood. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You refer to them appropriately in a forum 
such as this. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes.  So we had worked together closely on 
the trab loan with ABSA bank.  ABSA bank was one of the 
20 
banks that lent Transnet I think it was R3 billion on the trab 
loan.   
So – and we dealt – we liaised with Ms Thuli Zulu 
who was a transactor in – at ABSA in the corporate banking 
side focussing on state owned companies.   
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 206 of 274 
 
So early December I cannot remember the exact date I got a 
call from Ms Thuli Zulu and she asked – she was very 
confused because she said that Mr Anoj Singh had called her 
to explain the process of securing a guarantee on behalf of 
Tegeta of R1.6 billion.  And because Eric – she thinks that I 
should know what is happening.  I told her no I have 
absolutely no idea what you are talking about because ABSA 
had questions with regards to the latter of the guarantee 
because it is very strange for a state owned company to 
provide to a private company.  So the product specialist were 
10 
very confused.  So I went into Eric’s office and I told – I am 
going into Mr Wood’s office and I relate the conversation I 
had with Ms Thule Zulu.  And he said no, I can sit in on the 
conference call.   
 
So he called Ms Thule Zulu to schedule a conference 
call.  And I think it happened within ten minutes.  So I just 
sat in that conference call.   
 
And so Eric had to essentially unpack the – how this 
guarantee was going to work.  And they wanted us to provide 
that guarantee and it was going to be on three months.   
20 
 
They had various questions, of course, because it is 
very strange, as I have eluded earlier, how does a state-
owned company provide a guarantee to a private company?   
 
Eventually, Eric was able to explain.  And they were 
satisfied with his explanation.   
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 207 of 274 
 
 
Now it is quite interesting.  One of the questions that 
Ms Thule Zulu asked was who were the shareholders of 
Tegeta?  And Eric said no, he will revert back to Ms Zulu.   
 
And so I asked Eric out of curiosity, after the conference 
call:  Who are the shareholders of Tegeta?  And he said no, 
it is Mr Duduzane Zuma.  And he said I should not tell 
Ms Thule Zulu about that development. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So they get or after all the approvals, I 
think the following week, and Mr Anoj Singh and the then 
10 
Treasurer, Ms Caroline Henry, signed the guarantee.  And I 
think it lapsed in April 2016.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Okay.  So as I go to 37.  So we were - in 
January 2016, as – annually, each state-owned company has 
to submit a corporate plan.  And as I have eluded earlier, 
part of the Corporate Plan is the Funding Plan.  This is, 
essentially, something that happens every year.   
 
The 
Treasury 
submits 
this 
Funding 
Plan 
to 
the 
shareholder and to National Treasury.  So we were requested 
20 
by Mr Anoj Singh to assist Mr André Pillay in the Funding 
Plan.   
 
Something very strange happened because I got that 
instruction on Friday, later afternoon.  And Mr Singh wanted 
this Funding Plan by Monday.   
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 208 of 274 
 
 
So it was quite – I did not understand how come I had to 
do a Funding Plan over the weekend.  So I called Mr André 
Pillay and he had no idea about Mr Singh’s instruction for us 
as the consultant to draft this Funding Plan. 
 
Because it is annually, it is performed by Treasury.  So 
he had no idea that ...[indistinct] [00:03:42] had the Funding 
Plan, because I was trying to get an extension.   
 
Eskom has, as I said, they – the finance between 70 and 
80 billion rand per a year.  And a Funding Plan, I think, goes 
up to five years.   
10 
 
So over the weekend, we had to do a plan which was 
completely unreasonable.  And what I later found that 
McKenzie knew all along but they did not tell us.   
 
So when Anoj said:  Guys, remember I am expecting a 
Funding Plan on Monday.  Then Eric frantically called and 
said:  You have to work over the weekend and do this 
Funding Plan.  So my team and I worked over the weekend.   
 
The team from Regiments’ side consisted of Eric Wood, 
Fahima Badat, Stephen ...[indistinct] and Tyrone Vanders 
and Grant Joseph.  Now we gave – we met the deadline.   
20 
 
I tried getting hold of Mr Singh but unfortunately he was 
not picking up.  So, obviously...  If we go to thirty – page 
578.  These were the points that we had to look at.  So it is 
37.1.   
“In 
showing 
that 
there 
would 
sufficient 
cash 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 209 of 274 
 
available to meet all of Eskom’s operational and 
capital requirements, credit rating considerations, 
funding sources, markets, investor appetite and 
concerns and financial risk management.” 
 
So we submitted but obviously the quality of the Funding 
Plan was less to be desirable.  So Anoj is not happy with the 
Funding Plan.  So ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry.  Did, apart from Mr André Pillay 
for even including him, were you assisted by employees 
within Eskom to come up with that draft? 
10 
MS MOTHEPU:   Over the weekend, we worked alone. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   And we submitted without the Treasury’s 
input.  Because if you recall, Mr André Pillay ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   ...had no idea about the instruction to draft 
a Funding Plan by Monday.  But when Mr Singh saw how – it 
was terrible.  It was a terrible job.  So he wrote and Mr André 
Pillay and his team, and we worked with my team and the 
Treasury Team worked together. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, I see. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So eventually have ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Again? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Again. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Again.  [laughs] 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 210 of 274 
 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes.  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see we have done just over two hours. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe we should have a short break. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How long do you think we – you might still 
need with Ms Mothepu before she finishes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, I am capable of shortening 
Ms Mothepu to 30-minutes but I know she wants to tell you 
much more than...  [laughs] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Well, the important thing is that 
we strike an appropriate balance ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...between not spending more time than 
we should ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...on one witness.  But also, ensuring that 
we do justice to the issues. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that is the guiding principle. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us take a short adjournment of ten 
minutes and then we come back. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328

INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  I guess Mr Seleka, you must 
resume your role of leading Ms Mothepu. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs]  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do not allow her to lead herself. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs]  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She has already told me, she wants to 
take one more hour.  [laughs] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She says she wants to take one more 
hour.  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Was that a threat or a promise?  
[laughs] 
MS MOTHEPU:   I have load-shedding at my house.  So I 
can be here all night. [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka, please led then. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let me lead the witness.  And Ms Bianca 
Goodson is already here Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Ja, let us ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let us continue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Without compromising on doing justice to 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 212 of 274 
 
the important issues. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us not spend one more minute that we 
do not need to spend on her evidence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But in the end, we must cover important 
issues. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, earlier Ms Mothepu said, the 
10 
issue of online vending came out yesterday, but that was two 
days ago.  And let me refer the Chairperson to what 
Ms Mothepu is talking about in Eskom Bundle 18(b).  Chair, 
and you have to look at that to – by reference to Bundle 14, 
page 573, which is the affidavit of Ms Mothepu.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay just repeat what you just said 
Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So the bundle now given to the 
Chairperson is 18(b), page ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 1032. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson will see it is an email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To Mr Matjila Koko.

CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is dated Monday, 20 July 2015.  It is 
addressed to info – well, sent to infoportal1@zoho.com 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And the subject is:  Top Engineers.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Top Engineers?  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Top Engineers.  Yes, that is the first. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And the second email is page 1056.  It is 
also from Mr Matjila Koko, Saturday, 8 August 2015, also to 
10 
infoportal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   1056. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   An email from Mr Matjila Koko dated 
8 August 2015 on Saturday and sent to infoportal, subject is:  
Online vending.  And the message says – well, we do not 
know.  There is no dear sir or whoever, the name.  The 
message simple says: 
“We did not finish our discussions about this 
20 
transaction.  This is what is going to the board on 
18 August.” 
 
Now what Ms Mothepu referring to online vending, that 
came up during the testimony she was referring to this 
Chairperson.   
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 214 of 274 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then you go back to the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I guess on Mr Koko’s version of who he 
says he was – he thought he was addressing these emails 
to. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We are supposed to take it that when he 
says this is what is going to the board of 18 August, he was 
telling the chairperson of the board ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...what was coming to the board on the 
18t h of August. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   On the 18t h of August 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Alright.  You were referring me 
somewhere else as well. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, then we go back to Ms Mothepu’s 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 573. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was the point about page 1032?  
20 
That is the email address from Mr Matjila Koko to infoportal 
to Regiments. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Is that, apparent from these emails 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 215 of 274 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There are – there is documents, Top 
Engineers, on the one hand, a pdf document.  And on the 
other, Online Vending document, pdf document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which are exchanged with infoportal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which are the part of the proposals made 
by Regiments which you will see in Mr Mothepu’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I am sorry.  Just repeat that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So the documents exchanged in 
10 
the two emails ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is one at 1032. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the other one is at page – again, what 
page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   1056. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   1056. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The attachments? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The attachments. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   They form part of the proposal that 
Ms Mothepu is being talking about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That Regiments is preparing for Eskom. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 216 of 274 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And so you see that on page 573 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...if we go back to Bundle 14. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  We then – now we go back to her 
10 
affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At what page in her affidavit? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   573. 
CHAIRPERSON:   573? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It starts paragraph 16, one six.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So she says there: 
20 
“McKenzie and Regiments had submitted a joint 
proposal in the first quarter of 2015. 
When McKenzie and Regiments were supposed to 
assist Eskom with Management Consulting Services 
under the Master Service Agreement, which included 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 217 of 274 
 
cost savings on procurement, generation, primary 
energy and the establishment 
of Eskom’s Top 
Engineering Programme.” 
 
So 
the 
top 
engineers 
or 
the 
Top 
Engineering 
Programme is one which you see in the second – in the first 
email, the 10:32 email.   
 
The 
Vending 
Online 
is 
in 
the 
next 
paragraph, 
paragraph 18 Chairperson, at 18.3 in particular which is part 
of the initiatives in regard to the Balance Optimisation and 
Cash Unlocking.   
10 
 
So that Vending – Online Vending is what Ms Mothepu 
on page 575, paragraph 27 says was one of the additional 
transactions or initiatives added to the original proposal.  It 
was added subsequently by Mr Matjila Koko and Mr Anoj 
Singh.  Added initiatives that were originally not in the 
proposal and the first one is that Online Vending.   
 
So the email show that this documents or initiatives in 
regard to some of these documents – or documents in regard 
to some of these initiatives would have been exchanged with 
infoportal.  One in July 2015 and the other one in August 
20 
2015. 
 
So Ms Mothepu, you as Regiments were then also 
asked to do proposals on this very subject matters? 
MS MOTHEPU:   That is correct.  And if you recall my last 
testimony.  I said that Mr Salim Essa and Mr Kuben Moodley 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 218 of 274 
 
were Regiments’ business development partners.  So they 
are the ones who essentially sourced these contracts with – 
from the state-owned companies under the umbrella of the 
Department of Public Enterprise.   
 
And I am sure you have seen testimony that the bulk of 
the fees that Regiments earned from Transnet, from SAA 
Express, from SAA.   
 
Probably, I would say, between 50 and 60% of it was 
paid in commissions to Mr Kuben Moodley and Mr Salim 
Essa.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I wanted to say on a lighter note that 
Ms Mothepu is more reserved after the break than before.  
[laughs]  Maybe it is because I said she was leading herself.  
[laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, continue Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  I had to flex my muscles Chair. 
MS MOTHEPU:   [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Mothepu, you were taking us through 
what you say are the services rendered by Regiments to 
20 
Eskom and the first one was ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Can I ask this question, please?  Please, 
do not forget your question Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can I ask this question because I do not 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 219 of 274 
 
want to forget it?  You interacted with, among other people 
at Eskom, Mr Koko and Mr Anoj Singh in 2015 and 2016.  In 
your interactions with them, are you aware of them using this 
email address infoportal?   
 
And if you are aware, is there anything you can tell me 
which might throw light what their understanding would have 
been as to who they were communicating with? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Unfortunately, Mr Chairperson I cannot 
throw light because the first time I saw this infoportal, you 
know, was at the Commission.  So in my time at Regiments 
10 
and my time at Trillian ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   ...I never used that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS 
MOTHEPU: 
 
 
And 
even 
in 
my 
correspondence 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You never ...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPU:   ...nobody ever copied that email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright.  Continue Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Was Mr Salim Essa 
20 
part of Regiments? 
MS MOTHEPU:   No, he was not part of Regiments.  He was 
the business development partner.  So he was the guy who 
sourced the contract with the state-owned companies and he 
would earn a commission.  So he was not formally part of 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 220 of 274 
 
Regiments, not was Mr Kuben Moodley.  So he did not have 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, so the business developer partner 
sourcing work for Regiments? 
MS MOTHEPU:   That is correct.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   And this work we are now talking about, 
do you know whether or not it would have been sourced by 
him? 
MS MOTHEPU:   I suspect so. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you do not know for sure? 
10 
MS MOTHEPU:   I do not know for sure. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, you got in the middle of it? 
MS MOTHEPU:   That is correct.  But if you look at the 
Transnet model.  I earlier mentioned that Regiments was 
paid R 190 million for negotiating the China Development, 
that 2.5 billion Dollar loan.  About 60% of that money went to 
Mr Essa.   
 
So if you – typically that model, it was going to attract(?) 
now a trillion(?).  He was no longer a supply development 
partner.  He was now a 60% shareholder.   
20 
 
So what – when Trillian was paid those dividends and 
the money were flowed to him as a majority shareholder.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Ms Mothepu, you – in additional to 
the Funding Plan, you have already mentioned, is one of the 
services you rendered, even though you were put under 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 221 of 274 
 
pressure and your draft was trashed.  You mentioned six 
more initiatives that you worked on, on page 578 to 579.   
 
You could in a nutshell just tell the Chairperson what are 
those projects or initiatives, whatever you call them, and 
who at Eskom you worked with, if at all you worked with, in 
terms of giving you instructions and working together in the 
rendition of the services. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Thank you.  Before I proceed.  May I please 
have another bottle of water?  Okay.  Let us go to page 
...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think probably give her two. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, please. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] Because I observe that she drinks 
water quite frequently.  Yes? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, my mouth gets dry when I am nervous.  
[laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] 
MS MOTHEPU:   [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.   
20 
MS MOTHEPU:   Okay so we are on page 578.  We are on 
paragraph 38.  Analyses of China Development Bank, 
500 million Loan Facility.   
 
So Anoj sent us a proposal.  I mean, Mr Singh sent 
Regiments through Erich Wood, Mr Eric Wood a proposal of 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 222 of 274 
 
500 million US Dollars that the China Bank Development had 
made to Eskom. 
 
And obviously, it was – there was an interest rate 
attached to it.  So he asked my team to review if it was 
competitive.  As I said, the Treasury at Eskom could easily 
do this ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I was to ask the question because I 
see at paragraph 38, you say your team assisted Anoj Singh 
and André Pillay.  And I wondered whether they – you 
assisted them or they - Mr André Pillay assisted you.  
10 
[laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] 
MS MOTHEPU:   At least, at this particular point – remember 
I said there were two areas that we were expert at. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So this is funding, but I can say that his 
Treasury Team at Eskom could have easily ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Could have done the job. 
MS MOTHEPU:   ...done the analyses. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MS MOTHEPU:   ...because then you would Eskom’s average 
cost of funding was.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   And then compare it to what the China 
Development Bank had proposed. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 223 of 274 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Ja. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So this was not anything complex or 
difficult. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  And of course, when something like 
this is done, namely, bringing in outside service providers to 
do something that can be done by people who are employed 
full time, who are paid to do that kind of job.   
 
One, is just an unnecessary duplication but actually the 
company, the entity effectively pays for work that pays 
outsiders for work that it has already paid the people who 
10 
are employed on a full time basis to do that job. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Precisely Mr Chairperson.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m.  Yes, continue. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So from ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, there is one observation from 
what she said about business development partner.  That 
infoportal was called Businessman.  So there seems to be 
this – now the connection why Businessman is Businessman.  
Because he was developing business partner. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I...  But is the position not that 
20 
Businessman was the name and infoportal was the email 
address? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That was used by Businessman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct Chair. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 224 of 274 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is just that sometimes there was no – 
there would no reference to Businessman, the emails. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sometimes.  But the email address would 
be there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But Businessman did not use any other 
email address, is that correct? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Not as far as we have ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   As we know so far. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So...  Ja, okay.  Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   So it is not far from him, his designation 
as a business development partner.  And they will explain 
why he is called Businessman.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   In addition, if I can just assist the 
Chairperson?  I was contacted by Fundudzi investigators 
20 
while they were doing their investigation on Eskom and 
Transnet.   
 
And they also asked me this question with regards to, do 
I know who the owner of that account was.  And they showed 
me an email.   
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 225 of 274 
 
 
I think it was from Minister Lynne Brown’s PA and she 
started saying:  Dear Salim.  So I saw that but obviously, I 
gave them the same response that I gave you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   That I never used the email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think we have seen that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We have Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I referred to it, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Well, Chair if I lead the witness 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, please. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you ...[intervenes] ‘ 
CHAIRPERSON:   But let – that email address from Minister 
Brown’s PA address to Salim and using the infoportal email 
address.  Was it not quite recent when there was evidence 
about it here?  Or was I just reading it that email outside of 
the hearing? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  I know we have relied on it insofar 
20 
as it is in the Fundudzi Report.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And it is to that extent that we have put 
that to the witnesses. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 226 of 274 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The email itself Chairperson, I do not 
think it is of – when you say recent Chair, would you have 
2020 in mind? 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Actually, I was – well, it could be 2021 or 
2020, December/November.  But it may be that it is not 
something that came up at the hearing.  Maybe I was – I 
came across it outside of the hearing. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, okay. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Will somebody just try and chase that 
email please, again? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To see where it is.  So, it was against an 
email from Ms Davids who was the Executive PA to Minister 
Brown. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it goes to the infoportal address and 
it says: Dear Salim.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it is fresh in my mind. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  I know that the Fundudzi Report is 
of July 2019. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There are two reports but we will check 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 227 of 274 
 
for Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright.  Yes, continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you for mentioning that you saw 
that as well. 
MS MOTHEPU:   It is a pleasure Mr Chairperson.  So as I 
said, we assisted Mr Anoj Singh with a comparison and we 
gave him advice.  Point(?) 9:  Analyses of Goldman Sachs 30 
billion loan facility.   
10 
 
So Goldman Sachs - I am not sure if Regiments had 
introduced Goldman Sachs to Mr Singh and Eskom or if 
Gorman Sacks had already had a relationship with Eskom 
and Mr Singh.  And Regiments was brought in.  So that I am 
not clear about.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
MS MOTHEPU:   But once Mr Singh was appointed, the CFO, 
we were – we had to work alongside Goldman Sachs.  They 
had 
proposed 
a 
R 30 billion 
loan 
facility. 
 
And 
we, 
essentially, had to analyse the proposal, the quantum, the 
20 
interest rate.  Is it comparable again.  And from Regiments’ 
side it was Mr Eric Wood.  It was Ms Fahima(?) Bedat(?) 
[00:24:05]  And on Eskom’s side, was Mr Singh and Mr André 
Pillay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So who is providing a loan, Gorman 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 228 of 274 
 
Sacks to Eskom? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Pardon? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Who is providing a loan? 
MS MOTHEPU:   It is Goldman Sachs. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To Eskom? 
MS MOTHEPU:   To Eskom.  A R 30 billion loan facility. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And the next is Online Vending. 
MS MOTHEPU:   The next is Online Vending. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And I am going to lead on that which is – 
you say, on the part of Eskom Mr Anoj Singh was there and 
Mr 
Prinesh 
Govender 
and 
Mr 
Eduard 
Mabelane 
and 
Mr Matjila Koko.  Your team assisted Eskom on this Online 
Vending.  What does that entail, Online Vending?  Can you 
recall? 
MS MOTHEPU:   About 20% of Eskom’s capital are on pre-
paid electricity.  So Eskom had a lot of suppliers, like Pick ‘n 
Pay, Shoprite, Checkers and some of the petrol stations.  So 
it had a lot of supply agreements with these vendors.  It 
20 
wanted to reduce the administration of dealing with so many 
vendors and have a master vendor.   
 
And this master vendor would essentially be contracted 
to Eskom.  And then he – this master vendor would now sub-
contract the other vendors.  And this was part of the Cash 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 229 of 274 
 
Unlocking Initiatives because they said that master vendor 
had now the capacity.   
 
I think either via a bank guarantee to buy the entire year 
worth of pre-paid at once.  And then it distributes that to the 
other vendors.  So that is what is what Online Vending was. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you achieve all this?  Did you 
successfully assist Eskom achieve what you were tasked to 
do here? 
MS MOTHEPU:   I think they eventually – I think Blue Label 
was eventually awarded the contract as the master vendor 
10 
but it was, I think, a year or two after I had left Trillian. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, Blue Label.  You would recall that 
name. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the name? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is related to ...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPU:   Mr Mark Pamensky who was a board 
member at Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Pamensky? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Mark Pamensky. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I remember him. 
20 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He was employed at Blue Labels. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He was – he recused himself in board 
meetings 
when 
it 
came 
to 
certain 
matters 
because 
...[intervenes]  
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 230 of 274 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...he had some relationship with either 
Trillian or Regiments or Salim Essa or the Gupta’s. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It was Tegeta by the time the pre-
payments decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Mr Mark Pamensky was supposed to be the 
CEO of Trillian Property.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do not ...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPU:   And he had a ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do not mention ...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPU:   Oh, sorry.  I...  Sorry.  Apologies.  I did not 
mention it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] 
MS MOTHEPU:   Okay sorry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I just wanted to tell the Chairperson how 
Blue Label has been mentioned here. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then you have three more projects 
you worked on.  On page 579, Eskom Finance Company, in 
20 
respect of which you say from Eskom’s side, the team was 
Mr Matjila Koko, Mr Prinesh Govender, Mr Anoj Singh.  You 
rendered services there.  You mentioned also, from your 
side, who was present.    
 
Next paragraph is Duvha Three Power Station Insurance.  
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 231 of 274 
 
Again, from Eskom’s side, Eskom executive – the last 
sentence in that paragraph: 
“Responsible for this transaction, comprised of, 
were Mr Anoj Singh, Jackie Kelani and Mr Matjila 
Koko.” 
 
Is Jackie there, Miss or Mister? 
MS MOTHEPU:   It is Miss and she was Head of Eskom 
Insurance.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Then the last one which is the 
seventh of – in the list, is Insurance Claim Management in 
10 
relation to Hitachi Settlement Offer.  Eric Wood and Faheem 
Badat advised Eskom on the Hitachi Settlement offer.  You 
did not take part in that one?   
MS MOTHEPU:   Not at all, no. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No.  Now some of this – you have not 
located some of these projects and services rendered by 
Regiments in respect of the time or date when they were 
rendered.  Can you indicate to the Chairperson, when does 
this get to be done?  Is it from November, as you said 
...[intervenes]  
20 
MS MOTHEPU:   It ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   2015, to which date? 
MS MOTHEPU:   The majority of them started October – well, 
I say November 2015.  And they continued onto, as 
Regiments.  And then on the 1 s t of March, they continued 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 232 of 274 
 
onto Trillian.  But what was finalised, I think, was the Duvha 
Three Claim.  That did not continue after the 1 s t of March.  
We 
had 
completed 
the 
Goldman 
Sachs 
30 billion 
at 
Regiments, and the 500 million Dollar China Development 
Facility.  The others moved onto Trillian after the 1 March 
2016. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Okay, I understand later in your 
affidavit you deal with the denials by Eskom officials that 
they had – you can tell the Chairperson about those 
denials. 
10 
MS MOTHEPU:   Do you want us to go into detail now or 
later on? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Not into details. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But because we have covered this part 
I think it is rather than just to say to the Chairperson this 
is how Eskom officials and which ones have denied that 
you have rendered services. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Okay.  Mr Chairperson, if you recall my 
testimony last December I said my statement was leaked to 
20 
the Sunday Times and what I told the then Public Protector 
Thuli Madonsela was that Eskom paid Trillian without a 
contract and I listed these transactions that we assisted 
them on.  After that Sunday Times revelation a lot of the 
media started calling Eskom spokesperson asking them to 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 233 of 274 
 
comment on the revelations that I had made.   
 
So the Eskom stance was Eskom did not have a 
contract with Trillian or Regiments and we did not – and 
neither Regiments nor Trillian assisted them on the Duvha 
3 claim, the Hitachi, the China Development Bank loan and 
I think Goldman Sachs.   
So we were denied like I guess Peter denied Jesus 
three times, so we were completely denied, yes.  And what 
subsequently happened was …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did not know what was the explanation 
10 
of why payment had been made? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Unfortunately, when the Sunday Times 
leaked 
my 
story, 
they 
did 
not 
have 
my 
supporting 
documentation to that is why Eskom was able to just do a 
blanket denial.  It was only after Mr Segwale, who was the 
Chairperson of Trillian, appointed senior counsel Geoff 
Budlender that I had sight of these emails and he 
eventually did vindicate my allegations, thank God, that 
there was no truth what Mr Singh had said to his 
spokesperson that indeed there was no contract, which was 
20 
factually 
correct, 
plus 
we 
did 
assist 
them 
in 
those 
transactions and he said they have not paid Trillian a cent.  
Which is true.  They had paid Trillian R595 million and 
which he denied. 
 
What subsequently happened was that a member of 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 234 of 274 
 
the DA, Ms Natasha Mazzone, laid a complaint to the Public 
Protector that Ms Brown had misled parliament because 
after this confusion the DA MP needed clarity because she 
had asked Ms Lynne Brown can you please give us a 
comment or an explanation with regard to the contract 
between Trillian and Eskom and how much money has been 
paid.   
So Ms Brown went to Eskom, obviously Mr Anoj 
Singh, and his response was there was no contract and 
there was no payment.  So eventually the Public Protector 
10 
found that Ms Lynne Brown had inadvertently misled 
parliament. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I recall Mr Anoj Singh being asked 
about that at the parliamentary Portfolio Committee.  So 
those are the – the projects, your rendered services, some 
of them seemed to have been shady services, others you 
think you were experts on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay… 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Payments were – I do not know where 
payments, maybe you could tell the Chairperson because 
what we see from the evidence is that payments, most of 
the payments were made from August 2016.  I know that 
you by that time had left.  You resigned 31 May. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 235 of 274 
 
MS MOTHEPU:   My last day at the office was 31 May but I 
resigned on the 22 June 2016. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   June 2016. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, so still those payments postdate 
you, postdate your resignation. 
MS MOTHEPU:   The only payment that was made was 
R30.6 million payment for the corporate plan, the funding 
plan.  There was a – I think – I am not sure if there was a 
contract but McKinsey was paid 70 million to assist Eskom 
10 
to draft a funding plan and Regiments got 30 million, so 
that is 70/30 split, once again.  Ms Goodson will -, I think 
also I her testimony she will provide the Commission with 
evidence as to if work was indeed done by Trillian on that 
corporate plan or not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Does that relate to the first of the 
seven items you have listed, which is the Eskom plan? 
MS MOTHEPU:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That payment of 30.6 million? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And you had drafted the funding plan 
over the weekend, it was found to be not up to scratch. 
MS MOTHEPU:   One thing… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And you got 30.6 million. 
MS MOTHEPU:   We – yes. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 236 of 274 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, not you personally, I am saying 
Regiments. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Trillian. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, tell the – who got paid, by the 
way? 
MS MOTHEPU:   The work was done at Regiments but 
Trillian got paid, that is why the former partners, Mr Nitha 
Nyhonyha and Mr Niven Pillay sued Mr Eric Wood for 
essentially Regiments did the work and then Trillian got 
paid.  Mr Chairperson, if I can be indulged before I go into 
10 
– can we go back to the section I missed, I think it is quite 
important. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Dentons report? 
MS MOTHEPU:   The Dentons report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So I think from me – so this is page 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that on page – okay? 
MS MOTHEPU:   576. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MS MOTHEPU:   31, Dentons report.  Yes, so in October 
2015 Eric – Mr Woods gave me a call and he wanted me to 
meet Mr Singh at his offices.  He did not tell me what the 
purpose of the meeting was, so we – it was quite late in 
the afternoon.  So we had a meeting with Mr Anoj Singh, 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 237 of 274 
 
Mr Eric Wood and myself and he – Mr Singh gave me a 
copy of the Dentons report and he asked me if I can make 
an executive summary on Dentons’ findings on the Treasury 
department.  Once again I was given 24 hours to do this.  
Yes.  So I went back to my office and I …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, you were asked to do what with 
regards to …[intervenes] 
MS MOTHEPU:   To essentially look at the Dentons report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MS MOTHEPU:   But only focus on his findings in relation 
10 
to the Treasury department because there was a section on 
auditing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MOTHEPU:   There was a section on procurement, 
there was a section on primary energy, new build, so he 
wanted just me to focus on the Treasury area. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  H’m. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So I went home and I read the Dentons 
report and started to make notes.  So if we go to page 
588.180. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat the page? 
MS MOTHEPU:   588.180.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MS MOTHEPU:   So this was my executive summary of the 
events that Denton – so I am assuming that Denton 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 238 of 274 
 
interviewed the Treasury officials so I made an executive 
summary for Mr Singh, as requested and so one of – I will 
just highlighted some of the areas that I looked at, the 
fact that Treasury had alerted I think National Treasury 
that they were going to run out of funds and that did not 
happen so that is why it is called even cry wolf and 
essentially, 
the 
report 
says 
that 
had 
Treasury 
had 
sufficient forecasting capability they should have known 
that because of the delays in Medupi and Kusile, the 
inefficient cash would not come through.  So those were 
10 
one 
of 
the 
factors, 
that 
they 
lacked 
forecasting 
capabilities. 
 
Another one was, after the downgrade, Eskom 
issued a dollar denominated bond and the interest rate 
was very high.  Of course it had to be because it was 
reflective of a downgraded credit rating and there was 
nothing Treasury could have done about it and so I made – 
I think in your own time you can just read the other things 
I have made but what is particularly concerning is that 
after I submitted this – now I am on paragraph 34 on page 
20 
577, that I submitted this report to Mr Singh.  
And then Mr Eric Wood eventually told me that Mr 
Singh wanted to – he used this report, amongst other 
things, to negotiate an exit package for the treasurer, Ms 
Caroline Henry, and her thing was, she did not want to 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 239 of 274 
 
work with Regiments. 
So, as we have seen, that part of state capture is 
essentially 
you 
ask 
an 
official 
with 
integrity 
to 
do 
something that is not within the prescripts or policy and if 
they refuse then you offer them an exit package. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, well sometimes you do not have to 
ask them, let them refuse.  If you know that they are 
people who will not cooperate with your agenda, you try 
and have them pushed out without asking them to do 
anything because you know they will not agree. 
10 
MS MOTHEPU:   That is correct.  So Ms Henry’s sin was 
that she did not want to work with Regiments.  In addition, 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
What 
was 
Ms 
Caroline 
Henry’s 
position? 
MS MOTHEPU:   She was Group Treasurer at Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Group Treasurer would be immediately 
below the CFO? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, she reported directly to the CFO, Mr 
Anoj Singh. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is Anoj Singh.  Oh, okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So in addition to that, Eric also – Mr Wood 
also said Mr Singh is putting undue pressure on Mr Andre 
Pillay so that he will rely on Regiments more and if – so he 
…[intervenes] 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 240 of 274 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I am sorry, Ms Mothepu, 
please do not forget what you wanted to say.  I do not want 
us to leave this without me understanding this correctly.  
Now what you say in paragraph 32 of your affidavit about 
what Mr Wood told you with regard to …[intervenes] 
MS MOTHEPU:   Mr Chairperson, can you please speak into 
the microphone?  So I need to hear. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you cannot hear me. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Usually my voice is very loud and 
10 
quite audible so I am not used to people not hearing my 
voice. 
MS MOTHEPU:   No, I have – I may be young but I think I 
have the hearing of a 65 year old. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Paragraph 32.  You say Mr Wood 
told you that Ms Caroline Henry had resisted working with 
the Regiments OTCP team and the first thing Mr Anoj Singh 
when he was officially appointed at Eskom was to find 
ways to get rid of her.  My question is whether you were 
being told this after the event, in other words after Ms 
20 
Henry had been got rid of or were you being told this 
before the event? 
MS MOTHEPU:   It was after the event. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was after the event. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes so Mr Singh had negotiated an exit 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 241 of 274 
 
package with Ms Henry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   And Mr Singh was now acting Treasurer 
and …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So he was acting Treasurer and CFO at 
the same time. 
MS MOTHEPU:   That is correct, Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And you were saying that Mr Wood 
told you that Mr Singh had used the Dentons – what was 
said in the Dentons report to get rid of Ms Henry. 
10 
MS MOTHEPU:   As ammunition.  I think he had other 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   There may have been other things. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But this was one of them. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, this was one of them, correct, Mr 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, alright, you can continue. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes.  So I was saying that he – Mr Woods 
continued to say the reason why Mr Anoj Singh puts excess 
20 
pressure on Mr Andre Pillay was to ensure that he relies on 
external consultants to assist him.  So he wanted to see how 
Mr Andre Pillay was amicable to work with Regiments, then 
Trillian, and if he passed the test, I remember that, then he 
would be appointed Treasurer.  But this is by no way of 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 242 of 274 
 
implicating Mr Andre Pillay, he was not involved in any of the 
contracting agreements, he was just following his superior’s 
instructions to involve us in the transactions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, Ms Mothepu, the executive 
summary that you have referred the Chairperson to on 
page 588.180, it has some information that seems to have 
a bearing on the suspension of the executives.  I see the 
first reference under March 2015. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Can you please repeat your comment or 
question? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, I would like to explain your 
executive summary insofar as it relates to entries under 
March 2015. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Oh, I see. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Okay, yes.  So March 2015. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Mr Chairman, are you there? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 588 point what? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   180. 
20 
MS MOTHEPU:   180. 
CHAIRPERSON:   180, yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Okay, so March 2015 suspension and 
later the removal of …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me get this right.  Is this executive 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 243 of 274 
 
summary from the Dentons report? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, the ones that I put together.  
Remember there was a Dentons report? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Your executive summary of the relevant 
portion of the Dentons report. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, that related to Treasury. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So in March 2015, suspension and later 
the removal of the CFO – I mean CEO, pardon me, and 
three executive, senior executives.  So if we move to the 
10 
right: 
“Standard and Poor downgraded Eskom’s credit 
rating.  Senior management suspensions.  Eskom 
board’s  decision regarding suspension of the 
company CEO and three senior executives led S & 
P, now that is Standard and Poor, to have less 
confidence in the company’s corporate governance 
arrangements as well as in its standalone credit 
profile.  Subsequently, Eskom’s international rating 
was downgraded to BB+ from BBB-.  The national 
20 
scale 
rating 
ZA/ZA-2 
from 
ZAAA-/ZA-1. 
 
The 
downgrade 
reflected 
reassessment 
of 
Eskom’s 
management and corporate governance to weak 
from fair.” 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see, go to the very last? 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 244 of 274 
 
MS MOTHEPU:   So Liquidity. 
“Standard 
and 
Poor ’s 
less 
than 
adequate 
assessment 
of 
Eskom’s 
liquidity 
reflected 
the 
pressure that Eskom faced at the time, negative 
working 
capital, 
high 
capital 
expenditures 
and 
relatively high dependence on uncommitted sources 
of funding to support its debt maturity profile.” 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So this executive summary is an 
executive summary …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just one second, Mr Seleka? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do not forget your next question. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think we need to talk about what is 
going to happen because you said Ms Goodson is already 
here? 
MS MOTHEPU:   She is, yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And there was to be another witness for 
the evening originally or not? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Not today. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not today? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Not today, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  How long would you expect Ms 
Goodson to be? 
MS MOTHEPU:   She needs about three to four hours, 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 245 of 274 
 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, I am wondering whether we 
should not rearrange if – because I see we are at nearly 
quarter to six now… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   …with Ms Mothepu.  What is your 
estimate of how much time you still need with her? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   With Ms Mothepu? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Mothepu is unpredictable, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is because you are not leading her 
properly.  If you lead her properly she will be controllable.  
So …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We should finish within 30 minutes, 
hey?  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, well I was hoping 15 minutes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But – so it may well be – it seems to me 
that 
maybe 
we 
should 
consider 
making 
fresh 
arrangements with regard to Ms Goodson and if we are 
20 
going to do that, we may as well do that now so that she 
can be excused. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Next week I do not think that there are 
any evening sessions that I have approved and if she 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 246 of 274 
 
would be available we could look at her coming in next 
week, one of the evenings, starting from four o’clock.  Do 
you want to check how she feels about that or is she 
legally represented? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She is represented by the same 
attorney, Mr Daniel Witz. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So fortunately. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What – how does that sound?  Ja, they 
should just sanitise or otherwise – ja.  Ja. 
10 
MR WITZ:   Chair, I confirm that I represent Ms Goodson as 
well.  We are flexible with time and we will fit in with the 
Commission and the Chair’s time next week regarding an 
evening session.  So you let us know when she needs to be 
here and she will be here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, excellent.  No, thank you very much.  
Why do we not try and fix that now?  Let us say we can – 
she can come and give evidence on Tuesday four o’clock if 
that is fine with everybody.  Is that fine?  That is fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   They are nodding, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us say that she will come on 
Tuesday next week four o’clock.  There might be, depending 
on a lot of things, there might – we might end up starting 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 247 of 274 
 
with her at five but at least if she is here at four.  If we are 
able to start at four we can start at four.  So otherwise then 
if she wishes to be excused now, she is excused. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Okay.  Okay, let us 
continue then with Ms Mothepu. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Ms Mothepu …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   This is not a licence that we can take 
more than we should. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Mothepu, you are ready, ja.  I was 
asking you the executive summary which is here contained 
in this document we are looking at.  It is not an executive 
summary you created. 
MS MOTHEPU:   It is the executive summary that I created. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, you created it? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes.  So I got the Dentons report. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   I read through the Treasury area. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   And I put together that executive 
summary. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So my sources of information was the 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 248 of 274 
 
Dentons report. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see. 
MS MOTHEPU:   In addition was the Standard and Poor 
and Moody’s credit rating as well. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So what are you trying to convey with 
the information you are presenting in this executive 
summary?  What are you trying to convey? 
MS MOTHEPU:   I was just asked to do it. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   And essentially he wanted to see what 
were the challenges at Treasury, what findings did Dentons 
find so that he can essentially close any of those gaps and 
challenges. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, for instance, this is my question, 
when 
you 
are 
dealing 
with 
the 
suspension 
of 
the 
executives, later removed three of the senior executives, 
the downgrade of Eskom and I think you repeat again the 
suspension of the three executives.  What is the message 
20 
you are conveying here?  Is this – are you identifying this 
as problem areas in Eskom or just facts that happened 
historically, or what? 
MS MOTHEPU:   It was to provide background and context 
because one of the – I think one of the alarms that 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 249 of 274 
 
Dentons report had said was Eskom’s higher cost of 
funding and, of course, you cannot divorce that from the 
fact that the reason why they raised a bond at higher 
interest rate was because of the credit rating downgrades.  
So I needed to go back why they downgraded, it was 
because of the suspension of the managers. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  If you go to the next page 
please, 588.181.  There are conclusions there and possible 
remedial action.  That is the heading of those entries.  Are 
those your conclusions? 
10 
MS MOTHEPU:   So thank you for saying that.  I gave this 
executive summary to Mr Wood and he is the one who 
drew up the conclusions and possible remedial action.  So 
that is Mr Wood’s – these bullet points are Mr Wood’s 
conclusions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So is the position that your summary, 
executive summary, starts and ends at page 588.180?  
MS MOTHEPU:   That is correct, Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then what appears at page 588.181, 
20 
that  is conclusions and possible remedial action, that was 
what Mr Wood wrote. 
MS MOTHEPU:   That is correct, would like me to…? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, read them. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Read them?  Or will you read them, Mr 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 250 of 274 
 
Evidence Leader. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, read them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, I will read them for her, Chair.  
The first bullet says: 
“The above chain of events…” 
The above chain of events, what does that refer to?  Is that 
the executive summaries? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The facts outline there? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, this chain of events. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That chain of events. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   
“The above chain of events places question marks 
about 
the 
ability 
of 
Eskom’s 
Treasury 
sound 
judgment.” 
So that includes the supplier of the executives because it 
is part of the chain of events, the downgrade as a result. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Not necessarily the… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MS MOTHEPU:   Ja, because Treasury had nothing to do 
with the decision to suspend but they were a recipient of a 
higher cost of funding. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 251 of 274 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then the next bullet point, it says: 
“As a direct consequence of poor judgment of 
Eskom 
Treasurer, 
a 
series 
of 
irreversible 
consequences places Eskom in unattainable position 
going forward.” 
Oh, so I remember your explanation.  So your explanation 
was this document was used in order to get rid of Ms 
Caroline Henry. 
MS MOTHEPU:   That is correct, Mr Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   This unatenable position I guess should 
have been untenable. 
MS MOTHEPO:   It was drafted by Mr ...[indistinct] so okay 
I will ...[indistinct – laughing] on his behalf. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing] it can’t be unatenable. 
MS MOTHEPO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He must have intended, whatever he had 
in mind it should have been untenable, not unatenable.  
Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just before you proceed, just for the 
record is the position that after Mr Wood had written his 
conclusions and possible remedial action he made that part 
of the document that contained your executive summary? 
MS MOTHEPO:   That is correct. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 252 of 274 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it was one document? 
MS MOTHEPO:   It was one document in a Power 
presentation form so this was the last slide. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja, okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson I am not going to read 
further in this document, it ends on page 186, that is 55 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry your voice has gone down? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sorry Chair, I was saying I am not 
going to read an further, the document ends on page 588, 
point 186. 
MS MOTHEPO:    The other ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think you can conclude, you can 
just do those conclusions, and ...[indistinct] is it not – the 
conclusions and possible remedial action do they go 
beyond 588, point 181? 
MS MOTHEPO:   If I can just add clarity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MS MOTHEPO:   This one starts on page 588 point 182, no 
that was a draft, so what we are seeing on page 588 point 
180 to 181 was the final document that Mr Woods sent to  
Mr Woods so the other ones were a draft. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think you have read the first two 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 253 of 274 
 
bullet points Mr Seleka, I think you must read the last 
three, then conclude – that concludes the conclusions and 
remedial section of the – remedial action section of the 
document.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, the third bullet point reads: 
“In 
addition 
consistent 
issues 
are 
raised 
by 
investors, National Treasury Department of Public 
Enterprise regarding a lack of timely information 
and lack of with the required and necessary level of 
depth.” 
10 
Next bullet point ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   One second, “in addition consistent 
issues are raised by investors .... Enterprises regarding a 
lack of timely information and lack of with the required and 
necessary level of ...”, yes do you understand the whole of 
that sentence?  
MS MOTHEPO:   My interpretation is that there is concern 
with regards to the first of all information is not timeously, 
is not timeous from either National Treasury, Investors or 
the Department of Public Enterprise, it lacks the required 
20 
level of depth, so maybe it is not enough, it doesn’t go into 
sufficient 
detail 
to 
satisfy 
the 
investors 
and 
the 
shareholder. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but at least if you are going to 
criticise somebody else get your own act together. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 254 of 274 
 
MS MOTHEPO:   I hope you call Mr Woods. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing] well if he can be found. 
MS MOTHEPO:   I know where he lives. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.   Don’t say then the 
investigators note that, I mean consistent issues I actually 
think he must have meant same or same issues were being 
raised consistently, not consistent issues.    
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, and I think that sentence Chair we 
are grappling with it has these two words “with the” which 
should not maybe be there.   Ability to recover from – ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but if you are going to criticise 
somebody else to say they are not good in their job at 
least what you write should be – should reflect that you are 
better, okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, the next bullet point: 
“This 
is 
critical 
stakeholder 
management 
is 
therefore sadly lacking.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   What does that mean?  This is critical 
stakeholder management is therefore sadly lacking and 
places further strained on Eskom’s ability to recover from 
20 
an extremely position to which it has found itself in.  Ja, 
it’s just if you criticise somebody make sure that you get 
your act together, I mean you write on a proper, your 
criticism. 
MS MOTHEPO:   If I can just assist. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 255 of 274 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPO:  Remember we were given 24 hours so 
Anoj, Mr Singh was in such a hurry to get this so I 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But he was the one ...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPO:   So I suspect that because of that 
pressure ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But he was the one ...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPO:   That is the problem, because of that 
pressure he made several mistakes as we can see. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well we didn’t pick up a number of 
errors on your section, on your executive summary but you 
wrote much more than he wrote. 
MS MOTHEPO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he wrote what – five lines – and ja, 
okay Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The last one Chair; 
“Treasury has made sub-optimal decisions that have 
obviously affected Eskom and further inquiry and 
investigation is required for remedial action.” 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So he doesn’t offer as it says possible 
remedial action, the heading. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Now Ms Mothepo then you 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 256 of 274 
 
were about to take us to – you have been now with 
Regiment, we are in March or is it February/March.  
MS MOTHEPO   It’s the 31 s t of March. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The Chairperson recalled that you 
have already taken us through how Trillian came into 
existence 
and 
I 
think 
you 
did 
say 
who 
were 
the 
shareholders in Trillian so that is Mr Salim Essa and Mr 
Eric Wood. 
MS MOTHEPO:   Yes, ...[indistinct] Trust, the family trust. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And when you say his family trust are 
10 
you referring to Mr Eric Wood or Mr Salim Essa? 
MS MOTHEPO:   Mr Eric Wood. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And the percentage of shareholding 
between the two? 
MS MOTHEPO:   Mr Essa was 60%, if I can – I stand to be 
corrected, I think Mr Wood’s family trust was 30%, it was 
called Zara 1 and Zara 2 Trust and Mr Daniel Roy had a 
smaller percent, I think it was 3% and I am not sure who 
the other, the balance of the shareholders were, it was 
envisaged that it will go to staff. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, so you were then, as you 
explained in your affidavit, were transferred – ja I recall 
now in your first appearance you mentioned how there 
were meetings, Mr Eric Wood told you about a new 
venture, a new company to be formed and you were to be 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 257 of 274 
 
moved from Regiments to that company with Mr Mohamed 
Balbeit. 
MS MOTHEPO:    That’s correct.    
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, although that changed in regard to 
Mohamed ...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPO:   That is correct Mr Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So I am just going through so that we 
sketch the context.  Then you are moved in terms of you 
say the proper section of the Labour Relations Act, you are 
transferred, taken over by Trillian and you were appointed 
10 
– you moved over when? 
MS MOTHEPO:   On the 1 s t of March 2016. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   1 March 2016, so Trillian is formed and 
Trillian now replaces Regiments at Eskom? 
MS MOTHEPO:   Yes that is correct Mr Chairperson.  If I 
can add to that, Mr Wood had kept Mr Anoj Singh abreast 
with the developments with regards to replacing Regiments 
with Trillian. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Now deal with the – that 
replacement 
what 
is 
it, 
a 
replacement 
objective 
of 
20 
Regiments by Trillian, that is as a development partner of 
McKinsey, does it happen or not? 
MS MOTHEPO:   It eventually does not happen, if you 
remember my earlier testimony Trillian had to be subjected 
to 
a 
global 
risk 
review 
which 
Regiments 
had 
been 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 258 of 274 
 
subjected to.  This global risk review ...[indistinct] in the 
US, the United States where McKinsey is headquartered.  
So they had requested us to draw up a company profile and 
our CV and I think sometime in January/February a global 
risk review had some reservations with regards to a lack of 
footprint that Trillian had, even if you did an internet 
search it wasn’t there, and Mr Anoj Singh asked if we could 
be given a little bit more time so that he can quickly put 
together a company profile and I think they had appointed 
a company to have a company website, so it was quite 
10 
interesting how it was Mr Singh who was basically pleading 
on Trillian’s behalf at McKinsey’s just give them a few, give 
them an extension so eventually on the 31 s t of March 2016 
at one of the steering committee’s chaired by Mr Singh, Mr 
Andre Pillay was there, Mr Koko was there, it was official 
that McKinsey indicated to Mr Singh that the credit risk 
review 
had 
declined 
to 
have 
Trillian 
as 
a 
supply 
development partner of McKinsey obviously because of the 
lack of footprint but the red flag was the 60% shareholder, 
Mr Salim Essa, he was labelled a politically exposed 
20 
person and they did not want to take that risk, so the 
formal communication was given to all parties that there 
will be no contractual relationship between McKinsey and 
had envisioned a supply development partner, Trillian. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the officials at Eskom, senior 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 259 of 274 
 
officials, Mr Anoj Singh, Mr Matshela Koko, you mentioned 
Edwin Mabelani, Mr Prish Govender, they all knew that 
McKinsey has declined Trillian to be its supply and 
development partner? 
MS MOTHEPO:   That is correct.  And if I have to go back 
to that day Mr Singh was very unhappy with McKinsey, we 
were even asked to leave the boardroom and have the 
Eskom parties deliberate on what are the next steps, so we 
were in the outside for I think an hour or so and then we 
were called back.  We continued to present and then I went 
10 
back to the office and told Eric that – the revelations, he 
was not at the meeting, and then he told me Mr Singh had 
communicated McKinsey’s decisions the night prior to the 
31 s t so he felt no need to attend this steering committee, 
so I said to Mr Wood it means now we have to stop working 
at Eskom because there is no contract and he had said to 
me no he will speak to Mr Singh to find some other way to 
contract Trillian and they eventually wanted to look at 
another partnership with Oliver Wyman, who is another 
international consultancy firm so from my high insight they 
20 
wanted to  have a reputable international consultancy 
company at the forefront and having a contract with Eskom 
and then there will be sub-contract with Trillian, so it was 
envisioned that if McKinsey does not to partner or they 
declined Trillian then I think other consultancy companies 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 260 of 274 
 
will also they reached out to them but I can only find 
documentation on Oliver Wyman’s meeting, it was Mr Salim 
Essa and Eric, they forwarded us the points that were 
discussed and one of the action points was Mr Wood – Mr 
Singh – no Mr Salim Essa would reach out to Mr Anoj Singh 
on exploring interest on sour gas strategy, I am not sure 
what that was but I think there were negotiations with 
Oliver Wyman and they didn’t – they fell through. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Do you know whether t 
here is – or did you know then ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, before that, I wanted to ask 
her, do we have your statement to the Public Protector? 
MS MOTHEPO:   I sent it to the team. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh then they have it. 
MS MOTHEPO:   I am not sure if it was included. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think it is here Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let’s continue, you can check and then 
let me know if it is in the bundle and whereabout it is, if it 
is not ...[indistinct] to have it included, I would like to have 
a look at it. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MOTHEPO:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So as I understand your evidence is 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 261 of 274 
 
that once McKinsey made the decision that we will not 
accept Trillian as a supply and development partner Eskom 
went out to try to bring a different entity by the name of 
Oliver Wyman ...[intervenes]   
MS MOTHEPO:   Trillian did. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh Trillian itself did? 
MS MOTHEPO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh. 
MS MOTHEPO:   Yes Trillian endeavoured to look for other 
reputable international consultancy firms, yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay and did you know that there is a 
connection at the time did you know that there is a 
connection between Oliver Wyman and Marsh, remember 
you mentioned Marsh as the insurance – what did you say 
they were? 
MS MOTHEPO:   On the ...[indistinct] 3 Marsh was the 
insurer, either the insurer or the insurance advisors I am 
not sure. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Of – to Eskom?  
MS MOTHEPO:  To Eskom, correct. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you know that? 
MS MOTHEPO:   I still don’t know today. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The one is a subsidiary of the other, 
Marsh is the holding company of Oliver Wyman or the other 
way round. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 262 of 274 
 
MS MOTHEPO:   Okay.    
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you know that?  
MS MOTHEPO:   No I am hearing it for the first time today. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh.  So 31 March 2016 you hear the 
news, no partnership between the two, you ultimately 
resign in  June, but from 31 March to the time you resigned 
did Trillian continue to run the services to Eskom? 
MS MOTHEPO:   Yes Trillian continued to run the services 
to Eskom, but upon my resignation no invoice had been 
submitted with the exception of the R13million that was for 
10 
the corporate plan but that was outside the Master Service 
Level agreement. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see. 
MS MOTHEPO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that is the corporate – the funding 
plan.  In respect of the other services that were rendered 
even after this announcement by – I beg your pardon – the 
announcement by McKinsey, or decision by McKinsey 
Trillian did not have an agreement with Eskom to render 
services? 
20 
MS MOTHEPO:   That is correct.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   To the time that you left, resigned from 
Trillian.   Now Ms Mothepo I think that brings me to the end 
of my questions to you, I know that you may have other 
things to say to the Chairperson and I am going to – I am 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 263 of 274 
 
going – oh, sorry Chairperson the Public Protector ’s, or Ms 
Mothepo’s statement to the Public Protector is in Eskom 
bundle 14, the same bundle, Exhibit U32, which one is 32, 
it is on page ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Is 
Ms 
Mothepo’s 
statement 
...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPO:   That’s mine Chairperson ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes in the ...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPO:   But I can forward it to you again.    
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 6. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Ja 
U32 
is 
her 
affidavit 
to 
the 
Commission, not to the Public Protector. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 690, 670 sorry, I am looking at it 
upside down Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 690?  Is that what you are saying? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   670, page 670, six seven zero, up until 
page 679. 
MS MOTHEPO:   Oh yes.    
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that the one Ms Mothepo? 
MS MOTHEPO:   That is the one. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the one that looks like a letter? 
MS MOTHEPO:   No, no, no this is not the right – this is 
not the one.  This one relates to my testimony in 
December. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us continue Mr Seleka, you can do 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 264 of 274 
 
this after, once you are sure. 
MS MOTHEPO:   Ja, no this one is my testimony in 
December, I will forward it to you again and you can add it 
on, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that brought me to the end of my 
questions to you, I know that you had asked to say certain 
things to the Chairperson. 
MS MOTHEPO:   Okay just – I won’t take more than five 
minutes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPO:   So subsequently I left Trillian in June 
2016 and I testified at the Budlender Inquiry, it was the 
first time that I saw that Trillian had paid at the time I think 
it was R266million and after that I was requested by Eskom 
through their legal attorneys, Bowman Gilfillan, to provide 
an affidavit because they wanted to have a civil claim to 
claim back a total of R595million, so I needed to sign a 
confirmatory affidavit of that – Mr Hadebe’s affidavit, 
because he was not there at the time so I had to read his 
20 
affidavit and sign a confirmatory affidavit and then I had to 
submit my own affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Is 
that 
Mr 
Phakamani 
Hadebe 
...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPO:   Yes that is correct. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 265 of 274 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who was CEO of Eskom? 
MS MOTHEPO:   That is correct and he was absent when 
these transactions were happening so it was not hearsay, I 
needed to sign a confirmatory affidavit on his behalf, but I 
think 
what 
is 
most 
disturbing 
Chairperson 
was 
that 
remember I told you that the transactions were on risk and 
Trillian would only get paid upon completion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If the transaction was successful. 
MS MOTHEPO:   Yes and there was cash in Eskom bank 
account, so I received a spreadsheet from Bowmans which 
10 
my team that I had left at Trillian so now they allocated, 
just from ...[indistinct] I think it was sent by Ms Fahima 
Gordat to Mr ...[indistinct] Kuma, so they had allocated 
that I had spent 180 days at Eskom, I was not at Trillian, 
180 days is six months I was at Trillian for three months, 
plus remember we were not, we did not charge Eskom per 
day or per hour. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MS MOTHEPO   So it was completely a misrepresentation, 
it was fabricated, that entire spreadsheet was I think the – 
20 
and they had also inflated the time that my team members 
had spent at Eskom so never did they give me a call and 
asked me to reconcile but even if they had asked me to 
reconcile my time at Eskom the basis, first of all there was 
no contract with Trillian, number two, the premise of that 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 266 of 274 
 
contract was risk, it was not per hour, per day and what is 
interesting is that eventually the high court found that 
there was a corrupt relationship between Eskom executives 
and Trillian and that Eskom executives did everything in 
their power to benefit Trillian at the expense of Eskom, so 
the judgment was, and there is a copy of the judgment in 
my file but because of lack of time I won’t go into it.  So 
Trillian was ordered to pay R595million plus interest from 
the day of payment to the day of judgment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I will allow you to deal with what  you 
10 
consider to be the main issues of the judgment, but 
continue, I just wanted to tell you that I will allow you to do 
that. 
MS MOTHEPO:   Thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The judgment Chair is on page 590, or 
it starts on page 589, that’s the cover page.   
MS MOTHEPO   It is ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Eskom Bundle 14, one four, page 589. 
MS MOTHEPO:   Isn’t it 586, I have 586. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have a judgment at – which starts at 
20 
page 589 in the matter between Eskom Holdings Limited, 
the applicant and McKinsey and Company first respondent 
and ...[indistinct] second respondent and then continues. 
MS MOTHEPO:   Oh, okay, alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It should be the judgment. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 267 of 274 
 
MS MOTHEPO:   Okay I think if we go to my statement 
because I just took the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Can you find it there? 
MS MOTHEPO:   No I can find it, but in my statement I 
copied the important parts of it, for the sake of time, let’s 
go back to 587. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MOTHEPO   Paragraph 99 and if you can indulge me I 
will just read the judgment.  
“The High Court rules that there was no contract so 
10 
there was nothing to say about the contract but the 
payments 
were 
unlawful, 
irregular 
and 
Trillian 
Capital Partners has to pay back to Eskom the 
entire 
R595million 
plus 
interest. 
 
 
In 
this 
...[indistinct] judgment three judges, Firoux, J, 
Babcock, J and Solgar, J wrote that.  The counter of 
corruption can be eradicated and those who benefit 
from ill-getting gains will be deprived of such 
gains.” 
They continued: 
20 
“In the present matter where the probabilities are 
apparent that senior officials of Eskom could leave 
no spoon unturned to the benefit of Trillian Capital 
Partners. 
 
They 
had 
confidential 
information 
belonging to Eskom with leaks to Trillian Capital 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 268 of 274 
 
Partners.  ...[Indistinct] Eskom who were expected 
to display the conduct of the utmost good faith and 
act in the best interests of Eskom where there 
appears to be a corrupt relationship between Eskom 
senior personnel and the directors of Trillian Capital 
Partners.   Justice and equity demands nothing less 
than the monies paid to TCP unjustifiably to be 
returned to Eskom.” 
I think I will end on that note. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I thought you – I interrupted you about 
10 
the judgment while you had something ...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPO:   Yes I am saying that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You prefer then to end on this note? 
MS MOTHEPO   Well plus – no, no I can actually say that I 
was also requested to be Mr Matshela Koko’s first witness 
in his disciplinary.   When he was in Parliament in I think 
2018 he said he played no role in the contracting of 
Trillian, he doesn’t know, but I was contacted once again 
by Bowmans Gilfillan, they had imaged Mr Koko’s email 
and they found our correspondence, which obviously 
20 
contradict his version that he gave in Parliament under 
oath.    
 
So part of his first – one of his charges was that he 
misled Parliament and he said he played no role, but the 
truth was as you have seen from my testimony today him 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 269 of 274 
 
and Mr Singh were central figures in the negotiation of 
McKinsey 
and 
Trillian, 
in 
addition 
they 
added 
more 
initiatives. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Items. 
MS MOTHEPO:   Yes but unfortunately Mr Koko, I 
remember I was having coffee waiting to be called and the 
attorneys called and said at their council chambers that Mr 
Koko had resigned, I think 15 minutes before we were 
supposed to start and it was ...[indistinct] but Eskom 
wanted to continue with their disciplinary so I had to wait 
10 
for an hour but the legal opinion was if it is with immediate 
effect 
that 
employer/employee 
relationship 
no 
longer 
ceases and Eskom doesn’t have a right to discipline him, 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Of course an employer who wants to 
know what happened there is no reason why they cannot 
continue with the inquiry even if it is no longer called a 
disciplinary inquiry and find out from the witnesses what 
had happened so that it knows the truth.   
 
But I see that you do say, you have just repeated 
20 
that, you say in paragraph 90 of your affidavit that you 
were able or able to provide five emails, have you provided 
those emails to the Commission? 
MS MOTHEPO:   Those are the emails that I was reading 
earlier on. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 270 of 274 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh the ones that we went through, 32 
and 10.56, there were two of them. 
MS MOTHEPO:   Yes so if you – the forensic people that 
Bowman 
Gilfillan 
appointed 
they 
mirrored 
Mr 
Koko’s 
emails, so they presented me with those emails, yes so 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MS MOTHEPO:   But the ones that I read were eventually 
what – the five emails that they indicated here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But here you say five, we saw two, were 
10 
there three that we didn’t go to? 
MS MOTHEPO:   No I think in one day I sent three, there 
was the 1 s t of December, the 30 t h of November and then 
there was a 3 r d of December and then there was a 7 t h of 
December. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just want to make sure that if you say 
there are five we do have all five? 
MS MOTHEPO:   I suspect we even have more than five. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chair I will confirm that, there is an 
email on the 30 t h, that’s the first, of November 2015, that’s 
20 
one, I think there are five. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay you can check later on and 
confirm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, I think there are five, there’s then 
other emails, four of them sent on the 7 t h of December. 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 271 of 274 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, alright. 
MS MOTHEPO:   There was another one on the 5 t h of 
December. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The 5 t h. 
MS MOTHEPO:   The 30 t h. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But I will check. 
MS MOTHEPO:   Yes, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I take it that when you are going to 
give evidence in Mr Koko’s disciplinary hearing a statement 
had been taken from you by somebody which was going to 
10 
be used to guide your evidence? 
MS MOTHEPO:   That is correct, I think I may have 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it with the legal team? 
MS MOTHEPO:   I will resend but I sent them the – my 
final statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That was ...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPO:   That was ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   submitted to the disciplinary hearing. 
MS MOTHEPO:   Yes, the senior counsel was Advocate 
20 
Sithemba ...[Indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but have you ...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPO:   I will double-check if I have sent it but I 
still have it with me so I will send the Public Protector ’s 
statement and my statement that I was asked to make 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 272 of 274 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay that is fine, and has – at least 
part of – or the portions Ms Mothepo’s affidavit that relate 
to Mr Koko have they been sent to him by way of 33 
notices? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes they have Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They have. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   They have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright, okay so if and when you get the 
other statements that she was talking about if those have 
not been sent to you they should also be sent insofar as 
10 
they relate to him. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright.  So you said you had 
completed what you wanted to say? 
MS MOTHEPO:   Yes on the Eskom part yes.   I have 
something else on the Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MS MOTHEPO:   I have a file here, in October 2018 I was 
requested by Transnet to assist them with an affidavit on 
the 
...[indistinct] 
and 
I 
saw 
a 
testimony 
from 
Mr 
20 
...[indistinct] 
Sebuthi 
that 
Trillian 
Asset 
Management 
played a role there and they were BEE.  My file is here, my 
version, I will give it to Advocate ...[indistinct] he can give 
it to the evidence leader, Advocate Myburgh, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but you are keeping a copy of your 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 273 of 274 
 
own? 
MS MOTHEPO:   This is my copy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Made sure that a copy is made, you 
retain your originals so that ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   We don’t lose it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...in case something happens to it we 
don’t. 
 
But 
thank 
you 
very 
much 
for 
assisting 
the 
Commission in regard to that as well, that is quite 
important, so you will make arrangements, I just don’t want 
her to lose the original, make arrangements so they can 
10 
make copies and then hand over to Mr Myburgh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Thank you very much. 
MS MOTHEPO:   Thank you Mr Chairperson 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.   Okay we are done? 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
We 
are 
done 
then 
for 
today 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Goodson has been excused until 
Tuesday, tomorrow we have scheduled Mr Brian Molefe as 
20 
well as Ms Rashni Naidoo for an evening session. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, for the evening session.   I think we 
must try and move Ms Naidoo to next week if that is 
possible as well, explore that and see – for example we 
could look at Wednesday but there is flexibility, evening 
14 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 328 
 
Page 274 of 274 
 
session, 
explore 
that, 
only 
if 
maybe 
there 
will 
be 
challenges to having her testify next week then we can see 
whether tomorrow evening we can do it.    
 
My inclination is that we might take quite long with 
Mr Brian Molefe but so explore whether she would, Ms 
Naidoo would be available on one of the evenings next 
week. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And if she will be available Wednesday 
or Thursday let us explore that. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I will do so with their legal team. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright, thank you very much Ms 
Mothepo and you are now excused, thank you once again 
for coming to assist the Commission.  We are now going to 
adjourn for the day and tomorrow we will continue at ten 
o’clock. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise.
