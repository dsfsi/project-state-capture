PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 22 JANUARY 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Wentzel, good morning everybody. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes I am ready Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us start. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  Chair at the conclusion of the 
evidence yesterday we had dealt with the diagram TSW19 on page 1958 
and the contracts between Intaka and the Department of Traditional 
Affairs and Local Government.  We are now going to turn to deal with 
10 
the contracts between Intaka and the Department of Health.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And that starts from what page in the affidavit? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair it starts from page 42 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  But for now I am going to not follow the 
affidavit exactly and show you some documents that are in the bundles. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Which Exhibit must I look at? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Exhibit… 
CHAIRPERSON:  A or RR4a? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  RR4b. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And in particular Annexure TSW8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what page is it on? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  678. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 3 of 212 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And then Chair this story starts… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Am I the only one feeling hot? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I – I am also feeling hot. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  If the – somebody could put on the air 
conditioner but not too much.  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair the story will start as you will see by 
reference by Mr White at page 707. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you – do you want me to go to 707? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes please Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now Mr White the document I have referred 
the Chair to Annexure TSW8 what is that document? 
MR WHITE:  Chair that was the report that I prepared that summarised 
the investigation and the evidence available relating to the procurement 
of two Water Purification Plants by the Department of Health in 
KwaZulu Natal for the Appelsbosch and Rietvlei Hospitals.  So Chair 
this report summarises the justification that the Department came up 
with internally to make the procurement.  The justification for not 
following a normal tender procedure and then how there was cover 
quotes from Intaka and two entities related to them and that the 
20 
Department ultimately purchased the goods at a significantly inflated 
price. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to make sure that on the record it is clear.  The 
report you are talking about is the one marked TSW8 and starts at page 
678, is that right? 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 4 of 212 
 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But we are now at 707? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And… 
MR WHITE:  Chair I also confirm I am the author of that report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are the author of that report yes.  And you stand 
by its contents? 
MR WHITE:  I do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And Mr White again are the references in the 
right hand column the references to the hard copies of the actual 
documents that you are referring to in your report? 
MR WHITE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And you say that there were two items that 
were purchased by the KwaZulu Natal of Health.  The one was a Water 
Purification Plant and how many of those were purchased? 
MR WHITE:  There were two Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what was the value of that contract? 
MR WHITE:  Chair it was R9.9 million Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were they under the one and the same contract? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair it was one procurement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One procurement process okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what was the colloquial name used to 
refer to those plants by Intaka? 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 5 of 212 
 
MR WHITE:  Chair Intaka calls them a Wataka.  So effectively it is a 
combination of the word water and Intaka. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And then what was the other item that was 
purchased? 
MR WHITE:  Chair that was the Oxygen Purification Plants which was 
part of a separate process where Intaka provided plants that would 
generate oxygen on site at hospitals or clinics so there would be no 
need for it to be bought in cylinders. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And how many of those plants were 
purchased? 
10 
MR WHITE:  Chair they were installed at a number of hospitals on a – 
on a phased implementation.  The ultimate plan was to install them at 
all hospitals in KZN. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what was the value of that contract? 
MR WHITE:  Chair that contract was in – was in the tens of millions of 
rands but the way the contract was structured was the Department 
would pay for the oxygen provided rather than for the plants.  So the – 
Intaka would install a plant and then the Department going forward 
would then pay for the oxygen that that plant generates. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  At a price per litre for oxygen? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what would Intaka get for making its equipment 
the plant available to the hospital – to the Department? 
MR WHITE:  Effectively the hospital would buy the output of the plant.  
So instead of a supplier generating oxygen, putting it in a cylinder and 
providing a cylinder they now put up a small plant at the hospital and 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 6 of 212 
 
the output of that plant is then purchased by the hospital. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the – the plant remained the property of Intaka? 
MR WHITE:  That is my understanding yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I guess that in the Department paying for the 
oxygen whatever price was agreed would have taken into account that 
the Department did not buy the plant as such. 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But Intaka’s plant was being used for the benefit of – 
of the Department? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And there was a price agreed per litre of 
oxygen used, is that correct? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair.  There were a number of issues around the 
pricing – was set.  Because obviously Intaka did not want to provide a 
plant if the hospital bought ten litres.  They needed to buy 10 000 litres 
a month for it to be viable for Intaka.  So – and I will come to it later.  
There is issues within the officials in the Department where they 
pushed back on the – in the negotiations on the contract because the 
minimum amounts Intaka wanted to supply at some of the hospitals was 
20 
in excess of what the hospitals had previously been using.  So they 
would now be paying at a minimum for oxygen they did not use.  So 
that became a – a financial impact to the prejudice of the Department if 
they went with this supply. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So effectively they would buy oxygen that they could 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 7 of 212 
 
not justify buying? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair and there was not a way to store it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  So if you paid for 10 000 litres and you only used 8 the 
other 2 000 they just disappear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what were the oxygen generating plants 
called by Intaka? 
MR WHITE:  An Oxintaka. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Oxintaka.  Right.  So we are going to now 
10 
start first with the Wataka’s that were purchased and I would like to 
refer you on page 707 against paragraph 9.042 a report from a Sowetan 
Newspaper dated Friday the 22 September 2006.  Could you… 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was that page? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  It is 707 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh still 707? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Could you please explain that? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair that – it was an article in the Sowetan on the 22 
20 
September 2006.  The title of the article was Muddy Water Not on.  And 
there was a quote in that article from the spokesman for the 
Department of Health in KwaZulu Natal Mr Leon Mbangwa and he 
stated and he said: 
“The Department had not heard about the hospital’s 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 8 of 212 
 
plight. As the Department of Health it is not our 
mandate to deliver water services but we will contact 
the appropriate stakeholder.  We do not want to see 
patients drinking dirty water.” 
Chair that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  What kind of answer is that?  You are running a 
hospital but you do not think it is your responsibility to make sure the 
hospital has got water? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair I think the – what he was trying to say is that the 
– the responsibility for the supply of water in the area is the local 
10 
municipality’s responsibility; it is not the Department – because the 
water that was coming to the hospital was the same water that was 
going to the town. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But he was saying they were not aware that there was 
a problem about water in the hospital. 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. Chair if one – and if we go through the 
documents the issue with – that ultimately happened with that hospital 
is the water was discoloured.  It was not contaminated, it was 
discoloured.  So that is why the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Said it was dirty water. 
20 
MR WHITE:  Ja so the – the – ultimately the testing that was done of 
the water found out that it was perfectly safe to drink.  It was just a bit 
cloudy.  So it was not actually contaminated it was just cloudy which 
gave people the impression that there was something wrong with it. But 
Chair this was used by officials in the Department particularly the Head 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 9 of 212 
 
of the Department at the time, Doctor Nyembezi to now find a reason to 
appoint Intaka without following a normal tender process.  Because 
they are now saying there is an urgency.  Because this article was one 
of the things that they used as a reference. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now you refer to the facts that it turned out 
that the water was not contaminated. With reference to that could you 
please 
deal 
with 
paragraph 
9.043 
the 
KwaZulu 
Natal 
Health 
Memorandum dated the 29 September 2006? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair that internal memorandum of the Department was 
seven days after the Sowetan article.  It was from Mr Kanyele who was 
10 
the Manager Environmental Health in the Department and it was 
addressed to Doctor Nyembezi the Head of Department.  And it was 
titled Situation of Water Supply at Appelsbosch and other Rural 
Hospitals.  It then says: 
“The onsite inspection of water supplies at the 
hospitals of the Provincial Department of Health have 
been carried out to identify actual and potential 
sources of contamination.  Periodic surveys of water 
supplied 
to 
the 
hospitals 
of 
the 
Provincial 
Department of Health are conducted to monitor and 
20 
assess the microbiological safety status of the water 
supplies” 
Chair he then goes into a lot of detail in that memorandum explaining 
what was done and the tests etcetera.  But then at the last three lines 
of the following paragraph on page 708: 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 10 of 212 
 
“I say of significance is that the results reflect 
Appelsbosch contained no chloroform organisms or 
Fecal E coliforms.  This report is dated one week 
after the Sowetan article of 22 September 2006.” 
So Chair the Department did take the issue seriously that was 
identified. The appropriate people went to the hospitals, they did the 
tests and they said there is nothing wrong.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  What then happened if you refer to paragraph 
5 on page 708? 
MR WHITE:  Chair that report where they tested the water and said 
10 
there is actually no contamination seems to have been ignored.  The 
fact that somebody had identified there was allegedly a problem was 
now used as the basis to now procure Wataka’s from Intaka.  And Chair 
there is then a memorandum dated the 6 October.  So the 6 October so 
again about a week after the Department itself has concluded there is 
no issue and that document that I am referring to is on page 708 at 
paragraph 9.045 and that is a memorandum from Mr Ntshangase who 
was the General Manager Budget and Supply Chain Management 
addressed to Doctor Nyembezi the Head of Department and it was titled 
Contaminated Water at Rietvlei and Appelsbosch Hospitals.  Request 
20 
for Exception from SCM procedures and process.  SCM delegation 701. 
Chair this was request not to follow a tender process.  The 
memorandum then goes on in the body and it states: 
“A report received from Integrated Health Services 
Cluster in an article from the Sowetan dated 22 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 11 of 212 
 
September 2006 attached hereto as reference.  The 
contaminated 
water 
at 
the 
abovementioned 
institutions and poses a health risk hazard to the 
health – hospital employees, patients and visitors at 
the hospitals.  The quality of drinking water at the 
hospitals has been a source of great concern.  Three 
quotations 
were 
invited 
by 
the 
Supply 
Chain 
Management Unit with the intention to deal with this 
matter urgently as this is a health threatening 
situation.  Approval to appoint the lowest bidder 
10 
namely Messrs Intaka Investments at a total cost 
R9 960 000.00 including VAT and no hidden costs is 
kindly sought in terms of Supply Chain Management 
Interim Delegation 701.” 
Chair that memorandum contains a number of statements that are just 
false Chair.  The documents do not support it.  So there was an article 
in the Sowetan on the 22 September that is factually correct.  The 
Department’s testing that they refer to here I actually found there was 
no problem at these two specific hospitals. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the people who tested belonged to the 
20 
Department? 
MR WHITE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I guess they have to belong to the Department.  
People who deal with – they will have to be health professionals. 
MR WHITE:  So they – correct Chair. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 12 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  So they concluded there was no issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  That memorandum is now ignored and it says there is an 
issue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And just for clarity who was that memorandum 
sent to? 
MR WHITE:  It was sent to Doctor Nyembezi the Head of Department 
Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And who was … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I guess that the – or earlier on the report went to 
him, the report that said that there was no contamination also went to 
him? 
MR WHITE:  It is a lady Chair but yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR WHITE:  It went to her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes oh ja to her.  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  
MR WHITE:  So Chair so she had a report that said there is no issue.  
20 
She now get a … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is a report from… 
MR WHITE:  Her own [indistinct]/ 
CHAIRPERSON:  Her health professionals in her own department? 
MR WHITE:  Own organisation. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 13 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  She now received a memorandum that comes from Supply 
Chain Management in her own department that – that says there is a 
problem.  So she had two memoranda.  They contradict.  It also says in 
this memorandum that three quotations were invited by Supply Chain 
Management.  Chair I will come to the documents shortly but that is 
false.  Because Doctor Nyembezi was personally responsible for 
obtaining the quotations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  She was also personally given the names of the cover – 
10 
the people who would provide the cover quotes by Doctor Savoi.  He 
emailed her the addresses and I will refer to the email shortly.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  Saying these are the other two people you must ask for 
quotes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  So this is just a memorandum that contains a number of 
false statements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  That has been prepared in my view to try and give the 
20 
impression that the proper procurement waiver has effectively been 
sought.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So are you saying that the quotations that they are 
talking about are not the quotations that Doctor Nyembezi obtained? 
MR WHITE:  It is the same ones Chair. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 14 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is the same ones? 
MR WHITE:  They were attached to this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what you are saying – what you say is not correct 
is that they are the ones who obtained those quotations Supply Chain 
Management Unit. 
MR WHITE:  No.  Chair they came to Doctor Nyembezi and she then 
gave it to Supply Chain Management. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  Where a Supply Chain Management’s responsibility is they 
go and source the quotations. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  The Head of Department does not personally source them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  And then just hand all three to the Supply Chain 
Management. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  So she is interspersed herself into the middle of the 
procurement process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on one second. This is now paragraph 9.046?  
Is that right?  Is that where we are? 
20 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair.  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That memorandum is it not from Ntshagase – it is 
from Ntshagase is it? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Ntshangase is General Manager Budget and 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 15 of 212 
 
Supply Chain Management and she writes to Doctor Nyembezi who is 
Head of the Department.  The report that Mr Ntshangase is referring to 
I the first sentence of the quote from Integrated Health Services 
Cluster is it not the one that found that there was no problem? 
MR WHITE:  It is Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is the one? 
MR WHITE:  That is why Chair if one reads these documents they 
actually – this memorandum is just false. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is not as if they do not know about it. They know 
the report and that says there is no problem with water there and they 
10 
actually refer to it but they go on to actually write something that shows 
the total disregard of the contents of that report? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Without explaining or criticising it in any way to say it 
is wrong and what grounds? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And perhaps Chair although this was only 
discovered later if I can just show you what happened at this stage 
because I think it will help us complete the picture. Could you please 
20 
refer to page 784? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry,  I am sorry Ms Wentzel.  So in the 
paragraph that talks about three quotations the point you were making 
in terms of it being false was that they did not obtain the quotations 
from outsiders – from the suppliers.  That – the quotations were given 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 16 of 212 
 
to them by the Head of Department? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And she had got them from Doctor Savoi. 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright now I follow. 
MR WHITE:  Because the way this is written it tries to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes it says if… 
MR WHITE:  It implies that Supply Chain Management. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Has done the process. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  And ordinarily they would be the ones who 
would be expected to obtain the quotes, is that right? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair.  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but this time that procedure did not happen? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I am going to just divert to show you this and 
then we will go back to where we were Chair.  If you can go to page 
784 sub paragraph 5 of your – sub paragraph 6 of your report where 
you refer to an email from Savoi to Doctor Nyembezi marked personal 
20 
dated 25 September 2006.   
MR WHITE:  So Chair that – that email which was obtained in Intaka’s 
records that were seized by the police.  It is an email… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry where does – do you say 784? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  784 sub paragraph 6 referring to an email 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 17 of 212 
 
from… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright.  
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair that whole paragraph is dealing with various 
extracts of the electronic records of – that were seized by the police 
from Intaka.  And this was one such email that I refer to.  It is dated the 
25 September 2006. So Chair that is three days after the Sowetan 
article.  So between the Sowetan article and the Department doing an 
assessment to say there is actually nothing wrong. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  In that three day period there is an email from Doctor 
Savoi of Intaka to Doctor Nembezi the Head of Department of Health 
and it commences: 
“Dear Amigo.  As agreed upon” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry just stop there.  In the course of your 
investigation did you get to understand the Amigo’s and Amiga.  I 
wonder whether Amiga is the female version of the word Amigo maybe 
plural for male.  
MR WHITE:  So Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  My Latin – I am influenced by my Latin background. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair my understanding is it was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But this must be Greek or something. 
MR WHITE:  It was the female version.  Amigo is male and Amiga is 
female. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 18 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  That – because depending on the emails that were sent if 
it was Amigo it was addressed to a male, if it was Amiga it was 
addressed to a female. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what does it mean?  Did you get to understand 
that? 
MR WHITE:  Chair my understanding is that it was just a… 
CHAIRPERSON:  A friend. 
MR WHITE:  A friendly way of – it is effectively Dear Friend. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  I think when we were looking at an email 
10 
or letter that was addressed to certain people in regard to – or certain 
people in the Department of Traditional Affairs and Local Government 
yesterday there was somewhere where it was saying Hello Amigos and I 
understood you to say this is not the way you would expect a potential 
supplier to a government department to be addressing the people that 
they deal with.  And I thought that that might be because of your 
understanding of the word.  Did I understand you correctly? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair it is partly because of the word but mainly 
because of the content of the emails. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
20 
MR WHITE:  They are on very personal… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes ja.   
MR WHITE:  There is no – it is not formally. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is more personal than business.  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  Yes correct Chair there is no formal introduction etcetera. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 19 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is like just writing to a friend. 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay thank you. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair that – that email it then says: 
“As agreed upon please note as follows. 
1. Water purification system.  Herewith the name of the 
companies.” 
And there is one company called Westpro and there is the contact 
details of the people and their email address.  And then Imvusa 
Stainless and again contact details of the people and their addresses.  
10 
And then at the bottom of the page: 
“And ourselves Intaka Investments for the patented 
equipment Wataka.  Do not hesitate to contact me.” 
And then on the following page: 
“Please bear in mind that we have Wataka’s model 
HWT ready for delivery just in time.” 
Chair those two entities Westpro and Imvusa Stainless are entities that 
had a business relationship with Intaka.  Westpro is a company that 
supplies pumps that are used in the manufacture of the Wataka and 
Imvusa Stainless was a company that did the manufacturing of the plant 
20 
on behalf of Intaka.  So they were the company that did stainless steel 
vats etcetera for the wine industry in the Western Cape but they made 
these plants on instruction of Intaka as well.  Those are the two entities 
that subsequently quoted and provided quotes to Doctor Nyembezi on 
behalf of – that were used as comparative quotes to the Intaka quote.  
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 20 of 212 
 
So you can see from this email Doctor Savoi is telling her who to ask.  
Her PA subsequently sent the emails requesting them to ask and they 
then submitted quotes that had actually been prepared by Intaka and 
emailed to them by Intaka.  So Doctor Nyembezi and Doctor Savoi … 
CHAIRPERSON:  They collaborated. 
MR WHITE:  To – to inflate the prices effectively Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  And Chair these are all in…hair these are all in… 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I am sorry Mr White not only to inflate the 
prices because was there a requirement that three quotes be obtained? 
10 
MR WHITE:  Well Chair it should have gone to tender because of the 
amount. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  This is a R10 million project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  You cannot get quotes.  It needs to go to tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  But Chair effectively they – Doctor Nyembezi created the 
need because there was not – if one looks at the Department’s own 
records there was not a need for water purification plant.  So it is – and 
20 
then in conjunction with Doctor Savoi identified who to ask to quote.  
Chair of interest is that Imvusa Stainless and Westpro are not on the 
Supplier Data Base in KwaZulu Natal.  So how would Supply Chain 
Management even know about them?  They are not even suppliers to 
the Department.  So Chair when one looks at all the details it is – it 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 21 of 212 
 
becomes clear that this was just a fabrication of documents to 
circumvent the procurement process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were no – were there no suppliers in KZN that could 
provide this kind of product as far as you may have established during 
your investigation? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair we – I cannot recall the name of it but we did 
look at the time so at the time we looked in the Yellow Pages . 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  Telephone book and there were some adverts or people 
that said and we phoned some of them and they said they could provide 
10 
something similar.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  If they had been asked they would have – would have 
considered it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  It is not exactly the same but something that would do the 
same job. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and obviously that could save a lot in terms of at 
least the delivery that was said to be about - what?  Five - five million 
in regard to yesterday’s plant for Traditional Affairs which I do not know 
20 
what the delivery would be here. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair the - the point relating to - if - if one compares to 
the Traditional Affairs supply.  Those were being supplied at the same 
time in the same six months of 2006.  Those were being charged at 
R2.2 million each. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 22 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  These are now being charged at R4.9 million each.  Maybe 
a slightly different size … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  But it does not - does not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the price is about double? 
MR WHITE:  It is more than double Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  More than double. 
MR WHITE:  And Chair the - there is an affidavit in the docket from 
Grotto and Imvusa the two entities that manufactured on behalf of 
10 
Intaka and they said the delivery price to KZN would be approximately 
R750 000,00 each. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  The cost. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  So anything above that would be a profit to Intaka. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  They are now charging a price of almost R5 million each.  
So it is a profit of more than R4 million per item supplied. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Did you get to know whether the - Dr Nyembezi 
20 
and the people in the Department of Health knew about the - the price 
and the - the price for - of the ones that were delivered to the 
Department of Traditional Health.  They - they must have known, 
because they are dealing with the same supplier and the supplier had 
provided to the same Provincial Government.  It was just different 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 23 of 212 
 
departments. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair, I - I do not know that they - I do not see 
anything that is specifically says they knew. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  But - but as you say … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it would - it would be surprising if they did not 
know. 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And who …? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is - it is unlikely that in - in seeking to sell these - 
sell this to them.  It is unlikely that Intaka did not say we have - we are 
also providing the same to your colleagues in the Department of 
Traditional Affairs and if - if they said that then the Department of 
Health should have checked what has happened. 
What were you charged?  What are we being charged and all 
of that? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair, but if one just looks at what - my view 
would be Dr Nyembezi did not care, because she is personally 
manipulating the procurement process and circumventing it and 
20 
assisting.  So she did not care what the price was, because she was 
already instrumental in asking or asking for quotations from the 
supplier that she wants to win the work.  So she … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  Did not care about the price. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 24 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what position did Mr Tshabalala hold in 
the department? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair, he had no position in the Department of Health, 
but he was the - the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  You said Mr Tshabalala? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  So he was the Head of the Provincial Treasury Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  But we will show when it comes to the Oxintakas how he 
10 
had some involvement in the procurement process there. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  But we will deal with that in - in due course.  
Thank you.  Now if you do not mind if we can go back to this 
memorandum on page 7-0-8.  6 October 2006 memorandum which 
requests an exemption from Supply Chain Management procedures 
essentially an exemption to go out to tender. 
Now what was the basis of that exemption?  What was used 
as the reason? 
MR WHITE:  The urgency Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Urgency and … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Are we back at 7-0-8? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  7-0-8.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And on page 7-0-9 at the top paragraph 
9.0-4-7 who was the memorandum signed by and who were those - what 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 25 of 212 
 
positions did those people hold? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair, Mr Shengazi was the Head of the Supply Chain 
Management and Health.  So he was the preparer of - of the document.  
It was then recommended by Mr Buthelezi the Chief Financial Officer in 
the Department of Health and it was ultimately approved by 
Dr Nyembezi the Head of Department of Health. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And attached to this memorandum were three 
quotations which you then deal with on page 7-0-9 from paragraphs 
9.0-4-9.  If you can just deal with that?  We basically touched on it. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair that is just the - the proof that we obtained 
10 
showing from the emails and the - and the computers that were - were 
imaged.  How the quotations got to the Department of Health and the 
fact that the person that was doing this on the instruction of 
Dr Nyembezi was her personal assistant and the emails were - were 
being sent from and being received by her personal assistant on - on 
the instruction of Dr Nyembezi. 
So Chair that just shows that the - the quote - the request for 
quotations and the receipt therefore did not originate with Supply Chain 
Management, but it was all done out of the office of the Head of 
Department and in Chair in support of that there is - there is emails - 
20 
the quotations that are attached to the emails are the same ones that 
ended up being attached to the memorandum that was then submitted 
for approval.  So that - that is just the detail to support … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  The conclusion Chair. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 26 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now three days after this memorandum there 
is 
a 
letter 
from 
the 
KwaZulu-Natal 
Health 
Department 
dated 
9 October 2006 referred to - by you in your report on page 7-4-2 and 
paragraph 9.0-5-8. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair that is just the way I have structured this report I 
have just in a chronological order put all the - all the documentation.  
So again this is just three days later a decision is made and it is now 
sent to Intaka for the attention of Dr Gastón Savoi and at 9.0-5-9 the 
content of that letter says: 
10 
“I 
have 
pleasure 
in 
advising 
you 
that 
the 
department has awarded the above mentioned 
quotation to your organisation at a total cost of 
R9 960 000,00 including VAT.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now after the award of the contract - I am 
referring you to page 7-1-5 paragraph 9.0-6-8.  What then happens on 
19 October 2006?  A few weeks later. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair, there is a further report prepared by the - by the 
Environmental Health Department within the Department of Health 
20 
relating to the quality of water at the various hospitals.  So they had 
obviously taken the allegation seriously and they had done further 
testing. 
This is again prepared by Mr Kanele and addressed to 
Dr Nyembezi and … 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 27 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And where - where is that? 
MR WHITE:  On page 7-1-5 Chair at … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR WHITE:  Paragraph 9.0-6-8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  So that is the memorandum of 19 October 2006 and Chair 
that lists all the health institutions within KwaZulu-Natal hospitals and 
clinics and summarises the results of the test, but where they were 
negative - but there is no mention of Rietvlei Hospital or Appelsbosch 
Hospital, because their testing was there was no issue. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because they - they had tested it and they found that 
there was no problem. 
MR WHITE:  Was no problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair - so … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is sent to the Head of Department again? 
MR WHITE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As well.  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR WHITE:  So there is now two reports to the Head of Department 
that says that those two specific hospitals there is no issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And was it in respect of those two hospitals 
that the water purification plants were bought? 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 28 of 212 
 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so the one hospital is Appelsbosch.  The other 
one is? 
MR WHITE:  Rietvlei, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Rietvlei.  Ja and the finding of Mr Kanele and his 
team is the same in regard to both? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Hm.  Well maybe you will address this at 
a later stage, but I would like to know now.  Did you come across any 
document where anybody within the Department of Health including 
10 
Dr Nyembezi sought to justify their decision or her decision or their 
decision to buy these - to place these orders in regard to the two 
hospitals despite the fact that there was a health - there was a report 
by health professionals within the department which said there was no 
problem? 
MR WHITE:  No Chair.  There was no … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is no. 
MR WHITE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They do not deal with it anywhere. 
MR WHITE:  Chair, none of the documents that I saw and we looked at 
20 
everything we could … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  Find relating to this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Explained … 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 29 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Why they would still … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Go forward with the procurement … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Even although there are these reports saying there is no 
issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but I know that you said yesterday in regard to - 
or was it the day before yesterday - in regard to one of the projects 
that you 
investigated. 
 
I 
think in 
regard 
to 
Mr Panday 
and 
10 
Colonel Madhoe that you did not speak to people who were or who 
seemed to be implicated, because in - the police were in charge of that 
investigation and your understanding was that there was going to be a 
stage later on when the police could approach the implicated persons 
for warning statements. 
In regard to this one did you never speak to anyone who was 
implicated such as Dr Nyembezi? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair, this matter proceeded right up to the stage 
where it had trial dates in the High Court.  So all these people had 
been arrested … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  And warning statements obtained. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  Most of the warning statements they - they declined to 
give - give a version. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 30 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  To put up a version? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and - and since then you are not aware of any 
version that somebody like Dr Nyembezi may have put up for one 
reason or another? 
MR WHITE:  I do not know of - of any version that she did put up Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  Now you have said in your report 
that after the authorisation had been granted in October 2006 a number 
of concerns were raised.  What were those concerns and what was - 
10 
before - okay?  Let us first deal with what were those concerns? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair, it was a similar situation to what happened with 
Local Government and Traditional Affairs.  Entities that where these 
water purification plants were to be installed had not been properly 
consulted in the process.  So when they suddenly were told here is an 
order this is to be installed at your hospital. 
They then became a lot of toing and froing between the 
technical people in those - within the department as well as the 
Department of Public Works, because effectively what was proposed 
was that the municipal supply of water to the hospital be diverted 
20 
through this water purification plant and then continue to the hospital 
and officials from Public Works started to get involved and said well. 
We are responsible for the - for the pipes, but as soon as you 
now divert it to something else we are not sure whether that meets our 
standards and as a result there was a lot of push back from various 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 31 of 212 
 
individuals and - and so it just led to months of delay.  Chair, what was 
interesting is that I never saw any further reports to say in those 
months of delay there was a problem with the water. 
There were no further things saying people are - are getting 
sick as a result of the water. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The - the fundamental point is that there was no need 
for this in regard to those hospitals. 
MR WHITE:  Based on the documentation and the people … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  That were interviewed.  That is … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  That is my view Chair.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and those who said there was a need in the 
Department of Health were aware of Mr Kanele’s report and they did 
not put any criticism of the conclusions reached in that report as far as 
you are aware. 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So they just went ahead.  Did something that was 
contrary to a report that to your knowledge they could not attack on any 
grounds. 
20 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And then if I can refer you to page 7-2-4 at 
paragraph 9.0-9-4 which is a letter of 22 January 2007 addressed by 
Dr Nyembezi to Savoi. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 32 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  You said page 7-1-4? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  7-2-4.  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  7-2-4. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And it is paragraph 9.0-9-4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Chair that - that is some three months later … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   
MR WHITE:  And it just - it states - it is about the Appelsbosch Hospital 
and it says: 
10 
“Further to our discussions regarding the delays 
and the installation of the Wataka water purifier at 
Appelsbosch Hospital.  It is my understanding that 
representatives from Health, Works and Intaka met 
at Appelsbosch on 28 September 2006 and decided 
on where the plant should be installed.  Please 
proceed with installation as agreed at the meeting.” 
 
So it is still not installed and Chair that and I say it in the 
following paragraph at 9.0-9-5 that. 
“On 
23 March 2007 
Intaka 
sent 
a 
letter 
to 
20 
Dr Nyembezi 
advising 
of 
the 
installation 
and 
commissioning was completing.” 
So Chair, effectively it took some five months to actually 
install these plants and from what I could see there was no further 
reports of any negative publicity around people getting sick or anything 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 33 of 212 
 
else as a result of the water and Chair the interesting fact is that same 
water is the water that supplies the towns. 
So it would not just be a - a hospital issue.  It would be a 
whole community issue if there was something wrong with the water. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Okay.  Mr White, if we can then go to page 
7-7-8 and there you deal … 
CHAIRPERSON:  To what page? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  7-7-8 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  30 … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  7-7-8 - 778. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay.  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair that - that is just where I refer to and I - and I 
briefly mention that this is just the - the detail.  This is where we found 
the evidence in the electronic records of Intaka where they sent the 
quotes that were to be used - to be submitted to the Department of 
Health by - by West - Westpro and Imvusa Stainless. 
So they - and the wording is exactly the same Chair.  If you 
look at the attachment to the email that was sent.  It just was not on 
these respective entities letterheads.  So once these entities received 
it they placed it on their own letterheads and sent it back to the 
20 
Department of Health, but the source of the content and the price came 
from Intaka. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So if we can just have a look at that from 
point 9.2-1-8.  Who was Ashleigh Spencer? 
MR WHITE:  She was one of the personal assistants at Intaka. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 34 of 212 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And it is directed to who? 
MR WHITE:  This one was to a - a Mr Geddes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And then it says: 
“Please find the attached letter with the amendment 
concerning the spelling of the name.” 
And 
then 
attached 
thereto 
is 
a 
letter 
dated 
29 September 2006 addressed to the Department of Health attention 
Samantha Cheadle titled Re:  Water Purification Plants.  This would 
indicate that Intaka prepared a letter on a blank letterhead and sent it 
to Ron Geddes at Westpro.  So were they required to put this letter on 
10 
their letterhead? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair and that is exactly what happened and Chair 
just - Samantha Cheadle is the personal assistant to Dr Nyembezi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And then in paragraph 2 on page 7-7-9. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second Ms Wentzel.  Yes.  Thank you 
Ms Wentzel. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  Then paragraph 2 page 7-7-9.  
Ashleigh Spencer sends a similar email to Mr Miller.  Is that correct? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And he is told to do exactly the same thing? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now if we could go to page 7-8-4.  Sorry.  We 
have dealt with that.  That - I - I went ahead Chair and showed you the 
email from Savoi to Dr Nyembezi in which he tells her exactly which 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 35 of 212 
 
companies to quote.  Now having given that picture with regard to the 
purchase of the water purification plants. 
I would like to now deal with the purchase of the oxygen 
generating plants.  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would you like a - a comfort break? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  No.  We would like to deal with something I 
have omitted. 
MR WHITE: 
 
Sorry 
Chair. 
 
Just 
- 
just 
the 
one 
point 
that 
Advocate Wentzel did not cover was the fact that the two individuals 
that did the cover quotes.  They - while initially when they were 
10 
interviewed they denied that they had done anything wrong.  They 
subsequently entered in to a plea bargain with the state in terms of 
Section105A and a copy of that plea bargain is at TSW20.  Page 
1-9-6-0 in Bundle D. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1-9-6-0.  Let us have a look at it and who were those 
individuals? 
MR WHITE:  Chair it was - it was a Mr Miller … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  And a Mr Romani. 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Indistinct)? 
20 
MR WHITE:  Romani. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  Romani. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And were they the people in charge of the 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 36 of 212 
 
entities who were requested to supply these quotes? 
MR WHITE:  So yes Chair.  They were involved in those - those two 
entities … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  And they subsequently while initially saying - denying that 
anything improper had been done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Once all the evidence became available … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Their legal representatives … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  Suggested that they enter into a plea bargain with the 
state which they did … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  And that plea bargain related to both the cases in 
KwaZulu-Natal as well as there was another plea bargain on the same 
day for similar cases in the Northern Cape. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and in terms of the - that - that agreement - plea 
bargain - bargaining agreement.  They pleaded guilty to certain 
charges? 
20 
MR WHITE:  It was effectively to fraud Chair relating to the provision of 
the cover quotes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So they - they accepted that they participated - 
they played a criminal role in the whole thing? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 37 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  Thank you.  I wanted to - before we move 
to the next topic.  I wanted to confirm with you that my understanding is 
correct that there seems to be some similarity in what the Department 
of Health and Dr Savoi were doing here in regard to these purchases 
with what Mr Panday was doing with regard to SAPS. 
Mr Panday was supplying SAPS with entities that were said to 
be independent of him, but they were actually not independent of him.  
Dr Savoi is supplying names of entities to Dr Nyembezi and saying you 
can get - us for quotes from them.  The difference might be that in 
regard to Mr Panday’s scheme - well I do not know if the Provincial 
10 
Commissioner did not know that those entities that were said to be 
competing with - is it Gold Coast - Gold Coast. 
I do not know if she knew or she did not know, but the people 
who were at the Supply Chain Management - Colonel Madhoe -may 
have known or did know that these were all entities linked to Mr Panday 
and in regard to the Department of Health Dr Nyembezi probably knew, 
because she got herself involved to getting names of entities from 
which to get quotes from Dr Savoi/Intaka who wanted to do business 
with them.  Do you see any similarities although they are not 100 
percent? 
20 
MR WHITE:  Chair, they are - they very similar. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  I think I would go further and remove the word probably 
knew. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 38 of 212 
 
MR WHITE:  I think on the documents I can come to the conclusion they 
knew … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  That the entities were linked or in one way were working 
together.  Chair, in 20 years this is probably the common way in - the 
most common way in which Supply Chain Management procedures are 
circumvented.  Where entities collude with each other to have inflated 
prices, but Chair it is something that is very difficult to do without the 
involvement of an official within the department. 
So you need a person internally.  The Government officials 
10 
and then you need the - the private sector suppliers.  They need to 
collude together.  This process will not work or they will not be able to 
circumvent the procedures … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  If they do not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  They need to have somebody inside. 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  And - and Chair why the people inside should always be 
able to pick this up is if they advertised in the proper procedure the 
20 
chances of only linked entities quoting against each other is - is almost 
zero. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  So then the - the entities or suppliers in the 
private sector needs somebody inside who will - will ignore the fact that 
he is aware that they are linked or they have a relationship with one 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 39 of 212 
 
another? 
MR WHITE:  Well … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Mr White, if we could now 
look at your report - TSW7 in - I think it is the previous bundle - Bundle 
B at page 5-3-9. 
CHAIRPERSON:  D? 
MR WHITE:  B. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  B for Beatrice? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  B for Beatrice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I think it is much better if … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say something to make sure I know whether it is 
B or D.  So B for Beatrice or … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  B for bull. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  For bull for Beatrice, bad. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  D for Dudu or D for Doris.  D for Derek.  It just helps 
so that … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I look at the right one.  Ja.  Okay.  It is the same one 
we had … 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 40 of 212 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That we were having. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   I think we were in C in and now we’re in B. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I thought we were in B. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Were we? 
MR WHITE:   Chair it’s just earlier on in B, the same file but it’s in B. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Oh sorry, sorry, I’m confused.  Sorry Chair I 
apologise. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So what page? 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Page 539. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Now this is a report of yours dated the 24 t h of 
May 2010, marked Annexure TSW 7, could you please tell the Chair, 
identify this report and explain to the Chair what it was about? 
MR WHITE:   Chair I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And confirm it. 
MR WHITE:   I am the author of the report and stand by the contents 
thereof. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MR WHITE:   Chair that now relates to the tender that was advertised 
by the Department of Health relating to the procurement of the 
Oxyntaka, it is the oxygen self-generating units.  Chair this instances is 
slightly different to the previous ones because in this instance there 
was a tender, it was advertised by open tender but the difference here 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 41 of 212 
 
Chair is that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, so this one was for buying what? 
MR WHITE:   Oxyntaka, the oxygen generating units. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, there’s Wataka and Oxintaka, okay. 
MR WHITE:   So Chair in this instance a – there was a tender, it was 
advertised and various bidders responded, but Chair the issue with this 
tender is that Dr Savoi colluded with Dr Nyabesi in the setting of the 
specifications that were advertised in the tender, and Chair I refer to 
various documents where there were emails backwards and forwards in 
the lead-up to the advertising of the tender where Dr Savoi in track 
10 
changes on the bid document changed the specifications, added things 
or deleted things where his product didn’t comply with the Department 
of Health and that process was a backwards and forward process more 
than once to Dr Nyabesi’s email address, culminating in a bid 
specification that suited to the best he could Intaka. 
 
So while they didn’t, they couldn’t take out all the competition 
they set the specifications to suit his company to the prejudice of all 
the other potential bidders. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   So to tell that story if we could please start 
at page 573, and paragraph 9.061 dealing with you say I also located 
20 
an email from Savoi to Dr Nyabesi dated the 27 t h of November 2006, 
could you tell the Chair please about that email? 
MR WHITE:   Chair that email once again was found in the electronic 
records of Intaka that was seized by the police and the content of that 
email, the third line reads as follows: 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 42 of 212 
 
“Dear Amiga 
Checking the document with our technical staff it was 
detected that a lot of things were added that are not 
according to our specifications, neither to ISO 10083 
specifications with which comply.  Therefore I closed the draft 
with the modifications/withdrawals highlighted in red.” 
And then attached to that document Chair was the draft bid 
specifications where Dr Savoi or the technical staff working for him at 
Intaka had deleted some items and had added other items. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   You deal with the changes that were made on 
10 
page 574 from paragraphs 1 to 12. 
MR WHITE:   Chair I just – ja, I just refer to the different paragraphs in 
the bid specs that we either added or deleted. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Then ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Are there any particular changes that he made that 
you think deserves special attention? 
MR WHITE:   Chair I don’t – I don’t recall the specific details because 
it was ten years ago, but it was ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  I thought maybe somewhere else in your 
report you may be dealing with them. 
20 
MR WHITE:   Chair the point I was just trying to make is that there 
were a lot and that he is having input prior to it becoming public and 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR WHITE:   And doing things where his entity doesn’t comply with the 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 43 of 212 
 
original draft specs, he is now deleting them and where there’s 
something extra his entity has got he is putting it in as a requirement 
potentially to the prejudice of any bidder that doesn’t have that little 
extra piece. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he was allowed to do that, by the head of 
department? 
MR WHITE:   Well Chair that’s what the emails reflect and ultimately 
his changes ended up, most of them, in the final bids that were 
advertised. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mmm, mmm. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Well let’s see on page 575 paragraph 9.063 
the head of department, Ms Mnyebesi, replies to Savoi also in an email 
dated the 29 t h of November 2006, could you explain to the Chair what 
she says there? 
MR WHITE:   So Chair that is two days after the previous email I have 
referred to, and in the fourth line down I quote from what she says 
where she says: 
“Success at last, hope you get it.” 
And then attached to that is the bid specification word document with 
the revised specifications.   And Chair then down the bottom of that 
20 
page at paragraph 9.064 on the same day Dr Savoi replies: 
“Dear Amega, 
I am sending the replies in green.” 
So now he has made further changes to the revised specifications. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but where are you reading from at 575? 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 44 of 212 
 
MR WHITE:   9.064. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay no “Dear Amega”, ja I see.  That is addressed 
to who? 
MR WHITE:   Dr Mnyebesi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
MR WHITE:   So these emails are a chain of emails, where they’re just 
replying backwards and forwards. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   And then perhaps if you could tell the Chair 
the conclusion that you come to, referred to in paragraph 9.065 on 
10 
page 576. 
MR WHITE:   So Chair relating to these changes in the fourth line of 
that paragraph I state: 
“It is clear however that Intaka was advising the Department 
what to include and exclude in the bid specification document 
for the 52 hospitals tender and that this was still an official 
document and not a public one that had gone out to tender 
and that Intaka themselves would later provide a bid.” 
Chair it was a significant tender, it was to supply all the oxygen 
requirements at 52 hospitals in KZN, so all the hospitals and Intaka is 
20 
now – had ongoing input into the specifications which then ultimately 
become the final specifications. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I mean I – did your investigation ever reveal how 
somebody whose company operated from the Western Cape came to 
end up having the kind of influence that he seems to have had on these 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 45 of 212 
 
– on senior officials in these departments where he was just getting 
whatever he wanted? 
MR WHITE:   Chair the introduction appears to have come via Mr 
Tshabalala, the Head of Treasury, and then these ultimately there were 
monies paid to people in either senior positions in the department or 
the MEC’s of those departments. 
 
So Chair the inference would have to be drawn that this kind of 
relationship was because there was pressure from higher up to do 
business with these entities regardless of the cost or the detriment to 
the Department in which these officials worked.  Because Chair most of 
10 
these officials that did these incorrect things it could never have been a 
mistake, because just on the documents and we can see when it comes 
to getting ultimately contracts signed there’s push back from the 
officials in the department, they really try not implement what’s actually 
been awarded in terms of a tender process, because they disagree and 
it takes months and months for these things to be – for contracts to be 
signed or things to be installed because people lower down in the 
hierarchy don’t agree with what’s happening, but ultimately they get 
overruled. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now you told me that when you were doing this 
20 
investigation that those people had already been arrested and so on 
and so on.   Did you ever get a chance to speak to those officials, 
lower ranking officials who may have experienced what was happening 
and were you able to get an input from them?  
MR WHITE:   So Chair all the people that were involved in the process, 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 46 of 212 
 
in 
the procurement, 
or 
the 
implementation 
etcetera, 
were 
all 
interviewed as part of that process and provided affidavits that were 
ultimately either referred to by reports and/or ended up in the police 
docket, so their – and a lot of them are very critical of the process but 
ultimately they were just pressurised into even if they raised concerns 
eventually they were overruled. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So in this case you were able to interview them or 
your team was able to interview them and affidavits and statements 
were obtained which are in the lever arch files that have been made 
available to the Commission. 
10 
MR WHITE:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR WHITE:   And Chair those interviews were done, most of them in 
conjunction with the investigating officers allocated to the matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Thank you Chair.  So after this did the 
contract go out to tender and you said with the specifications as 
manipulated by Mr Savoi? 
MR WHITE:   Correct Chair, those specifications were finally approved 
by the Bid Specification Committee and the Department of Health on 
20 
the 30 t h of November 2006.  There were – people bid for it and the 
winning bidder was ultimately adjudicated as being Intaka, but the 
losing bidders a number of them then appealed and their appeals were 
overruled, were dismissed. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   And those that ...[intervenes]  
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 47 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   They didn’t go to Court? 
MR WHITE:   No Chair it was part of the internal departmental appeals 
process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   And you deal with that at page 590, 
paragraph 10. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it 590? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes. 
MR WHITE:   So Chair there I just referred to the detailed ...[indistinct] 
but the entities that appealed were Afrox, Insmed and Myriad Medical.  
10 
The only interesting aspect is that Chair that appeal process was – it is 
run out of Provincial Treasury, effectively they oversee the appeals 
process son procurement and then once that appeal process had been 
concluded and effectively a decision had almost been made we 
identified that Mr Tshabalala, who I referred to yesterday he now also 
sent an sms to Intaka which I refer to at page 599 and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MR WHITE:   Paragraph 9.9.3, Chair maybe to explain what the people 
at Intaka seem to have had a – again very helpful if you’re doing an 
investigation, they typed out everything they received by sms and filed 
20 
it, and emails and in many instances they printed them out and filed 
them, which was quite helpful when doing an investigation.  So this was 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Not very much unlike Mr Panday’s situation? 
MR WHITE:   Correct Chair, these were very nice investigations to do. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 48 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You must have been – you are common to both, you 
are the investigator for both and somehow the investigation is made 
easy for you.   
MR WHITE:   It doesn’t always happen Chair, but you have to take it 
when you can get it.  Chair and in this sms I just set out we found it so 
when they  - the document ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well do tell me how you found it as well. 
MR WHITE:   So maybe I will just read it Chair, it will be easier. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR WHITE:   So I located an email in the Intaka electronic records 
10 
seized by the SAPS from Alicia Marcus to Roald de Lange, both of 
Intaka.  Alicia Marcus is one of the secretaries at Intaka and Roald de 
Lange is an employee in Intaka.  The body of the email titled KZN 
contains the following: 
“I enclose text of an sms sent by Sipho Tshabalala to Dr 
Savoi.  Attached is a document on an Intaka letterhead 
marked file note, sms sent by Sipho Tshabalala to Dr Savoi 
on 24 August 2007 at 10:20.   
Amigo,  
Hearing went very well, expecting results early next week.” 
20 
Now that related to the appeal where the other, Afrox and Insmed 
etcetera about the outcome of that appeal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR WHITE:   Again Chair just not what one would be expecting ahead 
of Provincial Treasury to be sending to a potential supplier of services 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 49 of 212 
 
to the Department of Health. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   And, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let’s take the tea adjournment now. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes Chair if I can just clarify one thing, one 
word. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   In what capacity was De Lange employed by 
Intaka? 
MR WHITE:   Chair if my memory serves me correct I think he was the 
10 
in-house legal person at Intaka. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, we will take the tea adjournment and resume 
at twenty to five to twelve. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us proceed.  Switch on your microphone. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I beg your pardon.  Mr White you say in your 
report that despite the award of the tender to Intaka there were on 
ongoing concerns about the contract.  What were those concerns? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair there were a number of issues raised by the – 
the technical people in the department as well as by the medical 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 50 of 212 
 
professionals.  So Chair the first one was regarding maintenance.  So 
the Intaka was going to provide these plants. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Are you talking about the Wataka or are 
you talking about the Oxintaka? 
MR WHITE:  The Oxintaka Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oxintaka okay, alright. 
MR WHITE:  Yes so relating to the Oxintaka. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought you had switched back to Wataka so okay.  
Oxintaka. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair so these plants that are going to be installed at 
10 
each hospital to make the oxygen the way the contract was initially 
being drafted the Department of Health said it is Intaka’s responsibility 
to maintain the plants because the department is just buying the 
output.  It is buying the oxygen it is not buying the plant.  Whereas 
Intaka’s representatives said the department must be responsible for 
the maintenance or must pay a maintenance contract for Intaka to 
maintain.  Now obviously that is an ongoing cost so that was one of the 
points of disagreement between the officials and Intaka when it came to 
finalising the contract.  So there was – it took about six months for 
when Intaka were told you appointed until when the contract was 
20 
signed.  So one of the negotiations related to maintenance. The second 
one related to the minimum usage.  So there was  - Intaka wanted – 
had said the minimum usage for certain hospitals was say 10 000 litres 
a month, the departmental officials said we only normally use 8, we 
cannot pay for 10 so that also in different hospitals there was – that 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 51 of 212 
 
was an issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  8 as in 8 000 instead of 10 000? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  So Intaka wanted to be paid for 10 or anything above that, 
the department said, no it needs to be 8 the minimum – so that led to 
quite a long negotiation.  There was then also the cost of the backup 
and this was the main – one of the main issues from the medical 
professionals where they said, we are not prepared to operate in 
hospitals where this is the only source of supply of oxygen.  Because 
10 
they said if there is a breakdown or an electricity failure there will be 
no oxygen.  And if they are busy operating or people who are in 
intensive care there would be no oxygen for those patients.  Intaka’s 
solution to that was to provide a generator which would provide power 
if there was a power failure.  But the plant’s needed significant 
modification if they were going to store oxygen in cylinders which their 
plants were not currently – it was not what they were planning to 
provide.  So that again led to disagreements in the contracts because 
the doctors wanted the department to continue to buy cylinders that 
would be used as the backup obviously at an additional cost then this 
20 
does not become viable.   And the last point that I can remember is 
there was issues around whether these plants needed to be registered 
as a medical device by the medical control council because there was 
ongoing debate about whether the supply of oxygen was a medical 
supply or not.  So those items took – took months effectively to try and 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 52 of 212 
 
resolve and again it was because officials within the organisation did 
not agree with what had happened and were now – there was push-back 
and I can refer to some – some documents and emails where effectively 
the MEC Peggy Nkonyeni now became involved in trying to finalise 
these negotiations. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now before we go there if I can refer you to 
Doctor Savoi’s affidavit.  It is bundle D for dog, page 1394? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Exhibit RR4d? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes RR4d. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For dog.  What page? 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  1394.   
MR WHITE:  Chair it is going to be C. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Oh is it C? 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is C. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I beg your pardon sorry I am just trying to 
locate it myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  C. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I beg your pardon.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is R – Exhibit RR4c. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  C. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page, 1394? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  What is that? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that somebody’s affidavit? 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 53 of 212 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes it is Mr Savoi’s affidavit we dealt with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In what matter? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  In both matters and just to remind you Chair I 
will – if I can refer to page 1386 paragraph 5 where Doctor Savoi says: 
“I have been advised that the issues that have been 
raised and with which I should deal in this affidavit 
are firstly a certain donation that was paid by Intaka 
in February 2007 and secondly to commission 
payments paid by Intaka to Rowmoor Investments 
738 PTY Limited in August 2007.  I shall now deal 
10 
with these issues.” 
Chair we referred to this affidavit with regard to the donation 
apparently made to the ANC but through Shezi Attorneys and what 
Doctor Savoi said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So this is the affidavit that Mr White you yesterday 
was furnished to the police by Doctor Savoi at stage in the course of 
the police investigation. 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  I just wanted to make sure it is clear where 
the affidavit came from.   
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And from paragraph 36 of his affidavit page 
1394 he deals with what he calls commissions paid to Rowmoor.  Could 
you deal with that? 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 54 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Starting with what was – what was Rowmoor? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair maybe if just to explain that if I could refer to the 
diagram at TSW19. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it one of those we saw yesterday? 
MR WHITE:  It is Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  It is the diagram that shows the whole relationship with 
Intake in the middle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR WHITE:  It is in RR4d for dog at page 1958. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  Diagram shows that Intaka is in the middle of the picture. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  It shows all the relationships with the different 
departments and then it shows that two payments were made to 
Rowmoor Investments of R500 000.00 each.  Rowmoor Investments is 
an entity that is owned and the director of which is Mr Linda 
20 
Mkhwanazi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  And Mr Mkhwanazi is the boyfriend of the MEC for Health 
at the time Ms Peggy Nkonyeni.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 55 of 212 
 
MR WHITE:  So this affidavit of Doctor Savoi attempts to address those 
two payments and what those payments were for.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  In this affidavit he says those two payments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Before that.  Does the diagram tell us 
who – who owns Rowmoor? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair if we go to the left on the page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  In the middle we see Intaka is in the middle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR WHITE:  There is two payments to Rowmoor. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  Then next to that I have LH Mkhwanazi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  And the arrow going across with 100%. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  So he is the 100% owner of Rowmoor Investments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  And then I link… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was Rowmoor a CC? 
20 
MR WHITE:  It was a company to my recollection. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Close Corporation.  Yes okay.  But he was the sole 
director? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 56 of 212 
 
MR WHITE:  Chair the interesting point is the entity was initially 
registered on the 26 March 2007. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Mr Mkhwanazi became a director on the 4 May 2007. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Okay. 
MR WHITE:  Now the importance of those dates is that Doctor Savoi in 
his affidavit says the two payments of R500 000.00 related to Mr 
Mkhwanazi’s assistance and involvement with obtaining the contracts 
for the supply of the Wataka’s to the Appelsbosch and Rietvlei Hotel – 
Rietvlei Hospitals.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Now the – the problem with that explanation Chair and 
where – with respect to Doctor Savoi it does not all tie together is 
those contracts for those hospitals were awarded in October of 2006. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  The payments are now made in August and November of 
2007. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Some more than ten months later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR WHITE:  So – but what was happening… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were those payments – so the payments were made 
to the legal entity and not to Mr Mkhwanazi in his personal capacity. 
MR WHITE:    Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and if they – if – well assuming if Rowmoor had 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 57 of 212 
 
existed in 2006 and Mr Mkhwanazi had been involved in it and 
Rowmoor had been used assuming it would have been lawful for this to 
happen to assist Intaka to get this business then at least if Rowmoor 
existed in 2006 and Mr Mkhwanazi was part of it at that time maybe 
there could be something in the proposition.  But you are saying that Mr 
Mkhwanazi and Rowmoor had no involvement with each other prior to 
2007 and you say the award was in 2006/ 
MR WHITE:  That is correct Chair.  And just to take that one step 
further there was also nothing in Intaka’s records that were seized 
including the emails as well as the Department of Health’s records, 
10 
including all the officials interviewed saying that Mr Mkhwanazi is his 
personal capacity had any involvement either.  So he may have said I 
did it in my personal capacity and my company was only registered 
later but in his personal capacity his name or any mention of him does 
not appear anywhere in that process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But did – does Doctor Savoi in his affidavit explain 
exactly what it is that either Rowmoor or Mr Mkhwanazi did for Intaka? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair maybe it would be better if I just read this 
specific paragraphs? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR WHITE:  So Chair if we go to page 1394 which is in RR4c. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  At paragraph 36 it reads? 
“I now turn to the issue of the commission paid to 
Rowmoor.” 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 58 of 212 
 
Paragraph 37. 
“In this regard Mr Lindelihle Mkhwanazi with whom 
we had initially come into contact at an early stage 
during our discussion with very role – various role 
players in KZN approached us expressing an interest 
in marketing our products in KZN.  He indicated that 
he was already supplying stationery and other 
products to KZN PG departments and we therefore 
thought that there would be no harm in giving him an 
opportunity to market ours as well.  I would add that 
10 
discussions with previous potential BE business 
partners in KZN had come to naught.  I cannot recall 
exactly 
when 
the 
initial 
discussion 
with 
Mr 
Mkhwanazi took place.” 
Paragraph 38. 
“We initially had not place [indistinct] what I would 
describe as a gentleman’s agreement in terms of 
which it was agreed he would promote Intaka and its 
products within the geographical area of KZN.  The 
intention was that this would be followed up with a 
20 
formal sole agency agreement in terms of which inter 
alia he would be entitled to commission on all Intaka 
Water Purification and Self Generating Oxygen 
equipment sold in KZN irrespective of whether he 
was the direct cause of the sale.  This is the 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 59 of 212 
 
standard approach reached in our sole agency 
agreements.  That this was not pursued at any stage 
after the initial discussions an agreement is perhaps 
due in part to the fact that Intaka did not have a full 
time legal counsel at the time and it was only 
subsequent to the appointment of Mr Rual De Lange 
in February 2007 that a number of outstanding legal 
issues or issues with legal implications were followed 
up.” 
Paragraph 39. 
10 
“Be that as it may however at some point subsequent 
to our discussions with Mr Mkhwanazi I was 
approached by Doctor Busi Nyembezi the then Head 
Department of Health whom I had met previously 
together with the MEC of Health for KZN Ms Peggy 
Nkonyeni.  Doctor Nyembezi enquired from me about 
the possible purchase of two Wataka’s for the 
Rietvlei and Appelsbosch Hospitals.” 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now if you can just stop there.  It is clear 
what he is saying and it will appear as we refer further he refers to this 
20 
as commission not for securing the self-generating oxygen plant 
contract but it is commission for securing the two Wataka’s the Water 
Purification Plants, is that correct? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Okay continue. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 60 of 212 
 
MR WHITE:  But Chair just on paragraph 39 there was no documents 
anywhere and as I said before from what I saw Intaka had the – and 
their employees printed out everything or typed it up and saved it and 
saved it in files etcetera.  So if there was communication with Mr 
Mkhwanazi I would have expected to have found something even if it 
was sms’ because that is – that is the way they kept their records.  So 
there was – there was absolutely nothing in their records around that 
time. Chair and then maybe just the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But was there any indication that either Mr 
Mkhwanazi or Rowmoor was doing any marketing for anybody? 
10 
MR WHITE:  Chair I did not have their records. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  But from what I could see in Intaka’s records they were 
not doing anything.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Well it would be interesting to see whether 
their business involved marketing anybody’s product at all at the time.  
Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  If we could then go to paragraph 44.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course Mr White if there is no proper explanation 
or satisfactory explanation for these two payments to Rowmoor and Mr 
20 
Mkhwanazi it may well be that those payments might be part of the 
explanation for some of the things that are difficult to understand in 
regard to these projects.   
MR WHITE:  Chair I agree 100% and that was the conclusions that the 
prosecutors in this matter came to originally. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 61 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  When you look at it as a complete picture they said as 
Chair said a lot of things are inexplicable for what was done and the 
fact that money is now being paid to people linked to people in 
positions that could influence these processes the inference that was 
drawn by the prosecutors was that these were corrupt payments Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Yes thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So if you can deal with paragraph 44 please? 
MR WHITE:   
“The two Wataka’s were subsequently supplied as 
10 
per the quotation and copies of the relevant sales 
orders and tax invoice of 6 December 2006 are 
attached as are also a letter from myself to Doctor 
Nyembezi dated 12 December regarding the 50% 
issue including fax transmission form.  Three further 
tax invoices, 311, 347 and 348 and an extract from 
Intaka’s general ledger in this regard.” 
Chair this – the 50% that is being referred there is Intaka wanted a 50% 
upfront payment before – based on receipt of the order. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
MR WHITE:  And there was a push-back from the department saying in 
terms of government procurement we cannot pay up front. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  You need to deliver and then we will pay you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 62 of 212 
 
MR WHITE:  That – so there was some backwards and forwards 
regarding that as well 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I am sorry I just want to go back to the 
commission, to the two payments.  Did your investigation reveal how far 
that money went? 
MR WHITE:  No Chair.  I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If it went to Rowmoor and did it end there? 
MR WHITE:  Chair it was used from there I cannot – there was nothing 
– I could not trace it to any specific other individual. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR WHITE:  Linked to the Department of Health. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Okay now Chair just to make the point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  In paragraph 44 again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And it is made very clear by Doctor Savoi that 
he is referring to the two Wataka’s not the self-generating oxygen 
plants. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  If you could then please deal with what he 
says in paragraphs 46 and 47? 
CHAIRPERSON:  But before you do that just to go back to the point I 
think at 44 you say that Intaka demanded an upfront payment and there 
was resistance to that from officials within the Department of Health. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 63 of 212 
 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And later on you will indicate how far that 
debate went – what – how it ended? 
MR WHITE:   Well Chair they were not – and the upfront payment was 
not made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was not made oh okay. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair at paragraph 46 on page 1397 it reads: 
“Reverting to the issue of Mr Mkhwanazi and the 
commissions paid to him as already indicated I was 
of the view that a gentleman’s agreement existed 
10 
between us and that as a result he was entitled to 
commissions on the sale of the two Wataka’s as 
detailed above.  I do note that by the time the 
payment for the two Wataka’s had been made to 
Intake by the Department of Health the standard sole 
agency agreement prepared by our legal counsel Mr 
De Lange had not yet been concluded with Mr 
Mkhwanazi.  After the agreement was prepared by Mr 
De Lange the matter was also subsequently followed 
up by or commercial department under the direction 
20 
of Mr Fernando Praderi.  However in the spirit of the 
gentleman’s agreement I nevertheless believed the 
commission should be paid to him in respect of the 
two Wataka sales and therefore authorised that such 
payments be made.  Copies of the documentations 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 64 of 212 
 
pertaining to the payments are attached.” 
So Chair there was apart from the so called gentleman’s agreement 
there was nothing to support the link of Mr Mkhwanazi to the sale of the 
Water Purification Plants for the Appelsbosch and Rietvlei Hospitals. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did – did your team look at Intaka’s computers and 
cell phones for Doctor Savoi to see what communications either by 
email or letters or sms’s or Whatsapp had – may have taken place 
between Mr Mkhwanazi and – and Intaka about his marketing role? 
MR WHITE:  Chair we could find nothing in their records. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR WHITE:  Both hard copy documents that were seized. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  There were some 320 lever arch files of documents seized 
from Intaka’s premises. 
CHAIRPERSON:  HM. 
MR WHITE:  As well as we had approximately three terabytes of 
electronic data from the various computers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  And we could not find details of what he was alleged to 
have done relating to this marketing Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And actual communication between them? 
MR WHITE:  Not at the time Chair no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not at the time? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair what I will refer to shortly is where I found 
records that Mr Mkhwanazi had meetings with Doctor Savoi together 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 65 of 212 
 
with Peggy Nkonyeni at the time.   
CHAIRPERSON:  You – you found evidence of that? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And was this prior to the award of the Oxintaka? 
MR WHITE:  So it was after the award of the Water Purification. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  But prior to the finalisation of the contract for the oxygen 
plants. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
MR WHITE:  So Chair… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And how – how did you find evidence of that meeting?  
Was that in some correspondence?  Was that in some sms’s or? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair maybe if I could just refer to that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair we will deal – we will deal with that in 
due course.  Perhaps if I can take it step by step Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I just want to know now. 
MR WHITE:  Okay so Chair it was in the records of Intaka. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  So one of the sources was Doctor Savoi’s electronic diary. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Which we then matched back to supporting documents like 
bookings for air tickets. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Hotel accommodation etcetera. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 66 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  As well as other documents in Intaka’s records confirming 
that meetings were set down and were to take place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So you found records which reflected that such 
a meeting did take place? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and then later on we can go to the records but that 
is what – that is how you came to know? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And would there have been any minutes of the 
10 
discussions? 
MR WHITE:  There is no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No minutes? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair I come to the conclusion that those were not 
official Department of Health meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  Because there is no minutes and no feedback into the 
Department of Health based on those meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  So those appear to have been private meetings of Ms 
20 
Nkonyeni and Mr Mkhwanazi with Doctor Savoi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So now going back you said that the bid was 
accepted on the 26 June 2007 and we know that the contract was 
ultimately signed on the 13 December 2007 nearly six months later.  
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 67 of 212 
 
And you explained that there was a delay in signing the contract 
because of these difficulties that had been raised.  And Chair I am now 
going to refer to documents from which I will submit it will become clear 
what the true purpose of the payment to Rowmoor Investments was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Where do I go? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So Chair if we can go back.  I think it is 
bundle b Chair.  So it is RR4b for bad and it is page 630.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 630? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Chair.  And the bottom of that page 
paragraph 9.128.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair this is now some five months after the award and 
it is about a month before the contract is – the appointment is actually 
made and Chair to put the – into the context the two payments of 
R500 000.00 to Rowmoor Investments were on the 30 August and the 
23 November 2007.  So this is between the two payments this 
communication took place.  So Mr De Lange who is the in-house legal 
at Intaka sent a letter to Doctor Mbele.  Doctor Mbele at the time was 
the new Head of Department of KZN Health so Doctor Nyembezi had 
been removed. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh did he or she succeed Doctor Nyembezi? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair.  So she [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh was it – was it a she? 
MR WHITE:  Also a she. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 68 of 212 
 
MR WHITE:  So 15 November 2007 and the email is copied to 
Ms Nkonyeni.  Okay and it relates to the delays experienced and the 
need to finalise the agreement.  Okay.  So that is what that - that email 
is about.  Dr Savoi sent an email to De Lange on the same day.  That 
was titled “KZN Tender Contract” and included in that email is the 
following: 
“After a long conference with the MEC …” 
It would be Ms Nkonyeni. 
“…she is very disappointed with HOD and Victor’s 
attitude not proceeding as per her instructions.” 
10 
Chair the HOD was Dr Mbele and Victor was Mr Ntshangase - 
the Head of the Supply Chain Management Department. 
“All the situation was created because Victor 
received questionnaire from DA and only today 
disclosed to MEC.  MEC will reply to DA.  Victor 
must send to you legal documents as you requested 
today.  If you do not receive them claim them to him 
by email and a copy to MEC.  I informed the MEC 
that as per my instructions once we receive these 
documents you will email him.  CC MEC and HOD 
20 
informing that you and the Commercial Director will 
be there to make a short presentation of the 
company and product to HOD.  She will make sure 
that you return with the documents signed.  I 
explained to her the reason why I will not be there 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 69 of 212 
 
and she fully agreed.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is - this is Dr Mbele or no, no.  This is De Lange.  
Who is writing here? 
MR WHITE:  So this is Dr Savoi sending an - sending this to - to 
De Lange.  So there was am … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm … 
MR WHITE:  Initial email. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And de - and De Lange is legal counsel - internal 
legal counsel for Intaka? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair.  So he was … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  So … 
MR WHITE:  He was the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so Dr Savoi had had a conversation with 
Dr Mbele? 
MR WHITE:  No.  With - with Ms Nkonyeni Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With - with Ms Nkonyeni … 
MR WHITE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he is now updating De Lange - Mr De Lange 
about what transpired in that conversation.  Is that right? 
MR WHITE:  That is correct Chair … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  Because Mr De Lange had been tasked or was the person 
that was interacting with the legal people at - at the Department of 
Health trying to get the contract finalised.  So because it was not 
moving - was not getting finalised Dr Savoi appears to have gone 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 70 of 212 
 
outside of the legal process negotiations to the MEC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  For her to put pressure on the people to get it final. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  The slight additional complication is now that there was 
also a new Head of Department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  So that is why my interpretation is they now wanted to do 
a brief presentation to her as to what this is actually about as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Let me just see.  Yes.  Okay.  Yes.  You can 
10 
continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So does - does this email reflect that Mr De Lange 
would do the presentation and Dr Savoi would not be there? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And it also - Chair - indicates that he is 
reporting to De Lange that after a long conference with Ms Nkonyeni.  
She is very disappointed with the Head of Department and Victor’s 
attitude for not proceeding and this whole situation is created because 
20 
of a questionnaire from the DA, but she - the assurances at the end 
very importantly she will make sure that you return with the documents 
signed. 
If I can then turn to page 6-3-2 and paragraph 9.1.3-3 which 
refers to a further email - internal email dated 5 December 2007 from 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 71 of 212 
 
Savoi to De Lange.  Could you deal with that? 
MR WHITE:  Chair, this email was titled KZN Contract Oxygen 
Generators and in that email Dr Savoi advises Mr De Lange as follows: 
“According to yesterday’s telephone conversation 
with the MEC of Health KZN.  I reiterate the need 
for both parties to have the contract signed this 
week.” 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And paragraph 9.1-3.4.  What does that deal 
with? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair this paragraph now sets out that never mind the 
10 
people at the Department of Health having concerns about the contract.  
The - some of the employees at Intaka also felt that the contract was 
not properly worded or drafted because they did not believe their 
product met the requirements of the contract and Chair this is a 
document now dated 7 December 2007 and it is sent - and I am reading 
from the - the second line. 
From Stefan Oosthuizen who was the Industrial and Technical 
Director of Intaka.  He sent this email to Intaka.  He sent this email to 
Mr De Lange.  He copies Mr Praderi who was the - one of the Directors 
and Mr Erasmus.  Chair, I do not quite recall what Mr Erasmus’ position 
20 
was, but he raised concerns with regard to the bid and the bid offer. 
These concerns are relevant particularly to point one and 
then I quote from his - his email: 
“Scope is clear that supply must be continuous 
online supply.  Our standard machines as a stand-
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 72 of 212 
 
alone cannot provide this without the cylinder 
manifold or VIE of the hospital as backup.” 
Chair, I conclude that hence at that stage the technical 
people at Intaka said the contract we are about to sign our - our 
equipment does not meet the specifications.  So - and that was why this 
thing had been dragging on for so long, but Chair regardless of the 
internal issues the contract was still signed six days later on 
13 December 2007. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So just going back to that to make the point.  
What has been said to De Lange who then signs the agreement within a 
10 
few days of being told this presumably by technical people in his own 
company that we are providing self-generating oxygen plants that are 
about to be relied on by hospitals and patients who in operations or 
otherwise in intensive care and we are not sure that our machine will 
give continuous supply and that we will need backup.  What backup was 
- were they contemplating? 
MR WHITE:  Chair, there were two options.  Either the - the department 
had to buy or rent cylinders as it had used in the past or the - the 
machine - the plant to be provided by Intaka to be modified to add on 
an additional unit to it where they could - the oxygen could be stored in 
20 
tanks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second.  Sorry.  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Then on the same day I believe that the 
contract was signed - 13 December 2007.  You refer to an email of that 
date sent to staff members of Intaka by Savoi.  It is page 6-3-2 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 73 of 212 
 
paragraph 9.1-3-5.  Could you deal with that? 
MR WHITE:  If I could just read it Chair and then I will comment. 
“On 13 December 2007 at 18:03 (the agreement was 
signed earlier in the day at Inkosi Albert Luthuli 
Hospital).  Savoi sent an email to four of his staff.  
The content of the email relates to Intaka’s 
relationship 
with 
Rowmoor 
Investments 
as 
at 
13 December 2007 being more than a year after 
they had been awarded the supply of the two water 
purification plants for Rietvlei and Appelsbosch 
10 
Hospitals and things that either did not or were not 
going to happen:  quantities, maintenance contract 
and the removal of one hospital.” 
So Chair they effectively muddling both together.  They 
referring to the Oxyntaka contract, because that is where the issues of 
quantities, maintenance contract etcetera as well the Rietvlei and 
Appelsbosch Hospitals, but the coincidence is this email is written in 
the afternoon or early evening. 
6 o’ clock in the evening when the contract was signed that 
afternoon for the Oxintakas.  Some - so while it refers to the Watakas.  
20 
This - this email is written by Dr Savoi on exactly the same day that the 
Oxyntaka contract is signed. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Chair maybe … 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 74 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am trying to understand the point you are making 
about the time of the signing and the time of the email. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair, this email was written within hours of the 
Oxyntaka contract being signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  So my inference to draw from that is that the - the issue 
that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let - let us start with what it says, because then 
maybe that is where I will get the - the clue. 
MR WHITE:  Okay.  So the … (intervenes). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  About quantities and maintenance - what - what it 
saying the email about all those things? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair maybe I can refer to the - I have quote on the 
next page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Let us read that first. 
MR WHITE:  Page 6-3-3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  “Considering that the conditions of the KZN 
tender contract that was signed are different from 
what was initially approved between our company 
20 
and the Department of Health.  I believe it is 
necessary 
and 
important 
to 
check 
the 
draft 
contracts sent to Rowmoor Investments.  It must be 
transmitted to Rowmoor that there are a lot of 
things agreed with the Department of Health of KZN 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 75 of 212 
 
that were going to happen and did not happen as 
one:  they decided to consider the wrong quantities 
mentioned in the tender and the volumes that our 
technicians got during the visit and that most of 
them were confirmed later by Mr Victor of the Chain 
Supply Management.  There is no evidence that any 
quantities were considered at the signing of the 
agreement as the schedule to Annexure B was not 
completed.” 
That is my insert Chair. 
10 
“Two:  they did not accept the maintenance 
contract.  Three:  they took one hospital out 
alleging that it is part of the Eastern Cape and not 
KZN.  Not substituting for another one etcetera.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what - what was the point about the time when the 
agreement was signed and the - and the timing of the email or its 
contents? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair, this is now - this email is now the first time I can 
20 
find the references to Rowmoor Investments and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Whether they - and it is now linking them to this contract, 
because … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And - and is it not interesting that Rowmoor is 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 76 of 212 
 
Rowmoor Investments and if you think about marketing.  It seems to 
very diverse things.  If you are an investment company then you do 
marketing for other - for other people. 
MR WHITE:  Chair, I - I think Rowmoor Investments was just the name 
of the shelf company that - that was purchased.  I did not draw any 
inference from the name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but - but if you - if - if you want to - if you want a 
vehicle for a marketing business.  I do not think you - you collect 
investment. 
MR WHITE:  I - I would agree Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So now … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - but - but still I think I am - I am still trying to get 
the point.  Maybe - maybe I am overemphasising, but I just want to 
make sure that I do not miss an important point that you may have been 
trying to make.  That - about the fact that the contract was signed on - 
earlier on that particular day and there was this email. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair, the point I was trying to make is that suddenly 
20 
this relationship seems to come to light.  It is now being referred to 
internally within Intaka and - so my inference is that the signing of the 
contract to Oxintakas was in one way or another linked to Rowmoor 
Investments, because why does he now refer to it and the issues that 
Intaka was not happy about around the quantities the maintenance 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 77 of 212 
 
contracts etcetera. 
He now refers to that and says we now need to check what 
we were discussing with Rowmoor relating to this contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  Whereas Dr Savoi has said the monies that were paid to 
Rowmoor relate to the water purification plants.  Whereas it now 
appears that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, yes.  Oh.  Okay.  No.  I think … 
MR WHITE:  That - that - so and based on the timing of those payments 
leading up to the signing of this contract.  It is my opinion Chair that 
10 
those payments link - linked to this contract not to something that 
happened more than a year prior to this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the point you are making is simply this.  The fact 
that this email which is sent a few hours after the signing of the 
contract that relates to Oxintaka.  The fact that Rowan Investments - 
Row - Rowmoor Investments is mentioned in relation to that contract 
and not in relation to Wataka - to the Wataka contract … 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is inconsistent with Dr Savoi’s version that those two 
payments relate to Rowmoor’s role in marketing the - or is inconsistent 
20 
with Dr Savoi’s version that it was payment connected with Wataka. 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Why mention it in relation to Oxintaka if Rowmoor 
relates to Wataka.  Unless of course - unless of course, because I think 
his affidavit - that is Dr Savoi’s affidavit seems to suggest that 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 78 of 212 
 
Rowmoor or Mr Mkhwanazi was going to market their products - their 
products. 
Unless somewhere he says he also - also marketed this 
Oxintaka and those payments included his work that he did in relation 
to this, but he does not say that. 
MR WHITE:  Chair he does not - he does not say that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  But also the - Mr Mkhwanazi is not involved from what I 
can see.  Dr Savoi dealt directly with the Head of Department at the 
time setting the specifications.  So any involvement - so Chair the only 
10 
involvement I can see of Mr Mkhwanazi is that he is the boyfriend of 
the MEC of Health at the time who assisted in getting the contract 
signed and the payments are made over that time period where her 
involvement was very clear that Dr Savoi was using her influence to get 
the contract signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And Chair for clarity what the staff are told is 
that I am complaining about the terms of the contract that I eventually 
got and he says: 
“I believe it is necessary and important to check the 
20 
drafts contract sent to Rowmoor Investments.  It 
must be transmitted to Rowmoor and there are a lot 
of things agreed with the Department of Health and 
KwaZulu-Natal that were going to happen and did 
not happen.” 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 79 of 212 
 
And he says: 
“I have got the wrong quantities.  They have not got 
a maintenance contract.” 
And he complains.  That - now I am going to refer to 
something that occurs the day after the contract is signed and I would 
like to refer you Chair to page 6-7-3 paragraph 20.  You say there that: 
“Ms Nkonyeni was present at the hospital on 
13 December 2007 
when 
the 
agreement 
was 
signed.” 
You then refer to an SMS sent the following day… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Who writes here?  Is it the same email or 
what is his and who does - is it going to? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  It is - it is - we are going to refer to an SMS. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So paragraph 20 is Mr White recording on 
page 6-7-3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay.  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  He records: 
“Peggy Nkonyeni was present at the IALC Hospital 
on the 13 t h …” 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well hang on.  Hang on.  The - this is Mr White in his 
report recording that Ms Peggy Nkonyeni was present. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  On the 13 t h … 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 80 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is just part of the report and … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In that - in that paragraph he quotes an SMS or 
something. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  It is just important that as we go to whatever 
page is clear what document it is from whom to whom … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And about what. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So you record that she was present at the 
hospital on 13 December 2007 when the agreement was - was signed.  
Can you tell the court what you discovered from your investigations 
referred to in that - in paragraph 20 of your report happened the very 
next day - 14 December 2007? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair, maybe just to come back to the fact that 
Ms Nkonyeni was present.  So people that were part of the process 
where the agreement was signed said Ms Nkonyeni was present in the 
room, but she sat at the other end of the take.  She was not part of the 
20 
discussions and that was at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli Hospital in - in 
Durban.  On the following day after … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is - that is an interesting venue to go and sign a 
contract at. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair … 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 81 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  One would have thought that they would go to the 
department’s offices. 
MR WHITE:  Chair, it - it may sound strange, but I - in the course of 
these investigations we had a number of meetings at that hospital 
complex, because they have an administration wing where they have a 
number of boardrooms. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR WHITE:  So it is - it seems to be used for meetings by the 
Department of Health on a - on a fairly regular basis.  So it was not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
10 
MR WHITE:  It does happen.  It is not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  Because I attended … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  Similar. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No.  I am just thinking that I am under the 
impression that the headquarters of the department would be in 
Pietermaritzburg, because that is the capital of the province and … 
MR WHITE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Inkosi Albert Luthuli Hospital is in Durban. 
20 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, but you say there - there are certain facilities 
which might be attractive for use by the department? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair.  There is an administration block with a 
number of boardrooms. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 82 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  That are used for meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair the - the day following the signing of that 
contract for the Oxintakas.  There was an SMS sent to Dr Savoi.  A 
copy of that was found in Intaka’s records and it reads as follows. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sent by? 
MR WHITE:  Ms Nkonyeni. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  It says: 
10 
“Doc!  A contract was signed yesterday although 
your guys were not happy with maintenance and a 
few other things.  Buy they were crushed because 
of what was reflected in the bid document.  Next 
time we will have to be more careful and perhaps 
you need to cancel the donation since you are 
losing on maintenance.  What do you suggest?  
Peggy” 
Chair that is just a very, very unusual SMS to be sent.  It 
almost looks from reading that - that SMS that Ms Nkonyeni is more 
20 
concerned about the welfare of Intaka and Dr Savoi than she is about 
the department she is the MEC of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And more … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And - and the reference to donation? 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 83 of 212 
 
MR WHITE:  So Chair, I do not know.  Everybody has asked me that 
question.  I do not know what donation she is referring to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  So it may be a donation I do not know about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did - did you ask Dr Savoi what … 
MR WHITE:  Chair, they … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Donation … 
MR WHITE:  They were all accused in the matter Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At - at that stage.  So you never got a chance to - to 
ask him? 
10 
MR WHITE:  I did not - did not Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you. 
MR WHITE:  Or they were suspects at this stage Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  When we did the investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And Mr White the way that I read it is that we 
know from the internal memorandum that we were referring to earlier 
that Mr Savoi was not happy that he had to maintain these oxygen 
purification plants in terms of the final agreement and it is quite clear 
20 
that would be a cost implication to him if he were to - this is - I am 
deducing. 
There would be a cost implication to him if he had to bear the 
cost of maintenance and I assume that when she says buy.  The means 
but and a few other things, but they were crushed because of what was 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 84 of 212 
 
reflected in the bid document.  I - and you can tell me if you agree - 
can only read that to mean that from what was said in the bid document 
it appeared that they would have to assume responsibility for 
maintenance, but then what is more important is she says: 
“Next time we will have to be more careful.” 
And then what can one only deduce from this.  You have now 
got to incur greater costs, because you are incurring maintenance.  So 
she says: 
“Perhaps you need to cancel the donation.  Since 
you are losing on maintenance.  What do you 
10 
suggest?” 
She is saying I can understand maybe you do not want to 
make such a big a donation.  I cannot read it any other way. 
MR WHITE:  Chair, maybe that is why in our investigation we did not 
find this donation if there was going to be one or a pay … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Just repeat that. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair, maybe if that is the interpretation of this SMS 
maybe that is why we did not identify a further payment to anybody, 
because the decision was made I am not going to make - loosely call it 
- a donation, because the contract was not as favourable as I originally 
20 
anticipated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms - Ms Wentzel just repeat the interpretation that 
you attach to it.  Let me … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Understand it. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 85 of 212 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Chair.  Just bear with me.  I am just going 
to go back to it.  Now she says: 
“Doc!  The contract was signed yesterday although 
your guys were not happy with maintenance and a 
few other things.” 
Buy I read as but. 
“But they were …” 
I think it should be crushed.  Perhaps with a C and S, 
because it is C-R-U-C-H-E-D. 
“…because of what was reflected in the bid 
10 
document.” 
I understand that to mean that they were not happy with 
having to assume responsibility for maintenance.  We know from the 
earlier documents this is - this was one of the contentious issues.  Who 
was going to bear responsibility for maintenance and they are not 
happy that at the end of the day it is found that Savoi who is the owner 
of the machine needs to be responsible for its own maintenance. 
What he wanted to do is lease the oxygen, but then also 
make the department pay for the maintenance of the machine.  So he 
did not have that and when she says: 
20 
“They were crushed, because of what was reflected 
in the bid document.” 
I read that to mean that the bid document specified that they 
would have to be responsible for maintenance.  So that was a problem.  
The next thing is she says … 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 86 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Has - has somebody looked at the bid document and 
see whether it would support that? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair.  The - the document did say the bid 
specifications said that the supplier would be responsible for the 
maintenance … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay.  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  But Intaka after being awarded did not want that - they did 
not want that in the final contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Okay.  So - so what - was what you were 
10 
saying there is that when Ms Nkonyeni says in the email: 
“…your guys were not happy with maintenance and 
a few other things …” 
Let us stick with maintenance.  You understand that to mean 
that they did not want Intaka to be responsible for maintenance and 
their stance was contrary to the bid specification, because the bid 
specification required Intaka to be responsible for that.  So they did not 
get that and the reason they did not get that is because of the bid 
document? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay and you - and - and you say you can - you 
can go along with that interpretation? 
MR WHITE:  I can confirm that is the facts Chair.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And then following on that … 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 87 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair, my submission is that what is said now 
is I know you wanted the department to pay for maintenance.  Now I 
understand and I am - we have to be more careful next time.  You are 
going to have to pay for the maintenance.  So there is going to be an 
extra cost.  You are not going to get as much out of this deal as you 
anticipated and so what does she offer him.  She says: 
“Perhaps you need to cancel the donation.  Since 
you are losing on maintenance.  What do you 
suggest?  Peggy” 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes what did you say to that interpretation, I know 
about the first part, I don’t know if you…[intervenes]. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair we didn’t find any subsequent payment that was 
made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  So my only conclusion could be that if there had been an 
agreement to make a payment that maybe it was cancelled because the 
contract wasn’t as lucrative as Intaka originally anticipated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay thank you.  Now what did you understand 
the reference to “we” to be referring to, we’ll have to be more careful? 
20 
MR WHITE:  So Chair my interpretation of that was that …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who was the “we”? 
MR WHITE:  It was referring to herself and Intaka, as in we together, 
will have to be more careful next time.  So she almost was putting 
herself as part of Intaka rather than as the political Head of the 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 88 of 212 
 
Department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes because the one option is that she was talking 
about her Department, the other option is that she was talking about 
herself on the one hand or herself and the department on the one hand 
and Intaka and Dr Savoi and Intaka on the other but you say, if one 
looks at the context you don’t think it’s a reference to her and the 
Department? 
MR WHITE:  Chair it doesn’t actually matter which variation of that it is, 
it’s wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR 
WHITE: 
 
If 
it’s 
her 
and 
the 
Department, 
he 
personally….[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They should not be working together they should not 
be a unit, ja. 
MR WHITE:  Because why would the department have to be more 
careful that they got a better deal than the supplier wanted? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  So she should be happy for the Department not need to be 
more careful I – so I can give a better deal to the supplier.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So you are saying, irrespective of whether she was 
20 
referring to herself and Dr Savoi or herself and Dr Savoi and Intaka or 
she included the Department or she was meaning herself and the 
Department it was simply wrong, they couldn’t be spoken about as a 
unit, the Department and Intaka or herself and Intaka or Dr Savoi? 
MR WHITE:  Correct because Chair when it comes to maintenance her 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 89 of 212 
 
only interest should have been the Department and what is it going to 
cost the Department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes she should not have been moaning about the fact 
that Intaka – Dr Savoi’s guys didn’t get what they wanted about 
maintenance. 
MR WHITE:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And she seems to have been moaning about that. 
MR WHITE: I agree Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She – the end result of the agreement is in favour of 
her department but she seems to lament that as if she would have been 
10 
happier if the end result was that Intaka got its way which would have 
been the department must be responsible for maintenance and that’s 
not what she should have stood for. 
MR WHITE:  I agree. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And Chair my submission to you is that the 
inference is – it’s inescapable, that the “we” referred to is Peggy 
Nkonyeni and the person she calls doc. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And the reason for that is that after saying I 
couldn’t get the department to pay for maintenance because of what 
20 
was in the bid documents, she ties the statement, next time we’ll have 
to be more careful, with it follows and in the very same sentence she 
says and perhaps you need to cancel the donation since you’re losing 
maintenance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So she regrets that the Department insisted that 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 90 of 212 
 
Intaka must be responsible for maintenance and she wants to 
compensate for that and she says, next time we’ll need to be more 
careful, which seems to suggest, next time there is anything like this 
we must be careful about the bid specifications. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Chair, it can only mean that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because this time – because this time the reason why 
we are ending with this is because the bid specification was clear. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One gets the impression that, that…[intervenes]. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Exactly Chair with respect it can have no 
10 
other meaning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now Chair I can make one point and that is 
that perhaps she’s not quite as magnanimous as it would appear 
because we know that her boyfriend’s company Rowmoor was paid a 
million rand in chanters of R500 0000.00 each and I’d like to ask Mr 
White at this stage, had those payments been made? 
MR WHITE:  They had been made Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How long before, are you able to remember? 
MR WHITE:  So they were made on the 30 t h of August and the 23 r d of 
20 
November, so one payment was some three weeks prior to this and the 
other one was three months prior to this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it would be difficult – if Mr Mkhwanazi was still 
her romantic partner it would be difficult to think that she was not 
aware of those payments three months later. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 91 of 212 
 
MR WHITE:  I agree Chair and she was having ongoing meetings during 
that period with Dr Savoi and Mr Mkhwanazi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Between the payment dates and this date. 
MR WHITE:  Around – before, during and after that period Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Chair maybe I could just refer to a summary of those 
meetings, just the dates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR WHITE:  Chair if I could just refer to that in RR4C at page 1268. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Exhibit RR4C page 1268 yes. 
10 
MR WHITE:  So Chair that’s a summary based on the records from 
Intaka that I could find where meetings were scheduled in Dr Savoi’s 
diary with Ms Nkonyeni or Mr Mkhwanazi.  So Char that summary in 
that table I’ve interpreted where it refers to Peggy to be a reference to 
Ms Peggy Nkonyeni, where it refers to Linde to a reference to Mr 
Mkhwanazi who, in many instances is just referred to as Linde but if 
you look in line seven on the 10 t h of July 2007…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja just read them out all those relevant ones, let’s get 
them into the transcript. 
MR WHITE:  Okay so Chair on the 18 t h of January 20017 there was a 
20 
meeting with Dr Busi Nyembezi and the MEC for Health for Kwa-Zulu 
Natal at our Intaka premises, so that MEC at the time was Ms Peggy 
Nkonyeni.  On the 12 t h of April 2007 …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry again, just to make sure that whoever reads the 
transcript knows this is now Dr – this relates to meetings between Dr 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 92 of 212 
 
Savoi and the people indicated on this page, okay continue. 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair…[intervenes]. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Sorry Chair and it comes from Dr Savoi’s 
electronic diary. 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR WHITE:  So the 12 t h of April 2007 MEC Peggy in CT, which I’ve 
interpreted to be Cape Town. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  The 13 t h of April MEC Peggy in Cape Town, the 4 t h of May 
10 
Peggy and Linde in Cape Town. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR WHITE:  The 7 t h of June 2007 Linde plus MEC Peggy, the 21 s t of 
June 2007 collect Linde and Peggy and then there’s a further reference 
to meeting with Dr Shabir, Linde and Peggy, Dr Shabir was from the 
Northern Cape Department of Health.  On the 10 t h of July – so Chair 
just to put it into the context, the contract for the Oxintaka’s, the bid 
adjudication committee and the final clearance from the appeals that 
was accepted on the 26 t h of June 2007.  So up until line six, the 21 s t of 
June that is before the Oxintaka award is made.  So subsequent to that 
20 
is the period when the Department of Health is trying to negotiate the 
terms with Intaka that led to the signing of the contract on the 13 t h of 
December.   So during that negotiation period there’s now a meeting on 
the 
10 t h 
of 
July 
2007, 
Linde 
and 
MEC 
Peggy 
in 
Cape 
Town…[intervenes]. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 93 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry I just want to take you back to item six at 21 
June 2007 it says 9 o’ clock collect Linde and Peggy do you know 
whether that means collect them from the airport or what? 
MR WHITE:  That’s my understanding Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay continue – that is on 21 June 2007 okay 
continue. 
MR WHITE:  So 10 July 2007 is Linde Mkhwanazi and MEC Peggy on 
the 11 t h of July 2007 Linde MEC Peggy. Chair some three weeks later, 
on the 3 r d of August the first R500 000.00 payment is made to Rowmoor 
Investments. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That’s R600 000.00. 
MR WHITE:  Sorry Chair that’s just a bad photocopy but the original 
one, it’s R500 000.00 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It’s R500 000.00? 
MR WHITE:  It’s R500 000.00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay this was written in the diary? 
MR WHITE:  No Chair this was not in the diary I just put it in amongst 
this…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh for convenience. 
MR WHITE:  So that you can see the dates the payments were made. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  On the 16 t h of August 2007, Peggy Y in Cape Town, 17 t h of 
August Peggy Y in Cape Town…[intervenes]. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  To be fair it says – I would read it as, Peggy Y 
in Cape Town to be confirmed, that’s CONF. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 94 of 212 
 
MR 
WHITE: 
 
Correct 
Chair 
that 
would 
probably 
be 
correct 
interpretation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Then on the 13 t h of August 2007 MEC Peggy Linde in Cape 
Town…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say September, 3 September…[intervenes]. 
MR WHITE:  3 September 2007. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  The 10 October 2007 Linde Y MEC Peggy at Steenberg.  
Chair Steenberg is a hotel in Cape Town, we confirm they stayed at that 
10 
hotel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR WHITE:   8 t h of November 2007 MEC Peggy in Cape Town, some 
two weeks later…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry did you do 14 – from 5 to 6 November 2007 
accommodation at Steenberg Hotel? 
MR WHITE:  That was correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You covered that? 
MR WHITE:  I didn’t read that line out, that was accommodation for Mr 
L Mkhwanazi and Ms O Nkonyeni, then on the 8 t h…[intervenes]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  This one says O, I take it, maybe it’s a mistake or 
what? 
MR WHITE: Chair that is what was in the diary but…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what was in the diary? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 95 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but the only Nkonyeni that’s been referred to is the 
MEC? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmmm okay. 
MR WHITE:  Then there’s a further – I just inserted so that we can see 
the relevance of the dates of the payment, on the 23 r d of November was 
the second payment of R500 000.00 to Rowmoor Investments and then 
Chair there’s no other meetings in Cape Town until the following year 
on the 18 t h of February and that was actually a meeting in Durban and 
then there’s another meeting much later in 2008.  So Chair what I was 
10 
trying to show by that summary is to show that there was, almost 
monthly meetings between…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Between Dr Savoi and the MEC Nkonyeni and Mr 
Linde Mkhwanazi. 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Both before the award of the contract and after? 
MR WHITE:  And after…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And during negotiations? 
MR WHITE:  To the signing of the contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So with this – if this is true then it will be difficult to 
20 
think that Ms Nkonyeni was not aware of the payment to Rowmoor at 
the time of sending the email that we were dealing with earlier on 
where she was lamenting the fact that the Intaka guys, Dr Savoi’s guys 
didn’t get what they wanted in regard to maintenance. 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 96 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you and in the course of your 
investigations Mr White did you find in the records of the Department of 
Health minutes…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are now going back to…[intervenes]. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  No I’m dealing with this still Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I mean the Exhibit are we still dealing with the 
same? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I’m still dealing with page 1268 yes Chair 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, I’d closed it, was it 1268? 
10 
ADV 
SUSAN 
WENTZEL: 
 
Yes 
you 
probably 
don’t 
need 
the…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I don’t need to have a look at it, okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Did you, in the course of your investigations 
find minutes in the records of the Department of Health that referred to 
any of these meetings? 
MR WHITE:  Chair not the ones that Mr Mkhwanazi, according to the 
diary, was also present at, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you ever have access to the MEC’s diary to see 
whether those meetings were also reflected? 
20 
MR WHITE:  Chair I can’t 100% recall at this point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay, okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Can you recall whether or who paid for the 
accommodation at the Steenberg Hotel for the 5 t h and 6 t h of November 
2007 for Ms Nkonyeni and her boyfriend Mr Linde Mkhwanazi? 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 97 of 212 
 
MR WHITE:  Chair to my recollection that was paid for by Intaka. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, what is that? 
MR WHITE:  My recollection it was paid for by Intaka. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that the travelling. 
MR WHITE:  The accommodation Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  The accommodation, the two days at the 
Steenberg Hotel in Cape Town. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay was it paid for by Intaka? 
MR WHITE:  To my recollection, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And then – sorry Chair I am referring back to 
something that follows page 1269…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes we are done – we are not done with that email 
you’ll still go back to is isn’t it? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes I’m going to go back to the email but I 
just want to point out that after – in your report after referring to these 
meetings we go back to where I started your testimony and that was – 
well not your testimony but your testimony on this issue and that was 
with the affidavit by Dr Savoi as to his explanation for these payments 
and just to recap he said that it was for him marketing not this contract 
20 
but the purchase of the water purification plants.  You make the point 
on page 1269 that the marketing and sale took place on and prior to 6 
October 2006.  Rowmoor Investments was only registered on the 26 t h of 
March 2007 and Mkhwanazi was appointed as a Director on the 4 t h of 
May 2007, the same day when he had a meeting with Mazars who are 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 98 of 212 
 
also the auditors of the Intaka Group of companies.  Can you just 
comment and explain and is that correct? 
MR WHITE:  Chair that is correct, this – the company that was formed 
from what I could see was formed by Mazars and they registered Mr 
Mkhwanazi as the Director of the entity and they were the same entity 
that were the auditors of Intaka at the time.  So it appears that the 
setting up of this company had been done at the request of Intaka and 
they’d used their same auditors to form the company for Mr Mkhwanazi. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And then just finally you say, it’s your 
conclusion that you reach on page…[intervenes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry Ms Wentzel so this wasn’t – what happened 
here doesn’t seem to be what happened with Mr Panday’s entities or 
some of them where they were taken out of the shelf or the same might 
have happened here, we don’t know? 
MR WHITE:  Chair I think the same happened because the company 
was registered on the 26 t h of March but Mr Mkhwanazi was only made a 
Director on the 4 t h of May. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but same year 2007? 
MR WHITE:  Same year Chair but some – more than a month later.  If 
he was – if it was registered and he was the first Director, I would have 
20 
expected it to be the same date. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And then finally you say that he was 
appointed a Director on the 4 t h of May which is the same day when he 
had a meeting with Mazars who are also the auditors of the Intaka 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 99 of 212 
 
Group of companies but then you say this, 
 
“It appears from the electronic diary of Savoi and from the 
 
information provided by Rennies Travel that Mkhwanazi 
 
together with Nkonyeni also attended a meeting with Dr Savoi 
 
in Cape Town on the 4 t h of May 2007”, 
 
Is that correct? 
MR WHITE:  That’s correct Chair.  So Chair that was referred to at line 
4 in that table above that I’d previously – one of the lines I’d read the 
date out of. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you and now if we can go back to 
10 
Bundle D…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON: Is that the email, are you going back to the email? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   I’m not going back to the email I’m going 
back to another document to tell – there’s more in the story. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I want us to finalise the email let’s not leave it 
for – let’s go back to the email at page 673 of RR4B. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Are you 673? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  The SMS? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The SMS – oh I thought it was the email ja, SMS. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that what you wanted to go to? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I was going to go to a further document later 
but let’s go back to the email. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let’s finish this ja. Mr White that SMS at page 673 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 100 of 212 
 
from the MEC to Dr Savoi is your understanding that when she says, 
that is the MEC, perhaps you need to cancel the donation since you are 
losing on maintenance, well I think it’s clear it looks like she wants to – 
she’s thinking of how maybe this could be made up, how Intaka could 
be compensated for losing on maintenance. 
MR WHITE:  I agree Chair 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say you don’t know what this reference to the 
donation was about, what that was about and you never found anything 
that threw light on what it was about? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  We know that yesterday you said that Dr Savoi said 
that the R1million and something that was paid to Kuboni & Shezi 
Attorneys was a donation.  If you look at – I don’t know have you 
thought about the dates when that payment was made – when this was 
made this SMS was made is there any possibility that it could be 
referring to that donation? 
MR WHITE:  So Char that other donation was made on the 12 t h of 
March 2007 so it’s some nine months prior to…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it had already been made so it could not be 
cancelled? 
20 
MR WHITE:   I don’t believe it’s referring to the same thing Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja because the cancellation of a donation must be 
referring – if it is a reference to a donation to a donation that had been 
discussed and it was contemplated was still to be made. 
MR WHITE:  That was my interpretation Chair. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 101 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja to say I said I would give a donation but maybe 
you should change your mind about that, that’s what…[intervenes]. 
MR WHITE:  That was my interpretation Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So as you understand the – this SMS it could not – 
with your reference to the donation could not be a reference to that 
R1milloin donation that we talked about yesterday – you talked about 
yesterday?  It could also not have referred to the two payments that 
were made to Rowmoor because those were not donations according to 
Dr Savoi, that was payment for services rendered by Rowmoor as far as 
marketing services – as far as he was concerned. 
10 
MR WHITE:    That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it remains a mystery what the reference to 
donations is a reference to other than that there may have been some 
prior discussion about a donation and that’s what she might be 
referring to. 
MR WHITE:  I agree Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And Chair one must bear in mind with respect 
the affidavit of Dr Savoi where he readily admits that he paid in the 
contract with the Department of Traditional Affairs and Local 
20 
Government a donation of R1million to the ANC as a quid pro quo for 
getting that contract and when one remembers that – because he says I 
was told, what I have to do is get the donation and after the contract 
was concluded he writes to Mr Tshabalala and says, now I need to pay 
the donation and he says he then pays the donation and he’s told to 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 102 of 212 
 
pay it into Kuboni & Shezi Attorney’s Trust account which then 
happens.  Now that’s on the version of Dr Savoi.  When you read that, 
here, although there isn’t evidence, in my view it is implicit that a 
similar donation had been requested in this instance but Ms Nkonyeni 
is saying, look I know you haven’t done as well as you thought you 
would you don’t have to pay the donation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well there may be parts of what’s in the Exhibit that 
were not referred to yesterday, I don’t remember hearing or reading 
something to the effect that Dr Savoi said the donation was a quid pro 
quo for him getting the contract, I don’t remember that but you have 
10 
read more in the bundle than what I have read, maybe you are telling 
me what you read but which wasn’t covered yesterday. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Chair it was covered yesterday but 
perhaps after…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We can go back to it at some stage but I do seem to 
have seen something in Ms – in Dr Savoi’s affidavit to the effect that 
something like, I was made to understand this is how business is done 
or something like that. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I don’t know – I can’t remember whether it was in 
20 
relation to that or it was something else. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes it was in relation to that. 
CHAIRPERSON: Yes, okay alright.  Well the other part you mentioned, 
namely whether this was – this may have been a similar donation that’s 
just speculation. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 103 of 212 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  It’s speculation – yes it’s speculation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We have gone past 1 o’clock. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes perhaps it’s a convenient time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How far are we from finishing with Mr White? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I think about 45 minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay, we’ll take the lunch adjournment now, it’s 
five past one, we’ll resume at five past two, we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
10 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Mr White. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to summarise at least part of the evidence in 
relation to the Department of Health and these two contracts.   
In regard to the – what is it called Wataka? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Wataka I am sure I am getting it wrong.  In regard to 
20 
that one there was no tender at all – competitive tender at all.  Is that 
right? 
MR WHITE:  That is correct Chair that is the one where there was three 
quotations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There were just three quotations that were actually – 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 104 of 212 
 
the entities from which they were obtained were provided by somebody 
who would – was supposed to compete with them? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is Intaka. 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They supply to the Head of Department Doctor 
Nyembezi and then she passed them on to Supply Chain Management. 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Supply Chain Management said they obtained 
them.  And  
10 
1. There was no need for this purchase at all in regard to the two 
hospitals because the water had no problem? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is a questionable transaction to say the least 
because there is no – there seems to be no need for it.  There is a 
team or a person – a health professional within the department who 
wrote a report after inspecting the water and said the water is not 
contaminated.  But that was – that is disregarded and a memorandum is 
or email is written to say, there is an urgent need for – for this plant in 
the two hospitals and ultimately the purchase happens and then with 
20 
regard to the Oxintaka then an impression is created or rather a tender 
process seems to be followed but the entity that had been given that 
had benefitted from the first project in regard to the two hospitals is 
given the right opportunity to specify or amend specifications to suit 
their bid and ultimately they get awarded this.  But at some stage there 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 105 of 212 
 
is a payment – there are two payments of about – is it 600 – R500 each 
– R500 000.00 each? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the romantic partner of the MEC of the same 
department and in terms of your investigation you find out that Doctor 
Savoi’s electronic diary reflects that he had a number of interactions or 
meetings or contacts with them or they were a number of meetings or 
contacts that were planned in terms of the diary.  And you say you 
found that at least on two occasions when the MEC of the department 
and her romantic partner stay at a hotel in Cape Town that is paid for 
10 
by Intaka, is that correct? 
MR WHITE:  Just one occasion Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one occasion that is paid for by Intaka.  The 
others did you check or you did not check? 
MR WHITE:  We did not check because the diaries did not record 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  That it was an overnight stay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  So – so then there is this sms from the 
MEC to Doctor Savoi of Intaka a few hours after the signing of the 
contract in regard to the Oxy plant – Oxintaka, Oxintaka and it seems 
20 
to indicate that she is more concerned about the fact that Intaka did not 
get its way in terms of the maintenance of the plant.  And she says 
something like we will have to more careful in the future and then she 
says, maybe you should cancel the donation.  So that is a summary of 
part of what we dealt with before lunch. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 106 of 212 
 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Now Mr White returning to 
the body of your affidavit Annexure RR4 and page 43. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say page 43? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Pursuant to your investigations is it correct 
that you prepared nine separate reports? 
MR WHITE:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And are those the reports that are listed in 
paragraph 56 and Annex mark – annexed to your affidavit marked 
Annexure TSW7 all the way through to TSW16? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair.  There was nine reports and one affidavit 
prepared. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now some of these reports Chair deal with 
corruption investigated with regard to procurement irregularities with 
the same contractor in the Northern – in the Northern Cape. 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair just so that you understand I have not 
20 
dealt with any of that procurement irregularity because it was felt it 
falls beyond the Terms of Reference because there is no evidence of 
political interference or interference in the National Prosecuting 
Authority with prosecutions pursuant to those investigations.  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it not corruption? 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 107 of 212 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes it was – it was corruption but in terms of 
the brief that I have here and the evidence I am now presenting on the 
behalf of Law – the State Capture of Law Enforcement Agencies I have 
not dealt with that in detail.  I just would like the witness just to give 
you a broad outline of what those investigations entailed.  But I do not 
propose dealing with them in the same detail as I have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well depending you know it is not as if we only deal 
with corruption, fraud that involves politicians and corruption and fraud 
that does not involve corruptions we do not deal with. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So… 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  No, no that was not the point. What I was 
saying is that this – this evidence is focussed as was with regard to the 
Panday matter and with regard to the Intaka matter with the subsequent 
interference by the NPA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The NPA oh – you – in regard to the other one you 
say there is complaint that the NPA did not do. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Their job. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  It might be something that needs to be 
investigated later but not at this stage with this witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  In this… 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 108 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine let me hear about and have an idea. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And let us take it from there.  
MR WHITE:  So Chair the – the processes followed in the Northern 
Cape by the Department of Health were very similar to what happened 
in KZN. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  Only difference was the officials in the Northern Cape 
were different and instead of the MEC being involved Mr John Block 
was the contact of Intaka and the person who directed what was to 
10 
happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  And he was a person who received benefits directly from 
Intaka. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  So that was the significant difference.   
CHAIRPERSON:  hm. 
MR WHITE:  The other – so just – it was again the Water Purification 
Plants and the Oxintaka plants purchased by the Department of Health. 
Chair again with regards to the Water Purification Plants there was no 
20 
need. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  They created a need. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  They purchased 10 Water Purification Plants. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 109 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  For installation at 10 different hospitals. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  Throughout the Northern Cape. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  Chair I went with the investigating officers in that matter 
to each of the 10 hospitals in the Northern Cape when we were doing 
the investigation and not one of the 10 plants was in operation.  So 
again there was no need. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR WHITE:  So Chair what they had done was they had installed these 
plants and had just diverted the municipal water supply through the 
plant in effectively a U and back in – back to the hospital.  When the 
plant … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So as if they were providing water that would have 
gone there anyway. 
MR WHITE:  Chair it went through this plant in theory to be purified.  
When the hospital either could not afford the chemicals or for some 
maintenance reason the plant broke down they just turned the taps that 
diverted the water to these plants back to the original direction and 
20 
they just bypassed the plant straight to the hospital with no detrimental 
effect to any of the patients or the people in the hospital.  And Chair 
just to show ridiculous it was in one of the instances they actually 
installed one of these plants at a hospital that was busy relocating to a 
different premises.  They installed it while the relocation was taking 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 110 of 212 
 
place and by the time the installation was complete the hospital had 
relocated to a new building.  So it was never even switched on.  So that 
is the extent that there was never a need. So that is regarding the 
Water Purification Plants.  There was also issues around… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry what were the prices there compared to 
the prices paid by the – by KZN departments? 
MR WHITE:  Chair I would have to check but they were – they were 
closer to what the Department of Health paid than to what local 
government paid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
MR WHITE:  So they were again significant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  Chair what – what then also happened was they used 
these cover quotes.  So those two gentlemen that pleaded guilty in 
terms of their plea in KZN also pleaded guilty in the Northern Cape 
courts.  But Chair those – in some instances those quotes there was 
examples again of emails etcetera printed out, maintained where Mr 
Block was liaising with Doctor Savoi saying he needed three quotes.  
The person In Supply Chain was being difficult. Doctor Savoi replied, I 
will arrange the three quotes.  Intaka then in their own records have 
20 
got copies of the three quotes as well as copy of the courier waybill 
that couriered those quotes to Doctor – sorry to Mr Block’s house. The 
following week those three quotes exactly the same ones appeared at 
the Northern Cape Tender Board and Intaka was appointed.  So it just 
shows the level of interference in the procurement process and what 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 111 of 212 
 
was happening.  Chair there was also 16 dialysis machines purchased.  
They were distributed across various hospitals in the Northern Cape. A 
number of them went to hospitals that did not have that unit in it and as 
a result there was no-one to operate them.  And Chair … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  You mean they did not have a kidney unit? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair.  Apparently the idea was they were going to 
establish one but the required nurses and medical practitioners had not 
been appointed.  Some eighteen months later when we were doing this 
investigation I took photographs of seven of those sixteen machines 
still in their original packaging standing in the corridors of these 
10 
different clinics.  They were not – they just were not operational.  So 
again purchased at inflated prices.  Again there was cover quotes not 
using the same people as the Watakas but other entities and as a result 
creating a need where there was a desperate need for this kind of 
equipment but at the hospitals they dispersed them to.  Those were 
then all subsequently transferred to the Kimberly Hospital.  But years 
later only as a result of when the investigations were taking place.  So 
Chair that process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is just the summary. 
MR WHITE:  At a high level Chair but because of the legal process that 
20 
– and challenges that were happening in KZN there was a decision that 
the cases in the Northern Cape would be prosecuted after the cases in 
KZN.  So those cases are waiting for progress in KZN and as a result 
nothing from a court perspective has – has happened on those cases 
yet either.  Although people were arrested, they are out on bail, charge 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 112 of 212 
 
sheets were drawn up, it is now just waiting for the legal process in 
KZN to proceed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So Mr Block’s criminal trial was not connected with 
the same thing? 
MR WHITE:  No Chair the case that Mr Block was convicted on related 
to the procurement of renting of facilities for different departments in 
the Northern Cape and his involvement in that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay so – so – but you have got that report here 
or relating to Northern Cape or not really? 
MR WHITE:  Chair they all attached to my affidavit. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  So this morning we just referred to two – the two that 
related to KZN. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  All the balance of those are also attached. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Well I – I want us to have that.  But what you 
have told me is already under oath in your affidavit in regard to that 
matter? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it is in the reports that you are talking about and 
20 
you confirm that you stand what is in the reports and in the affidavit? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair; 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  No I think what we need to do is you do 
need to study the reports relating to Northern Cape and the affidavit 
and they need to be identified.  I would like to have a look at them as 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 113 of 212 
 
well.   It may or may not be that we might ask you to come back and 
deal with them in more detail but there might not be a need.  It may be 
that the way forward might be to give the relevant people implicated 
persons, people implicated in your affidavit and in your report an 
opportunity to respond to it and we take it from there.  Because the – 
even a lot of that you are testifying about is really in your reports today 
and here in the past few days.  So – so if we would like you to come 
back we certainly will ask you.  But I know that we are not done.  I 
think Ms Wentzel has not – is not done yet with you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
10 
MR WHITE:  But thank you for that picture that you gave me about what 
happened in the Northern Cape. 
MR WHITE:  Thank you Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  So Mr White it is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just think – I am sorry – I just think that it would not 
be right to tell the story involving Intaka in KZN without saying that 
appears that they did the same thing in North – in the Northern Cape.  
Even if in terms of the Northern Cape there might not have been any 
challenges in the prosecution but for a complete picture that may be 
important.  Because even with a trial in regard to KZN the criminal trial 
20 
it may be important for – there may be references to what Intaka is 
alleged to have done in the Northern Cape. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So there is some… 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Interconnection. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 114 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Important connection ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Chair and I will spend some time with Mr 
White and investigate those more fully as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay alright. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Mr White it is correct that a number of 
persons were implicated in your reports were arrested on preliminary 
charge sheets and a final indictment was issued and filed in the 
KwaZulu Natal high court and it is annexed your affidavit as Annexure 
10 
TSW17 and Chair that is in RR1d for dog and it appears at page 1867. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  How many accused were there? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair there were 23 accused of which 18 were natural 
persons. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And who were the natural persons? 
MR WHITE:  Chair if I could just refer to the document at 1867?  The 
accused are listed as Gaston Savoi, Sipho Derrick Tshabalala, Busisiwe 
Muriel Nyembezi, Peggy Yliswa Nkonyeni, Victor Ntshangase. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So there – I think that is where that Y comes from.  I 
20 
did not understand where the Y came from in Doctor Savoi’s diary 
where it says, Peggy Y.  So it must be coming from Yliswa. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR WHITE:  Victor Ntshangase, Alson Sipho Ribeane Buthelezi, Ronald 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 115 of 212 
 
Winston Green Thompson, Yliswa Lulama Mbele, Fernando Predari, 
Annsano Romane, Donald Keith Miller, Sindile Kuboni, Michael 
Mabuyakhulu, Beatrice Nthombenhle Tshabalala,   Lindelihle Mhkanazi, 
Nozibele Priscilla Phindela, Jabujlani Langahle Thusa, Ian – Chair I 
definitely need some help with the gentleman’s second name, 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ian Buhlemake, Ian Buhlemake Blose. 
MR WHITE:  And it is the entities linked to Intaka.  Intaka Holdings PTY 
Limited. There is Rowmoor Investments 738 PTY Limited.  Mr 
Mkhwanazi’s entity.  Skyross Medical Supplies PTY Limited entity 
linked to Mr Tshabalala.  Kuboni and Shezi Attorneys and Blue Serenity 
10 
Investments PTY Limited an entity linked to Beatrice Tshabalala the 
wife of Mr Tshabalala.  So Chair that – that indictment has some 54 
charges.  It related to racketeering, fraud, corruption, money 
laundering and PFMA charges. Chair that indictment took a long time to 
be prepared.  There were lots of consultations and when I say lots I 
just cannot even remember how many meetings there were.  This 
investigation the prosecutors which changed a number of times were 
involved right from the very beginning.  So it was a joint effort.  There 
was the police, PWC assisting the police, representatives from National 
Treasury as well representatives from the NPA.  So we worked together 
20 
and ultimately presented the evidence and the prosecution team drew 
up the indictment.  While – so this was the – the end result effectively 
but Chair that was only finalised after the - for want of a better word 
the racketeering certificate had been issued by the NDPP.  Because 
this was included racketeering charges and you could only have 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 116 of 212 
 
racketeering charges if the NDPP had authorised it.  And that 
certificate is at TSW18 on page 1945 in the same file. So directly after 
that.  And that certificate is the one that refers to exactly the same 
charges that is in that indictment and that was signed by the NDPP on 
the 31 July 2011.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Then Mr White Annexure TSW20 is the plea 
deal in terms of which the two entities Mbusa and Westpro produced 
cover quotes to assist Savoi which was referred to by you earlier in 
your evidence.  Is that correct? 
MR WHITE:  So that is correct Chair. So after this indictment had been 
10 
finalised two of – those two entities that did the cover quotes their 
representatives, legal representatives negotiated a plea bargain with 
the state.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Then Mr White if we can go to paragraph 68 
on page 49 of your affidavit?  You say that after extensive work 
between your, the investigators and prosecutors at the NPA charges 
were drawn up. A racketeering certificate issued.  What happened on 
the 19 March 2012? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair on the 19 March 2012 which is some eight 
months after the racketeering certificate had been issued I received an 
20 
email from Advocate Dunywa he was the lead prosecutor in the matter 
for KZN and he invited me to attend a meeting on the 2 March 2012 at 
the NPA offices in Durban at ten o’clock.  I attended that meeting 
together… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I just want to make sure I understand 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 117 of 212 
 
this.  When you say he was the lead prosecutor did that relate to the 
two contracts relating to the Department of Health only or did it also 
relate to the matter involving Intaka that we dealt with yesterday 
relating to the Department of Traditional Affairs and Local Government 
and the donation?  Or was it all of these put together? 
MR WHITE:  It related to both Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To – to both yes the Department of Local Government, 
Traditional Affairs as well as Department of Health? 
MR WHITE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.   
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now  
MR WHITE:  So Chair if – just – sorry.  Just to go back.  If one looked 
at the indictment and the racketeering certificate it included both.  It 
was going to be one trial Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair just maybe the only split was going to be made 
between KZN and the Northern Cape.  They were going to be tried 
separately 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  And the reason there was lots of discussion about 
20 
centralising everything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  But then it was going to be in excess of 50 accused. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  And it felt it was going to become unmanageable. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 118 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Okay.  Now you referred to the email that you 
received to attend the meeting.  That is Annexure TSW22 and Chair it 
appears in bundle Exhibit RR4 at page 1980. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on has he completed paragraph 68?  He got an 
email inviting him to a meeting on 23 March 2012 with the NPA at ten 
am in Durban. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I am going to deal with it now with reference 
10 
to the actual email. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  The email Chair is found in bundle D for dog.  
It is at page 1980. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do I need to go to it? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair you can listen to the evidence it is not 
necessary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  If you could just perhaps read for the Chair 
what… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well - well if it needs to be read.  It probably needs 
me to see it. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Okay. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 119 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  It might just be a one liner. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  No.  I think it is important what - what he is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the page again? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  It is page 1-9-8-0 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1-9-8-0.  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  If you could just deal with this email please. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair that is a - a hard copy of the email that I 
received.  You can see at the top of the page it is addressed to 
Du Plooy P J, Lieutenant-Colonel and to Trevor White - being myself 
and Clarence Jones who was also involved in investigations, but not on 
10 
- not in this specific matter and it is Cc’d … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was - was he a member of your team? 
MR WHITE:  He was not Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  It is then Cc’d to Cyril S Mlotshwa who was who was the 
Acting DPP at the time and it is an invitation to an NPA - an 
investigating team meeting on 23 March 2012 at 10 o’ clock and it was 
in the Southern Life Building and just the part that is relevant to myself 
Chair.  It says: 
“This serves to inform you that you are invited to 
20 
the above mentioned meeting to be held on Friday 
23 March which will be attended by the National 
Head of SCCU and the National Head of the 
Organised Crime Unit of the NPA.” 
Chair, I found out afterwards when I attended the meeting 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 120 of 212 
 
that 
the 
National 
Head 
of 
the 
SCCU 
is 
- 
was 
Advocate Lawrence Mrwebi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Or the National Head of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mrwebi. 
MR WHITE:  Mrwebi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mrwebi.  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  The National Head of the Organised Crime Unit was 
Advocate Anthony Mosing. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  What were you asked to bring to the meeting? 
10 
MR WHITE: 
 
So 
Chair, 
the 
first 
point 
relates 
to 
Lieutenant 
Colonel Du Plooy and then the second point which says: 
“A forensic investigator Mr White is requested to 
prepare the following:  a, Busisiwe Nyembezi’s 
companies’ flow of funds; b, Rowmoor flow - funds 
flow analysis and c, Intaka flow of funds.” 
Chair that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where is that part of what you should bring?  Oh. 
MR WHITE:  It is in the middle almost opposite … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is requested to prepare the following.  Oh, okay.  Now 
20 
I see it.  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And was Colonel Du Plooy the investigating 
officer? 
MR WHITE:  That is correct Chair.  So Chair, what I was requested to - 
to bring it actually made no sense to me what I was supposed to do.  I 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 121 of 212 
 
did not know the purpose of the meeting.  There was no such thing as a 
flow of funds for Dr Nyembezi’s companies.  I did not know what was 
meant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  The Rowmoor flow of funds was just the two payments of 
R500 000,00 each.  So that - and then the Intaka flow of funds I was 
not quite sure what they meant, but that diagram I have referred to at 
TSW19 effectively showed at a high level.  So I had that, but it was not 
- apart from that I did not know what else was required. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Did you then attend this meeting? 
10 
MR WHITE:  I did Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what happened? 
MR WHITE:  And I refer to it - page 50 of my affidavit in RR4 Chair at 
paragraph 70 going onwards.  Chair when - I recall the meeting very 
clearly, because it was a very unusual meeting.  It was a very hot day 
in March in Durban and the only reason I recall that is that there was 
problems with the air conditioning in the building and as a result they 
could not find a room where there was air conditioning or it was cool 
enough and as a result the meeting started 20 minutes late. 
I very clearly recall that.  When the meeting started I refer to 
20 
it at paragraph 71.  Advocate Dunywa - the lead prosecutor in the 
matter.  Advocate Vimbani - the Head of the SCCU in Durban and 
Advocate Mthembu who was Advocate Dunywa’s junior in the matter 
were present.  As well as Advocates Mrwebi and Mosing who I was 
introduced to at the meeting and Lieutenant-Colonel Du Plooy and 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 122 of 212 
 
Colonel Jones were also present. 
Chair, once that meeting started it became very clear to me 
that Advocate Dunywa was almost a spectator to the meeting.  Even 
although he was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was almost? 
MR WHITE:  A spectator … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  In the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  Even though he was the lead prosecutor. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  He was just effective … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was not active? 
MR WHITE:  Active.  He was just sitting in the meeting … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  And Advocates Mrwebi and Mosing … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  Were running the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  Chair, when the meeting started Advocate Mrwebi informed 
20 
us that a decision had been made to withdraw the charges against 
Mr Mabuyakhulu and they just wanted to know what evidence there was 
against Ms Nkonyeni as they were considering withdrawing the charges 
against her as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But was that not a - a strange question, because if 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 123 of 212 
 
they 
had 
already 
decided 
to 
withdraw 
the 
charges 
against 
Mr Mabuyakhulu.  One would have expected that they would have read 
the whole - your report to say the least and - and all relevant affidavits 
to get a full picture of the whole case. 
MR WHITE:  Chair that was what I thought. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  So I - this was a first for me in all the years I had been 
investigating matters of this nature and dealing with police and 
prosecutors.  I had never come across this situation where on one of 
the accused the decision is already made and now they asking what 
10 
evidence is there. 
I would have thought they would either be asking for a very 
detailed briefing or they would have already looked at all the evidence 
and would have specific queries about what was said.  Chair, taking in - 
into account … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So with regard to Mr Mabuyakhulu effectively they 
were saying we are not here to consult you about whether that decision 
should - 
we 
should 
withdraw 
all 
the - 
the 
charges 
against 
Mr Mabuyakhulu.  They are saying that decision has been taken.  The 
only person we - we want to engage you on is Ms Nkonyeni.  Tell us 
20 
what evidence there is against her. 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair, this is after numerous people in the NPA have 
come to the conclusion there is cases against these people.  There has 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 124 of 212 
 
been lots of presentations to senior members of the NPA at the VGM 
Building in Pretoria and a racketeering certificate has been issued.  
The matter is before the High Court. 
Judge McLaren had been allocated as the - as a Retired 
Judge to hear the matter, because it was going to - they thought it was 
going to take quite some time.  So that was where it was at.  We asked 
this question.  Myself and - and Lieutenant-Colonel Du Plooy and they 
said regardless of what has happened to date there is no evidence 
against Mabuyakhulu in their view and we must not waste their time 
with this and we must just deal with Nkonyeni.  So Chair … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Did - did anybody - did you or Lieutenant 
Colonel Du Plooy or anybody seek to engage them on their decision on 
Mr Mabuyakhulu?  In other words how did they come to say what you 
say they said?  Was it because somebody said hang on.  How can you 
make that decision about Mr Mabuyakhulu, because of - because there 
is evidence or anything like that? 
MR WHITE:  Chair we did … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  And that is where they said we must not waste their time.  
That decision is already made and we have only got an hour for this 
20 
meeting and you have already wasted 20 minutes which was not - we 
did not waste it.  They could not find a room and we only had till 11 o’ 
clock to finalise the discussions on Nkonyeni. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And how - before you proceed with the meeting.  How 
did you receive this news that one, the decision - a decision had 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 125 of 212 
 
already been taken to withdraw the decision to - to withdraw charges 
against Mabuyakhulu and two that the people were telling you about 
that decision to withdraw the charges did not seem to have time to hear 
from you and yet you are - you had spent a lot of time obviously at 
state expense to do an extensive investigation on these matters. 
MR WHITE:  Chair, I got the distinct impression that they were just 
going through a formality of - of being able to say we consulted with 
the investigators.  They actually did not care what we had to say, 
because one, what I then said to them was if we are going to do this 
properly I need three days of time. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  I need to bring all the reports.  All the annexures and I 
need three days and I will work through it with you systematically.  
Almost as if we are going to court to explain the evidence and show 
them the documents etcetera and I said I need three days and they said 
we do not want this to be a long drawn out process. 
We need to finalise our decision today and you have got to 11 
o’ clock.  Basically get on with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Coincidentally you have taken about three days to - 
to take me through the … 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The - the matter. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair, I - I did do Mr Panday.  So that would have been 
separate to this.  So that may have been there, but Chair if - if a 
decision is going to be made to withdraw against people where they are 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 126 of 212 
 
already before court.  There is an indictment for racketeering which is 
not issued very easily by the NPA and not very often. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  You are not going to make a decision in less than an hour 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  To withdraw.  Chair, it just felt like … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  They had already made up their mind and this was a 
formality … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  And Chair, it felt like they actually did not care what the 
evidence was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  They wanted to finish and leave. 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you say Advocate Dunywa was very quiet in the 
meeting? 
MR WHITE:  Chair, he - to my recollection he said almost nothing.  So 
they … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And was he one of the NPA prosecutors or people who 
20 
may have previous said there is a case here? 
MR WHITE:  Chair, he was the person that was instrumental in drafting 
the indictment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  So he had been part of this case - I cannot remember for 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 127 of 212 
 
how long, but it must have been almost a year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  So he drew up that indictment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  He did the presentations to his superiors in Pretoria. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  He appeared in court when the people were arrested and 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  And he was going to prosecute the matter in the High 
10 
Court. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So his - his view as far as you knew was quite clear.  
There was a case to - to prosecute? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair, but I got the impression that the 
prosecution team had been told to just … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  Be present, but not to be involved in the discussion … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR WHITE:  And Chair the - it - it goes further.  When he ultimately 
withdraw the charges in court - Advocate Dunywa.  He made a very 
specific point of saying I am withdrawing these - these charges on 
instruction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 128 of 212 
 
MR WHITE:  He told me he did that on purpose, because it was not his 
view. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was not his view.  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  He only did it on instruction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  It sounded strange at the time, but that is what he said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it does not strange to me.  You know very often 
lawyers have a way of putting things when they want to disassociate 
themselves from it.  So I - has Advocate Dunywa being interviewed?  Is 
he going to be called? 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair, I am not sure if he has been 
interviewed, but Advocate Mlotshwa is going to testify today.  He is also 
involved. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
No. 
 
Will 
- 
will 
you 
please 
get 
hold 
of 
Advocate Dunywa? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  I will. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He needs to be interviewed if he has not been 
interviewed.  He could throw a lot of … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Light. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  He could. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On how that decision came about … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And - so that we - in due course we could have his 
evidence. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 129 of 212 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I will arrange that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now when you were told that you had 
essentially 40 minutes to address which has taken a few days in this 
court.  What did you and Lieutenant-Colonel Du Plooy say and do? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I miss - I missed that question.  Is it after 
the meeting or is it still on the meeting? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  When they were told they had … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. Still in the meeting? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Essentially they had 40 minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  To address them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  What did you do?  What did you and 
Colonel Du Plooy do? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair, Colonel Du Plooy was also particularly irritated.  
I mean this was a matter we had worked on for years and he made the 
rather abrupt statement to say to Advocate Mrwebi you send us your 
20 
decisions in writing.  The police are not part of this process.  We are 
not going to be party to a whitewash to withdraw these charges by 
saying you consulted us. 
You just tell us what your answer is, but Chair what we then 
did was in the time available as best we could we tried to explain at a 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 130 of 212 
 
very high level.  They were not interested in seeing documents.  So you 
can see just from what we have done for the last day and a half on this 
you need to understand the detail and the process. 
So they were not interested in the detail.  They wanted to 
know at a high level.  So Chair, we - we did what we - what we could. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  What happened when the hour had elapsed? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  This was now in regard to Ms Nkonyeni, 
because they said about Ms - Mr Mabuyakhulu you must not waste their 
time.  The decision has been made. 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  What happened when the hour had elapsed? 
MR WHITE:  Chair, they said thank you for attending the meeting and 
they left. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But tell me more about what you said to them if you 
are able to. 
MR WHITE:  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said you did the best you could do within the time 
available.  Do you remember what - what you said or is it …? 
MR WHITE:  Chair to my - my … (intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  What points you made? 
MR WHITE:  Chair, I - I did not make notes.  It is some eight years ago 
or so, but to the best of my recollection.  We had a high level try to 
explain that what I explained just before - before - this morning.  Was 
that the link of the - of the two payments of R500 000,00 we believed 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 131 of 212 
 
as an investigating team were linked to Ms Nkonyeni via Mr Mkhwanazi. 
 
That there was no evidence that those payments related to the 
Watakas, but in fact were paid during the period that she was 
influencing the signing of the contract and putting pressure on - on 
officials in the department to sign the contract with Intaka for Oxintakas 
and then we also referred to that - that SMS that she sent to Dr Savoi 
which I have referred to just before, because that was a crucial 
reference just showing her involvement in the process and - and where 
her loyalties lay, but Chair that was - you know they - they did not 
really - they were not really interested in seeing how it all fitted 
10 
together. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what was their response after you had told them 
what you could tell them within that time? 
MR WHITE:  They said they would make their decision.  They did not - 
they did not tell us what their decision was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  They said they would make it.  So it is like they 
would make it later. 
MR WHITE:  That was my impression Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That - that was your impression and then they closed 
the meeting? 
20 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So they in fact did not give you any more time 
beyond that hour? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 132 of 212 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  What happened after that? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair, following that I had a - a meeting on 2 May 2012 
with Advocate Dunywa and following that meeting I sent her an email 
which is at TSW23. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it a lady? 
MR WHITE:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say “her”?  Was it a lady?  I thought it was a 
man - a man?  Dunywa - Advocate Dunywa. 
MR WHITE:  Dunywa.  It is - it is a man Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is man.  Oh.  Okay.  I thought you said her. 
10 
MR WHITE:  No sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought maybe I heard you used the wrong - ja.  
Okay. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair the email I wrote following that meeting is on 
page 1-9-8-2 in Bundle RR4D. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Chair, maybe if I could - so Chair if I could just maybe 
read the email and I will you … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  You can read it.  That is an email from you to 
Advocate Dunywa? 
20 
MR WHITE:  No Chair.  This is an email from me to Freeman Nomvalo 
who was the Accountant-General from National Treasury. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay.  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  Who was - who was the contracting party with PWC.  He 
was paying our fees effectively. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 133 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  He was your client? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  He was my client, but I was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  Working under the direction of the police. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  This was on the same day? 
MR WHITE:  Same day as the follow up meeting … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR WHITE:  With Advocate Dunywa.  2 May 2012 and I say: 
“Dear Freeman, I met with the prosecutors in the 
Intake case this morning.  They informed me that to 
date no charges have formally - have been formally 
withdrawn from any of the …” 
(Loud background noise) 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I think I am - we may have just spoken at 
cross purposes just now.  When I said you sent this email on the same 
day I meant on the same day as the day when you met Mr Mrwebi and 
Mr Mosing? 
20 
MR WHITE:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is not true? 
MR WHITE:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You had a meeting with Advocate Dunywa at some 
stage and this was on the same day? 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 134 of 212 
 
MR WHITE:  This email - so that meeting was on 2 May … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  And following that meeting with Advocate Dunywa I sent 
this email … 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the same day? 
MR WHITE:  On the same day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  Well is there something to tell me 
about your meeting with Advocate Dunywa on 2 May … 
MR WHITE:  So he picked … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or is it contained here? 
10 
MR WHITE:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there something for you to tell me about your 
meeting with Advocate Dunywa on 2 May or is it captured in this email 
to … 
MR WHITE:  Chair, it is captured in the email Chair, but - but maybe 
the important aspect … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I would like to hear what … 
MR WHITE:  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The discussion was, because that would have been I 
guess the first meeting with him after your meeting with Mr Mrwebi and 
20 
Mr Mosing. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair what - what happened was he informed me that 
the Acting DPP in KZN at the time - Advocate Mlotshwa - was 
challenging the decision that had come out from Advocate Mrwebi to 
withdraw the charges against Nkonyeni and Mabuyakhulu and he 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 135 of 212 
 
informed me that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  By then - by then they had withdrawn the charges 
against - they had decided to withdraw the charges against 
Ms Nkonyeni as well by the time of 2 May of the meeting. 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  So the decision had been made … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  But they had not been formally withdrawn … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yoh.  Okay.  In court? 
10 
MR WHITE:  Because the - the DPP in KZN had said … 
CHAIRPERSON:  What …? 
MR WHITE:  He is not going to withdraw the charges. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Huh-uh. 
MR WHITE:  Because he felt there was a case … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  And he said if they wanted to withdraw the charges … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  The NDPP must take his decision on review … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh.  Hm. 
20 
MR WHITE:  And he said it - they must follow the formal process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  So - so he - what he said was that to date at that date the 
charges have not been withdrawn … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 136 of 212 
 
MR WHITE:  Because the DPP is - is pushing back and challenging the 
decision … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  And that it needed to go - to go on review. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair that was on the 2 n d … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I guess that is what - that meant was that the 
NDPP would need to review the decision to charge the two in terms of 
the National Prosecuting Authority Act.  I think that is the review they 
may have been talking about … 
10 
MR WHITE:  That is my understanding Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or to - or to review the decision to withdraw, but in 
terms of that Act. 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair and - and my understanding was that 
Advocate Mlotshwa - the DPP - wanted the process to be done formally 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  And the reason for that was he believed there was a case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  He had signed all the original warrants of arrest personally 
20 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Himself … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  And he said if you now decide to withdraw the charges … 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 137 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  Follow a formal process … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  And then come to that decision … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  But he was not prepared to just withdraw the charges … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  Because Advocate Mrwebi told him to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair that was on 2 May 2012. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then you sent this email to the Accountant-General 
on the same day. 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair.  Just to update him on - on the status of 
what was happening, because everybody wanted to know what was 
happening with this matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL: 
 
What 
then 
happened 
in 
July 2012 
to 
Advocate Mlotshwa? 
MR WHITE:  Chair, I refer to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I think what is necessary to just say.  
20 
Earlier on you were going to read this email, but you are not reading it 
now and I think that is because you have basically told me what is 
contained in it.  You - you told the Accountant-General basically what 
you knew up to that stage about what was happening in the case. 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair.  So effectively telling him the status of the 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 138 of 212 
 
case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  What the process was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   
MR WHITE:  It has been set down.  Judge McLaren has been allocated.  
Some people have asked for further particulars.  So effectively 
updating him.  So he knew … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  The process. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair that was on 2 May.  During July 2012 and I refer 
to it at page 53 of RR4 paragraph 79. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is of your affidavit? 
MR WHITE:  My affidavit Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  So during July 2012 Advocate Mlotshwa who was the 
Acting DPP in KZN was replaced by Advocate Noko and shortly 
thereafter in mid-August 2012 the charges were withdrawn against Ms - 
Mr Mabuyakhulu and Ms Nkonyeni.  So Chair there was a number of 
20 
stories at the time that it was just a rotational thing of Acting DPP. 
So everybody was being given a chance.  Chair the - the 
coincidence is just uncanny that Advocate Mlotshwa refuses to 
withdraw the charges.  It takes some months.  He is replaced by 
Advocate Noko and a couple of weeks later the charges are withdrawn. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 139 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And as far as you know when Advocate Noko withdrew 
the charges the review process that Advocate Mlotshwa had said he 
wanted to happen - the formal process that would led to the NDPP 
making a decision had not happened. 
MR WHITE:  Chair, it did not happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so you have an - an Acting - a Acting DPP who 
refuses to withdraw the charges when Mr Mrwebi and Mr Mosing say 
they should be withdrawn and he insists that there should be a proper 
lawful process followed in terms of the Act.  Then he gets removed and 
somebody else takes his place and that process that he wanted to be 
10 
pursued does not happen and the new person does not take long before 
she withdraws the charges. 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And before she withdrew the charges did she 
ever ask you or Colonel Du Plooy to brief her on the matter?  Ask for 
documents, explain the matter to her? 
MR WHITE:  Chair, I was not asked and - and to my knowledge nor was 
Colonel Du Plooy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you have any knowledge whether she was - she 
20 
withdrew the charges because she came to the conclusion after looking 
at the matter that they should be withdrawn or she was withdrew them 
in order to carry out an instruction from somebody senior to withdraw 
them … 
MR WHITE:  Chair … 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 140 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because if - if she was carrying out the instruction 
maybe there might have been no need for her to interview you or 
consult you, but if she was making her own decision.  One would have 
expected that she would want to consult with the investigating officer 
and yourself. 
MR WHITE:  Chair, we were not consulted.  The - the timeframe was 
very short.  If one was to study the documents that are in the docket 
which are the forensic reports, the annexures and all the affidavits of 
all the - the factual witnesses.  If one was to look at that cold and read 
it.  It is going to take weeks and weeks of time. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  It is not - it is not going to be something you can just do in 
an afternoon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair - so just in respect of the time available … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  And considering that she was the new … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  Acting DPP. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR WHITE:  Even if she spent every day working on it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  She probably would not have got through all the 
documentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 141 of 212 
 
MR WHITE:  By the time she made the decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  So the only inference I could draw would be that it was - it 
was on an instruction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  Just because of the time available. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if she - if she had taken the trouble to read as 
much as she would have had to read in order to arrive at a decision.  
She probably would have wanted to speak to the investigating officer 
and you would have known even if he did not - she did not speak to 
10 
you. 
MR WHITE:  I would have Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now had she read all the documents and all 
your reports, in your view is it conceivable that she could have come to 
a decision not to prosecute? 
MR WHITE:  Chair the facts are the same facts I presented here at a 
high level so there’s a lot more content and detail behind that, it’s just 
more evidence supporting what happened.  So Chair the decision would 
be her interpretation of those facts but a lot of other people in the NPA 
20 
prior to that had come to a decision, there was a case.  So how you 
would come to – I know lawyers come to different decisions based on 
the same facts but it appeared that the facts weren’t really that 
important in this decision. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And when you say you made numerous 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 142 of 212 
 
presentations to prosecutors at the NPA, was that to several 
prosecutors? 
MR WHITE:  Chair I can remember a couple of meetings at the VGM 
Building where there was probably 30 people in the room where this 
matter was discussed.  So you know it wasn’t – and they were senior 
people it wasn’t junior people that were involved and Chair – but just 
the rigorous process to get to a racketeering certificate is not 
something that happens very easily in the NPA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There must be a reason why the Act requires that 
racketeering charges be pursued only after the NDPP has issued a 
10 
certificate, that’s what, in part you are talking about. 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To say that is simply because the idea is that this is a 
special kind of crime and the idea is that it must have received 
consideration and attention of the highest officer in the NPA before 
anybody is charged with it. 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  Now what do you say about Mr Mgwebi’s 
and Mr Mosing’s view or conclusion that there was no case against both 
Mr Mabuyakhulu and Ms Nkonyeni and maybe I must just say that there 
20 
was no prima facie case because that’s the conclusion they must have 
reached.  At that stage they are not looking at whether there’s a 
conclusive case.  They are supposed to look at whether there is a 
prima facie case which the accused must answer in the light of the work 
you had done in the light of the facts that you knew about the case as 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 143 of 212 
 
part of – arising out of the investigation, what do you say about that 
decision or that conclusion? 
MR WHITE: So Chair just to clarify…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I accept that you are not a lawyer. 
MR WHITE:  Ok so that is what I was going to say, I am an accountant 
by training. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but you have dealt with these types of crimes for 
around 20 or more years. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair it just didn’t make sense, so on the facts as I 
knew them that was supported by the most part by documents the 
10 
decision just appeared illogical and it appeared that it was made for an 
ulterior motive it didn’t – and that was also from all my discussions with 
the various prosecutors that had been involved etc. there was no legal 
basis and I never saw – Chair the other point to make is when these 
kind of decisions are made, normally it’s not so late in the process it’s 
not when the person’s already appearing in Court and it’s set down 
there’s normally a review done by the Prosecutor normally, maybe 
someone more senior and they will look at the evidence and say, you’ve 
got a gap over here, you need to fill that gap otherwise we’re going to 
have a problem if we go to Court, go and look for more evidence, more 
20 
documents, find a factual witness that was at a meeting or was involved 
in some process.  So it’s not a decision, you tell us what you’ve got and 
then we’re going to say there’s nothing.  They would normally look at it 
and say, here’s where you need to do something further.  Now that 
definitely wasn’t the process followed here. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 144 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And at the meeting which you attended where Mr 
Mgwebi and Mr Mosing were present, did they ever give any reason for 
the conclusion that they had already reached that there was no case 
against Mr Mabuyakhulu and they have decided or the decision has 
been made to withdraw the charges against him? 
MR WHITE:  Chair they just said, there’s no evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But did they reason that out to say what was the 
basis for saying there was no evidence? 
MR WHITE:  Chair they just refused to discuss it because they said the 
decision’s already made. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  And when we tried to probe it, they said we’re wasting time 
and you’ve only got an hour so that topic’s closed, now let’s talk about 
Nkonyeni.  They were not interested in discussing it at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you establish from them, in one way or another, 
at that meeting or after as to who exactly had made that decision was it 
them or was it somebody else? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair I had no interaction with the after that meeting so 
there was no further opportunity to ask that question but they never 
said at the meeting so I never heard whether it was someone else who 
20 
told them to do it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Or whether they just did it on their own behalf. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But is my understanding correct that the way they 
spoke about the decision, or let me put it this way, did you get any 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 145 of 212 
 
impression whether when they said the decision had been made that 
meant that they had made the decision or was it neutral that they were 
not indicating who had made the decision, they’re simply saying, that 
decision has been made and don’t waste our time because it futile to 
talk about it? 
MR WHITE:  Chair it wasn’t clear whether it was their decision or 
somebody else had told them, they just said the decision has been 
made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Mr White you say in 
10 
paragraph 79 the charges were also withdrawn against Ms Pendela, Mr 
Thusi and Mr Blows, who were they? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair those were the attorneys that worked for Kuboni 
Shezi Attorneys so they were the people that had been making the 
payments out of the Trust account.  So originally they were charged 
with a money laundering charge but obviously if you’re going to start 
withdrawing charges against people further down the line, and likewise 
the charge against Mr Mkhwanazi was withdrawn because the charge 
against Nkonyeni had been withdrawn.  So the people on the periphery 
of the two MEC’s the charges against them, even although it wasn’t 
20 
discussed at the meeting they were ultimately withdrawn against them 
later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And your understanding is that the withdrawal of 
charges against those people was a consequence of the decision to 
withdraw charges against the two MEC’s? 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 146 of 212 
 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now you’ve told the Chair that Advocate 
Dhanwa made a point when he was required to formerly withdraw these 
charges in Court and you said he said, 
 
“I’m withdrawing these charges on instructions”, 
 
Did you have a cause, after this to discuss what had happened 
with Advocate Mlotshwa? 
MR WHITE:   Chair I did, so Advocate Mlotshwa was the acting DPP 
that had been replaced by Advocate Noko and Chair I bumped into him, 
10 
I can’t recall, I think it was at the airport on one occasion and I was 
talking to him and he said that he believed the reason he was removed 
as the acting DPP was because he had refused to withdraw these 
charges. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And do you recall who the National Director of Public 
Prosecutions was at this time? 
MR WHITE:  Chair I don’t specifically…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sure Mr Mlotshwa will tell us yes okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  He’s going to testify Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Are we – has Advocate Noko been interviewed 
20 
are we going to get her to come here and explain some of the things? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR WHITE:  It is the intention. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 147 of 212 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Could you tell the Chair, after that, what has 
happened to these matters, both here and in the Cape? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair there were a number of challenges brought – 
legal challenges in the case brought by Dr Savoi and Intaka’s legal 
representatives so the first legal challenge they brought was they 
challenged whether the words, “ought to have known” are constitutional 
and that obviously followed the process where it went to the SCA and it 
then went to the Constitutional Court and Chair probably knows better 
than I do, it was found that they are constitutional but that was just a 
delaying process, it delayed it by almost two years and in the – partway 
10 
through that appeal process in May of 2013 they filed notice that they 
were going to apply for a permanent stay of prosecution and the main 
reasons for that permanent stay, apart from various others were that 
the politicians had been treated differently to Dr Savoi and the Intaka 
people.  So they were saying that there’s not equal treatment of all the 
accused and if the charges were withdrawn against the politicians the 
charges against Dr Savoi and Mr[indistinct] should also be withdrawn, 
that’s one of the reasons for the applications for a permanent stay.  
Chair that matter I was consulted with…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry I just want to make sure I understand, the 
20 
withdraw of charges in relation to KZN were the charges withdrawn 
against every accused or was it the two MEC’s plus departmental 
people in their departments and Mr Mkhwanazi only and Dr Savoi and 
others did not have their charges withdrawn against them? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair it was against the MEC, the two MEC’s and those 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 148 of 212 
 
attorneys and Mr Mkhwanazi, so it was them, there was also charges 
against – at a later point against Mr Green-Thompson and Dr Mbele 
who were also heads of Department of Health, they were also 
withdrawn against.  So the other officials within the Department of 
Health as well as Mr Tshabalala from Provincial Treasury as well as the 
people from Intaka, those charges stayed.  So some were withdrawn 
and, Chair if I understand there’s either 11 or 12 accused that are still 
before Court. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you ever get a chance to apply your mind to the 
fact that charges were withdrawn against some and not against others 
10 
and were you able to understand the basis of the withdrawal in terms of 
evidence to say, well maybe I do understand a little bit about so and 
so, the charges being withdrawn, you know, but I can’t understand the 
withdrawal against so and so or I can’t understand why, if there’s no 
case against so and so, and charges against him or her are withdrawn, 
why that one remains? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair that’s – a lot of that, what’s left doesn’t make 
sense but Chair what’s happened in the process is the NPA has 
changed the prosecutors in the matter, Advocate Dhunwa is no longer 
involved…[intervenes]. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Who is now involved? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair, Advocate Vimbani from the SCCU in Durban is 
currently heading up a team and there are new Prosecutors allocated 
but Chair it’s …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I want you to finish what we were dealing with, 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 149 of 212 
 
namely that which you thought didn’t seem to make sense about 
withdrawal and not withdrawing, I thought you had not finished what 
you were telling me. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair it’s currently not clear exactly which charges the 
accused that are left still face.  So we’ve – so the State has withdrawn 
charges against some of the people that got the alleged corrupt 
payments but I don’t know what amendments have been made to the 
charge sheet because it’s just not proceeding because of this 
permanent stay application that has been floating around for some six 
years Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I would like you if you haven’t done so, to look at 
which charges were withdrawn against whom. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And does that withdrawal make sense if the charge 
against so and so is not withdrawn. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Chair and I will address you on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I would like that to be looked at in depth. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair even although the permanent stay application 
20 
was 
initially 
– 
notice 
of 
motion 
was 
issued 
in 
May 
of 
2013…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I was about to ask you, do you know why it’s 
taking so long to process a review application, to process that 
permanent stay application? 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 150 of 212 
 
MR WHITE:  Chair there seems to be a reluctance on both the part of 
the State and the accused to set the matter down.  I now understand it 
is set down for – in the next couple of months, I think it’s sometime in 
March this year, so some, almost seven years later it’s now finally set 
down but Chair what this has done, it’s effectively sterilised the whole 
prosecution both in the KZN and in the Northern Cape because nothing 
has happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Wentzel I’m interested in the Commission 
examining what has been happening in regard to that application from 
the time it was launched, what has been done, by whom with whom up 
10 
to now so that we can see if there’s a case to say, people who were 
supposed to make sure that it was processed quickly didn’t do their job 
because I can understand if the accused who brought the application 
don’t mind it it’s not pursued – processed quickly but I don’t understand 
– I wouldn’t understand why the NPA, if for argument sake the accused 
were not acting diligently in pursuing it why they themselves wouldn’t 
do that.  So I want to know what has happened, the NPA has always 
had, either a Head or an Acting Head over the years, how can that 
application stay pending for six years. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or was this another way of letting this matter go 
away? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Chair. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair while this – there was this whole, nothing 
happening I was then approached sometime in 2017, I’m not – I can’t 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 151 of 212 
 
recall exactly when by Advocate Vimbani who now said she was 
heading up the prosecution and she had a team and she wanted to 
consult with myself relating to the evidence with the new prosecution 
team.  Chair because I’d had no involvement with this matter for some 
five years, I went back to National Treasury and said, are you prepared 
to appoint me to consult with these people and National Treasury said 
they weren’t prepared to pay further money for something that didn’t 
appear to be going anywhere and if the NPA wanted to consult, then the 
NPA must pay.  I went back to the NPA with that message and they 
subsequently appointed PWC on the 13 t h of December 2017 and said, 
10 
right you’re appointed, we want you to brief us and we want to consult 
in the matter.  Chair the first consultation took place some six months 
later on the 12 t h of June 2018…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well there may be – there might not be any 
connection but it’s interesting that attempts to get going on the matter 
took – started or resumed in 2017 when there were to be certain 
changes in the political landscape of the country. 
MR WHITE:  Chair lots of these things happen, if one draws pictures 
between the dates and happenings they…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes it’s something we have got to look at because 
20 
decisions of the NPA should have nothing to do with who is in what 
position where but part of what this Commission is doing is looking at 
to what extent the NPA and other Law Enforcement Agencies may, 
themselves have – may have allowed themselves to be influenced in 
regard to certain matters and we need to look and remain open and 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 152 of 212 
 
look at everything.  Maybe it’s got nothing to do with that but we must 
remain open and look at all possibilities.  Yes, so the NPA appointed 
you to …[intervenes]. 
MR WHITE:  In December of 2017 to consult, the meeting took place on 
the 12 t h of June 2008, Advocate Vimbani was present together with 
three new prosecutors that had never been involved in the matter 
before as well as Lieutenant Colonel du Ploy and Mr Jansen van 
Vuuren, a manager in my office that that had assisted me with the 
matter originally.  Chair the prosecutors were totally unprepared for the 
meeting, they did not have any background other than what they had 
10 
seen on TV, read in newspapers or heard in corridor talk, they had not 
read anything.  I then asked them, have you read the reports, they said 
no, you must tell us about it.  Chair, with respect I was 
fairly…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were annoyed. 
MR WHITE:  Ja annoyed is probably the right word because now we’re 
going to have a two-day consultation and they know nothing about the 
matter.  So I said to them it’s not my job to read the report to them.  So 
what we ultimately agreed was we would give them an overview, similar 
to what we’ve probably done today Chair, we spent the better part of 
20 
the first day, giving them an overview of what the case was about and 
who the people were that were involved.  We then agreed that we would 
adjourn and reconvene on the 16 t h and 17 t h of October 2018 to work 
through what they now, perceived the charges should be and the detail. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So how big was that gap between that first meeting 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 153 of 212 
 
and the next meeting, more or less? 
MR WHITE:  Four months Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Four months, okay. 
MR WHITE:  So it was from the 12 t h of June till the 16 t h of October. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the lead prosecutor now was who? 
MR WHITE:  It was Advocate Vimbani Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair just before that meeting was to take place, we 
confirmed, right the meeting’s taking place and we were told they were 
not ready for the meeting, they needed more time to study the 
10 
material…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now just to understand what was happening. Now 
when you had this meeting with them was it on the basis that they 
wanted to – they wanted to consult with you in order for them to make 
certain decisions about the application for a permanent stay, was it – 
did they want to consult with you so that they could make a decision – 
you could assist with information for them to make a decision as to 
whether to withdraw or to restate the charges that had been withdrawn 
against certain accused in KZN or was the purpose of the meeting, 
consultation, that they could make decisions as to the way forward in 
20 
regard to those accused persons against whom the charges had not 
been withdrawn? 
MR WHITE: So Chair it was the last one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was the last one? 
MR WHITE:  So it was how this team of prosecutors was now going to 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 154 of 212 
 
prosecute the remaining accused against – who the charges had not 
been withdrawn. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair so – I mean I would have thought they would 
have started with the charge sheet that was currently before Court, 
they would have crossed out the charges that relate to the accused that 
are withdrawn and then you would work with what’s left but it looked 
like they wanted to start afresh but Chair – so four months went past 
and then the meeting did not take place because they said they needed 
more time, so that was October of 2018 and to date the meeting’s never 
10 
been rescheduled.  Chair it sounds impossible but they’ve never come 
back and said, we’re now ready let’s consult. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the NPA appointed you towards the end of 2017 
because they wanted to consult with you in order to take the matter – 
the charges relating to the accused against whom charges had not been 
withdrawn, to take that matter forward and there was a meeting 
sometime in 2018 and it was adjourned and the date was arranged for a 
second meeting then that meeting didn’t take place because they were 
not ready, they said they were not ready and it’s 2020 now, they’ve 
never come back to you? 
20 
MR WHITE:   So Chair relating to consulting around that, that’s correct 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If they’ve been in touch with you it’s been about other 
matters? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair there was a meeting towards the end of 2019 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 155 of 212 
 
where they wanted to discuss – one of the accused wanted to enter into 
a potential plea bargain and they wanted to talk about the details 
around that, that’s the only further consultation that has taken place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay alright, yes thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Chair unless there is 
something else you would like to clarify or address with the witness, 
that concludes the evidence of the witness yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no I think – I don’t think I’ve got further 
questions, thank you very much Mr White for coming forward to assist 
the Commission we may ask you to come back or we may correspond 
10 
with you with regard to the Northern Cape matter or if there’s an 
application for leave to cross-examine you and if it’s granted there may 
be a need for you to come back but – then the Commission will be in 
touch with you at that time, but thank you very much and you are 
excused. 
MR WHITE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, the next witness is ready? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair if I might just address you firstly, the 
20 
next two witnesses are going to be Colonel du Ploy and also Advocate 
Manyathi.  Chair those witnesses are going to be led by my learned 
friend Mr Nicholson but I just want to address you on one aspect and 
that is the issue that was raised by the attorney for Mr Ngubene and Mr 
Malikla during the course of the proceedings where he…[intervenes]. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 156 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You’re referring to counsel for the Provincial 
Commissioner? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now what was said was that he had informed 
Mr Nicholson that there were two cases in which his client had set out 
her version and there was a very clear implication and criticism of the 
Commission for not having pursued that or had a look at it or had made 
any effort to find those cases.  I want to place it on record that from 
what I understand from Mr Nicholson, the conversation took place in a 
10 
much more oblique way in a different context. He had no idea that what 
was being referred to were affidavits that had been deposed to by her 
in – relating to this very matter.  Be that as it may Chair what has 
transpired is that attempts have then been made to obtain the two 
matters.  The two matters are the first, an affidavit deposed to by his 
client in an application to strike out certain statements made by 
Colonel Booysen in his application to have himself reinstated. 
The second, is an affidavit deposed to by her in her own 
disciplinary proceedings.  Now the first affidavit was emailed to 
Mr Nicholson by Mr (indistinct) last night and I have that before me.  
20 
The second was retrieved from the archives in Durban and couriered 
this morning.  It arrived at the Commission’s Offices while I have been 
leading this evidence. 
I have not had a chance to look at it.  So Chair I cannot 
address you as to what is set out in the disciplinary proceedings.  
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 157 of 212 
 
These … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well what you have said may be construed as if 
counsel for the Provincial Commissioner criticised you.  I do not know 
whether you intended to say that. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I did not understand him to criticise you, but … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I - I understand - I understood him to criticise 
the Commission … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And also what I wanted to correct Chair is 
10 
that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  When this was said in the manner in which it 
was said … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I publically … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Said to you … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  But my junior did not even mention this to me. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair that was not fair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And I need to address that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 158 of 212 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  An aspersion was created that perhaps he had 
not done his job properly and he … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  It was something he really should have told 
me about … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  But it has been explained that that did not 
happen … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And I just think that that needs to be 
10 
publically addressed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no.  That is fine.  The - I just wanted to make 
sure that you are not understood to convey that counsel for the 
Provincial Commissioner was criticising you or the legal team based on 
what he may have told Mr Nicholson the day before.  Maybe there is 
room to say there was some criticism. 
Maybe mild implied to say, but there is - there is a version in 
the public domain … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From my client … 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And we expected the Commission to have been aware 
of that.  Maybe to that extent.  Maybe - maybe it can be said there - 
there was some criticism, but I - I - my own impression was that 
counsel for the Provincial Commissioner said whatever he needed to 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 159 of 212 
 
say in a very constructive manner and in a very collegial manner and 
sought to cooperate.  That was my impression. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I may have - I certainly expressed certain sentiments 
which may be seen as criticism of the legal team or whatever, but it 
was not based on - to the extent that you can call it criticism. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was not based on the fact that the day before you 
were told something.  I specifically said there had not been much time 
even if you had been told … 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you were told the day before. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So whatever concerns I had … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were based on other factors in relation to not having 
that information, but I think you have placed on record what you wished 
to place on record. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Chair.  I - I just wanted to correct what - 
the criticism I had levelled at my colleague … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  On national TV and I just … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Felt compelled to address that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay.  Okay.  Alright. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 160 of 212 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  If I can ask him to then call the next two 
witnesses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let us talk about the fact that we are at 20 
minutes to five.  Maybe he should take … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  To four. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Oh.  Is it to four? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay.  I looked at my watch I thought it was to 
10 
five.  Okay.  There is still time then. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am happy that there is still time.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So let us - let him call the witness and we can talk 
about whether it looks like we can finish within the remaining time. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am happy to continue until five. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Nicholson. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Good afternoon Chair. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 161 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good afternoon. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Chair, I intend calling Adv Manyathi.  The 
- the legal team had intended on calling two witness:  Colonel Du Plooy 
and Adv Manyathi.  However due to the time constraints and the fact 
that they are both from Durban and both of them have planes at 7 o’ 
clock which means that they both need to be out of here by five at the 
very latest.  I think what we may only be able to finish one witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think what we should have done yesterday.  If we at 
that stage thought that we would take as long as we did with Mr White.  
We should have explored the possibility of starting early - earlier than 
10 
10 o’ clock, but it may be that it was not foreseen that we would take as 
long as we ultimately took with him. 
Now of course the one concern that arises if we are not going 
to hear the evidence of one of them.  Is that costs have been incurred 
to bring them up here and if anyone of them has to go back without 
giving evidence that would mean further costs would have to be 
incurred some other time when they must come up. 
That - I know that in chambers I indicated that we could 
continue until five and I just repeated that, but it may be that if need be 
we might have to look at possibilities.  Now the one possibility is 
20 
subject to me checking if I can manage is that I sit and we deal with 
both of them if they can get or the one that will come after - after this 
one. 
Will - if they can get later flights, but I understand yesterday 
SAA was not flying.  So that might mean there is a reduced number of 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 162 of 212 
 
flights available, but I do not also know whether they have - may have 
commitments that they need to honour.  So do - do you know anything 
about these issues that I am raising? 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Chair, with regard to the flights. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  We have attempted - certainly for 
Adv Manyathi - we have moved the flight by one hour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  There is no flights after 7 o’ clock as I 
understand … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Because what I had suggested was we 
move the flights to 8 o’ clock … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  But the - the administration staff had 
come back to me and stated that they can only get a flight at 7 o’ clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Colonel Du Plooy’s flight is at 20 to 
seven. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  So it would not make any sense … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  To move it to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  To seven. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 163 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  On my estimation Chair we - we may be 
able to conclude both witnesses … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  In one and a half hours. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  If we can … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well … 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  See how it goes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe let us try.  Let us start.  Yes.  Let us just 
10 
administer the oath or affirmation to the witness. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think - I think switch off the other one.  Ja. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
ADV MANYATHI:  Bheki Felix Manyathi. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the prescribed oath? 
ADV MANYATHI:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
conscience? 
ADV MANYATHI:  I do. 
20 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the 
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?  If so please raise your 
right hand and say so help me God. 
ADV MANYATHI:  So help me God. 
ADV MANYATHI:  (duly sworn, states) 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 164 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.  Then you can just switch on 
your mic.  Thank you.  Yes Mr Nicholson. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Chair, Adv Manyathi is going to deal with 
two - with his - with one issue.  His involvement in the - in the 
prosecution of Colonel Madhoe and Thoshan Panday in the corruption 
matter.  Adv Manyathi do you have your affidavit in front of you? 
ADV MANYATHI:  I do. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Do you confirm that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  We should admit this first is it not? 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  That is correct.  With the leave of the 
10 
Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The affidavit - the affidavit of Mr Bheki Felix Manyathi 
will be admitted as EXHIBIT RR3 and will be marked accordingly. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  I am indebted Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That includes whatever annexures there are to it.  
Yes. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Do you confirm your affidavit with 
annexures derived from pages 1 to 29 of RR3?  Do you confirm that is 
your affidavit? 
ADV MANYATHI:  I do.  However Chair there is one aspect that I would 
20 
like to elaborate on regarding paragraphs 19 and 22.  My elaboration 
will … (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on.  Before you elaborate.  You do confirm that 
this is your affidavit? 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 165 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So now you want to talk about the contents 
and you have something to say on a certain paragraph.  Is that right? 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes.  19 and 22.  I will - I will just add something in 
due course, but it will not take anything from the essence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From the substance.  Ja. 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No.  That is fine.  Do you want to do that when 
it is the right time as you give evidence? 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  Alright. 
10 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Do you confirm those are you initials at 
the bottom of each page? 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  And at page 11 is that your signature? 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Do you confirm the correctness and 
truthfulness of your affidavit save to what you have just mentioned? 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON: 
 
Advocate Manyathi 
where 
are 
you 
currently employed? 
20 
ADV MANYATHI:  I am in private practice as an advocate at the Durban 
Bar. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  For how long have you been in private 
practice? 
ADV MANYATHI:  This is my sixth year. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 166 of 212 
 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Prior to joining the bar where were you 
employed? 
ADV MANYATHI:  I was with the National Prosecuting Authority at 
different levels, but when I left - my last day was 31 December 2013.  I 
was a Senior State Advocate based at the office of the Directorate of 
Public Prosecutions. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  So for how long were you at the NPA? 
ADV MANYATHI:  From 1997 to 2013. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Could you just briefly take … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would that more - about 15 years? 
10 
ADV MANYATHI:  1997/2007 - eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13.  16. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Can you briefly take the Chair through 
your career at the Department of Justice and/or the NPA? 
ADV MANYATHI:  Before I became a prosecutor I was a court 
interpreter employed by the Department of Justice from 1985 to 
January 1993 and then in - from February 1993 I then went to full time 
studies at the University of Zululand.  In other words I - I resigned from 
the Department of Justice effectively 31 January 1993 and then 1993, 
four, five, six I was in full time study at University of Zululand doing 
20 
BProc and then I returned to the NPA in 1997 as an aspirant 
prosecutor. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I - I guess you - you came to the NPA, because 
for the first time rather than return, because before you were in the 
Department of Justice? 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 167 of 212 
 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As an interpreter. 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were coming to the NPA for the first time? 
ADV MANYATHI:  Accurately.  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANYATHI:  I - I started in the NPA in 1997. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  In 2011 where were you employed? 
ADV MANYATHI:  I was at - at the Office of the DPP as a Senior State 
Advocate.  I was based in the Durban Office. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  And do you know who the DPP of KZN 
was at that stage? 
ADV MANYATHI:  At that time it was Advocate Simphiwe Mlotshwa.  He 
was Acting as DPP. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Now if we turn to your affidavit at page 1 
paragraph 4.  You state that you were allocated a corruption case. 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Mr Manyathi so you - you may have been 
at the Bar for six years, but you have been an advocate for more than 
20 years. 
ADV MANYATHI:  No, no, no Chair.  It is an interesting point.  I - I 
never thought I would leave the NPA. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 168 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANYATHI:  So it - it was one of those mind-set aspects that I do 
not need to be admitted as an advocate because … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV MANYATHI:  As - as a prosecutor you do not need to be admitted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay. 
ADV MANYATHI:  You can be - that is why it is called a state advocate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Well I thought you - you are only a state 
advocate if you have been admitted as an advocate. 
ADV MANYATHI:  No.  Not necessarily.  Some - some … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  So you - you can be a state advocate without 
being an advocate in terms of the Advocates Act … 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because in terms of the Advocates Act you are only 
an advocate if you have been admitted as an advocate.  Is it not? 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes Chairperson? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANYATHI:  In - in the sense that the delegation and authority to 
prosecute is in terms of National Prosecuting - Prosecuting Authority 
Act. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANYATHI:  So you - you can be a state advocate without being 
an advocate in terms of the Advocates Act. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Oh.  Okay.  No.  I did not know that.  I - I 
thought you are called state advocate, because you are an advocate 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 169 of 212 
 
employed by the state.  Okay.  Alright.  I - I learnt something today. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Advocate Manyathi when you - did you in 
fact receive this corruption matter? 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Did you peruse the police case docket? 
ADV MANYATHI:  I did. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  What were …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Nicholson you just said this corruption matter.  I 
10 
think you must specify what corruption matter you are talking about. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Indeed Chair.  I was going to come to it 
later, but - but I think it is … (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  For somebody who is reading the transcript to follow 
the evidence they will not understand what this matter is. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Advocate Manyathi can you tell us who 
the suspects in this matter were? 
ADV MANYATHI:  The suspects were … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You still have this matter. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Yes. I am coming to - I am coming to the 
20 
explanation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why do you not go to it?  Is it not in dispute?  Why do 
you not go to it straightaway?  It is the Amigos matter or whatever -
whatever.  Just specify it. 
ADV MANYATHI:  I will - I will answer that Chairperson. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 170 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja.  Tell us what the matter is first. 
ADV MANYATHI:  The corruption related to the alleged bribery … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MANYATHI:  General Johan Booysen … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV MANYATHI:  Who was the Provincial Head of the Hawks … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANYATHI:  At the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay.  That is the - the Panday and 
Colonel Madhoe - Madhoe matter? 
10 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  Alright.  That is what I wanted so that 
further questions as they follow - every - everybody understands which 
matter you are talking about, because there - there are various matters 
that have today and yesterday. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Did you peruse the police case docket? 
ADV MANYATHI:  I did. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  What was your impression of the 
20 
evidence in the police docket? 
ADV MANYATHI:  There was a case. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Okay. 
ADV MANYATHI:  That is why I prosecuted. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Now you - you mentioned the names of 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 171 of 212 
 
the accused at paragraph 6 of your affidavit at page - at page of RR3. 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  What were the names of the accused? 
ADV MANYATHI:  Colonel Navin Madhoe as in Colonel in the South 
African Police Service and businessman Mr Thoshan Panday. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  At page 2 of RR3 paragraph 5 you state 
that: 
“The corruption case relates to a case of - of 
procurement fraud.” 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes. 
10 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON: 
 
Who 
was 
the 
prosecutor 
of 
the 
procurement fraud investigation? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Before that.  You - you were asked the 
question what your impression was of the case … 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you said there was a case.  How strong was the 
case against the accused in your view? 
ADV MANYATHI:  I - I will borrow from what the Chairperson said to the 
previous witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV MANYATHI:  I was sitting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MANYATHI:  At - at the stage of making a decision … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANYATHI:  Whether to prosecutor or not. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 172 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MANYATHI:  All you are required to look at is whether there is a 
prima facie case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANYATHI:  That warrants a prosecution … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANYATHI:  In respect of which the accused are required by law 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANYATHI:  To respond. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANYATHI:  So there was a prima facie case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was a prima facie case? 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Okay. 
ADV MANYATHI:  In - in fact I may elaborate Chair.  That obviously 
investigation progresses … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANYATHI:  And even at the early stage … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANYATHI:  When I enrolled the matter … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MANYATHI:  There was a prima facie case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 173 of 212 
 
ADV MANYATHI:  As - as the investigation progressed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANYATHI:  The evidence was supplemented. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So as the investigation went on - or in any case 
speaking generally - as the investigation goes on the evidence might 
become stronger … 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the case might become strong against the 
accused … 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or sometimes it can be weaker. 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV MANYATHI:  To - to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MANYATHI:  To illustrate the point I am making.  Ultimately I 
drafted an indictment and indicted both accused in the High Court on a 
charge of corruption. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Okay.  Who was the prosecutor in the 
20 
procurement fraud investigation? 
ADV MANYATHI:  Ms Wendy Clark.  Clark was her maiden surname.  
She then got married.  I have got the - the married surname there - 
Greeff, but we still called her Wendy Clark. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Okay.  In which section of the NPP is she 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 174 of 212 
 
based? 
ADV MANYATHI:  I beg your pardon. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  In which section of the NPA is she based? 
ADV MANYATHI:  Ms Clark was with the Organised Crime of the NPA 
which fell under the General Section. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Okay and can you just briefly - do you 
know any of the facts regarding to the procurement fraud? 
ADV MANYATHI:  The facts would be based on what I was told when I 
consulted with the investigation team in the corruption matter as well 
as Ms Clark herself.  I did consult with her.  The reason I mention this 
10 
is because I did not read the fraud case.  I did not need to read it.  So 
the facts as I was informed were - were that in 2010 when there was 
the Soccer World Cup in South Africa. 
Police officers from all over the country were doing special 
duties.  Obviously at specific places where there were stadiums where 
the matches were going to be held.  So you would find police officers 
being moved from their bases to these different places.  They were - 
they were doing special duties and in the process accommodation had 
to be obtained for them and in - in the process of awarding tenders - 
for lack of a better word. 
20 
I do not know what the procurement process was, but - but let 
me rather say in the process of awarding the accommodation to the 
SAPS it was alleged that companies - not one - companies that were 
owned by Mr Thoshan Panday - he was a businessman - were awarded 
this procurement - so to speak - and the charges that - that were 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 175 of 212 
 
charged for the accommodation were - were over inflated. 
Hence the - the R60 million fraud based on the over inflate - 
inflation of prices for those BNB’s/lodges etcetera. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Okay.  Do you - who were the suspects in 
that fraud case you just mentioned? 
ADV MANYATHI:  Again as I was informed by my colleague and the 
investigators it was the same two suspects - Madhoe and - and Panday. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Those people that you mention at 
paragraph 6 of your affidavit? 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes.  If - if I may elaborate so that the Chair will 
10 
understand.  Madhoe was in charge of Procurement in KwaZulu-Natal.  
I think that is how he featured in - in the alleged fraud, because the 
procurement for the accommodation had to go via him.  He was in 
charge of it. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Okay.  At paragraphs 8 to - to 18 at 
EXHIBIT RR3 page - pages 3 and four.  You give a brief detail of the 
corruption matter.  Is that correct? 
ADV MANYATHI:  Sorry.  Which paragraphs?  Page 3. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  It is pages 3 and four.  Paragraphs 8 to 
18.  Okay. 
20 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Who is the complainant in the corruption 
case? 
ADV MANYATHI:  Complainant was General Johan Booysen. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  And how did this corruption occur? 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 176 of 212 
 
ADV MANYATHI:  It was alleged that Colonel Madhoe approached 
General Booysen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Please do not forget your question 
Mr Nicholson. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you proceed I just want to talk about your 
statement that General Booysen was the complainant.  Yesterday 
during Mr White’s evidence reference was made to either an email or a 
memorandum which was written by General Booysen I think to the Head 
of the Hawks at the time where he was refuting the statement made by I 
10 
think somebody from the NPA. 
I think Advocate Letswalo that he or Advocate Noko.  One - 
one of the two or both.  That he had been the complainant in that 
matter and I think he said well he was simply a witness and that - I 
hope I am - my recollection is correct.  I think he said the complainant 
was the state.  I - I may be mistaken about the second part, but it - but 
he - he refuted any suggestion that he was the complainant. 
ADV MANYATHI:  I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  What - what would you like to say about that? 
ADV MANYATHI:  I will - I will answer as a lawyer and - and a former 
20 
prosecutor.  He - he was technically correct.  In - in the sense that it is 
- it is a layman’s perspective.  I will - I will use the example of say my 
car is stolen.  I go and lay a charge of theft of motor vehicle.  I regard 
myself as the complainant … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 177 of 212 
 
ADV MANYATHI:  And in fact the prosecutors, the police and everyone 
will say I am the complainant.  However in the sense that the ultimate 
decision whether to prosecute or not lies with the Prosecuting 
Authority.  So strictly speaking you could say the NPA is the 
complainant. 
More so Chairperson you have instances - I will use sexual 
offences - rape.  You would have many instances even when I was a 
prosecutor that the so called complainant wants to withdraw a rape 
charge and as a prosecutor you say no.  I am not going to do it, 
because you have the authority in terms of law.  So it - it is a matter of 
10 
perspective.  So Booysen was not incorrect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let us - let us look at that.  Using the term 
complainant in the normal way in which it is used within the context of 
criminal law … 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And within the context of crime and prosecution. 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would it be a legitimate or correct use of that term to 
say he was a - he was a complainant in the matter? 
ADV MANYATHI:  I - I do not know what his reasoning was … 
20 
(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but on your understanding of the term and on 
your understanding of his role in this matter.  Would you - if - if 
somebody says he was - he was the complainant in that matter.  Would 
- would it fit within your understanding of what a complainant is 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 178 of 212 
 
generally understood to be - to be in the context of prosecution and 
criminal law? 
ADV MANYATHI:  I would say probably not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MANYATHI:  Based on the nature … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MANYATHI:  Of - of the charge.  It is corruption. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MANYATHI:  He - he is allegedly being bribed … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV MANYATHI:  In his official capacity as a policeman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MANYATHI:  So it is not a personal … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MANYATHI:  Matter where like the example of theft of motor 
vehicle.  I have … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MANYATHI:  Made the - the point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
ADV MANYATHI:  So he - he is just a witness … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MANYATHI:  In the sense that he is being bribed in his official 
capacity as a policeman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
ADV MANYATHI:  So he - he was - he had a point to make.  So he … 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 179 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MANYATHI:  He is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now to the extent that either Advocate Noko or 
Advocate Letswalo may have in one or more of their memorandums 
relating to the withdrawal of the charge may have said he was the 
complainant in that matter.  What would you say about their use of that 
term in saying he was the complainant? 
Would you say be able to say - would you say that was the 
wrong use of the terms?  Would you say it was not wrong use if you 
look at what is normally said, but technically it was wrong?  What would 
10 
you say about that? 
ADV MANYATHI:  It is a difficult one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANYATHI:  In - in the context of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want to understand, because from the NPA’s 
side when they withdrew the charges one of the criticisms they relied 
upon to justify the decision to withdraw the charges was that 
General Booysen was the complainant in the matter and yet he was 
playing a certain role. 
Such as they said he was - he was writing letters or giving 
20 
instructions as to who could or could not visit or see Colonel Madhoe 
when he was in police custody and I think they said something else, but 
the - the impression they were creating was there is something strange 
happening here.  This man is the complainant in this case … 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 180 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And yet look at what he is doing.  He - he is in charge 
of what is happening.  He says he - he will say who may see the 
accused and who may not see the accused.  He should not be playing 
that role.  That is my impression of what they are saying and when he 
respond - when he responded. 
He was saying no, but I am not the complainant.  So I am 
trying to understand the matter from their perspective.  Is there 
somebody who was being disingenuous in - in the use of the word - of 
the term or in adopting whatever position was being adopted by the two 
sides or is this a situation where both could genuinely be thinking they 
10 
were right in what - in the position they were taking and - and nothing 
more should turn on it, but the prosecution - the NPA used that term as 
one of reasons to say there is something fishy here. 
For that reason we are not going to proceed.  We are 
withdrawing the charges.  For that reason and maybe other reasons we 
- we are withdrawing the charges. 
ADV MANYATHI:  I - I now understand.  Based on the information that 
the Chairperson has given me.  I was not aware why the charges were 
withdrawn, because they were withdrawn after I had left the NPA and 
because it was in the public domain.  I - I got to know, because certain 
20 
prosecutors also called me out of interest to say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANYATHI:  Are you aware that the case that you were allocated 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Prosecuting. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 181 of 212 
 
ADV MANYATHI:  Has been withdrawn on the instructions of the DPP - 
Advocate Noko. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
ADV MANYATHI:  To - to answer the question.  As a prosecutor I would 
not have given that reason if I took that decision to withdraw to say I 
am withdrawing because General Booysen is the complainant.  No.  I - I 
think it does not make legal sense.  Perhaps one should also answer in 
- in an insightful way.  Let us - let us talk about the R60 million fraud. 
Where the state as in the department of the police was 
allegedly defrauded.  That who is the complainant.  Is it - is it the 
10 
person who opened the docket who is representing the police, because 
someone has - has to open the docket.  So I - let us say it was 
Captain So and so who opened the docket, because a crime had been 
opened. 
No it is not that Captain.  It is the police - the entire 
department.  So from that perspective I - I would say there is - there is 
substance in perspective that Booysen was not the complainant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  I - I am just thinking of 
other cases where a police officer witnesses a crime being committed.  
Whether - unless there is somebody else who is a complainant.  The 
20 
police cannot arrest and the NPA cannot charge unless there is 
somebody who is called a complainant. 
What - what can you tell me on that?  In other words this 
thing of a complainant must there always be a complainant? 
ADV MANYATHI:  No.  Again interestingly practical cases that I have 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 182 of 212 
 
dealt with are in - in my career as a prosecutor way back in - in District 
Court when I started.  The police would - would go to the City - the 
CBD and be in plain clothes and do what was called crime prevention 
against pick pocketing. 
I prosecuted several cases where for instance a pickpocket 
would pickpocket a civilian and the civilian was unaware that he is 
being pick pocketed.  That was the whole point of pick pocketing. That - 
that you take the wallet or whatever … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Without the person being aware? 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes and the policeman would chase the pickpocket 
10 
and by the time he catches the - the victim - so to speak … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Has - is nowhere to be seen? 
ADV MANYATHI:  Is gone … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes. 
ADV MANYATHI:  And we would prosecute pickpockets … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MANYATHI:  For robbery of a person unknown to the state … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANYATHI:  And we would secure a conviction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MANYATHI:  On the basis of the evidence of the policeman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And - and you would not say the policeman who 
arrested that - the pickpocket is the complainant? 
ADV MANYATHI:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 183 of 212 
 
ADV MANYATHI:  He - he is not the complainant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  He is just a witness. 
ADV MANYATHI:  He is just a witness and because … 
CHAIRPERSON:  To a crime. 
ADV MANYATHI:  He is a witness and the only one who - who 
witnesses the crime who is available.  He would then open the docket. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANYATHI:  On the part where it says complainant.  His name 
would be there.  Sergeant So and so, but he is not the complainant 
really. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  So - so in terms of paperwork he - he or she 
might appear as the complainant? 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes.  On the face of each docket … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MANYATHI:  There is a part which says complainant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Then you would put - the policeman’s name 
could appear then … 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There.  Would it ever happen that no name is put 
there, but the matter is prosecuted? 
20 
ADV MANYATHI:  There would always be a name.  A good example is 
cases of murder or homicide.  In - in a case where someone has died 
the complainant is always the - a policeman who opens the docket … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV MANYATHI:  Because the deceased is - is dead. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 184 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Okay.  So - so this issue about whether 
General Booysen was the complainant or not maybe it is not a simple 
issue. 
ADV MANYATHI:  No.  It is not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MANYATHI:  But based on what the Chairperson has told me … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MANYATHI:  As being one of the reasons cited for the withdrawal.  
For me … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV MANYATHI:  It does not make legal sense. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To - to rely on that? 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON: 
 
Advocate Manyathi, 
you 
were 
still 
explaining to the Chair how the corruption occurred. 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes.  The allegation was that Madhoe approached 
Booysen and offered him R1.5 million to predate a report which had 
been submitted in the fraud matter.  Those were the brief facts, but I 
can elaborate further, because it - it was - it was something that 
20 
happened over a period of time. 
From the - from the moment the approach was allegedly made 
by Madhoe culminating in the exchange of the cash and the report. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you say fraud matter you relay - you referring 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 185 of 212 
 
to the procurement matter? 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  I think it is appropriate if we can just go 
through it step by step.  You say Madhoe approached … 
ADV MANYATHI:  Booysen. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Booysen and offered him 1.4 million. 
ADV MANYATHI:  1.5. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  1.5 million … 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes. 
10 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  To predate a report. 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes.  Which - which had been submitted in the 
procurement fraud case. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  What is the significance of this report? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before that.  The procurement case - the fraud 
case that you refer to.  The suspects or accused were who? 
ADV MANYATHI:  The same two. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Panday and Colonel Madhoe? 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  Then the question of what was the 
20 
significance of the report that it was said he wanted predated. 
ADV MANYATHI:  Based on the briefing a - it was called specifically a 
preliminary report.  In the sense that it was not final.  The investigation 
was ongoing.  A preliminary report was submitted to Booysen as the 
Provincial Head of the Hawks.  That - that preliminary report I was told 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 186 of 212 
 
was not signed and - must I just … 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Yes.  Just continue. 
ADV MANYATHI:  Unpack everything? 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Unpack it.  Yes. 
ADV MANYATHI:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but having said so I think he was saying what was 
the significance of the report. 
ADV MANYATHI:  Oh yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if you are able to just zoom in on that. 
ADV MANYATHI:  Okay.  For the report to have been compiled there - 
10 
there are occurrences that happened.  The sequence is critical.  
Investigation - as part of the investigation the police in conjunction with 
the prosecutors would apply for what is called a Section 205 subpoena. 
Section 205 in terms of the Criminal Procedure Act.  Must elaborate on 
what it provides? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no.  Not really. 
ADV MANYATHI:  Not necessary? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, because - ja.  There has been evidence - ja. 
ADV MANYATHI:  So you - you then get a prosecutor to apply for the 
Section 205 subpoena and a - a Judicial Officer authorises it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MANYATHI:  In this case the Section 205 subpoenas are served 
on financial institutions.  I would presume banks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MANYATHI:  So that the banks would provide bank records of the 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 187 of 212 
 
companies that allegedly were paid … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MANYATHI:  From the procurement fraud … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MANYATHI:  And it was alleged that those companies belonged to 
Panday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MANYATHI:  So sequence is Section 205 subpoenas served on the 
bank or banks depending how many accounts where they were held.  
Banks then provide bank statements. 
10 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV MANYATHI:  The police then look at those bank statements.  
Remember the modus operandi that the charges for the accommodation 
were inflated and obviously the police would not pay those companies 
cash.  There would be EFTs or whatever.  So there - there would be a 
paper trail. 
Once you access the bank records of those companies that 
were paid you then see how much was paid on what day for which 
accommodation totalling how much and then once you access those 
bank records you then compile a preliminary report.  Saying at this 
20 
stage prima facie there is evidence against Madhoe and Panday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now … 
ADV MANYATHI:  So coming back to the - the question.  The 
significance of that report.  So the report as I was told was not dated.  
It was a preliminary report.  I was informed that what was going to 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 188 of 212 
 
happen after that the police would engage an external service provider.  
It was usually accountants and auditors firms to conduct a forensic 
audit report.  That would be the final one. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Okay. 
ADV MANYATHI:  Tell me if I have not answered your question. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  No.  No you have.  What is the 
significance - I just - I did not come out clear.  What is the significance 
of predating the - the report? 
ADV MANYATHI:  The report.  Is the significance is this.  Remember 
the sequence.  Section 205 subpoenas, bank statements, report. 
10 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV MANYATHI:  Also it is - it is important to mention that at some 
point Panday brought a challenge in the High Court to have the validity 
of the Section 205 subpoenas set aside.  So he was challenging their 
validity.  That was - that is a separate civil matter.  Now if Madhoe 
approaches Booysen and says predate this pre - preliminary report 
which refers to bank statements. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV MANYATHI:  Once you predate that report to prior to the date that 
the Section 205 subpoenas were obtained.  It - it logically means the 
20 
report was already completed before the Section 205 subpoenas were 
obtained in terms of which the bank statements which are referred to in 
the report were obtained. 
So it - it would bolster the notion that the Section 205 
subpoenas were obtained illegally which would follow also that the bank 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 189 of 212 
 
statements were obtained illegally. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We have to take a - a very short break.  Let us make 
it five minutes.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Advocate Manyathi if we go to RR3, page 4, 
paragraph 14 you mentioned that Panday’s fingerprints were found on 
the report. 
10 
ADV MANYATHI:   One print. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   One print? 
ADV MANYATHI:   Fingerprint yes. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   From whom was this report received? 
ADV MANYATHI:   What happened is remember that Booysen already 
had a copy of the report, the preliminary report so when Madhoe 
approached him to pre-date it Booysen said he doesn’t have a copy, 
whether he was misleading Madhoe playing along, I don’t know, or 
whether he had genuinely misplaced it I don’t know.   In any way 
Madhoe then said I will provide you with a copy of the report.   Just to 
20 
digress a bit when we were busy with the bail application in respect of 
both Madhoe and Panday because we opposed it as the State, I nearly 
said I opposed it (laughing).   It was common cause that Madhoe had a 
copy of the preliminary report on his own version. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 190 of 212 
 
ADV MANYATHI:   So Madhoe said I will give you a copy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just to recall again that would have been a report 
prepared by the investigators? 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes, in the fraud matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja in the fraud matter and it being a report to whom? 
ADV MANYATHI:   As I understood to – no I don’t know whether to 
Booysen as the Provincial Head of the Hawks in Kwa-Zulu Natal or to 
the National Head of Department, I think it was General Dramat at the 
time I’m not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes it was one of them? 
10 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It would have been a report to either General 
Booysen or the National Head of the Hawks. 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s your recollection? 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes but both would have a copy of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay. 
ADV MANYATHI:   Whether it was addressed to Booysen or Dramat the 
one would give the other – it will be given to both. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes, so is your – was your understanding that 
20 
Madhoe was not supposed to have a copy of this report? 
ADV MANYATHI:   I don’t know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You don’t know but it was common cause during the 
bail application that he had a copy? 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes it was common cause based on the fact that it 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 191 of 212 
 
was common cause, again this is just my reasoning, not based on any 
facts that were before me in the docket.  Remember Chairperson the 
procurement fraud emanated from the accommodation and I said 
Madhoe was in charge of procurement.  It could be that as the Head of 
Procurement in whose section this fraud occurred was given a copy of 
this report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay. 
ADV MANYATHI:   Ja so he then said to Booysen, well I’ve got a copy 
I’ll give you, so he gave him and Booysen did not sign – rather did not 
pre-date that one that Madhoe gave to him because it was taken for 
10 
investigation, that is where Panday’s fingerprint was found it was found 
on that report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay. 
ADV MANYATHI:   And it was then preserved as evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes because fingerprint elimination had been done 
on it so it was now evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MANYATHI:   So what then happened, I’m just completing the 
picture, now that Madhoe has given him a report Madhoe is unaware of 
20 
the developments now that Panday’s fingerprint has been found.  
Subsequently then Booysen gave Madhoe a pre-dated report.  I don’t 
know where that report came from, Booysen can answer either Booysen 
made a copy of the report that Madhoe gave him before it was 
submitted for fingerprint or afterwards or Booysen draw his own report 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 192 of 212 
 
that he initially said he doesn’t have any. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MANYATHI:   So the pre-dated one was then handed to Madhoe. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I didn’t hear that before so I think I’m hearing 
that for the first time. 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay so there was a pre-dated report that General 
Booysen gave to Madhoe as you understood the position? 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
10 
ADV MANYATHI:   The exchange occurred on the day that Madhoe was 
arrested.  So what happened is…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay. 
ADV MANYATHI:   Ja as I said, it was over different days culminating in 
the day that the sting operation was held, so Madhoe gave Booysen 
1.362million yet he had offered 1.5 but gave him 1.362million and then 
in exchange Booysen gave him the pre-dated report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay maybe I was told about him giving –General 
Booysen giving Colonel Madhoe a pre-dated report maybe I’ve 
forgotten, I’ve been hearing too much evidence so ja. 
20 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Do you know, dealing with the report, with 
Panday’s print on it, where is that report now? 
ADV MANYATHI:   As I said the report on which Panday’s print was 
found, after the print was found it was preserved as evidence, so it was 
– no it was not in the docket, I now recall.  Procedurally when a 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 193 of 212 
 
fingerprint expert does an elimination they keep the Exhibits so it would 
have been preserved in the safe or strong room of the local criminal 
records centre where the fingerprint expert is based but the fingerprint 
expert would depose to an affidavit for purposes of filing the docket 
setting out everything. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Okay if we go to RR3 page 4 paragraph 15, you 
mention that authorisation was received in terms of Section 252 A. 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Which Act are you referring to? 
ADV MANYATHI:   Criminal Procedure Act. 
10 
ADV NICHOLSON:   What is the significance of Section 252A? 
ADV MANYATHI:   In essence the Section says before a trap is 
conducted the police must obtain authorisation from the Directorate of 
Public Prosecutions to conduct that trap, obviously there are 
exceptions like any other provision. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Okay so you mention that a sting operation took 
place on the 8 t h of September 2011. 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess the significance is simply that it’s a measure 
obtaining the authorisation beforehand, it’s a measure to ensure or to 
20 
distinguish, at least at a general level between a legitimate trap and 
something else that’s not really a legitimate trap, in other words if you 
find if General Booysen if, while General Booysen was with Colonel 
Madhoe, and they – and Colonel Madhoe was handing over the cash if 
there wasn’t this kind of provision, if later on the police charged both 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 194 of 212 
 
Madhoe and General Booysen and General Booysen says no it was a 
trap it will be difficult to know is it genuine, is it true or was he also 
engaging in some illegal activity but now in order to get out of that he 
says, no as a police officer it was a trap. 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you have gone to the NPA and said, I’m asking for 
authorisation to conduct a trap, if you are caught in that situation by 
the police you can say, go to the NPA you’ll find that this trap has been 
authorised, I asked for it, then in that way you avoid a situation where 
the police can get involved in illegal things and claim that they were 
10 
conducting a trap. 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Now was there a Section 252A authorisation for a 
sting operation that took place on the 8 t h of September 2011? 
ADV MANYATHI:   According to the evidence in the docket there was 
authorisation. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Okay, now you have spoken about the sting 
operation can you just tell us, where did the sting operation take place? 
ADV MANYATHI:   If I recall – yes I remember now it – both Madhoe 
20 
and Booysen were based in the office of the Provincial Head Quarters 
of the police in Durban.  The operation occurred in the basement in the 
parking lot of that building. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Okay was it during this sting operation that the 
R1.3million was exchanged, that you mentioned earlier? 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 195 of 212 
 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Can you just – do you know where the money was 
found after the exchange? 
ADV MANYATHI:   It was found in Madhoe’s car – sorry it was found in 
Booysen’s car. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Okay and the pre-dated report, was the pre-dated 
report ever exchanged? 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes it was found in Madhoe’s car. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry what was found in Colonel Madhoe’s car 
10 
what was found in General Booysen’s car? 
ADV MANYATHI:   Initially I got it the other way around, the money, 
R1.362million was found in Booysen’s car and the report was found in 
Madhoe’s car. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay at the time of the arrest? 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay so Colonel Madhoe had succeeded in 
transferring the cash from his car to General Booysen’s car? 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja as you understood the position. 
20 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes if I remember the specifics, they arranged to 
meet at the basement in the parking and then Booysen said, come to 
my car.  So Madhoe entered – gave him the money and Booysen gave 
Madhoe the report and then Madhoe walked to his car.  Once he 
entered the police officers who were at strategic spots then arrested 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 196 of 212 
 
him on the spot. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Okay, do you know if the sting operation was 
recorded in any way?  
ADV MANYATHI:    If I remember correctly there was an audio 
recording. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Now we know that R1.362million was given to 
General Booysen.  What was the benefit to Madhoe who gave General 
Booysen this money, you have mentioned it, if you can just crystallise 
it? 
ADV MANYATHI:   Benefit in what sense? 
10 
ADV NICHOLSON:  What did he get this money…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja the question would be, why did Colonel Madhoe 
give General Booysen such a lot of money. 
ADV MANYATHI:   So that as initially asked, so that Booysen would 
pre-date the preliminary report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Now if we go to paragraph 17 of RR…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So in other words he was buying him so to speak, 
buying him to do this for him? 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that’s the normal language. 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja it was an inducement ja okay. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   If we go to page 4 of RR3 at paragraph 17, can 
you just read that paragraph. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 197 of 212 
 
ADV MANYATHI:   17? 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Yes. 
ADV MANYATHI:   “Madhoe admitted, after his arrest that the cash that 
was handed over to Booysen had been provided by Panday”. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   How do you know this? 
ADV MANYATHI:   Because it was in the docket as in the evidence of 
the members of the sting operation who – I can’t remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who made statements. 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes they made statements. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
ADV MANYATHI:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you had – when the docket was before you, you 
had the report that had Mr Panday’s fingerprint? 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then you had statements by members of the 
investigation team who said Colonel Madhoe said to them after he had 
been arrested that Mr Panday had provided the cash that he gave to 
General Booysen. 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
ADV MANYATHI:   An interesting point of law because there have been 
developments at that time an admission was admissible against another 
person as in a court yes, the laws changed. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Chair, the Chair asked my very next question, what 
was the evidence against Panday because in page 5 paragraph 18 you 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 198 of 212 
 
stated that you applied for a warrant of arrest for Panday. 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes.  The Chair has summarised the two main 
aspects that I considered, of course there were other circumstantial 
aspects that I applied my mind to.  What motivated me or rather what 
informed my decision to say there’s a case, and I am going to apply for 
a warrant to have him arrested I was mindful that you know if I was 
having him arrested I could pursue it, so a fingerprint is found on a 
report which is strictly supposed to be within the police services, he is 
not a policeman, he is a businessman, what is his fingerprint doing on 
a report. 
10 
 
Two the person who provides them R1.362million makes an 
admission that, sorry the person that gives Booysen the money makes 
an admission that Panday provided the money obviously in my head as 
I said you also look at other circumstantial aspects, without 
undermining him but I considered the probability that a Colonel in the 
police would have so much money. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   And you also mentioned ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, the point you make is that it was unlikely 
that a Colonel in the police would have so much money to give to 
somebody else? 
20 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   And you had also mentioned that Panday was a 
suspect in the fraud matter? 
ADV MANYATHI:  Yes.  
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 199 of 212 
 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Do you know if Panday was ever arrested? 
ADV MANYATHI:   For the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well firstly did you get the warrant? 
ADV MANYATHI:   I got it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, was it carried out? 
ADV MANYATHI:   It was executed and they arrested him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, okay. 
ADV MANYATHI:   And I enrolled him in other words I added him to who 
was already accused on the roll. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV NICHOLSON:   At the time you arrested Panday at that point in 
time what was your estimation on the prospects of a successful 
prosecution in the corruption matter, in this corruption matter we’re 
dealing with. 
ADV MANYATHI:   As I said I ultimately indicted both in the high court, 
so there was a case, very good case, in my view and experience. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Okay you had also mentioned that you were 
allocated this matter by the Acting DPP, Advocate ...[indistinct]. 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Did you keep him appraised of the progress in the 
20 
prosecution? 
ADV MANYATHI:   I did. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Did he ever express any reservations to you 
regarding the evidence? 
ADV MANYATHI:   No. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 200 of 212 
 
ADV NICHOLSON:   At RR3 page 5, paragraph 19 you say that 
presentations were made to Advocate Lawrence Mgwebe, the National 
Head Specialised Commercial Crime Unit, known as the SCU? 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Perhaps it is convenient if at this point you can 
just explain the structures within the NPA. 
ADV MANYATHI:   I will deal with the two units that are relevant here.   
You had – it still is the case so I will speak in the past tense, you had 
the National Prosecution Services which was called NPS, under which 
all the officers of the DPP’s in all provinces fell and in terms of 
10 
hierarchy under the DPP you will have the Deputy Directors of Public 
Prosecutions, that is in terms of the High Court, and then on the side 
still falling under the Deputy you have Chief Prosecutors who were in 
charge of clusters.   Clusters are made of districts and then under 
Chief Prosecutors you have SPP’s who are in charge of districts and 
then your prosecutions below that.   
 
That was the NPS which was called the general section, under 
which I and Ms Clarke fell.   And then on the side you would have the 
Specialised Commercial Crimes Unit, the SCCU.  The National Head of 
SCCU was based in Pretoria was Advocate Mgwebe and then SCCU’s 
20 
would have offices and courts in major centres. 
 
For instance in KwaZulu Natal the entire Province there’s one 
SCCU office and court that would be in Durban.  There were you know 
other officers and courts in major cities like Johannesburg, Pretoria, 
Cape Town. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 201 of 212 
 
ADV NICHOLSON:   So the point is the NPS didn’t fall under the SCCU 
but it was a parallel structure? 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Okay. 
ADV MANYATHI:   If I may elaborate something important, when 
Advocate all along there were just two separate structures in the sense 
that the one hand did not know what the other hand was doing until 
Advocate Mendes Melone became the National Director of Public 
Prosecutions and he changed, so when he came on board he said he 
doesn’t want a situation where for instance I will use KwaZulu Natal the 
10 
DPP in this case Advocate Mlodjwa, is in charge of the whole province, 
but he doesn’t know what is happening at SCCU which is situated in 
Durban within his province, he said no there should be two centres of 
power in terms of SCCU, the DPP must be involved and so is the 
spatial director who sits in Pretoria, in this case Advocate Mgwebe. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Okay, in which section did you and Advocate 
Wendy, I think you said Clarke, work? 
ADV MANYATHI:   General Section, NPS. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   And under which section did both the fraud and 
corruption prosecutions reside? 
20 
ADV MANYATHI:   The fraud matter I don’t know whether it was ever 
involved but at the time it was not on the roll.   Remember I said there 
was still a long way to go, there was still going to be forensic audit 
report etcetera, so it was no on the roll, it was still being investigated, 
the corruption matter was under the general section but that’s one 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 202 of 212 
 
aspect where I said I need to add, it actually came back to my 
recollection as I was sitting there, initially this corruption case was 
held at the commercial crimes court and then it was moved to the 
general court, which would be Durban Regional Court, but it was 
allocated to me by Mlodjwa who is in charge of the general section and 
also technically in charge of SCCU and I was in the general section. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Okay did it make any sense for representations to 
be made to the head of SCCU and not to the Acting DPP KZN? 
ADV MANYATHI:   It’s the point I make in my affidavit, I am just saying 
I don’t know why representations were made to Mgwebe, that is as far 
10 
as I can say. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on one second, did the corruption, did 
corruption matters not fall under his unit or they did, fraud and 
corruption? 
ADV MANYATHI:   Under the Specialised Commercial Crimes Unit? 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, they didn’t under general? 
ADV MANYATHI:   Fraud yes, certain frauds. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Certain types of fraud. 
ADV MANYATHI:   Certain types fraud. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would fall under his unit? 
20 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes complex fraud. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Complex fraud, commercial fraud. 
ADV MANYATHI:   Commercial fraud more precisely because we also in 
the general section we did a lot of fraud, very serious fraud I did 
mainly. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 203 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Okay so commercial fraud would fall under 
his unit. 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But there would be a lot of other fraud cases that did 
not fall under his unit. 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And those would fall under general section. 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And corruption, would there be some corruption 
cases that fell under his unit? 
10 
ADV MANYATHI:   If you look at the very establishment of that 
specialised commercial crimes unit I don’t think they were dealing with 
corruption, I mean by definition but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well unless, unless I guess they wouldn’t separate it 
if the fraud is part of corruption. 
ADV MANYATHI:   Probably yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If the – if it is commercial fraud but that commercial 
fraud is part of corruption then maybe it could fall within, that type 
could fall within his unit.  
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but this particular fraud would it fall under 
commercial fraud this kind of case or not? 
ADV MANYATHI:   I don’t know but something important Chairperson as 
I have said I only recalled this morning as I was sitting there that when 
I first went to court for this matter we appeared at the Commercial 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 204 of 212 
 
Crimes Court and then it was moved to Durban Magistrate’s Court 
which is in a separate building. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Now the representations that we refer to are at 
page 12 of RR3, attached to your affidavits as BM1. 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   If you look on the same page at the second 
unmarked paragraph can you read the first line. 
ADV MANYATHI:   Which paragraph? 
ADV NICHOLSON:   On the same page the second unmarked paragraph 
10 
starting from, well the bottom starts from we, the second we. 
ADV MANYATHI:   The one that says “we are instructed”? 
ADV NICHOLSON:   That’s correct. 
ADV MANYATHI:   Read the entire one? 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Yes, well read the first line. 
ADV MANYATHI:  “ 
“We are instructed to make the following representations to 
your offices as our client is of the reasonable belief that your 
offices have clearly not been appraised of the circumstances 
wherein our client is a potential witness in matters of national 
20 
interest involving both provincial and national levels of SAPS 
management, intelligence, covert operations, the Hawks and 
others.” 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Okay it was just the first line I was interested in, 
we are instructed to make the following representations to your offices.   
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 205 of 212 
 
Now on whose behalf were these presentations made? 
ADV MANYATHI:   Interestingly the attorney is present here.  They  
were made on behalf of accused number one only, Madhoe. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Okay, now what do you make of the line there t hat 
you read, the first line? 
ADV MANYATHI:   In what sense Mr Nicholson, I am just reading this 
as an attorney saying to Mgwebe I have been instructed to make 
representations to your office. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   To your offices yes. 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes. 
10 
ADV NICHOLSON:   My reading is that Colonel Madhoe advised his 
attorney to make representations to Advocate Mgwebe’s office, and not 
to your office. 
ADV MANYATHI:   I wouldn’t want to go that far because I don’t know, I 
was not privy to the discussions between Madhoe and the attorney. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I am not sure that I follow what you are talking 
about.  Of course when that sentence says we are instructed, written by 
an attorney, it means our client has asked us to do A, B, C, D so we are 
instructed to make the following representations to your offices.   The 
reference to your offices is the reference to the offices of the National 
20 
Head of the Special Director of Public Prosecutions in Pretoria.  In 
Pretoria, so I am not sure that I follow what the issue is. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Chair the point that I was trying to establish was 
my reading of that line is that the instructions were given to make 
representations to the SCCU’s offices and not to the DPP’s offices 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 206 of 212 
 
where the representation should have been made, but Advocate 
Manyathi has stated that he doesn’t see it that way. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Well I don’t know maybe the two of you 
were talking cross-purposes.  The letter is addressed to Pretoria, to the 
National Head of the Special Commercial Crime Unit.   Obviously when 
the author of the letter says we are ...[indistinct] to make the following 
representation to your offices that is the offices of the National Head in 
Pretoria. 
ADV MANYATHI:   Advocate Mgwebe? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MANYATHI:   Basically yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that’s what you also understand it to be saying? 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  There is no confusion you bare both on the 
same page but I thought it looked like you were not on the same page. 
ADV MANYATHI:   Perhaps the difference Chairperson is this, Mr 
Nicholson is saying – is reading into that we instructed to make 
representations to you, Advocate Mgwebe and not to Malodgwa.   It is 
the latter aspect that I am saying I am not willing to go to that extent. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but that’s not what the letter says isn’t it? 
20 
ADV MANYATHI:   One could read the letter in that light. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me see, maybe I am missing something.   We are 
instructed to make the following representation to your offices as our 
client is of the reasonable belief that your offices have clearly not been 
apprised of the circumstances wherein your client, our client is a 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 207 of 212 
 
potential witness in matters of national interest involving both 
Provincial and National levels of SAP management, blah-blah-bah.   
What they may be saying is we – they are saying definite we are 
approaching you at national level, that is now specialised commercial 
crime unit, and then they seem to be saying the reason why we are 
approaching you is that you might not have been appraised of the 
circumstances wherein our client is a potential witness in such and 
such a matter involving the Provincial and National levels SAPS.  I am 
not sure that I see what the point is, I am not sure. 
 
If the point is they were supposed to make representation 
10 
somewhere else that might be a separate point but I don’t see that from 
that paragraph they are necessarily saying we have a particular reason 
for not sending it to the Provincial Office.   I am not sure if it’s 
important but you tell me if it is important to understand. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   No Chair I think we can leave it ...[indistinct] . 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   That same paragraph mentions that our client is a 
potential witness, can you see that? 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Do you know if he is a witness in any matters of 
20 
national interest? 
ADV MANYATHI: I don’t know.   In fact in my memorandum in which I 
responded to Advocate Mgwebe’s covering memorandum wherein he 
attached his representations I said Madau is clouding issues, most of 
those aspects that he is talking about I was not privy to, they did not 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 208 of 212 
 
feature in the corruption matter so I don’t know what he was talking 
about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was just statements which were not substantiated. 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He did not put up anything to say what he was 
talking about when he was referring to matters of national interest? 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes, also the key word he said he is a potential 
witness, not as if it is actual. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but potential or not, potential witness or not 
these matters of national interest he is referring to he didn’t put up any 
10 
facts to tell you what he was talking about. 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes, no he didn’t. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   During this time you had already mentioned that 
Madau was an accused in the – was a suspect in the fraud matter? 
ADV MANYATHI:   Yes. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see we are at five, estimate of how much time we 
need? 
ADV NICHOLSON:   We are about halfway Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   We are about halfway.   We won’t get to the next 
witness hey? 
ADV NICHOLSON:   No Chair, it seems not Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I think I will go up to half past five, let’s see if 
we can finish, will that suit you in terms of going back? 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 209 of 212 
 
ADV MANYATHI:   Now that the Chair has asked I will say, I didn’t want 
to spoil the record, my flight is at seven which means I will have to 
check in at six, I don’t know, Johannesburg has a reputation of traffic. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MANYATHI:   I don’t know, what’s the latest I should leave here 
with the traffic to check in at six? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MANYATHI:   And there is no flight after seven. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   My learned friend has just indicated that if he 
misses the flight we will put him on another flight., 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But he says there is no other flight after that? 
ADV MANYATHI:   Chairperson that is based on what Mr Nicholson 
said. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He told you previously. 
ADV MANYATHI:   Told the Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   That is correct Chair I did mention that the 
administration staff had indicated that there is only a flight at seven 
and that’s the flight we booked Advocate Manyathi on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that remains the position, as far as you know. 
20 
ADV NICHOLSON:   That remains the position as far as I know. 
ADV MANYATHI:   Sorry the other option is this, which I am willing to 
sacrifice, but it is a sacrifice in the real sense of the word.  I have a 
matter at Ulundu Regional Court tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 210 of 212 
 
ADV MANYATHI:   There is no way I will  not be there, worst case 
scenario if the Commission would hire a car for me to drive to Durban I 
am willing to sacrifice and leave it at Durban at the airport. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, yes, look I think that’s a good gesture but I think 
we might not finish in 30 minutes time.  I am saying that because Mr 
Nicholson I think probably you and I are quite poor in estimating 
anything because you had said you thought we might finish both 
witnesses within one and a half hours, so I think what we should do, we 
should stop unfortunately and allow the witness to catch his plane and 
then request that he should come back on the same day that the other 
10 
witness must come back, so that we can deal with matters properly.    
 
Now the other witness, that is Colonel ...[intervenes]  
ADV NICHOLSON:   du Plooy, Piet du Plooy? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I don’t know if I can ask for your estimate again 
of how long he might be? 
ADV NICHOLSON:  Colonel du Plooy is definitely going to be longer 
than Advocate Manyathi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, we might have to find another time to bring them 
in.  Next week there are no witnesses who will be heard by the 
Commission because that’s the week that had been reserved for the 
20 
former President to come and give evidence, so one possibility is to 
find a day next week when then they can come back or to find another 
date not too far from now, so I think what should happen is let’s 
adjourn.  Before he leaves, before they leave you get information about 
possibilities, don’t confine yourself to next week, also look at later in 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 211 of 212 
 
February or early March, but also next week because I’m not sure.  It 
may be that we can use one of the days next week or it may be that we 
should rather put it later on in February.   
 
Would that be fine?  Yes, let’s do that, let’s allow him to catch 
the flight because as I say I also didn’t want to go beyond half past five 
and we might proceed and at half past five we are not done and when 
he drives all the way he would arrive in Durban after twelve midnight 
and then he must still drive from Durban tomorrow morning to where?   
ADV MANYATHI:   ...[Indistinct – mic off] I should be leaving Durban at 
half past five. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so I think let’s rather stop now and then you 
make those arrangements and then you come back to me and then I will 
fix a date for them to come back.  What about – when was Advocate 
...[indistinct] to come, because maybe he could come then too? 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Chair as I understand the position was Advocate 
...[indistinct] was supposed to come in this week but because the law 
enforcement team had to give some of our times away a date has not 
been set for him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no that’s fine, but he’s ready in terms of you 
have his statement. 
20 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have the statement, it’s a question of fixing a 
date? 
ADV NICHOLSON:   We have the statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You’ve got the statement. 
22 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 203 
 
Page 212 of 212 
 
ADV NICHOLSON:   I believe the 33 notices have been served. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay, that’s fine.   I just wanted to have an idea, 
later on you can tell me what the position is afterwards and then maybe 
tomorrow and then I can fix a date, but I think that’s fine for today, let’s 
allow Mr Manyathi to catch his flight.  So we are going to adjourn the 
proceedings, discussions will be held to arrange another date and we 
will ask you to come back. 
 
Okay, so we are going to then adjourn, we adjourn for the day. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise.
