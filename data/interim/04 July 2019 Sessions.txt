position you held? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA [through interpreter]:  Assisting in

CHAIRPERSON:  And what were the circumstances under which you 
10 
were required to prepare note verbal’s’? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA [through interpreter]:  The note

verbal’s? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA [through interpreter]:  In connection 
with this issue of …

Page 12 of 120 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was Mr Koloane your immediate superior? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA [through interpreter]:  Yes Mr 
Koloane was my superior at that point in time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no thank you.  Now you can go back to telling me 
what your role was in this – in this – in regard to this incident? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA [through interpreter]:  Okay. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Sorry I have just received word from 
the technicians.  Mr Matjila can you just move the microphone towards 
you. 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA [through interpreter]:  Okay. 
10 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you. 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA [through interpreter]:  I received a 
call from Ambassador Koloane to ask the Indian Delegation about the 
overflight clearance.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, I am sorry just start again I missed 
something in that sentence. 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA [through interpreter]:  I received a 
call from Ambassador Koloane to assist the Indian with the clearance.  
A few minutes… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the Indian government or … 
20 
MR 
WILLIAM 
MOLEFE 
MATJILA 
[through 
interpreter]: 
 
Yes 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay continue. 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA [through interpreter]:  I then finished 
speaking to Mr Koloane for that specific point in time. 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 13 of 120 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you remember on what date that was when you got 
this instruction from him? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA [through interpreter]:  No I am not 
quite certain Your Worship about the date. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay well the incident happened in – the landing of 
the aircraft happened on the 30 April 2013 and it appears that the 
discussions and preparations started happening early or may have 
started early in April but if you do wish to refresh your memory if there 
is a document where you know you can see the date. 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA [through interpreter]:  Oh yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Feel free to have a look. 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA [through interpreter]:  It was on the 
9 t h of Apirl. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so he – the instruction that Mr Koloane gave 
you was to assist with the clearance for the Indian government? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA [through interpreter]:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What did you understand that to entail that instruction 
to entail if he says, please assist with the clearance for the Indian 
government, what did you understand that to require you to do? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA [through interpreter]:  Seeing that 
20 
the Ambassador is senior to me there are actually used to receive some 
note verbal.  And then he will then hand over to me to process the – for 
the clearance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let me – I am sorry let me get that sentence 
correctly.  What is it that he will give to you is that the note verbal? 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 14 of 120 
 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA [through interpreter]:  Ja they are 
supposed to give me the note verbal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what would you do with the note verbal? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA [through interpreter]:  I check if the 
said note verbal contains all the information that we need.  In the note 
verbal they must specify Your Worship who is coming to visit?  What is 
the person coming to do in South Africa or the purpose of the visit?  Is 
he coming to meet the President or is he coming on his own capacity or 
on a private visit? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes continue and tell me what you do if it contains 
10 
that this information or different information. 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA [through interpreter]:  Yes if the note 
verbal states that the President from another country is coming in to 
meet the South African President we check it.  Our political desk must 
know or my director must know that there is another President from 
outside the country who is coming in.  For any President who is coming 
into South Africa or a state visit they are supposed to assign a protocol 
officer for that specific visit.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And who does the assigning – who assigns the 
[indistinct].  {Interpreter speaking over Chair] 
20 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA [through interpreter]:  My director 
Your Worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And who was your director at the time? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA [through interpreter]:  It was Ms 
Mason but she was out of the country. 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 15 of 120 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  In her absence who was performing her duties as 
director? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  Ms Mdledle 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Continue. 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
The 
(indistinct) is supposed to also be involved if there is any visit but in 
this matter or in this problem that we are having now all of those did 
not happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I am sorry.  Just repeat that.  I missed that. 
10 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  The problem 
that we are having of this Indian visit there is none of those that I have 
stated that happened your worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the usual procedures that are normally 
followed?  Is that what you are talking about? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
Yes 
Chairperson because normally the Director is the one who will call me if 
he got the formal request. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  But with this I 
20 
never received anything.  Even my Director did not know anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Is that request separate from the note verbal 
that we are talking about or is it the same thing that when – when you 
say a request? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  No.  They are 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 16 of 120 
 
separate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh they are two separate things? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
Yes 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if there is going to be a visit by a Head of State 
from another country on official business to meet with the President of 
South Africa you say there would be a note verbal that should be issued 
– that should be available? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
Yes 
Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in this case you say there was no note verbal and 
there was no request as well.  Is that what you are saying? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
Yes 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the request would be a request for what that you 
say was not there in this case? 
INTERPRETER:  Pardon.  I did not hear that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The request … 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you say was not there would have been a 
20 
request for what? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  The request 
Chairperson that I am talking about is actually the note verbal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, I – I thought earlier on when I asked you whether 
it is a separate – the request and the note verbal were separate things.  
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 17 of 120 
 
I thought you said they were separate things. 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
I 
misunderstood. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  So when you talk about the request and 
the note verbal you are talking about the same thing? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
Yes 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  So now we know that one of the things 
that you say would normally happen that did not happen was that the – 
there should have been a note verbal but on this case there was no 
10 
note verbal? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
Yes 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What other step or procedure or item in the procedure 
that you – was normally followed which did happen in this case? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  At the State 
visit when they assign the Protocol Officer he must arrange some 
accommodation, transport and the venue for the meetings.  In this point 
in time all of those did not happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And who was the Protocol Officer at the time who 
20 
would have performed – who would have done that if this was a State 
visit and there was going to be a Head of State coming to South Africa? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  As far as the 
State visits there are quite a number of us.  We are many and we are 
rotating Chairperson. 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 18 of 120 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, it would have been a Protocol Officer who would 
have been assigned for this particular trip? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
Yes 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And who would have been the person to assign a 
Protocol Officer? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  Director - that 
is now my Director your worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In her absence who did you say was performing her 
duties? 
10 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA 
(through 
interpreter):  
Ms Noba Mdledle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you and what other step in the procedure 
that would normally have applied that did not apply that was not 
involved in this case? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  Normally when 
there are incoming visits into the country there will be meeting that 
must be held to prepare for the visit.  In this your worship no meeting 
did take place. 
CHAIRPERSO:  Okay and who would convene those meetings? 
20 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  The Protocol 
Officer assigned for that visit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thanks and then what other procedural step that 
would normally have been taken that was not taken in this instance? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  Normally I am 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 19 of 120 
 
the one who will send the note verbal to the air force requesting for the 
clearance but in this matter I was surprised that that note verbal went 
direct to the air force. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it was not sent by you this time? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
Yes 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who sent it? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  Chairperson 
we did not receive the note verbal as usual as we are supposed to.  I 
only received a call from the Ambassador.  Then they just sent me a 
10 
short or small message and then I forwarded that message to the air 
force. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you.  Do you want to take it from there?  
You have an idea what my interest …? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where my interest is?  Okay. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but I think just complete – let us – let us be sure 
all the procedural steps that he says used to be taken that he says 
were not taken.  Now we know that on his evidence one of them is the 
20 
note verbal and that was said by previous witnesses.  It was not there.  
He says that the other is that a Protocol Officer would be assigned to 
the trip.  That was not done. 
He has mentioned that he would be the one who would 
normally send the note verbal to the air force.  There was not note

verbal.  He did not send that but he says there was a message that he 
was given – a small message as he put it which he passed on.  Just 
follow up to see whether there are other procedural steps that he know 
– knows would normally be taken but were not taken and then take it 
from there. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Matjila when 
Ambassador Koloane called you what documents did you have relating 
to the Indian delegation? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  There was 
actually no document that I had or received from the Ambassador like 
10 
the note verbal itself. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Did you receive – Mr Matjila did you 
receive anything from the air force? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  No, I did not 
receive anything from the air force. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Mr Matjila am I correct in saying that 
all you had received is a call on behalf and from Ambassador Koloane? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And Mr Matjila the clearance number 
that was issued from the air force was done without any proper 
20 
non-verbal or authorisation from DIRCO? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  Yes that is 
true. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, did you want to add something? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  Yes.  I wanted 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 21 of 120 
 
to show Chairperson the clearance that I would normally receive from 
the air force. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Chair that would be paginated page 15 
of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay before we – we do that.  Mr Matjila let us 
just complete the part that I wanted to complete.  In terms of the 
procedure that was normally followed when there was a Head of State 
who was going to visit South Africa have you finished telling me the 
procedural steps that would normally be taken but were not taken on 
this occasion or are there still some that you want to tell me – 
10 
procedural steps that were not taken. 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
Yes 
Chairperson when the President from another country is coming to visit 
I will get the note verbal, which I will scan and then send it to the air 
force.  From there we will wait for two or three days and then they will 
then send me the approval. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  Then I will 
send it back to the Embassy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Would that normally complete your role for a 
20 
State visit? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
Yes 
Chairperson.  After I get the approval from the air force that shall have 
completed my role. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Yes, you want to … 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 22 of 120 
 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  DIRCO or my 
Director your worship we do not approve any flight clearances.  We 
only forward it to the air force. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, yes.  Okay.  Now in this case you did not forward 
to the air force any note verbal because there was known but you say 
you also did not or you forwarded a small message as you put it? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the air force.  Is that correct? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through 
interpreter): 
 
Yes 
the 
message that I sent your worship was to show that as the Ambassador 
10 
is our Head of the section that there is no way that I can refuse to do 
the job or the duties that I was given.  It was to show that I did 
something or the duty as instructed.  On the email that I sent to the air 
force there were three things.  Assist, (indistinct) and for your 
information and no approval your worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You want to take it from there? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes Chair.  Just to assist Mr Matjila is 
talking to a document that is in FF4 Chair from pages 198.  Mr Matjila it 
is the big file just right next to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  Yes I am 
there. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  In the middle of that page on 1-9-8 that 
is an email from you to the air – to the air force? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  Yes. 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 23 of 120 
 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And the message that you forwarded is 
on page 1-9-9. 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Chair can we read just that short 
message into the record? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Let him – ja – you – you can read it. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you Chair. 
“Dear William, as per our as per your discussion 
with Ambassador Koloane with regards to the 
request for flight clearances and landing at the 
10 
Waterkloof AFB for the Indian delegation kindly note 
that Ambassador Koloane telephonically approved 
the request, regards.” 
And this was sent from – on behalf of Ambassador Koloane office of the 
DDG State Protocol on 9 April 2013 08:33 am. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let us – let us go … 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  Yes that is 
true. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did – have you had a chance to interpret the actual 
text of the message Mr Interpreter.  It says  
20 
“Dear William, as per our as per your discussion 
with Ambassador Koloane with regards to the 
request for flight clearances and landing at the 
Waterkloof AFB for the Indian delegation kindly note 
that Ambassador Koloane telephonically approved 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 24 of 120 
 
the request.” 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  That is quite 
correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who did you receive this message from? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  From the 
Ambassador’s public assistance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now … 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  Or Personal 
Assistant your worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now the request – the request that 
10 
Ambassador Koloane was said to have telephonically approved what 
request was that and who had it come from? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  As far as this 
message 
is 
concerned 
your 
worship 
I 
lastly 
spoke 
to 
Ambassador Koloane and his PA and that was it your worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the – the – this email was addressed to you.  
Therefore one would expect that you would understand what it says and 
if you did not understand you would go back to them. 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
Yes 
Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So my question is what your understanding was 
of what request Mr Koloane’s PA was talking about in this email that he 
– that she said Mr Koloane had approved. 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
Look 
Chairperson I asked for some documentation which I could not receive 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 25 of 120 
 
and that is when I asked – I spoke to the PA and I told her seeing that I 
did not receive any documents there is nothing that I can do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that what you said to Mr Koloane’s PA after 
receiving this email at page 1-9-9? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Am I correct to take that to mean that you did not 
understand what request she was talking about in the email? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you remember what documents you asked for in 
response to this email when you spoke to Mr Koloane’s PA? 
10 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What documents – what documents did you ask for? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
The 
documents that I requested was a note verbal.  On the note verbal 
there shall be a flight plan or flight details.  Those were the things that 
I was asking for so that I could send them to the air force. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What did Mr Koloane’s PA say when you made this 
request? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  After I asked 
her to send me something in writing your worship that is when she sent 
20 
me this email.  That was the last time I then spoke to them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the discussion that you have told me about 
between yourself and Mr Koloane’s PA when you asked her for certain 
documents including the note verbal happened before she sent you the 
email at page 1-9-9. 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 26 of 120 
 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
Yes 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What had prompted that discussion between you and 
Mr Koloane’s PA? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  Because she 
is the one that is conduit between both of us. She is the one that will 
be sending us messages as we are working together. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did say that the first thing that, your first 
involvement was when Mr Kholoane asked you to assist with the 
clearance. Is that correct? 
10 
MR 
WILLIAM 
MOLEFE 
MATJILA 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
Yes, 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you said that at that stage you do not have any 
documentation relating to this visit? 
MR 
WILLIAM 
MOLEFE 
MATJILA 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
Yes, 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did Mr Kholoane tell you the conversation he had with 
you whether this was a visit by Head of State or by deputy President of 
another country or a visit that entailed some Ministers? Did you talk to 
you about those details? 
20 
MR 
WILLIAM 
MOLEFE 
MATJILA 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
No, 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he simply say please assist with obtaining a 
clearance for this Indian government request or exactly how do he put 
it to make sure you understood what he wanted you to assist with? 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 27 of 120 
 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  Yes, Your 
Worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he say this was a visit involving a Head of State 
or some Ministers or President from another country? Did he say that? 
MR 
WILLIAM 
MOLEFE 
MATJILA 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
No, 
Chairperson. He just said I must assist the Indian delegation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At that stage, at the stage of that conversation with 
Mr Kholoane, did you know what Indian delegation he was talking 
about? 
MR 
WILLIAM 
MOLEFE 
MATJILA 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
No, 
10 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you ask him for any information about this visit by 
this Indian delegation? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you know where to find information about the 
Indian delegation? Is that why you didn’t ask because you knew where 
you would find the information? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where would you find the information? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  As I have 
20 
stated that whenever there is a State visit we get the note verbal but if 
there is no note verbal there is no way that we would know that the 
Indian delegation or the Brazilian delegation is coming into South 
Africa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but my question is, you didn’t ask him for more 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 28 of 120 
 
information about the Indian delegation that he was talking about and 
that was visit he wanted you to help with in terms of the clearance and 
you said you were to find the information. Now where, the question is 
where we going to find the information? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  As I have 
stated that we are given these tasks or duties by our director and if 
there is no task or duties from the director means there is nothing then. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does that mean that you didn’t asking for more 
information because you are going to wait for your director or the 
person who was performing your director’s duties to give you more 
10 
details about the visit? 
MR 
WILLIAM 
MOLEFE 
MATJILA 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
Yes, 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you waited and the person who was 
performing your director’s duties ask you to do anything? 
MR 
WILLIAM 
MOLEFE 
MATJILA 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
No, 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that answer mean you did not wait for your director 
or person performing your director’s duties to give you instructions? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  Look, yes if 
20 
the director gave us some tasks I should have received the note verbal 
but till today whenever received a note verbal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. I think there may be some misunderstanding. 
Am I correct to say you waited to see whether the person performing 
your director’s duties would give you instructions including a note 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 29 of 120 
 
verbal? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  Yes, I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and at what stage did you then speak to Mr 
Kholoane’s PA about documents? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  It was during 
the period when she can send this email and that was it. That was the 
last time we spoke. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what prom – who called? Did you call her or did 
she call you? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  She’s the one 
10 
that called me. 
CHAIRPERSON of:  Okay. And what did she say in the telephone 
conversation with you? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  She said, Mr 
Matjila the Ambassador is saying please assist the Indian delegation 
with the clearance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So was she effectively repeating what Mr Matjila had 
said to you in a telephone conversation, no Mr Kholoane not Mr. Was 
Mr Kholoane’s PA in this telephone conversation repeating in effect 
what Mr Kholoane had sent to you in an earlier conversation? 
20 
MR 
WILLIAM 
MOLEFE 
MATJILA 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
Yes, 
Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And what did you say? I know some of the things that 
you said because you said your requested documents but just tell me 
the actual conversation how it went. This is what she said to you that 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 30 of 120 
 
Mr Kholoane said please assist and what did you say? Let me hear how 
the conversation unfolded. 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  As the PA is 
working at the State visit, she knows all the procedures of the State 
visit and then I told her that if we are not in possession of the note 
verbal there is absolutely nothing that we can do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now, do you only get involved in State visits? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  No, not only 
that, Your Worship. Even Head of State or our President is being 
assisted by myself whenever he is going abroad. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I am trying to understand what stage you 
understood that this was a State visit if at any stage that is what you 
understood because you didn’t ask Mr Kholoane whether this was a 
State visit. You didn’t ask him whether the visit involved a Head of 
State or Ministers. So I’m trying to understand whether at any stage 
your understanding was that this was a visit by Head of State, deputy 
Head of State, Ministers and if that is the case, at what stage you 
understood that to be the case? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  Look, after my 
director did not forward me with a note verbal that is when I realized 
20 
that this visit is not actually a State visit and that this might be a 
private visit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Up to that point, was your understanding that this was 
a State visit? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  No, Chair. 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 31 of 120 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before that point, you didn’t understand whether it 
was a State visit or private visit? 
MR 
WILLIAM 
MOLEFE 
MATJILA 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
Yes, 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So when the telephone call from Mr Kholoane, when 
the PA to Mr Kholoane called you, at that stage the time within which 
you were supposed to get note verbal, had it passed or you were still 
expecting to be given verbal at that stage? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  On that day, 
Your Worship, on the specific day when we were still waiting for the 
10 
note verbal, Your Worship, that is when during the course of the day we 
noticed that there is playing that was landing in the base, Your 
Worship, which was the Gupta plane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. I’m not sure if I follow that. The plate, we are 
still talking about the 9 t h of April. 
MR 
WILLIAM 
MOLEFE 
MATJILA 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
Yes, 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Okay let’s go back to the conversation with Mr 
Kholoane’s PA. She said, Mr Matjila Mr Kholoane says please assist 
with the clearance for this visit. Is that right? 
20 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And as I understand your evidence, you then said you 
needed a note verbal before you could assist. Is that correct? 
MR 
WILLIAM 
MOLEFE 
MATJILA 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
Yes, 
Chairperson. 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 32 of 120 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Act together with the note verbal you expected a flight 
or details of the flight? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So did you say to her, I can’t do, I can’t assist unless 
I get a note verbal? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  Yes, Chair, 
because as far as the State visit is concerned we don’t do things, Your 
Worship, telephonically. We do things according to documentation or 
the note verbal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what didn’t Mr Kholoane’s PA said when you said 
10 
you could not assist unless there was a note verbal? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  That was the 
end of our speech or talking, Your Worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did she undertake to convey your request to Mr 
Kholoane… (indistinct)? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  No, Chair. She 
didn’t tell me anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. And that what happened after that? Is that 
when you received the message from Mr Kholoane that you passed on 
to the Air Force? 
20 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would you normally get involved if the visit was a 
private visit and not a State visit? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  It is the 
President who is coming privately, yes I do assist because on a private 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 33 of 120 
 
visit it happens that he has come to meet our own State President even 
though he came privately. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. Then do you want to complete it? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes, Chair. I have also noted that is 
about 25 past but however, we can continue. I have just got you know, 
a singular question and to refer to Mr Matjila. He had put that he 
wanted to make reference to a document and that would be the 
conclusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. Maybe let’s use the time up to 11h30 and then 
we take the tea break. 
10 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  As the Chair pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Mr Matjila, just to conclude on the 
evidence that you have informed the Chair on. What has now changed 
to deter noncompliance of let’s just say the nonverbal’s at Derco and so 
forth? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  Can you 
repeat your question again? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes. What has now changed to deter 
noncompliance of the normal processes of the note verbal? 
20 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  At this point in 
time, if I sent a request at the Air Force I attach the letter from Derco 
and then I will send it with a stamp from Derco. And now on the note 
verbal they must state the full names of the President not VVIP. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Chair, that knows that he’s talking 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 34 of 120 
 
about is on paginated page 14. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I would like you to go to the message that he 
got from Mr Matjila which he sent to the Air Force. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Indeed, Chair. That would be the email 
sent to the Air Force forwarding that message you received on behalf of 
Ambassador Kholoane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At page 199? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The one that we are dealing with? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  It’s page 198. That’s the message that 
10 
he Mr Matjila had forwarded to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry Mr Matjila. Are you page 198 of Exhibit FF4? 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that an email that you sent, is that the email that 
you, covering email that you sent to the Air Force? 
MR 
WILLIAM 
MOLEFE 
MATJILA 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
Yes, 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It’s written; it seems to be addressed to SAAF 
overflights and then it copies a number of people and he says from 
Matjila WM and it was sent on Tuesday, April 9 2013 at 08h57 AM and 
20 
the subject is, ‘Request for flight clearances – Indian delegation’. Is 
that the message we are talking about? The covering email we are 
talking about? 
MR 
WILLIAM 
MOLEFE 
MATJILA 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
Yes, 
Chairperson. 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 35 of 120 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what did you attach to that covering email? Did 
you attach, what did you, ja where is the one that you attached to 
there? Is it the one at page 199? 
MR 
WILLIAM 
MOLEFE 
MATJILA 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
Yes, 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. And did you say that later on you received 
the approval or clearance from Waterkloof?

CHAIRPERSON:  Was the sending of this message the last thing you 
did in connection with the, with assisting with regard to this trip? 
10 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you have another conversation with Mr Kholoane 
in connection with this visit and your assistance? 
MR 
WILLIAM 
MOLEFE 
MATJILA 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
No, 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. Thank you. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you got anything? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Chair, besides Mr Matjila attempting 
earlier to refer to an Annexure of his confirmatory affidavit, there is 
20 
nothing further to leading evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. Mr Matjila, I think at this stage we are done 
with you. 
MR WILLIAM MOLEFE MATJILA (through interpreter):  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much for coming to give evidence.

General Petane and we had – he was a Brigadier General at the time 
and Misi, he’s a Major General now and then Colonel Dlomo who was a 
Colonel at the time he is a Brigadier General now, he was a scribe of 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 38 of 120 
 
the Board. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you, what was the mandate of 
the Board? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  The Board was convened 
by General Shoke? after the incident of the landing of the aircraft at 
the Air Force Base Waterkloof and then the Board was expected to 
determine whether in fact there was an authority and clearance for the 
aircraft to land there, then whether the policies and procedures were 
followed and if not, if there was anybody, or individuals who might 
have, at least violated any prescripts or any witnesses in the system to 
10 
be rectified, we had to determine that and be able to report – make 
findings and report back  with recommendation to the convener of the 
Board which was General Shoke. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you before we go into detail can 
you just – because in your statement you deal with what you had to do 
insofar as the Board is concerned but can you please identify your 
statement which appears at pages 1 to page 4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry did you say page 4? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Yes page – I beg your 
pardon Chair it’s, they put in as 1.4 I beg your pardon, yes it will be 
20 
page 1.1 to page 1.4 of Exhibit FF4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Are you there General, do you identify this 
is – did you sign this statement and do you identify your signature 
there? 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 39 of 120 
 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:     Yes I do. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Where is it? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  You’re talking about the 
affidavit? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes your signature appearing at page 1.4. 
GENERAL 
DERRICK 
MBUYISELO 
MGWEBI: 
 The 
signature 
is 
appearing at page 4. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and are the contents of what you’ve 
10 
put in that statement true and correct? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  They’re true. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  Now let’s talk about the – 
you’ve already outlined what the mandate of the Board was, how did 
you go about then investigating and discharging your mandate? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Well we had, first of all to 
look at who would be appearing before the Board and to determine that 
we had to look at the structure of the Defence Force and who is in 
charge for what. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  So all the military Air 
Force Bases are under the Chief of the Air Force and whatever happens 
there falls under his jurisdiction but anything which has got to do with 
information, intelligence then falls under the Chief of Defence 
Intelligence.  So from there they become the first individuals to give  
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 40 of 120 
 
sense of what actually happened and then from there , there would be 
structures, the levels of the structures you would have the Chief of the 
Defence Force which we’ll call level 2 and then you would have the Air 
Command Post which becomes level 3 and then we have the base itself 
which is Waterkloof Air Force Base, which becomes level 4 and all of 
them have got certain responsibilities and tasks you’ve got to 
understand so that to least – who is in charge for what and who reports 
to who.  So we followed that order to speak to those who were in 
command. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and the Chief of Air Force is General 
10 
Msimang, is that correct? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Yes it is Colonel 
Msimang. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So is that why you’ll find then that he’s 
very – his questions and statements, they appear quite early in the 
report. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Yes we had to follow that 
order. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes you followed order of seniority in 
interviewing them. 
20 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you, then you interviewed them, did 
you prepare a set of questions for them which they had to answer to or 
did you simply conduct oral interviews with all of them? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  It was oral interviews and 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 41 of 120 
 
those were probably not comfortable with that, they had to make 
statements but they have to at least all of them do that under oath? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and those interviews that were given 
under oath, were they recorded mechanically? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  They were recorded. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And the company that the Air Force used 
to record those, was it a company that is contracted to the Air Force 
and the – because the transcripts, I’ll deal with that aspect of a 
transcript that was questioned yesterday by one of the witnesses, Major 
Ntshisi, I just want to get you the name of the companies that was 
10 
doing the recordings, whether it is a company that’s contracted to the 
Defence Force and it appears in that bundle at page 282, it’s called 
IAfrica Transcription (Pty) Ltd. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Page? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Page 282. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:    Okay, yes I see. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you, just to follow the process 
after 
these 
interviews 
were 
conducted 
and 
then 
there 
were 
transcriptions were these kept under lock and key or were these 
safeguarded by the department or do you know whose responsibility it 
20 
was to make sure that the transcripts- the record, the recordings are 
not interfered with and the transcripts are kept safe. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  The Chief of Defence 
Force keep these transcripts and records under the legal department of 
the Defence, the military side of it. 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 42 of 120 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes and under your watch whilst you were 
conducting these interviews would you have kept these under lock and 
key to make sure that there was no tampering with the evidence? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It that what you did? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you.  Now let’s talk then about 
you having interviewed then the Chief of the Air Force, after 
interviewing the Chief of the Air Force, what is it that you found which 
would have indicated to you, that maybe there were certain processes 
10 
that were not followed? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  The – what transpired in 
terms of the incident is that the advisor to the Minister of Defence 
seemingly somewhere in February, early March did speak to the Chief 
of the Air Force enquiring about this possible landing of this aircraft 
and the Chief of the Air Force, having listened to that, that’s what he 
says to us or to the Board.  He in fact indicated that if that’s what is 
required they are advising that he should not approve the landing of 
this, so that was the first thing.  The second thing then, we then asked 
the Chief of the Air Force because after all that has been said and done 
20 
the aircraft did land, now the question is, the approval of the landing 
and the policy which governs that.  So it became quite clear that in 
terms of the policy framework there was a gap, what then, the Air Force 
was utilising is a standard operating procedure which then gives you 
boxes to tick whether this has been done, this has been done and also 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 43 of 120 
 
the challenge with that standard operating procedure is that the people 
at a lower level are the ones who determine but the interesting part 
about that is that if there is anything untoward it is expected that they 
report to the senior controller, the senior controller must report to the 
Commander of the Air Force Base command post who then reports to 
the Chief of the Air Force. So basically those were the – some of the 
challenges which then were quite clear and also in terms of number of 
government departments – because that base, Waterkloof is also 
understood and recognised as an entry point to South Africa and 
therefore if there are going to be visitors other government departments 
10 
as would be the case that the OR Tambo International, those 
government departments must be present but then what was missing t 
the time is a policy which governs that inter-departmental relations and 
workings to manage that, it was a policy missing.  So these were the 
kind of things which – at least which became glaring as we were 
interviewing the Chief of the Air Force. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And you were talking when we were 
dealing with the levels starting from the Chief of the Air Force you were 
dealing with level 4 and you said the standard operating procedures, 
they applied to level 4 and in your investigations then, if – did you find 
20 
that there were things that were not done properly within that level, 
that is level 4? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  The challenge with this 
request, 
you 
start 
seeing 
a 
Defence 
(indistinct) 
from 
India 
communicating with the Defence foreign relation which is correct but 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 44 of 120 
 
they are sharing what is going to happen and also requesting that they 
should be allowed to land. Now the foreign relations people share that 
information with some of their colleagues who are foreign relation but 
sitting at the Air Force and that again, in terms of warning, one can say 
is correct but the approval should go through DIRCO and DIRCO  it 
should go to the Secretariat of Defence and then they should meet with 
the Chief of Defence Force, but  that policy is guiding that, it’s not 
written, its not documented, it becomes a practice. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Then when that first one 
10 
from February because it’s starting 28 February it goes up to the 5 t h of 
March and nothing happens, it stopped and then the Indians from their 
side, the Defence Attaché decides to send it direct to level 4 and this is 
where then the level 4 people start processing it and then it becomes 
quite clear that the level 4 people they were looking at what was being 
said in terms of the request, from again the Defence Attaché of India 
and from there they realise that there’s nothing coming from DIRCO 
and then they tried to link up with DIRCO. And what transpired later on 
it becomes an email and that email is coming from a PA in my 
understanding, of Mr Koloane who’s – and then it goes to one of the 
20 
officials, I think it’s Mr Matjila who was there and then from Mr Matjila 
it goes to the Air Force again, level 4 and then you then find at level 4, 
the base itself has got a base Commander and then there’s a Movement 
Control Officer who becomes (indistinct). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 45 of 120 
 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:    Now (indistinct) 
manages that without the knowledge to a certain extent of his 
Commander. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And who was the Commander? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  The Commander was 
Brigadier General Matumane. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  General Matumane, yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  So then Matumane 
seemingly does not get involved and then Anderson runs it and then 
comes from the Air Force Command Post Sergeant Major at the time 
10 
Ntshisi and then who’s supposed to be – because that’s talking about a 
clearance a clearance means in terms of the length of the airstrip the 
width of the airstrip and the safety of the passengers when then all the 
issues speak to safety and the passengers is the landing strip and the 
aircraft at least (indistinct) what is possible at that Air Force Base and 
then that’s the clearance part of it and the clearance part of it, also it’s 
who are these people, what levels are they and are they in fact 
expected to land here.  So those are the boxes which they’re supposed 
to tick. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  What then becomes quite 
clear in this one right through in the discussion it’s just a delegation 
from India and of course from one of the states of India, I think 27 one 
of the 27 states and it’s just said it’s a Minister from one the states and 
they say Minister from the central level.  No names, no leader of the 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 46 of 120 
 
delegation in this part of the discussion among themselves right 
through. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And you found those to be irregular? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  First of all the Air Force 
Base Waterkloof there are those that are supposed to land there, the 
heads of state, and their deputies and it must be a Minister of a state 
coming from somewhere else, it must be cleared at least for the 
Defence Force at DIRCO for whatever special reason but there must be 
clearance from that level and any delegation who’s coming through 
there must be a leader of that delegation because protocol demands 
10 
that when that aircraft lands, then the protocol from the Defence Force 
there must be an officer which we call that officer, meet and greeter, he 
must meet the person who’s senior and greet the person and of course 
if he’s really an official person deserving the red carpet it must be 
rolled and then all the rest.  So this is why it’s important that there 
must be a leader of the delegation and the level of that person so that 
the meet and greet can be able to know, who is this person, so that one 
again was missing. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And – so as you were going along 
interviewing all these persons, then you would focus on the key people 
20 
that would have played key roles in the incident itself. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And you didn’t just interview generally but 
you had specific persons who were relevant for the purposes of 
executing your mandate. 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 47 of 120 
 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:    That’s correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And you have attached to the report 
various statements that were obtained from the various individuals but 
you may highlight persons that you have mentioned so far in evidence 
that you also obtained a statement from Lieutenant Colonel Anderson 
and that appears at pages 35 to 44 and you obtained from Lieutenant 
General Simunk that you’ve already mentioned and you’ve obtained one 
from Brigadier General Lombard, what was the position of General 
Lombard. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  He was a Commander – 
10 
General Officer Commanding, the Air Force Command Post. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  What would have been his involvement in 
the incident? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Now under him, there 
would be – first of all he is in charge of that base so he’s a 
Commander, you’re supposed to know what’s happening and you’d get 
that from your subordinates, they will be briefing you and in the 
morning there’s supposed to be sittings and there you get briefed about 
what has happened the previous day and what’s about to happen which 
deserve your attention as a Commander.  So he was supposed to have 
20 
been informed about all these, what’s happening. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Alright. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  So then he had to explain 
what happened and then under him of course there would be a senior – 
in relation to this one there’ll be a senior controller who is the actual 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 48 of 120 
 
person then who must sign and approve the clearance and it happened 
to be Lieutenant Colonel Van Zyl. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and did you get a – you do have a 
statement also at pages 45 to 50 sorry, and then I see you also 
obtained one from Brigadier General Matumane, that you mentioned. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   So all of these statements were obtained 
from them but then having done that then you would have reached – 
because we don’t have to go through all of these because you did the 
investigations and you made the findings and maybe can you just go 
10 
then – may I refer you to page 206 of the document, or maybe because, 
just to identify it formally because this is attached to your report, 
maybe we could start at page 199 because you made reference to it 
just now.  This is an email that has been referred to in the evidence of 
the two previous witnesses. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:    Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Or maybe we should just start it at page 
194, I beg your pardon General I would like us to start at page 193 
because I’d like you to explain to the Chairperson the difference 
between the RSA05 and RSA04. Could you just start at page 193? 
20 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Yes the RSA05 speaks to 
aircraft coming and flying into the Air Force Base Waterkloof, coming 
from outside South Africa then that becomes the form to be filled to do 
the clearance. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And who completes this form? 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 49 of 120 
 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:    Well the form is 
supposed to be completed by somebody under Van Zyl.  Now in this 
particular case, the person who is supposed to have filled that form 
looking at that – if one is looking at this particular one, it becomes a 
Ntshisi who was a Warrant Officer Class 1 at the time, that’s referred 
under inquiry, so he’s the one who filled the form. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  But then at the end of the 
day, the person who takes responsibility of whatever changes are done 
there becomes Van Zyl who signs it at the bottom. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  He signed at the bottom there, yes thank 
you and then RSA04, that clearance, what is it about? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  That one it’s an aircraft 
which is within the borders of South Africa but again it’s going to land 
at the Air Force Base, so it becomes that one but this particular one 
was a request which was speaking to - about seven helicopters and two 
fixed winged aircraft which were going to be playing a role in moving 
this delegation from Waterkloof to somewhere in the area of Sun City, 
Pilansberg.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and this too would be signed by 
20 
Colonel Van Zyl? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Same story the inquiry is 
Ntshisi and signed by Van Zyl because it’s kind of spoke to one 
mission, you can call that because it was a mission therefore that 
mission had to be done the same individuals. 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 50 of 120 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Yes thank you and then when you said to 
the Chairperson that – your investigations revealed that there was an 
email that was sent by a PA to Matjila and then Matjila sent it, were you 
referring to the email that appears at page 199 and the one appearing 
at 198? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:    Yes I see. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you. And then at page 200 you 
then summarise the events and then you make your findings as the 
Board at page – they start from page 206. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Yes I see. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, could you just summarise for the 
Chairperson those very important findings that you made after you had 
heard all this evidence, you had read all the statements that were 
submitted and then what were your findings? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Well according to what 
was expected to happen there, is that the Board of inquiry in fact came 
to realise that the Air Force and the Defence Intelligence they knew 
about the request and the proposal and this became quite clear 
roundabout the 28 t h of February and of course foreign relation did 
receive the copies that there will be people and of course also it 
20 
(indistinct) seemingly confirmed what has happened for this is it was a 
communication between DIRCO, of course claiming that it was coming 
fro Mr Koloane and then also Indian Navy Captain Chetty sitting in the 
High Commission of India then all what they were saying there were 
going to be two or three Ministers coming in, this was the kind of 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 51 of 120 
 
mention being made and of course Anderson also seemingly have 
confirmed and probably told Ntshisi that according to Mr Koloane this is 
known and Anderson also mentioned the question of  number one, 
because – relating number one in the South African context with the 
President. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes is that what you mention in paragraph 
28D? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Yes so then it becomes 
quite clear that the Air Force structures were not necessarily 
communicating within the Air Force, because you would have Anderson 
10 
not necessarily giving full information to his Commander who’s 
Matumane and also you have Matumane not necessarily playing his role 
in all that was happening.  Why one is saying this in terms of the 
findings, now Anderson begins to change the furniture without telling 
anybody at the Air Force Base which we don’t do that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Yes, when you say, changing the 
furniture, where was this furniture? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:   At the lounge because 
there was going to be a reception so she decided to change the – which 
was suiting that and decorated the way it was expected by those who 
20 
were going to decorate and also she then allows that there must be 
cultural groupings and then photographs, people with cameras came in 
and then a number of cars came in again nobody seems to be aware 
except Anderson in this particular case.  So these are the things that 
becomes visible and if you look at the role of the – what I’ll call for this 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 52 of 120 
 
Board, I’ll call it, the Military Intelligence Officers this is why Defence 
Intelligence.  You would have Commanders you would have people 
working 
but 
they 
are 
Military 
Information 
Officers, 
now 
their 
responsibility is to, when they pick something which is out of the 
ordinary they must be able to bring it to the attention of the Commander 
and those structures are developed by the Air Force and they are 
available at the Air Force Base Waterkloof.  Now the question is, when 
all this was happening, furniture was being changed, and people were 
making these arrangements, where were they, to whom did they report 
and this again becomes glaring in terms of the witnesses of the system. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  And of course they are 
trained and prepared in different (indistinct) and divisions but that’s a 
responsibility to empower and train them of the Chief of Defence 
Intelligence. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes can I just take you back to – or maybe 
take you to paragraph F, 28F. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Where you deal with the role of the 
intelligence not knowing this aircraft. What was – what ought to have 
20 
happened as soon as maybe supposing that there was an indication or 
a request that there is this aircraft coming from another country into 
the country.  What would have been the role of intelligence there 
insofar as that aircraft is concerned? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  The first thing you have 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 53 of 120 
 
got seven helicopters landing very early in the morning and then you 
got two fixed [indistinct] landing later on and you then get to know that 
those who are in command at a higher level than those who were within 
the base do not know what is happening.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.   
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  And of course an hour or 
two later you have got the airbus landing.  Again the question is if 
those aircraft which landed about two hours earlier were known and 
then they were interrogated and it was understood what was happening 
somebody was supposed to report to the seniors and then that two 
10 
hours later that airbus if it was – since it was not approved by the 
Minister and the Chief of the Air Force was aware and the Chief of 
Intelligence was aware and the Chief of Defence Force was aware then 
there is no way if those intelligence officers or information officers did 
pick up that information and report it correctly. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So that… 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  So the aircraft would not 
have landed two hours later. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Because they would have prevented 
it from landing? 
20 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  They would have picked 
the first ones up. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  And then they would have 
known that something is wrong and then we cannot just have seven 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 54 of 120 
 
helicopters landing in a base and nobody reports it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Alright thank you.  And then can we 
move on or can highlight just those that you believe are quite 
important. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Sorry? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  You may proceed General 
thank you. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Okay.  Then of course 
what then becomes clear in terms of the finding the link between the 
Chief of the Air Force and the Chief of Defence Intelligence and within 
10 
their own structures also going down there seems to be in terms of 
communication a little bit of weakness in the links and sharing 
information there.  That is what we at least – and clearing and 
authorisation again of the – of that aircraft at the base it is the policy – 
the policy framework which guides that not the SOP, not the Standard 
Operating Policy. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Then also it was quite 
clear that there is a requirement for that.  Even the approving cell at 
the Air Force Command Post the approving cell they were able to do 
20 
what they did.  Now you would find that this Van Zyl was almost one 
month in the post. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Because he was standing 
in for somebody who attended a course.  Now of course if you take that 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 55 of 120 
 
check list where you are going to tick the boxes now you answer 
yourself a question.  Did Van Zyl interrogate that even if he [indistinct] 
so did he interrogate that.  Now he was relying on Ntshisi but Ntshisi 
himself then you would find that Ntshisi in fact had his own challenges 
and he was asking all the right questions. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  From Anderson, From the 
Defence Attaché, from Matjila, from Mr Koloane he was asking all the 
right questions. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Ys. 
10 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  And he knew what was 
wrong the question is did he share that information for Van Zyl to make 
a decision – an informed decision.  If you look at that there is 
something which is not gelling so something is wrong there.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  So this is why I am saying 
for me if you look at [indistinct] that approving cell was able to hide 
and led to a decision which the request was approved.  And again that 
request if you look at it there is nowhere where Mr Koloane signed 
anything except that somebody says and from his office a verbal 
20 
approval has been done.  Even in the email.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  But do we work on verbal 
approval?  Do we work on emails?  And the answer is no. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And those are the standard practices 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 56 of 120 
 
within the defence force? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  And officer sitting at the 
level of a Lieutenant Colonel should have known that.  A Sergeant 
Major with the experience of Ntshisi should have picked that up and 
then they should have said no this is not on.  And then they should 
have requested for a better formal at least information coming from 
DIRCO. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  They did not. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It appears from Mr – Major Ntshisi’s 
10 
evidence that when he got the call from Ambassador Koloane and that 
was – and then the email from Mr Matjila he looked at it and he thought 
this was all appropriate.  But I just want to understand is he allowed as 
a Major to take instructions from an Ambassador who falls within 
DIRCO? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  The Ambassador Koloane 
is sitting at a higher level in another government department. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  The formal way of 
communication between the two government departments should be a 
20 
written one and again it should go the right level.  And then any person 
at a level 4, level 3 should be receiving direction orders instructions 
from his or her only commanders. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  So there was no way that 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 57 of 120 
 
they should have implemented whatever that was coming from Mr 
Koloane without clearing. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  With the commander? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  With their commanders. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  You have said that it is not clear whether Major 
Ntshisi told Mr Van Zyl everything that he should have told him.  He 
said here yesterday that is Mr Ntshisi, Major Ntshisi that he told Mr Van 
Zyl everything from the beginning of this request or his involvement up 
to the point where he went to him for him to make a decision.  Is that 
10 
consistent with what he told you during the inquiry, the board inquiry? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  The Sergeant Major when 
we ask all these questions it became quite clear that the Sergeant 
Major was aware of what was happening.  But the information shared 
with Van Zyl is not in fact reflecting what he was aware about all the 
time.  That is on his side he did not necessarily share everything.  But 
again Van Zyl has got a responsibility that he is a senior person and he 
is an accounting and responsible for what he does.  Looking at the – 
that SOP and looking at the boxes to be ticked he also had at least a 
duty to ask the relevant questions. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now as I understand the position to the extent that Mr 
Van Zyl’s information was that the aircraft that was going to be bringing 
these visitors was going to be commercial aircraft for purposes of 
allowing it to land at Waterkloof he could only allow it as I understand 
the position if it was bringing a head of state, deputy head of state or 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 58 of 120 
 
some national ministers is that understanding correct? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Chair your understanding 
is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And is it also correct that such an aircraft in order for 
him to allow it there would have had to be a note verbal that he would 
have received? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  A note verbal would be 
coming from the DIRCO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  And then indicating the 
10 
delegation and the nature of the delegation and the nature of the visit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So is it correct to say one of the things he 
would have looked for to find out which – find out if it was there would 
have been the note verbal? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  He should have asked for 
the note verbal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  And to confirm the nature 
of the visit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  And delegation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if he was – if he did not get a note verbal and got 
something else is it correct that in terms of the procedures then he 
should not have provided clearance? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  That is correct Chair. 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 59 of 120 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Obviously here he did not find any note verbal so 
would it be consistent with your understanding when you presided in 
the inquiry that he provided clearance knowing that there was no note 
verbal and therefore that this was not right. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  The challenge with him 
with the benefit of doubt in terms of being in that post although senior 
as it might be being one month and the experience and also the ease of 
handing over and taking over whether that [indistinct] hand over take 
over was done which then might have led to a gap.  But in… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Things being equal his 
[indistinct] [coughing] not have approved that request. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  He was standing in on that day for 
somebody else but his position within the Air Force would it not have 
been a position that would have meant that he would have known what 
the requirement are? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Chair coming from a 
different environment within the air force he might not necessarily have 
the nitty gritty and details of what is required. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay,  okay. 
20 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  And this is why Chair one 
would say if then the air force and himself they did hand over and take 
over that the one who was going on leave brought on board a little bit – 
the one was taking – going to take over brought on board a little bit 
earlier so that they can sit together and take one through that process 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 60 of 120 
 
so that when one finally is in charge in the absence of the person who 
has been doing it he is able to see any gaps. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Again that led to this 
situation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Thank you.  Then may 
you then proceed again – is there any other one that you wish to 
highlight?  I think you have dealt with J as well.  But then what follows 
you then found that certain people should be held accountable for 
10 
whatever non-compliance with procedures were and you deal with those 
in paragraph 30 of the report.  That would be at page 209.   
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  200 and? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  209. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  209. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  30A Van Zyl did approve 
and authorise the landing without proper checking and complying with 
the air force instruction.  Now that air force instruction mainly speak to 
the issues of what needs to be done so he did not and also the SOP 
20 
which speaks to the over flying and landing rights.  So… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You found that he was – he must be held 
responsible? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and then Ntshisi? 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 61 of 120 
 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Ntshisi yes for facilitating 
and influencing the approval of the request while knowing that it does 
not comply with the air force instruction and the SOP. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Anderson for advising 
Ntshisi wrongly because when Ntshisi goes there and then he sets a 
one he mentioned again Ambassador Koloane and then he mentioned – 
she mentions number 1.  Now obviously that kind of information 
Anderson being an officer Ntshisi being a Sergeant Major there is a 
challenge there because now Ntshisi is a Sergeant Major who is a 
10 
Warrant Officer which is not a commissioned officer.  Anderson is an 
officer, a commissioned officer he should understand what he says to 
Ntshisi and Ntshisi is supposed to take at least with confidence what a 
commissioned officer say.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  So yes – well Mr Koloane 
if you look at what then is coming from the document from his office. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Was saying here there 
was a misinformation coming from his environment to say this is a VIP 
20 
coming in.  There are Ministers which are going to be landing there and 
we take these and we did not interview him.  But we take this because 
1. He was going to be appearing in the one which was being done 
at government level. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The email an enquiry? 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 62 of 120 
 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  In terms of enquiry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  So we said 
1. Based on what Ntshisi is saying and based on what Anderson is 
saying and based on the documents flowing from a PA in his 
office this information was misleading therefore something needs 
to be done. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  In relation to Mr Koloane.  
And then the captain from India also with all the writings there was 
10 
misinformation and [indistinct] the Department of Defence there for 
them to accept what was happening.  And again his entry point to the 
Defence Force was wrong.  So that captain from India knew what was 
happening.  And he knew that these were not ministers and he knew 
that in fact it was not an official visit.  Therefore he was misleading. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And then you also deal with security 
matters whether there were any security breaches as a result of that 
incident.   
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  When you – again Ntshisi 
then in terms of using the communication with the people he was 
20 
communicating to which he was not aware that in terms of the 
telephone that there were recording happening then it finally transpired 
during that period when he was doing all these phone he also phoned 
another lady where then discussing this kind of event and also in terms 
of asking this lady to assist Koloane I mean not Koloane Mr Koloane.  
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 63 of 120 
 
To assist Ntshisi to get some kind of employment somewhere else. So 
then again Ntshisi then becomes a little bit  
1. Security wise discussing issues of the department with a civilian 
outside and 
2. Then you get to understand that he has got other interests in 
terms of possibly employment outside the defence force. 
And then there was a foreign relation officer by the name of Khumalo.  
In the writings of the defence foreign relation she get copied by the 
officer from the Embassy of India the captain and also when foreign 
relations received the same letter which speaks about this they sent it 
10 
to Colonel Khumalo but when Khumalo appears before the board she 
claimed ignorance about the two documents which she was supposed to 
have received. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.   
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  So obviously again the 
reliability there of the Colonel becomes a challenge. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Then we are also saying 
there is an absence of properly guided and informed counter 
intelligence so those military officers I was talking about that from a 
20 
security point of view there was a lack in terms of that.  So security 
was compromised because people are trained, people who were there 
they saw all this but they did not report.   So the security was breached 
there.  And again if you look at the question of the communication with 
the other government departments at what level so obviously that is D 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 64 of 120 
 
the communication of the personnel of the department with the 
members of the diplomatic core where they were talking direct and 
liaising you would look at a Sergeant Major speaking to somebody in 
the name of Khetias a captain in the Indian High Commission he has 
got no business to do that but he was doing.  So [indistinct] security 
again get compromised.  So these are the issues which speaks to 
security. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  The civilians came into 
during the landing, they came in, they took pictures.  Remember this 
10 
base is a at least understood to be a strategic military facility and 
therefore you – nobody is supposed to take pictures and if you do you 
must be authorised.  But here people came in, they took pictures.  And 
of course civilian vehicles came in, they were able to enter and drive 
around.  Again there was a challenge there.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And then in the following you 
analyse the policies, the standard operating procedures and how they 
applied or they ought to have been applied?  You have already 
summarised that you found that people failed to do what they were 
supposed to do. 
20 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  They failed to do what 
they are supposed to do but again those two documents are not 
necessarily speaking to the authorisation of the aircraft to land.  One is 
speaking to the issue of the aircraft landing there, is it going to need 
fuel and if it is going to be needing fuel then the base must prepare 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 65 of 120 
 
fuel and then also they are supposed to charged for the fuel which is 
coming from defence so defence wants to speak to that.  The second 
one is looking at a technical issue of is this aircraft in fact able to land 
in this airstrip and then the size of the aircraft and of course the safety 
so that you can prepare in terms of the fire fighting and the emergency 
side.  Mainly that is that.  So those are the technical things clearance 
to land. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  But now authorise to land.  
So there is a document which is missing.  So the air force is expected – 
10 
was expected to have developed a document which speaks to the 
actually authorisation not clearance.  So the two documents just they 
are there but there is a policy missing part of it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  So it just went direct to 
an SOP.  34 speaks to what I have already mentioned. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  That we came to a 
realisation as a board that between DIRCO and the DOD there should 
be a policy which govern this. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So that its relationship so that … 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  This relationship so that it 
is documented it does not rely on personalities.  It is informed by policy 
and at least even if it is a working procedure.  So that is what we are 
saying there. 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 66 of 120 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And then – then you analyse all the 
policy matters that should be adhered to but then I would like to take 
you then to – you also highlight what corrective measures ought to be 
taken.  But I would like to take you to the recommendations or maybe 
before that at page 219. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You deal there with any other related 
matters that may be brought to the board’s attention during the 
investigation and you highlight those from paragraphs 58 to 61.  Could 
you just summarise those for the Chairperson please? 
10 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  58 reads as such: 
“Mr 
Koloane’s 
name 
was 
mentioned 
by 
many 
witnesses in influencing the decision to authorise 
and approve the landing of the aircraft that landed on 
the 30 April 2013.  The board is aware that Mr 
Koloane 
was 
interviewed 
during 
the 
directors’ 
generals’ investigation regarding this matter.  It 
would be proper that the convening authority which 
happened with the defence force here request a copy 
of the investigation or his testimony at a later stage 
20 
if it is – if he so wishes.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  So we are saying 
something has to be done but we did not call him because he was 
already there that is why. 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 67 of 120 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  That investigation is the one that the 
witness we had yesterday Ms Sindane spoke to.  The inquiry about the 
directors’ general. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Ja she was part that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Yes.  Must I go through? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes please.  Thank you. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Then we are saying there 
is no clarity and interference or duplication of responsibility for that of 
the post of officer in charge movement control which undermine the 
10 
question [indistinct].  Now here this is speak to us as a – as an 
organisation.  Anderson and Ndluli they were occupying one and the 
same posts and the person who was in the post was Ndluli not 
Anderson.  But Anderson in fact ran the show.  So we are saying here 
to the Chief of the air force this thing is wrong. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  There must be one person 
so that you can have one person accountable.  And again the level of 
training of the person so that was one other problem which was at least 
indicated in terms of 59. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  The board found that 
training and understanding of counter intelligence function and its role 
in the DOD was lacking in the SAF – in the South African Air Force.  
There is no relationship between the air force counter intelligence 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 68 of 120 
 
officers and practices and practitioners at the DI.  Now what one is 
saying here those are the people I call for the sake of this point so that 
I make it a little bit easier?  Military information officers I call them. 
Now their job firstly are training.  If you are trained you should and you 
must see something wrong and when you see something wrong most of 
the time you should see it before it happens and you should try and 
sensitise the commanders to prevent it from happening.  But the actual 
functioning authority for this function is the chief of defence 
intelligence.  But these people are found in the army, the air force, in 
the navy, in the other divisions but coming from there.  So here there is 
10 
a lack of interaction and lack of training and the practices indicate that 
because of the incident which happened so this is what we are picking 
up in terms of this. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And that would also be linked to 61? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Ja who individual officers 
who fully understand the practice were able to portray their trust and 
responsibility bestowed to them and manipulate the structure – the 
structural processes unnoticed.  There is no clear distinction between 
the roles played by the air force base Waterkloof and the air force 
command post. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Now one you would have 
here Anderson who is very well versed with the processes and he 
understand – she understand what should have happened.  She is 
sitting at the air force base Waterkloof, Ntshisi is sitting at the air force 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 69 of 120 
 
command post.  Now you can see how things the two of them were able 
to facilitate things.  So the question would be who must speak to who 
before they can do what they need to do at a lower level in terms of the 
two structures. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  That is what then is being 
alluded there. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Then at – then from paragraph 62 then you 
listed the recommendations of board. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Yes. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And its – some relate to the 
miscommunication between the departments that is DIRCO and the 
defence force and improvement of those communication channels.  But 
I would like you to just this one issue that I think we need to deal with.  
There was – apparently there is a CCTV system that is supposed to be 
operational at all times at the Waterkloof base but it appears that 
during that period it was not working.  What did you establish around 
that? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Well it – when we finally 
went there – when we went there to check what happened we wanted to 
20 
see the footages then we could not see things.  And all what we could 
see the relevant areas where we were interested in they were not 
covered.  And then it then transpired that they were under at least 
service – had been serviced and then we say no if you are servicing 
you need to be able to have a backup system. 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 70 of 120 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  So then there was a lack 
of a backup system.  And the areas which are critical were not covered 
during that period.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So even if there was not any form of 
documentation any aircraft could have landed and no one would have 
picked it up because the system perhaps was not functional at that 
stage. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Not necessary the – this 
one is not necessarily speaking to an aircraft it is speaking to the – 
10 
once you are on the ground and the movement of the people. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Because now you want to 
check when the aircraft land and then there was a meeter and a 
greeter. But the meeter and the greeter then there was a red carpet 
rolled.  Now you want to check where was this aircraft?  Was the – and 
then where was the red carpet?  And you look at where it is supposed 
to be and then you ask the meeter and the greeter and then the meeter 
and the greeter goes and then they see people coming then there is no 
control  The meeter and greeter means nobody greets nobody. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  But the carpet is rolled 
but for who?  But you want to see that in terms of [indistinct] what 
actually was happening then there were photographers but who were 
they carrying cameras?  Then of course there were cars moving around 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 71 of 120 
 
but you want to see them. So if then that footage is not there then it is 
a story not necessarily evidence. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Depending on who tells 
the story.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  So those are the kind of 
challenges. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  And then you all of those you 
confirm all those recommendations that you have from paragraph 62 
10 
right up to S – 62S they are all the recommendations that the board 
made relating to individuals as to what each individual ought to have 
done or should be done about a particular individual, is that correct? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  That is correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  And you stand by those 
recommendations? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Yes I do. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And I see your signature is the one 
appearing at page 223 General? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  That is correct 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And the date that was the 21 s t June 2013? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  That is correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So you completed it just almost a month 
after the incident? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Yes. 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 72 of 120 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And this record as you can see on 
top it is marked ‘Secret’ does this – it is – it has been kept like that by 
the Defence Force until it was required by the commission? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  We as a board we had it – 
as the President handed it over to the office of the chief through the 
legal officers and then it became their responsibility to keep it and my 
understanding is it was kept in the hands of the chief in terms of his 
office. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  And under a lock and key. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  Is there anything else that 
you wish to share with the Chairperson? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Probably let me say 
nothing thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said that is it Colonel Anderson was occupying 
the same position with somebody else, is that correct? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who was the other person? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Lieutenant Colonel Mdluli. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mdluli? 
20 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Mdluli. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mdluli. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Mdluli. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mdluli. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Yes. 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 73 of 120 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  How is that possible for two people to occupy the 
same position? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  It was wrong.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  It was not supposed to 
happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it happened? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  But it happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  But the one who was correctly in the position 
was Mdluli? 
10 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  In terms of 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that… 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  Chair in terms of 
paperwork the one who was supposed to be in the position was Mdluli. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  But in terms of 
functioning the one who was functioning doing the job was Anderson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What does that mean at a practical level?  Does this 
mean Mdluli was supposed to just enjoy the position and the benefits 
and Anderson would do the actual job or what?  Or both would perform 
20 
– they would just divide the tasks between themselves and they would 
both perform the tasks attached to the position? 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  It is one of those 
unfortunate incident Chair which was not supposed to have happened in 
the first place. 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 74 of 120 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  And it created its own 
challenges in terms of the morale within the base and of course the 
functioning of the base.   
CHAIRPERSON:  It was subsequently sorted out I take it? 
GENERAL 
DERRICK 
MBUYISELO 
MGWEBI: 
 
As 
part 
of 
the 
recommendation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
GENERAL DERRICK MBUYISELO MGWEBI:  The finding it also it was 
found to be wrong and Chief of the Air Force was also at least expected 
10 
to correct that.

LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Oh sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or bring the mic closer … 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  I will – I will 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Lieutenant General. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you 
General.  Is it correct that you are the Chief – Chief of the Air Force? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  I certainly 
am.  I am the Chief of the South African Air Force. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes; and how long have you held this 
position? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG: 
 
Since 
October, the 1 s t 2012. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes; and is it also correct that you are 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 78 of 120 
 
pilot by profession? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Yes I am. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes; and how long have you been in 
service with the defence force? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG: 
 
Since 
integration in 1994 but prior to that I was a Member of Umkhonto we 
Sizwe, trained in Russia. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you.  Now let us – the incident 
that you are talking is and as we have heard from the earlier witness 
General Mgwebi that when he started doing the investigation they had 
10 
to start with the Chief of the Air Force … 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Yes ma’am. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Because that is something that falls 
squarely within your responsibility.  Is that correct? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes; and then the South Africans are 
asking where the Chief of the Air Force was when all of this was 
happening.  Could you please just tell the Chairperson then as to how – 
what do you know about the incident, how you got to know about it and 
– and what did you do? 
20 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Thank you 
very much Chair.  As it is stated in my statement I was approached by 
the advisor to the Minister of Defence with regards to a possible arrival 
of the Indian delegation.  This took place during the time when the 
South African National Defence Force was on high alert.  We had a 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 79 of 120 
 
situation in the Central African Republic whereby on 22 March it was 
around that period where we lost 13 of our members. 
It was at this time when we had to attach the officer 
commanding of the F – the officer commanding of the Air Force 
Command Post Brigadier General Lombard to our joint operations to 
assist with this operation.  At the same time we had also an incident or 
an accident in the South African Air Force whereby we had lost a 
helicopter. 
So there were all those things that were taking place.  I 
would also like to state that the landing of the aircraft the one that we 
10 
are talking about happened within the six months of my having taken 
office.  I had also at a time did indicate to my Commander the Chief of 
the South African National Defence Force General Shoke in writing that 
I had serious concerns with regards to the command and control of the 
South African Air Force – the structure – with structural problems and 
of course those were being addressed. 
The issues around the landing of the aircraft and in my 
statement I have stated that after I had indicated that – to the – to the 
advisor – to the Minister of Defence that - I would like to quote what I 
had said. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, okay thank you.  Oh, sorry.  Maybe 
just let us go back. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The advisor approached you what did the 
advisor want from you? 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 80 of 120 
 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  The advisor 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can – you can have a look at the statement … 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For purposes of refreshing your memory. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Thank you 
very much. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG: 
 
In 
my 
statement I state that: 
10 
“During the latter half of my March 2013 the 
political advisor of the Minister of Defence and 
Military Veterans approached the Chief of the South 
African Air Force …” 
Which is myself. 
“…to determine the regulations governing the 
landing and taking off civilian aircraft at Air Force 
Base Waterkloof.” 
I state in my statement that: 
“The Chief of the South African Air Force informed 
20 
the political advisor it would be irregular for an 
aircraft carrying Indian wedding guests to land at 
the base.  The Chief of the Air Force advised the 
political advisor that the matter should not be 
entertained any further.” 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 81 of 120 
 
And from my point of view I thought that was the end of it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So you just give an answer and you knew 
that no one else … 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  He sought – 
he sought advice … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPNDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  And we gave 
him the advice. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes; and ordinarily when then a political 
advisor seeks advice do you share what you had communicated with 
10 
that political advisor with – I do not know whether it would be the 
Commanders or the Commanders who are below you or is it something 
that you would keep to yourself because in any event it is your advice 
that was being solicited? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  It was the 
first time that such a thing had happened.  That the political advisor 
came to seek my advice.  I think it was due to the fact that he too 
wanted to – to be advised as to whether it fell within the regulations. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  I thought I 
20 
was duty bound to inform him and I think that was from my point of view 
that was – would have been the end of our discussion. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Discussion. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then why did you feel that it would 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 82 of 120 
 
have been irregular?  What - what are the factors that informed that 
advice? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG: 
 
We 
have 
protocols within the South African National Defence Force … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG: 
 
And 
especially in the South African Air Force.  We have also what we would 
call SOPs which determine the type of aircraft, type of delegations that 
would be allowed to land at Air Force Base Waterkloof and for the mere 
fact that it spoke about a wedding party.  That in itself did not comply 
10 
with the – with the regulations. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Maybe I should just take you to the 
protocols that you have attached to your statement. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Yes ma’am. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  If I may take you – refer you to a divider 
marked two Mr Chairman. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Pardon to? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  There is a divider … 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Yes ma’am. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Marked number two. 
20 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG: 
 
Marked 
number two? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  At number five – page five there is 
what is called: 
“The Standard Operating Procedures Issuing of 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 83 of 120 
 
Overflight and Landing Authorities for Visiting 
Aircraft.” 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Yes ma’am. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Could you just highlight those 
factors that where one wants to land as a wedding party which would 
conflict with what you have got here in this SOP? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Okay.  Would 
you mind if I just talk about it in general? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG: 
 
Once 
a 
10 
foreign state requests to land at Waterkloof we would first have to 
determine whether it was military, non-military or other.  If it was 
military it will then follow the – I would – if it was military it will then 
come from the country concerned to the Defence Foreign Affairs to the 
Command Post and to the Base Command Post. 
In this case it was a non-military and which we call – which is 
a non-military.  The request came through DIRCO because it was 
diplomatic under RSA05.  Diplomatic to DIRCO and then from DIRCO it 
would have then gone to – should have gone to Defence Foreign Affairs 
that is within the DOD and then from DIRCO it would have then gone to 
20 
the Department of Transport and then within – and then from the 
Department of Transport I think it will go to Home Affairs and also to 
the Civil Aviation Authority. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please just clarify – clarify the “it” throughout this?  It 
would come from DIRCO to Foreign Affairs within DOD 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 84 of 120 
 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG: 
 
Oh 
the 
request, the request sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then to Transport. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  The request, 
the request, the request. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, so – so DIRCO then to the Foreign Affairs Section 
of DOD and then from there to Department of Transport? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Yes.  They 
also have – they have links with the other – other Government 
departments’ yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  What I am asking is whether the Transport one 
that would go to Transport would come directly from DIRCO or it would 
be after going via … 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  No, no.  It 
would be directly – directly from DIRCO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Foreign Affairs Section of the DOD? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  The way I 
understand … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Directly to 
20 
DIRCO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, not that is fine. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Directly to - 
to the Department of Transport. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 85 of 120 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Now … 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is still just the request? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  This is just 
the request yes.  Now please understand this … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  I must say it 
up front that there were no checks and balances.  That is now the 
problem that we are faced with here.  It is due to the nature of the – 
the request in general – 05s – because it is a diplomatic request.  It 
10 
has its own protocols. 
It involves other Government departments and in most 
incidences when there is that – when it is initiated from the requesting 
country or state at level four – the technical level – the officials are 
already running around trying to make sure that they have got systems 
in place to accommodate the – the guests and this has become the 
practice.  So you have the – the SOPs and then you have got also 
practice.  Now can I take …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  SOPS being? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG: 
 
Standard 
20 
Operating Procedures.  I am sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG: 
 
Standard 
Operating Procedures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 86 of 120 
 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:   Yes. I would 
like us to maybe to maybe have a – to show the … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  there is a slide? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG: 
 
Yes 
that 
slide. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  The hierarchy 
of policies. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Alright, thank you.  Sorry Mr Chairman 
could you – oh it is up there.  Oh, thank you.  Okay. 
10 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Yes.  As we 
can see we have got a hierarchy of policies which are at various levels.  
Typically the Chief of the Air Force would be at level two.  Level two 
which states: 
“Services and Divisions.” 
At this level we – I am talking about now services in the South African 
National Defence Force we have got four Service Chiefs.  That is the 
Chief of the Army, Chief of the Air Force, Chief of the Navy and Chief of 
the Military Health Service called the Surgeon General and then we 
have got eight … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I am trying to follow. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Level two, 
level two, level two. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Level two is – is - what position would be there? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG: 
 
That 
is 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 87 of 120 
 
Lieutenant General. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, right and level one. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG: 
 
Level 
one 
that is now my boss. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the Chief of the – the Army? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  The Chief of 
the South African National Defence Force. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay, okay. 
10 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Chief of the 
Defence Force. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Yes.  Now at 
his level which is now as you can see it is copied policy matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  That is where 
we – we deal with the Department of Defence instructions. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  You then deal 
with the joint Defence Publications … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG: 
 
Because 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 88 of 120 
 
remember that this arms of service … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  And this – the 
– the divisions and then there is a joint command. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  So then of 
course – then that – the directives.  Then there is the Department of 
Defence Strategy and then the Military Strategy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Now this is 
10 
now which comes from the top which now informs the next levels 
policies.  So at my level what we generate which is now the service 
operational level which looks at the strategic and operational level 
there are instructions, the doctrines, the manuals, the sub – strategies, 
the divisional supporting strategies and then the level below us which 
we call the intermediate structures. 
This is now where the Air Force Command Post resides, okay.  
That is where the Air Force Command Post resides.  That is at level 
three. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is level?  Three? 
20 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Level three. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Okay.  That is 
where they have the instructions, the manuals, functional curricula 
because some of these are directorates which have got their own 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 89 of 120 
 
training entities within which is like the combat line, the helicopter line, 
the transport line, command and control line and so forth. 
Now – and then we have got level four which is now at the 
technical level which is basis, units, centres and depots.  Now at this 
level this is now where you – where they generate orders, technical 
publications, the Standard Operating Procedures, curricula’s because 
they also have training responsibilities and of course the base 
strategies. 
Now seeing that Air Force Command Post is a unit it also 
generates its own Standard Operating Procedures.  Now with the 
10 
problem that we are faced … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you … 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Go further just so that I can understand the – the 
hierarchy there. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would the – would level one be equivalent in terms of 
public service rankings to a DG or – or it is incomparable?  Well maybe 
in terms of responsibility. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG: 
 
A 
Military 
20 
General is a Military General. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG: 
 
A 
Military 
General is a Military General.  There is no equivalent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I – I suspected you would say that; but in terms of 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 90 of 120 
 
responsibility it would be the same responsibility … 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  DG. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That a DG has?  Okay. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine; and then level two Deputy DG and – 
and maybe level three would be Chief Director? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  That is it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine.  Thank you.  Yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Chairperson, 
okay.  Then furthermore is that when you look at this hierarchy you find 
10 
that the – most of the activities are taking place under the guide of the 
SOPs.  I am saying this because there is no over arcing instrument that 
pulls together … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Everything. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Everything … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG: 
 
Including 
other Government departments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  It is a gap … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG: 
 And 
it 
is 
unfortunate that at the end of the day it is those persons – people at 
level four … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 91 of 120 
 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG: 
 
Who 
are 
exposed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  I think that is 
the finding also in the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  In the Board 
of Inquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   
10 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG: 
 
It 
is 
something that we have also since – are rectifying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Nor for me 
that is the crux of the problem.  Nothing else but just that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG: 
 
So 
this 
incident for me is a symptom of an absence of a coordinated 
interdepartmental arrangement to coordinate and coherent – coherently 
deal with the RSA05 which is now diplomatic requests and this is what 
20 
the interim air force instruction which is a regime that we are currently 
working under seeks to address in the interim because there is already 
within the system a departmental instruction that is being formalised – 
finalised - let me put it that way – under the signature of level one and 
also level zero. 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 92 of 120 
 
From the Minister to the – to the Chief Defence and the 
Secretary of Defence but again it will also create some challenges this 
is why we are also engaging with other Government departments to 
ensure that there is an over arcing instrument that will deal with such 
issues to protect level four, level three, level two.  So that the entry 
point for any of these requests must come at the appropriate level. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it - it maybe that what I want to ask you is 
something that we should deal with later but let me ask – ask you it 
maybe that the systems that were in place were not the best … 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Were not the 
10 
best. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That could be put in place but is the position not this 
that when one looks at what appears to have unfolded here one is 
dealing with a situation where nobody can say I did not know that it was 
not right to allow the landing of this aircraft.  Is the position not that 
when all is said and done nobody can say I did not know that it was 
wrong because if particularly the key people knew that this was not 
right and knew that it was not in accordance with one, the operating 
procedures and policies and – and two, the practices. 
Then they should have said no and then the whole question is 
20 
why they did not say no or maybe some of them.  Some might have said 
no up to a certain point and then gave in.  So therefore if one is looking 
at it – it may be that we should not put a lot of emphasis on any 
inadequacies that might have been there in the systems because 
anybody who wanted to do the right thing knew what to do and if they 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 93 of 120 
 
did what – if they did the right thing and had the courage to do the right 
thing this would not have happened.  What do you say to that? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Sir in this 
space arrangements are hinged on trust and integrity.  Initially when I 
tried to categorise the type of request that came in when we spoke 
about the non-military which 05 is one of them the environment from 
where that information is activated the right information has to come 
through.  Otherwise it contaminates the whole process. 
This is why I said there are no checks and balances from the 
point where that information comes into the Defence Force.  We are not 
10 
even sure as to when it also goes to the other environments as to 
whether there are those checks and balances.  Hence the necessity for 
us to have this over arcing instrument which will deal with all these 
issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what do you say to the proposition that on the 
facts as they seem to have emerged in the report of the Directors 
General the Justice Cluster Investigation Team that at least insofar as 
we speak about the actual landing of the aircraft there may be other 
issues but that is the main issue. 
Insofar as that one is concerned all the key people who had a 
20 
role to play before your – the authorisation could be given knew that 
this was not in order.  Do – do you accept that – that does emerge or is 
your understanding or analysis different? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  I go by the 
findings. 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 94 of 120 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  I go by the 
findings … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  But again we 
also have to put everything into context. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  This request 
should not have gone through … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  After we had 
said no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Period. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Exactly, exactly. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  That it went 
through at a different level well that is now the reason why we have got 
this Board of Inquiry and I would like to repeat we work on trust and 
integrity, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it is – it is a good thing to work on trust and 
20 
integrity but the reason why it is necessary to have checks and 
balances … 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is precisely because … 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  That is it. 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 95 of 120 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sometimes it is not enough to work on trust and 
integrity.  That part I understand but let’s go back to the request. A no 
was given; you have just said then it went; the request went somewhere 
else. Is there any doubt in your mind that wherever it went they knew 
that this was not in order? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, you are a leader now in the Defence Force. You 
have got to come out clearly. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  As a Chief of the South African Air 
Force, I said no and once we said no I wouldn’t like to second-guess as 
10 
to what informed them to be creative and. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see? You are also saying they were creative. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  In the lack. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, you see, you see I guess we must look at the 
Defence Force as well as Derco as part of society. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  True. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And part of the problem in our society is that it 
appears we don’t have enough numbers of people who stand firm for 
what is right in the face of pressure and enticements, corruption and 
just stand firm and say it is not right. So we know that some of the 
20 
people, you know appeared to have said no. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But later on either they gave in to the pressure or I 
don’t know if they got persuaded and we know that there are 
statements that appear to have been made to which appear to have 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 96 of 120 
 
been intended to put pressure on them one way or another. So but 
knowing what, knowing the request that was made and you said no, it 
should not be entertained, is there any reason you know of why people 
who were required to deal with this request in the Air Force at different 
level up to the level where it was authorized, do you know of any 
reason why they wouldn’t have clearly seen that this was not an order 
and it should not be allowed? And to be fair to you, you are free to see 
if you don’t know; to say if you haven’t looked at the facts sufficiently 
in regard to what happened at the different stages about knowing what 
knowledge and expectation the Air Force has of people at certain levels 
10 
who are authorized to deal with something like this. So my question is, 
can there be any doubt that anybody would have known that this 
request was not correct for purposes of authorizing the landing of this 
type of aircraft or an aircraft that was coming with a wording party? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Sir, from the word go this 
shouldn’t have been approved at any level. I think that’s what also 
comes out from the board of inquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  That decision was taken I think 
that’s why specific steps were taken within the Defence Force. I’d like 
20 
to repeat once again the findings of the board of inquiries both. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, are in order? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Are in order, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 97 of 120 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay maybe I can just ask this question. Were you 
shocked when you heard that the aircraft had been allowed to land? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  I think that’s why I have become 
bold. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. You were shocked? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  It took us, yes. It took us… 
(indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. Just as a follow-up to that 
shock that you had. At under what circumstances does the Chief of the 
10 
Air Force get involved when a foreign aircraft lands into the country or 
at least at the Waterkloof Base? Are there instances where you get 
involved and what are those instances? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Yes, the South African Air Force 
through its various structures gets informed. The officer commanding of 
the unit, I’m now talking about the Air Force command post would then 
inform the relevant entities but in this case because of the following 
that officer commanding of the unit was not available. We were dealing 
with a crisis. The SENCON officer Lieutenant Colonel Van Zyl was new. 
He was just brought in and these were all things that would should have 
20 
been in place. Unfortunately, at that time it just so happened that this 
thing came at the time when we were most vulnerable. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. No, my question really relates to as 
because you are the Chief of the Air Force. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Yes. 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 98 of 120 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I just want to know ordinarily do you get 
involved in the, in these approvals at whatever level, of foreign 
aircrafts or you don’t get involved at all… (intervention). 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Ma’am, this is why I am saying. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  This procedure is designed to 
manage activities at level four and three, not at my level. Hence, the 
need for us firstly within the Air Force to overhaul our systems at that 
time and to ensure that we have an overarching instrument that also 
talks to the other government departments. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess that answer means you don’t normally get 
involved? Because that’s the question. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Then then. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, at that stage. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  At that stage, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not get involved? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you get involved now? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Oh yes, certainly. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because of what happened? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  It’s because it’s the right thing to 
do. 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 99 of 120 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but arising from that incident which may have 
opened your? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Remember we spoke about there 
were deficiencies within the. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  The system at that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Because truly speaking we were 
not really configured to do what we were doing at that time. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay. 
10 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  You understand? So, yes we were 
doing this but. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  We were not properly configured. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, let me ask you about the, your feeling or 
reaction to the incident. When Mr Ramatlodi gave evidence here, the 
former Minister of Mineral Resources, he gave his description of how 
he felt about his reaction to the incident. I don’t want to put words in 
20 
his mouth but what the impression that I gained from whatever words 
he used was that it was such a huge shock to learn that effectively a 
private aircraft had been allowed to land at Waterkloof. If I put it in my 
own words I think whatever words he used gave me the impression that 
he was saying, this was an abomination. Now you being. 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 100 of 120 
 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Chief of the Air Force. 
CHAIRPERSON:  High up in the military, Chief of the Air Force, what 
was your reaction? What was your feeling about this commercial 
aircraft being allowed to land at Waterkloof? How bad was this thing to 
a leader of the Army of the country to somebody high up in the 
leadership of the Army of the country? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  This is totally unacceptable. This 
hurt me personally. This was something that I never did imagine that it 
could happen. It was an unfortunate situation. As a commander of that 
entity, this under normal circumstances would have required of course 
10 
a board of inquiry of which we immediately instituted a preliminary 
investigation within the South African Air Force. A preliminary is a short 
intensive investigation and of course it did hurt the image of the 
Defence Force and of the country. Hence, the rapid reaction of the 
Chief of the South African National Defence Force in instituting the 
board of inquiry at his level and then the security cluster immediately 
after that. This just shows the importance the various government 
departments attached to this incident. I repeat again. It is for this 
reason that we are looking and war gaming the new instruction, the 
overarching instruction because when you deal with so many 
20 
government departments at level 4 that I spoke of where you dealing 
with border police, customs, immigration, Department of Health, SARS, 
Department of Agriculture, natural conservation, the military police, 
counterintelligence and so forth and also Derco. There is a huge 
number of departments that level 4 you are dealing with those people. 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 101 of 120 
 
It should be the case. The entry point should be at the right level and 
of this interdepartmental instrument seeks to address just that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would say this is something that should never, 
ever happen again? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Yes. No, no it shouldn’t happen, 
never. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you. Just on the SOPs that you 
have put up, General, I see you have a look at paragraph 5, page 5 
paragraph 5 of the standard operating procedures. 
10 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Is it the interim? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No, sorry. We’re looking at this. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  The? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No, no, no FF10. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  FF10. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes. Yes, page 5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  FF10 page 5. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Okay page 5. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Under divider 2. 
20 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Okay, under divider 2? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Maybe we should start with paragraph 2. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Paragraph 2? 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 102 of 120 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Paragraph 2, yes. Those SOPs the place 
the responsibility of issuing of the overflight and landing authorities. 
They make it the responsibility of the flight centre situated in the 
operational complex. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Under the administrative command and 
functional command of the (AFCP) senior controller. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  That’s it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Would that be level 4? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  That is now level 3. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is level 3? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Level 3. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Alright. And then it tells us… 
(intervention). 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Because remember. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Level 3 is, okay it’s level 3. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  This is level 3. Okay, thank you. And then 
it then tells us in paragraph 4 and 5 about the process that must be 
followed but what I would like us to talk about is paragraph 5. Where it 
20 
says, the request for the issuing of an overflight and landing authority 
can be divided into two types of authority. 1.) An RSA05 international 
authority. This is relevant to what we’re talking about. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Exactly. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay. Now this authority is issued to 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 103 of 120 
 
foreign military or government owned or chartered aircraft or to RSA 
registered aircraft charted for government purposes crossing the RSA 
international boundaries and is divided into three categories. So if one 
looks at the circumstances on the Waterkloof request. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Yes, Ma’am. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Being a wording party, coming back to the 
question that the Chairperson had asked you. That without looking at 
the loopholes, any official knowing exactly what is it that’s required 
would know that that doesn’t fit. It doesn’t fit within that requirement. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Yes. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  That’s if the correct information 
was given from the word go. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  So if there was no mention of 
Ministers, no mention of whoever you understand? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Supposing that really there was one or two 
Ministers that were carried on this aircraft but if one takes the evidence 
20 
of Mr Matjila this morning that there was never any protocol. No one to 
meet and greet. There was no meetings within the stakeholders to deal 
with how you are going to deal with this; where are they going to be 
accommodated. So even if there was a mention of Ministers, if one had 
looked carefully at the request itself, one would have found that given 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 104 of 120 
 
the process that has to be followed it was not possible that there would 
have been Ministers of the aircraft or am I simply stretching it too far? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  No, you are correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  You are correct. Apart from that, 
there would have been an interdepartmental meeting. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Which informs all the relevant 
parties of what is happening who needs to do what. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  And so forth. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  And from what I could deduce 
from the two boards of inquiry, that never took place. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the moment it was an RSA05 that conveyed the 
impression that there would be a Head of State or a deputy Head of 
State. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  A Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or a Minister. 
20 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Of a particular level. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. And anyone filling in and making it an RSA05 not 
knowing that was aware that they were making misrepresentation? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 105 of 120 
 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. And you told the chairperson 
that when you heard about this you were shocked but I like to know 
when did you actually get to know about the landing? Was it a day after 
the landing or was it a week after the landing? When exactly did you 
get to know about it? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  On the very same day. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, and then as we’ve been told because 
there would have been given a clearance… (intervention). 
10 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Then what happened was that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  We ran to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You immediately wanted to know what’s that? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  I was in a meeting. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  And then I see that I heard a lot of 
missed calls. I say, okay now what’s happening. Check that okay, check 
your TV, go check your TV, go check the TV and we saw what was 
happening. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. They were, this aircraft was supposed 
to return on the 3 r d of May. So now it is landed at Waterkloof but we 
know that it didn’t leave from Waterkloof to India. It had to go to OR 
Tambo. Do you have any dealings with that process? After then you 
discovered that it had landed in the manner in which it did, what steps 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 106 of 120 
 
did you take to make sure that it does not leave out of Waterkloof 
again? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  No, we immediately indicated that 
the aircraft must be repositioned outside the Air Force bases. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. And that instruction would have been 
given to? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  To my, at that time it was General 
Officer Commanding of the Air Force. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, and that is out it was moved to OR 
Tambo? 
10 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Yes, of course and then the staff 
that were dealing with it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Did the necessary activities to 
make sure that it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  It was repositioned, yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Did you at any stage make contact with 
Captain Kurty from India High Commission in India who was the one 
who was liaising with in fact sent directly correspondence to the level 4 
20 
officials? There’s that correspondence it’s from Captain Kurty. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  To me? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No, no, no not to you. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Oh okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I just want to know even if it was not him. 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 107 of 120 
 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:   Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Did you try and establish from the Indian 
High Commission as to how did this happen, you know? What 
procedures did you follow before you allow this to happen? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Ma’am, immediately after we got 
wind of this that’s when we initiated as I said our, sorry our internal. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The board of inquiry? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  No, what do they call it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The preliminary investigation? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Preliminary investigation. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  The preliminary investigation, yes. 
That’s what we initiated and then immediately after that the Chief of the 
Defence Force initiated the board of inquiry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Which is now more, it’s at a high 
level whereby I was also a subject of that investigation. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Alright. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But you didn’t make contact with the 
20 
Indian authorities? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  … (indistinct). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may have shaken your head but. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  No, no. 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 108 of 120 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You must articulate your response so that it will be 
recorded. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  I don’t recall. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I also forgot to ask him to do that. Maybe 
just, I’m not sure whether this diagram that you have. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Yes, Ma’am. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  At page, under divider 4, you have there, 
South African Air Force Interim Air Force instruction under 4 and then 
10 
page 47 of the same document you have a diagram there. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Yes, Ma’am. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I’m not sure whether you would want to 
talk to it or is it, do you think it’s covered by the explanation that 
you’ve given? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  It’s covered by the explanation. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You gave earlier? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Yes, it’s covered by the 
explanation. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Remember this is just interim. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  I think I did also share with you a 
matrix which speaks to the evolution of the overflight and clearance 
instructions from 20/072014, 2018, 2019. 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 109 of 120 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG: Yes, so you can, this is work in 
progress and then we are still awaiting to present this to the plenary 
defence staff council for approval. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And it is also just… (intervention). 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  And then I will get then the go 
ahead and further guidelines from the Chief of the South African 
National Defence Force and the secretary of Defence before it is 
promulgated. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. So let me understand. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the document at page 27? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  The one which I’m speaking to, 
the matrix? 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you are talking, ja. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Page 27, which divider? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Under divider 4. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Under divider 4. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Page 27. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The one marked South African. 
CHAIRPERSON:  South African Air Force, interim Air Force instruction. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Yes, yes. 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 110 of 120 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That’s the document you are talking about? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  That’s an interim instruction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Interims? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does it represent some of the steps that the Air Force 
indeed the Defence Force has taken subsequent to this incident? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Yes, yes it has. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To try and address whatever witnesses may have 
been identified? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Yes, and also to make sure that 
10 
the entry-level. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  For such requests. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Is at the correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Level, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  The entry point, sorry is at the 
correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is at the correct level? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you’re saying it’s not the final version yet? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  It’s not the final version. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It’s not the approved version as yet? 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 111 of 120 
 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Yes but it is approved by me at my 
level. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the idea is just to show the Commission what work 
is being undertaken to try and address some of the weaknesses 
identified? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. Thank you. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  So that’s within the, yes within the 
10 
Air Force. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  But subsequently, okay I think 
we’ll leave it at that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, I understand that it will still go through other 
levels for final approval. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman. Then I think 
20 
we’ve covered everything in your statement. Let me just double check 
that I haven’t left out anything to that. Oh and maybe just to confirm, 
I’m sorry General. Just to confirm that you made the statement before 
the board of inquiry. General Mgwebi has already made mention of that. 
That will be in Exhibit FF4. 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 112 of 120 
 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Yes, Ma’am. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And if you could just identify that 
statement. It appears from page 1 of that bundle. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Yes, Ma’am. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And it is in line with your evidence 
today on how the landing happened. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Yes, Ma’am. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And the irregularities that you pointed out. 
That goes up to page 22. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  22? 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, and do you see that? Is that your 
signature there? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  That is my signature, Ma’am. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Thank you very much, Ma’am. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, unless I have missed something or unless I 
have missed this, although you provided us with the, with this interim. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MSIMANG:  Instruction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Instruction, you haven’t highlighted some of the new 
20 
suggestions. I may have missed it. To say in the past this is what would 
happen but in terms of this proposed new instruction this is what would 
be different. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  I can go 
through that sir. 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 113 of 120 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Pardon? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  I can go 
through that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please do that ja. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Chair it is for 
that reason that I did share the semantics to show the evolution of 
where we were 2007, then we had a draft DODE 2014.  In 2007 which 
was an SOP, at the Air Force Command Post this was at level 4 as I 
indicated, wrong level. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is where the request would come in. 
10 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At that time, yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  At that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As well as 2013? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  And the 
nodule point at that point was Air Force Command Post, and then 
subsequently to that we had the nodule point being Chief Defence 
Intelligence.  The approval was Chief Defence Intelligence, acronym we 
used CDI, and then the instruction was CAF which is Chief of the Air 
Force, and the execution was then at that time was CAF but (Air Force 
20 
Command Post) that is the – and then it still remains the same in 14, in 
18 and into the future because that’s actually a (indistinct) point, and 
then the Accounting Authority 2014 it was not addressed but the 
controlling authority at that time it was in the draft it was SAGDAF, in 
the previous one 2007 that was not the case.  Responsible authority 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 114 of 120 
 
2007 it was not there.  2014 it was included.  In the draft it is included, 
but this time authority is now within the operational level of my 
environment, that is the Chief of Air Staff Operations, now it’s going to 
be now a Major General, it’s Lieutenant General, Major General who 
will now be responsible for the operational aspect of it, who reports 
directly to me and then executing authority remains the same but in 
2007 it was not there. 
 
Decision makers 2007 it was not there, in 2014 draft it was 
CDI and CAF.  In the interim it was suggested that it should be the 
MOD, Minister of Defence but was subsequently changed and its 
10 
Chief’s of Defence and Chief of the Air Force and all these updates are 
done in either the Military Command Council or the (indistinct) Defence 
Staff Council, in those forums.   
 
This approval criteria, which is very important, it was not there 
in 2007, it was not there in 2014, but was included in 2018 and also the 
2019 version.  The financial implications which is also equally 
important it was not there in the 2007 document.  2014 yes it is, it was 
not there, in 2018 it was included and also in the 2019.  If we go 
further in terms of the interdepartmental arrangement 2014, that’s when 
we – it was cited that it should be included, it was not there in 2007, in 
20 
2014, 2018 it was included but it was then withdrawn because 
remember the DODE it is a Departmental instrument so there has to be 
something that actually, which is overarching which includes all the 
other government departments, and then we had the processes, in 2007 
it was just the internal processes, nothing that had to do with the 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 115 of 120 
 
external processes.  In 2014 we had the CDI was in the loop, CAF 
executes.  In 2018 the – in the interim was MOD receives the 
approvals, CSNDF instructs, CDI recommends and CAF executes.  That 
was subsequently changed and then there is a – for the DODE the 
suggestion is CDI receives, investigates, approves and then informs the 
MOD and CSNDF.   
 
Now once that is done it then closes all loops, we all are now 
mandated, we know exactly who does what and the level four is no 
longer exposed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Then maybe I 
need to put this question to you because it was put to Mr Ntshisi that 
now having done this the members of your staff not following what – the 
processes that were there that ought to have been followed, but then 
Major Ntshisi or who was not a Major at the time, gets promoted, then I 
just want to understand would you have been involved in that promotion 
and recommended his promotion to a major position and if so why in 
the light of what had happened? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:  Ma’am the 
Major was charged. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:   And after 
that his career continues.  Unless you are suggesting that seeing that 
he had there were some negative findings on him he shouldn’t be 
promoted or he shouldn’t undergo further development and so forth, I 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 116 of 120 
 
would also like to put it on record here that Major or the Warrant 
Officer at that time, if I remember well, he was being prepared to be 
attached to DIRCO, because at that time we did sense that there was a 
problem.  Hence at the level of a warrant officer he was, it was part of 
his career plans that he would get the training and after that get 
deployed to DIRCO to ensure that there is smooth operations between 
us and DIRCO. 
 
What we’re talking about here is the idea.  When things start 
happening especially when there are tight schedules to meet you need 
to have someone who understands what’s happening from the Air Force 
10 
side and also from the DIRCO side, so we took that initiative to say 
okay we’re going to train this gentleman and then after that we send 
him to DIRCO, that was our plan, that was in our plans.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which Major was that, I missed that question. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Major Ntshisi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ntshisi? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the light of you being Chief of the Air Force I just 
want to indicate that the investigators – I am told that the investigators 
of the Commission and the Legal Team have been trying to get a 
certain recording of the conversation between I think Ambassador 
Koloane and – is it ...(intervention)  
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 117 of 120 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Between Ambassador Koloane and 
Lieutenant Colonel Anderson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Anderson yes.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And Ambassador Koloane and Warrant 
Office Ntshisi at the time.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and that at a certain stage State Security Agency 
had promised to make sure it was furnished to the Commission by last 
Friday I think but it seems that there was also some indication it could 
be furnished on Monday or I might have my facts not right there but it 
was promised and it is still not here.  I don’t know what role, if any the 
10 
Defence Force has or may have and power in making sure that we get 
it.  So I just want to alert you to this and say Ms Norman could speak to 
you after this and give you more information and ask you to assist.  I 
would like – we aim to finish the witnesses that were lined up for this 
session in regard to Waterkloof early next week and I would like that, if 
possible, the Commission could have, by tomorrow to prepare for next 
week.  So if there is any chance that you could …(intervention). 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ZIMPANDE FABIAN MSIMANG:      We’ll 
endeavour to assist. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You’ll try do that ja, no thank you very much. 
20 
LIEUTENANT 
GENERAL 
ZIMPANDE 
FABIAN 
MSIMANG: 
 
And 
Chairperson I must state this, that within the South African Air Force so 
is the SANDF, South African National Defence Force we have dedicated 
people, people who go out of their way to make things happen, people 
who have taken an oath to serve this country and if needs be to die for 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 118 of 120 
 
this country.  These are the men and women who, the ordinary person 
does not see them get – going about their tasks on a day-to-day basis 
serving our people on the – trying to man the borders, assisting other 
government departments as you can see what the Army is being doing 
in the Vaal area, what the Medical Health arm of service is doing – has 
been doing when, Nationally the Medical Health Service puts tools 
down, the Air force when they are called upon to do rescues in 
mountains at sea and the Navy too and in my cases they’re not 
adequately 
appreciated. 
 
They 
operate 
under 
very 
difficult 
circumstances with a dwindling budget and they are expected to do 
10 
more and one of our tasks as Commanders is to ensure that we support 
State Departments for the purpose of social economic upliftment, it’s 
not seen we don’t talk about it but we do it.  Not long ago, last week, 
we were involved in KZN we had a two-week boot camp summer school 
with students from Grade 10, 11, 12 working with the Department of 
Education, helping them with maths and science and so forth and when 
things go bad this is your first line of defence and also probably your 
last line of defence. Yes, we do have gaps in our processes and so 
forth, this does not necessarily say that all is wrong in the Defence 
Force or whatever it is.  We are trying our level best under the 
20 
circumstances and we plead that the Defence Force must be looked 
upon differently, yes we’ve got our challenges don’t forget we are as 
old as this democracy, we are still in transition, we have issues of 
transformation, not transformation in terms of black and white, 
transforming the systems and so forth.  Yes, there are going to be 
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127 
 
Page 119 of 120 
 
gaps, yes we need to make sure that we have sufficient funds to send 
people to train adequately, we need to overhaul the systems that we 
have to be in line with our today’s requirements.  We also need that 
support; we also need that space.  Yes, what happened is something 
that should never happen again, but we also need the support of the 
men and women on the streets, the people that we defend, the people 
that we – you now together with the police try and ensure that they are 
safe, we need their support, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much Lieutenant General Msimang I 
can tell you that my own impression is that the South African National 
10 
Defence Force enjoys a lot of support from society, the population and I 
do not think that most people would simply by knowing that something – 
some incident happened that shouldn’t have happened that they would 
then say forget about this Defence Force, that’s not my impression but 
as you say, the Defence Force many people don’t see it on a daily 
basis but my own impression is that many people appreciate the fact 
that they know it is there and that it is there for them to defend them.  
So my own impression is that the people might or might not show as 
much appreciation as you might have wished for but my own impression 
is that it is supported it is loved, that’s my own impression, thank you 
20 
but thank you once again for having come forward to help the 
Commission understand what happened and I doubt that anybody would 
apply for leave to cross-examine you but if that does happen we will 
ask you to come back again but thank you very much and you are 
excused.  
04 JULY 2019 – DAY 127

ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  There is also – I’ve just been told that 
Ambassador Matjila has also arrived so yes we would want to lead him 
10 
so that they can leave – go back early in the week if possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and then for Tuesday? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   For Tuesday I think – I those will be the 
last for now Chair.
