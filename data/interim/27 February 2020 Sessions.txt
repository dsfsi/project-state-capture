Page 3 of 77 
 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  So help me God. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Chair there is a bundle prepared for the 
Chair.  The bundle has been marked Exhibit RR6.  With the Chair’s 
leave may the bundle be handed in? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The affidavit of Mr Cyril Simphiwe Mlotshwa deposed 
to on the 9 t h of December 2019 together with its annexures is admitted 
and will be marked as Exhibit RR6. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  I am indebted Chair.  Mr Mlotshwa can 
you have a look at the bundle before you at pages 1 and 2?   
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Yes. 
10 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Can you – are you able to identify that 
document? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Yes it is a confirmatory affidavit that I deposed to in 
December 2019. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Okay.  The signature on the second page 
is that yours 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Absolutely. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  And the signature and the initials 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is ...(intervenes). 
20 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  That is correct. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Under deponent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There are two signatures on page 2 so the one under 
– above deponent is yours? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  That is correct Chairperson. 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 4 of 77 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  And the second signature is that the 
signature of the Commissioner of Oaths? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  That is the position. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  On page 1 there are two sets of initials 
whose initials are those? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  The first one will be mine on your left. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  And the second one? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  The second one will be that of a Commissioner of 
Oaths who administered the oath to me. 
10 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Okay.  Now this affidavit at pages 1 and 2 
confirms an affidavit which is at pages 4 and 5, is that correct? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  That is correct sir. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Are you the deponent of that affidavit at 
pages 4 and 5? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Absolutely. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  And the initials at the bottom right hand 
are those your initials? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Yes initials yes mine. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  And on the left hand side are those the 
20 
Commissioner of Oath’s? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  That is the position. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  And then on the – at page 5 we have a 
full signature above what is typed out C S Mlotshwa, is that your 
signature? 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 5 of 77 
 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  That is correct Sir. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  And the signature below that is that of the 
Commissioner of Oaths? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  That is the position. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Okay.  At page 6 we have another 
affidavit.  Can you confirm – do you identify these documents?  Let me 
put it that way? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Sir the position is if one meticulously looks at the 
affidavit that you have referred to on page 4 and 5 it makes reference 
to e-mails that were exchanged.  So as I deposed to that affidavit on 12 
10 
May 2015 I was a few months in July approached by the same 
Commissioner of Oaths requesting me to hand to him the e-mails that I 
had give – I had referred to in the initial e-mail.  So it is just an 
affidavit that was confirming the handing over of those e-mails to the 
investigating officer at the time.  I think he was Colonel Dawe. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  And at pages 7 to 12 are those the e-
mails you referring to ...(intervenes). 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  That is the position sir. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Okay now at pages 40 to 67 of the bundle 
can you identify that document? 
20 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Yes I think this will relate to the evidence that I 
tendered before the Mokgoro Commission of Inquiry in respect of two 
NPA senior officials. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Is the correct name Justice Mokgoro 
Inquiry? 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 6 of 77 
 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  I confirm that Sir. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  And did you testify on the 1 s t of February 
2019? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  That is correct. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Does your testimony go from page 14 to 
page 67 of the bundle? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well ...(intervenes). 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  That is also true sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Starts from 15 is it not?  Page 14 is just the covering 
page. 
10 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  That is correct.  Does your testimony go 
from page 15 to page 67 of the bundle? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Your Worship it – my apologies.  Chairperson it 
seems it goes further than that because there will be cross-examination 
from I think page 68. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To 106? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  To ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe re-examination as well?  I think what we need 
is have you recently had a look at this document. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Indeed Chairperson I was accorded an opportunity 
20 
to do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does it correctly reflect the evidence that you gave at 
the Inquiry chaired by Justice Mokgoro last year that is 2019? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  I confirm Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You confirm? 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 7 of 77 
 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  I am indebted Chair.  Now Mr Mlotshwa if 
we can just start – where are you currently employed? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  So currently I am at the Pietermaritzburg Advocates 
Bar. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  And how long have you been there? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  I resigned in the NPA end of the year 2015 and at 
the commencement of the year 2016 I was attached to the Pupillage 
Program which I completed end of 2016.  So with effect from 2017 I am 
10 
practicing as an advocate at the Pietermaritzburg Constituent Bar. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Before joining the bar where were you 
employed? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  I will say I have been in the justice system – I was 
in the justice system for almost 16 years having started as a court 
interpreter in Durban.  Appointed as a court – a District Court 
Prosecutor in Verulam 1998/99 I was transferred to Stanger Magistrate 
Court 2000/2001 I was in the Regional Court Stanger in the middle of 
2001 I was appointed as a State Advocate stationed at the 
Pietermaritzburg Advocates Bar.  After three years of which will be 
20 
2003 I was elevated into the position of a senior State Advocate and 
then in the year 2008 I was appointed as a Deputy Director of 
Prosecutions KwaZulu-Natal and then in the year 2010 until 2012 I was 
appointed as the acting Director of Public Prosecutions for the Province 
KwaZulu-Natal.   
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 8 of 77 
 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Can you just tell us for which period were 
the acting Director of Public Prosecutions for the Province KwaZulu-
Natal? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  It is effective from the 17 t h of May 2010 and I think I 
was recalled or I stepped down.  If I am not mistaken on a Friday the 
9 t h of July 2010 effectively two years. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Okay.  And who replaced you? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  My successor was Advocate Moipone Noko. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Did she replace you in an acting 
capacity? 
10 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  I think so.  When I was recalled she was also 
appointed to act.  And acting position that was confirmed permanently if 
I am not mistaken 2013/2014. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Okay.  Now if we can just before we move 
onto your affidavits very briefly what is a Director of Public 
Prosecutions? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  If one looks at the constitution firstly Section 179 it 
speaks of ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry – I am sorry what was that question? 
ADV 
WILLIAM 
NICHOLSON: 
 
What 
is 
a 
Director 
of 
Public 
20 
Prosecutions? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No we know what a Director of Public Prosecutions is. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us go to matters that are really important for the 
witness. 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 9 of 77 
 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mlotshwa you gave evidence already in the 
Inquiry that was chaired by Justice Mokgoro it would appear that here 
you would be needing to traverse the same issues.  Since we already 
have a transcript of your evidence in that inquiry and you have 
confirmed that this transcript correctly reflects your evidence the 
Evidence Leader will focus on what may be important where it is 
necessary to get clarification or for you to cover just certain things 
because otherwise your evidence was under oath, you were cross-
examined, you have signed an affidavit that says, this transcript 
10 
correctly reflects your evidence. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  As the Chairperson pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Ja. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  So Mr Mlotshwa if we can just briefly deal 
with the – what has been termed the Cato Manor it has been dubbed 
“The Hit – Cato Manor Hit Squad Prosecution”.  If we can just deal with 
that.  What was your involvement in that matter? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  I became involved when I first received a call from 
my Line Manager at the time Advocate Jiba informing me that there was 
a matter that required my consideration.  My second involvement was 
20 
when myself and another fellow colleague the Head of the Division 
Gauteng South with the Line Manager Advocate Jiba at the time met in 
her office and then a suggestion was made that in the light of the fact 
that I was the Head of the Province KZN and the case was emanating 
from KwaZulu-Natal I will have to sign an indictment to array the 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 10 of 77 
 
accused in the matter in the High Court in KZN. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Was a prosecution conducted by 
prosecutors from your office? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  No it was conducted by prosecutors from other 
jurisdictions North West as well as Gauteng South.  If I am not 
mistaken the Lead Prosecutor was from North West Advocate Maema 
and then the other Members of the Team were from Gauteng South. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well ...(intervenes). 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  DPP office. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Do you know why they were not 
10 
prosecuted by prosecutors from your office? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  At that time I was never given the reason except 
that from the discussion that we would have had in the office of my Line 
Manager I could gather that the view was not to involve prosecutors 
from KZN as the possibility existed that the investigation may lead to a 
possible charge of some of the advocates or prosecutors in my 
decision.  That is what I could glean from the discussion that we had in 
her chambers. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Were prosecutors from the KZN Province 
ever prosecuted in this matter? 
20 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  To date no. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Okay.  There was also ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were there any allegations that were ever brought to 
their attention or your attention relating to anybody in your office that 
related to the Cato Manor? 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 11 of 77 
 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  I am not sure if I understand the question 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were you ever made aware or were any prosecutors 
in KZN ever made aware of any allegations against them relating to the 
Cato Manor matter? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Not at all Chairperson it was just ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is not just that they were not prosecuted but 
nobody even ever came to them and said, you are implicated in this 
way and that way in the Cato Manor matter? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  To date as far as I know. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  That has never happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Now if we could just briefly deal with that.  
If in the Province of KwaZulu-Natal if there is a prosecution that is 
going to be connected against another prosecution how would that be 
dealt with? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Under normal circumstances if the matter is arising 
out of a specific division prosecutors from that division are the ones 
who are supposed to be handling the prosecution in the matter.  But 
20 
there will be instances where there will be ground breaking exceptional 
circumstances that warrant that a prosecutor from another division be 
brought in to conduct a prosecution.  A variety of reasons may exist for 
that. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  The question that I am trying to get at did 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 12 of 77 
 
the Province of KwaZulu-Natal at the – at that stage the DPP’s office 
had the capacity to prosecute within its – from prosecutors within the 
province to prosecute another prosecutor. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  In KZN particularly during my reign the province 
KwaZulu-Natal was handling very huge prosecution projects some of 
which you have already made reference to in your bite sized 
introductory remarks. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Okay.  Let me ask the question this way.  
Was there any reason that you were informed of that would warrant the 
prosecutors from a different division prosecuting the Cato Manor 
10 
matter? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Chair no except that if one looks at the e-mails that 
we made reference earlier on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can refer to the e-mails to refresh your memory. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  The Chairperson with ...(intervenes). 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  The e-mails starts at page 7. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Chair the e-mail that I focussing on will be an e-
mail that appears on page 9 of Exhibit RR6.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  If you look – if you cast a glance at that e-mail 
20 
towards the bottom of that e-mail there are – the last paragraph reads: 
“I do not want to step on your toes.  I was informed 
that you agreed and arranged with the acting 
National 
Director 
of 
Public 
Prosecutions 
for 
somebody from outside to do the prosecution of this 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 13 of 77 
 
matter.  If you have now a change of heart please 
indicate so that we may resolve it as soon as 
possible.” 
That was the first time this was brought to my attention that 
somewhere somehow there was an allegation that I had made an 
arrangement for somebody to be brought from outside. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Did you in fact make this arrangements? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were you ever asked by Ms Jiba or anybody to agree 
that the Cato Manor matter be prosecuted by prosecutors from outside 
10 
KZN? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were asked for – to agree to that? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Never. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So to the extent that the writer of that e-mail says 
that this is what he was told namely that you had agreed that 
prosecutors from outside KZN be the ones who would prosecute the 
Cato Manor you are saying that is not true? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  I saw it first time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  And it is a bit generic in the sense that it never 
particularises the date, the place where this arrangement would 
probably have been – it is just generic there was an arrangement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. But of course there might be no need to give 
those particulars until they – the writer knows whether you are 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 14 of 77 
 
disputing that you agreed.  So if he was told that you had agreed and 
have no reason to think that is not true he would not give those 
particulars.  But if you said, no I do not know what you are talking 
about I have never agreed to this you may say give me more 
information and then maybe he would give you information or maybe he 
would say, actually the person who can give information is so and so 
who is the one that told me.  You understand that? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  I do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  But you are saying you never agreed to – you 
never agreed that the prosecutors for the Cato Manor matter be from 
10 
outside KZN. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you were never requested to agree? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Did you in fact – if we just deal with this 
– with that e-mail.  You said an e-mail you were dealing with is at page 
9?  Who was the e-mail from? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  The author will be the person appearing at the 
bottom the Head of the Division Gauteng South fellow colleague 
20 
Advocate Andrew Chauke. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  And on what date was it sent? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  It is dated 12 June 2012 in the afternoon 17:14. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Did you in fact – did you reply to this e-
mail or in writing or telephonically? 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 15 of 77 
 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Probably with the leave of the Chair to avoid 
decontextualizing the e-mails. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  If one looks at page 11 of Exhibit RR6. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  As you lay an eye on that e-mail you can see from 
Mamiki Suping so at the time that was a lady who was a personal 
assistant to the Head of the Prosecution Gauteng.  So that e-mail was 
following hotly and hardly on the heels of the meeting I had with 
Chauke and Advocate Jiba.  A meeting where she had indicated to me 
10 
that I will have to sign an indictment as well as the provisional 
delegation in the light of the fact that the prosecutors who were going 
to handle prosecution were not from KZN.  So at that meeting my 
response had been I never had a problem of signing an indictment 
provided 
the 
indictment 
was 
going 
to 
be 
accompanied 
by 
a 
memorandum or a report.  A report that would be detailing evidence – 
that would be detailing evidence how it links each accused individually 
and the accused as a collective.  So as you can see there it was just an 
indictment without a memorandum with – so as I received that e-mail it 
was on the 12 t h of June 2012 at 13:29.  As soon as I received it I made 
20 
a call to my colleague to say, there seems to be a deviation from the 
agreement in terms of which when we left at our meeting we were all 
consensus ad idem that I was going to receive both the indictment and 
the memorandum.  But it seems now I am not sure if it is the PA who 
would have committed an error here by sending the indictment without 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 16 of 77 
 
the memorandum.  It is then that I started picking up during our 
telephonic conversation that was not going to happen.  Then I decided 
to terminate the call and transmit another e-mail so that I could have a 
record of what was happening.  It is then that you will be able to see 
the e-mail that appears on page 9 of Exhibit RR6 at the bottom there 
you can see he sent that e-mail – the first e-mail is at 13:29 on 12 June 
2012.  Then the e-mail that I am sending to him at the bottom of page 9 
from Cyril S Mlotshwa it bears the same subject. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  The  
10 
“Dear Advocate Chauke our telephonic conversation 
today the 1 s t kindly furnish me with the prosecutor’s 
memorandum or report so that I can have a 
wraparound view of the matter.  The report must also 
have the police station and case numbers so that we 
can be able to open up the DPP’s file.”   
In the normal scheme of things if the docket is forwarded to 
the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions there ought to be a file 
opened there.  And then that file will contain the docket and everything 
that relates to that matter.  So you can see when you look at this e-mail 
20 
closely that the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions KwaZulu-
Natal did not have anything in relation to this matter.  It was my 
eloquent and conscious effort to get some information so that we could 
also open up the file at our office.  So it is then that you can see the 
debate getting heated.  A reply to my e-mail at 13:21 on the same page, 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 17 of 77 
 
on page 9. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  At 17:14 from my colleague. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I think you can read that e-mail. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Yes.  The e-mail reads: 
“Dear Advocate Mlotshwa who is the prosecutor that 
you are referring to?  I have forwarded to you the 
indictment which has all the detailed summary by 
which you ought to be in a position to open up your 
file – your office file.  I also forwarded to you details 
10 
of the inquest with police case numbers etcetera to 
which you referred to Advocate Thoke Mjokweni.”   
For the record Thoke Mjokweni at the time was the acting 
Prosecution Services Director at National office. 
“For reasons that I do not follow and I understand 
the indictment with respect gives you the whole view 
of the matter.  You are kindly and fervently requested 
to please discuss any issues if any with me.  I really 
do not see any need for me to give you any report 
other than what I have forwarded to you already.  
20 
Please if I misunderstand you make me understand.  
I do not want to play you or undermine your 
jurisdictional authority in any way whatsoever.  There 
are serious issues of security in this matter which if 
necessary you will be briefed about which are not 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 18 of 77 
 
relevant to you and I cannot expose such to you at 
this stage.  I have also learnt with utter dismay that 
you have now issued an instruction to the senior 
prosecutors that all dockets that are with us must be 
brought to you.  What is happening here my brother?  
Please if you have any issue again talk to me or 
arrange that we see the acting National Director of 
Public Prosecutions urgently.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I think it says what is not happening here my 
brother. 
10 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know whether he meant what is happening 
here my brother but what is written is what is not happening here my 
brother.  I am mentioning that because I think you read what is 
happening here my brother whereas it is written what is not happening 
here my brother.  That is the only reason why I am mentioning it.  
ADV MLOTSHWA:  As the Chairperson pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  “Another issue of concern to me is the 
delay in your issuing the instruction of the reopening 
20 
of the inquest in view of the fact that you have been 
requested to sign the indictment which must be 
preceded by your decision to reopen the inquest.  If 
this makes you uncomfortable please indicate so that 
I may urgently take the matter up with the acting and 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 19 of 77 
 
DPP as well as the Minister.” 
That was a bit confusing because if one looks at the lines of 
reporting within the National Prosecuting Authority I am not sure 
because I am not …(indistinct) in the system the DPP reports to the 
acting and DPP and its – the NDPP in terms of the legislation who 
should report to the Minister. So here seems to be suggestive that he 
has to report to both. 
“I do not want to step on your toes I was informed 
that you agreed and arranged with the NDPP for 
somebody from outside to do the prosecution of this 
10 
matter.  If you have now a change of heart please 
indicate so that I may resolve it as soon as 
possible.” 
Chairperson it is something that I brought to the attention 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it is from Mr Andrew Chauke Director of Public 
Prosecutions South Gauteng High Court? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  That is the position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Again if you go back on page 8 that is my response 
20 
to his e-mail.  So which means in the afternoon after sending an e-mail 
to him I left the office late.  Upon opening up my e-mails on the 
following day 13 June 2012 at 09:12.  That is the e-mail I decide – it is 
then that read that e-mail and I decided to respond. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 20 of 77 
 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Regrettably Chair that e-mail is incomplete in my 
response to him.  As you can see I am saying to him: 
“Dear Advocate Chauke, I operate from the premise 
that the mission of the NPA enjoins us to be guided 
by the Constitution.  The last time I cast a glance at 
the Constitution I gleaned that it is its preamble 
encapsulate that all the rights enshrined in the 
Constitution have to be respected, protected and 
promoted.  This includes the right to human dignity 
which is affirmed by Section 10 of the same 
10 
Constitution.  I think it is significant that I alert you 
or I bring it to your consciousness that as a South 
African citizen that this Constitution also renders 
me a cast iron guarantee to this right.  I am acutely 
aware that as we live in a fast paced over 
stimulated and I want it quick society.  There is 
always a temptation to arrive at a decision that is 
based on preconceived ideas.  Argumentum ad 
hominem principle is a well-established principle of 
law.  The caveat is that we should guard against 
20 
emotions when we engage or interact with each 
other.  If your memory services you well you will 
recall how you threw tantrums at me when you 
contacted me one morning last month.  You levelled 
serious allegations against me.  You did not repeat 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 21 of 77 
 
the same allegations when we met the NDPP in 
their office.  I maintained my cool through and 
through.  The impression I derived from your 
behaviour is that you nourish a lavish mentality that 
you are the only one so fortunate ...” 
My apologies.  It seems there I was also emotional in that 
response and then paragraph 3: 
“(Indistinct) that we do not see things as they are, 
but we see things as we are.  Hence it is imperative 
that we make a conclusion that is based on facts, 
10 
factors and circumstances.  You are posing a 
question to me.  Do I have issues that we must 
discuss?  So premier significant is the fact that 
Butler holds the view that words are nothing, but 
just the clothes that the thoughts were.  In 1974 
L E Hefner (?)postulated that a skilful reader reads 
between the lines and reads beyond the lines.  
Watermeyer, J H stated in R vs Blom 1989 AD that:  
when we draw inference the inference that we seek 
to draw must be from the facts.” 
20 
So two pages are missing to that e-mail. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  So ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is quite a lot.  Why are those two pages not 
there? 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 22 of 77 
 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Chair, we – these e-mails come from the 
information that was provided to us on a hard drive by the Mokgoro 
Inquiry.  Only until consulting with Advocate Mlotshwa did we realise 
that these two pages are missing.  We are going to endeavour to 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why was that not seen much earlier?  His affidavit 
was deposed to in December. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Chair, it just was not brought to our 
attention that there was anything missing, because ...(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:  Who was going to bring it to your attention, because 
10 
he was going to give evidence in December is it not or was it 
November? 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  In January. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well we had the other session when was it when 
Mr Ngidi – is it Ngidi or Manyathi testified?  When was that? 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  It was in January Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it in January? 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay, but by then there would – what 
Mr Mlotshwa was going to give evidence should have been perused and 
20 
to see if everything was fine.  I cannot see why that was not picked up 
much earlier. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Chair ...(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:  Both by the investigators, but more importantly by the 
Legal Team. 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 23 of 77 
 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Indeed Chair.  Chair, it ought to have 
been picked up much earlier.  The only reason I can think of is that 
Mr Mlotshwa was removed in January and therefore the file was not 
perused for the January hearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but who are responsible to make sure everything 
is ready?  It is the Legal Team, because they are the ones who must 
lead evidence.  If there is anything that is not ready.  They are the ones 
who must be able to pick it up if the investigators have not picked it up 
before it comes here. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Indeed Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because how much value can I put on an incomplete 
e-mail ...(intervenes). 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Chair ...(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I do not know what was said in the second 
page.  I do not what was said in the second page.  I do not know what 
was in the third page.  I do not know if it negates everything that was 
said in the first page. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Indeed Chair.  Chair, what I will 
endeavour to do is to ensure that those e-mails are obtained and 
perhaps a supplementary affidavit is obtained for the purposes of the 
20 
Chair, but perhaps this witness could testify if he has memory of what 
was in the e-mail. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is unsatisfactory.  The Legal Team should long have 
picked up if there were – there was an e-mail that was not complete.  
That should have attended to.  To obtain whatever pages were missing 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 24 of 77 
 
and if the position was that those missing pages could not be found.  
The Legal Team should have taken a decision whether there was any 
value in presenting an incomplete e-mail. 
I do not know whether it would be fair to the witness to ask 
him to try and remember what the two pages that he wrote in 2012 said.  
If – unless he has got the complete e-mail and he has had a look at it 
recently.  Mr Mlotshwa, do you have a complete e-mail? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Chair, as the incident happened in 2012.  I handed 
these e-mails to the investigation Team in 2015 and I left the system. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the Investigation Team of the Cato Manor 
10 
matter? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Both Teams.  The SAPS, the Commissioner of Oath.  
I think it is Lieutenant Howa who appears there at the bottom of the e-
mail that I deposed to.  I gave him those e-mails.  I also gave those e-
mails to the Evidence Leaders in the Mokgoro Commission of Inquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So as of last year when you testified at the Mokgoro 
Inquiry ...(intervenes). 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  They were complete. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This e-mail was complete? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  That is the position. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  That is why when reading the e-mails realising that 
they were incomplete.  The impression I got was that probably when 
making the copies someone might have erred and not printed out the – 
so that is the impression I immediately got when ...(intervenes). 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 25 of 77 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but the Legal Team should have picked that a 
long time ago.  That is my concern that the witness is giving evidence 
and the – he is referred to an e-mail that is incomplete.  I have not 
been told in advance that there is an incomplete e-mail here. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not understand why the Legal Team should not 
have picked that up much earlier and made sure that it was sorted out. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Chair, the only explanation I can give is 
that as I have said perhaps we can endeavour to find it and do a 
supplementary affidavit. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Of course you are appreciated that is not an 
explanation.  That is what you will do to try and control damage, but I 
really do not understand why.  Let us continue with the witness and try 
and let him cover the important things and then you can do what needs 
to be done to rectify this. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  I am indebted Chair.  Are you able to say 
what the rest of the e-mail contained? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  The significant part in the outstanding pages is that 
I had agreed with the colleague to go and see the Acting Judge 
President in the division.  He is currently the Judge President 
20 
Judge Chabi, because in – if prosecutors from outside were coming to 
the division.  It was more appropriate for me to introduce him to the 
Judge.  He did not do that. 
So I had raised that in the outstanding pages that that was 
also my embedded concern.  That look that was not honoured.  So the 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 26 of 77 
 
response will be the e-mail 30 June 2012 on page 8 I think he authored 
that 
e-mail 
at 
10:32 
copying 
in 
Jiba 
as 
well 
as 
Advocate Sithole Majokweni.  In that e-mail he said: 
“Dear 
Advocate Mlotshwa 
I 
have 
noted 
your 
concerns below.  I apologise to the extent that you 
feel I am not respecting you and my communication 
to you was not what you expected.  I also apologise 
for having not told you that I could not travel to 
KZN due to unforeseen circumstances.  I hope this 
meets your approval and I have learnt my lesson in 
10 
this regard.” 
I accepted his apology and then he also gave me another e-
mail on page 12, because he had also indicted that the inquest must be 
reopened.  So him saying that that e-mail is also withdrawn according 
to the e-mail on page 12. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us go back to the practice or system used before 
a prosecutor from another province can be brought in to prosecute in a 
matter that is in another province.  Is there a policy on this?  Is there - 
are there prescripts that you are aware of that need to be followed?  
Was there a practice as to how – when that happens and how it is 
20 
done? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Chair that is why it was a problem when we met in 
the office of the then Acting Director of Public Prosecutions, because 
what she said to me were two things during that very brief meeting.  
That one, you will have to sign the …(indistinct) and then two, you will 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 27 of 77 
 
have to sign the provisional delegations for those prosecutors and then 
at that point she indicated to me it is a legal opinion she had procured 
from legal services. 
She particularised the person from whom she got a legal 
opinion.  Advocate Gerhard Nel.  I understand he also testified in the 
Mokgoro Commission whether or not he ever administered that opinion.  
That being a legal conundrum in the sense that if a Deputy Director is 
appointed by the Minister is appointed for a specific division and if one 
looks meticulously at the members of the Team that were forming part 
of this Team that was sent to KZN. 
10 
The Lead Prosecutor was Advocate Maema from North West 
DPP Office.  He was a Deputy DPP and still is a Deputy DPP in North 
West and appointment specifying as such.  So if he goes to lead 
prosecution in KZN it was going to create a problem.  I think another 
advocate – Advocate Mathenjwa – Ray Mathenjwa – he was also a 
Deputy DPP in the office of the DPP Gauteng South.  Appointed 
specifically for Gauteng South. 
For him to go and prosecute in KZN that was going to be an 
issue and then with the other members.  Advocate Yanni Mlotshwa.  
Mlotshwa is a Senior Advocate.  Though not appointed by the Minister 
20 
for – specifically for Gauteng South, but his delegation to execute 
prosecutorial decisions.  That delegation would have been assigned – 
would have been signed by the Head of the Division my colleague, 
Advocate Chauke. 
So it is against that background that my Line Manager at the 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 28 of 77 
 
time of Jiba indicated that in terms of the legal opinion that she had 
procured.  I could sign the indictment.  I could sign the provisional 
delegation pending the research and investigation whether or not they 
can be assigned permanently in that project.  So unfortunately I was 
recalled in 2012.  I am not sure, because they are still involved – if the 
case is still in court as to what is the status of their delegation in the 
matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that is what happened in the specific case. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am asking about the general practice or a policy 
10 
whether when you were Acting DPP in KZN you were aware of what 
policies exit within the NPA or what prescripts – legal prescripts exited 
that dealt with or governed the situation where a prosecutor will be 
taken from one province to go and prosecute in another province. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  None that I know of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you have any recollection whether the National 
Prosecuting Authority Act says anything about such things? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  As far as I remember there was nothing in the Act.  
20 
Except that because of the nature of budget if a prosecutor from – if 
the DPP requests assistance.  We request assistance from the NDPP 
and then the NDPP will get assistance from a specific DPP who has to 
dispatch the prosecutor to go and assist.  It is then that the issue of 
budget will be discussed. 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 29 of 77 
 
Travelling arrangements and so on and so forth as to which 
office will have to pick up the tab – to pay the bill.  So in this one I was 
not involved even with the arrangements, accommodation, travelling.  I 
do not know what was – what happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But is your answer that as far as you know or rather 
that you are not aware of any provision in the National Prosecuting 
Authority Act that specifically deals with getting a prosecutor from one 
province to go and prosecute in another province? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  That is affirmative Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you are not aware that there were any written 
10 
policies on this? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  None that I recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you aware of – were you aware of any practice 
that may have been followed over the years? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  As I have indicated Chair ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  That it will be the DPP because of some certain 
considerations feeling that look another division must send a 
prosecutor, but that require – request will have to go via – the NDPP 
will make a determination from which division a request can be made to 
20 
get a prosecutor to go and prosecute in that division. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So your understanding is that indeed there was a 
practice? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Yes.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And are you saying the practice was that the request 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 30 of 77 
 
had to come from the DPP of the province concerned where the 
prosecution was to take place? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  That is the position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that request would be directed to the NDPP? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Who will make a determination among the other 
divisions that are there ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Where he or she approaches ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  To get assistance. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it ought to be possible to have a situation where 
a prosecutor comes from another province, because there could be a 
situation where a sitting DPP has to be prosecuted and maybe it might 
be awkward to have one of his or her subordinates prosecuting him.  So 
it ought to be possible to bring in somebody from another province, but 
you say the only practice you knew is that the DPP would have to make 
the request to the NDPP. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  I concur Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  That that was always possible during my time 
20 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  To have somebody from another division to 
prosecute in another ...(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but in regard to this particular matter of Cato 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 31 of 77 
 
Manor how did it come about that a matter that related to KZN where 
you were Acting DPP suddenly got attended to in Gauteng without your 
knowledge, because that is what I understand, but you can tell me if I 
misunderstand something. 
I get the impression that when you were approached by the 
Acting NDPP and told about the Cato Manor matter.  Your office as 
acting DPP in KZN had not been involved in any – in that matter at all 
at that stage or do I misunderstand something? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Chair, I think that is the aspect that I also found a 
bit odd, because in respect of the e-mails that I made reference to.  I 
10 
indicated that we did not have even the case numbers, the police 
stations from which those cases would be coming from.  Except just the 
indictment.  So as we all know that the parties will be. 
No matter can be enrolled in the High Court – a criminal 
matter in the High Court without the DPP file existing and it is on that 
basis that once the DPP file has been captured/obtained then there will 
be another file in the Registrar’s Office on their part which will 
eventually become the Judge’s file.  So with this one I did not have 
anything from the day I first became aware of the matter until I was 
recalled. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So as I understand your evidence before the inquiry 
chaired by Justice Mokgoro.  You got a call from Advocate Jiba when 
you were on a trip to Port Shepstone and that is when you heard for the 
first time that there was prosecution that was being contemplated 
relating to the Cato Manor matter. 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 32 of 77 
 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  That is ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is correct? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As at that time you did not – your office was not 
involved in – as far as you know no prosecutor was involved in any 
...(intervenes). 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  During ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Such matter? 
10 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  During that telephonic conversation no indication 
was made as to who were the accused.  As to where in KwaZulu-Natal 
was the matter emanating from.  Even the date of possible commission 
of the offences.  I was not given the information.  As far as I remember 
her call had to be terminated, because she indicated that she was at 
the airport at the time and was going to call me later. 
Then I did not receive a call from her.  Up until one of the 
days when I was the Chair of the meeting of the Managers in KZN.  The 
Chief Prosecutors and the Deputy Directors of Public Prosecutions.  Me 
having forgotten to switch off my phone.  It rang.  As I excused myself 
20 
from chairing the meeting seeing who the caller was.  It is then that my 
colleague indicated that he had been instructed to dispatch a team, 
that is Advocate Chauke, to dispatch a Team of prosecutors to KZN, 
because I had to go back to the meeting. 
My reply to him was we were going to discuss the matter 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 33 of 77 
 
further and thoroughly when we meet again at the DPP’s meeting and 
indeed there were – there was a meeting at National Office which took 
three days.  First day it was chaired by Advocate Jiba if I am not 
mistaken and then the second day it was discussing the performance 
assessment of the prosecutors in the country. 
I think at that meeting it was a meeting of the DPP’s only and 
Advocate Jiba was in her chambers.  So while that meeting was in 
progress it is then that my colleague, Advocate Chauke, stood up, 
touched me on my shoulder and said let us go and meet Advocate Jiba 
in her chambers. 
10 
I left the DPP’s meeting following him into Advocate Jiba’s 
office and indeed upon entering her office we exchanged greetings and 
then Chauke indicating that look we cannot discuss much about this 
case, because there are serious security concerns and the possibility 
that other prosecutors or advocates in KZN may also be possibly linked 
and then the Line Manager Advocate Jiba responded that Simphiwe by 
the way I have got a legal opinion in terms of which you will have to 
sign the indictment as the Head of the Province KwaZulu-Natal and 
then also sign the provisional delegation for them – the team to have a 
delegation to hand the prosecution in the province and reply to that 
20 
was very short in that. 
I will do that provided in respect of the indictment it will be 
accompanied by the report and the memo that will help me to have a 
helicopter view of what is happening in the matter.  As I do not have 
any information at that stage. 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 34 of 77 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just as maybe an aside.  Actually in order to be 
comfortable in signing an indictment would the position not be that not 
only 
would 
you 
need 
a 
prosecutor’s 
memo 
I 
think 
as 
the 
correspondence seems to refer to it, but you – would you not also need 
to see the statements of witnesses and so on or would you be able to 
sign an indictment without seeing the statements of witnesses? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Chair, as you saw in the e-mails that I made 
reference to that we did not have any file in existence.  At that time I 
was so desperate to get something so that I could be able to issue an 
instruction in my office that an – a docket – a file for this matter be 
10 
opened.  It was against that background that at least if I got an 
indictment as well as the memo or the memorandum. 
With those two documents we will be able to open up the file 
in the DPP’s Office, because obviously the memo or the report will 
indicate the police station where the matter or the matters were coming 
from, case numbers, the investigating officers and then detail what 
evidence each witness is saying and the form of evidence contained in 
the docket whether it is documental, eyewitnesses and so on and so 
forth and for me as well, because if – as the Head of the Division 
though I cannot tamper with the decision to prosecute, but I had also to 
20 
be satisfied that evidence existed to justify the enrolment in the matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but am I right in thinking that you would not be 
comfortable or any DPP should not be comfortable signing the 
indictment without having seen the actual evidence or statements?  Am 
I correct in that or is the position that provided you have – you are 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 35 of 77 
 
satisfied on the basis of a memo from another prosecutor who has 
looked at the evidence and in his or her memo he or she details what 
the evidence is. 
You may be justified in signing the indictment even if you 
yourself have not actually seen the statements or the evidence. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Chair, unfortunately the outstanding pages of the e-
mail will also explain that ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Because if you see the e-mail to me asking me who 
are you talking about?  What report are you talking about?  It is then 
10 
that I try to give an account to him in respect of the report or the memo 
saying;  it is the practice in the NPP – it was the practice then.  I do 
not know currently.  For instance if the National Director of Public 
Prosecutions had to issue a certificate for people to be charged with 
racketeering with this new – racketeering/money laundering. 
I will make an example.  With the projects that I had the 
Amigos case and other projects were there would be racketeering 
charges.  More often than not a practice will be a memo will be 
submitted without the copies of dockets themselves.  So the memo will 
be so detailed to such an extent that they put one in a tense and 
20 
uncomfortable space to make a determination as to what is it that is 
happening in the matter. 
For the NDPP to have confidence to append a signature on 
the certificate.  That is how I appeared to be understanding 
...(intervenes). 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 36 of 77 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  The situation at the time.  That with those two 
documents the indictment accompanied by the memo with that 
information I could be in a position to sign the indictment with ease. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if the prosecutor’s memo is sufficient detailed that 
could lead you to being comfortable to sign the indictment even though 
you have not seen the witness statements as such, but if it is not 
sufficiently detailed you might then wish to see more – to see the 
witness statements? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Under normal circumstances Chair, it is sufficient, 
10 
because as lawyers will know.  In the memo you will see what facts will 
they – will be alleged.  What facts will be proved?  What facts will be 
disputed?  The anticipation of the defence by the accused. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  What facts will possibly be agreed on when the 
matter goes ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  To court ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  And then we will further indicate the oral evidence 
20 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Documentary evidence and the shortcomings 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 37 of 77 
 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  If any. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  For instance the witness.  It was at night 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  And so on and so forth. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  It is so detailed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So usually it is sufficiently detailed? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  That is the position. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay ...(intervenes). 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But here you were being asked to sign an indictment 
and there was no such prosecutor’s memo? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  That was the position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you had difficulty with that? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  I had difficulty with that to such an extent that the 
way I was viewing the difficulty I refused to sign the indictment until I 
was recalled. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So by the time you were recalled or asked to 
20 
step down as Acting DPP.  That issue had not been resolved.  Namely 
whether the signing of the indictment, because you were saying I need 
the prosecutor’s memo and Mr Chauke and whoever else were not 
providing that memo and Mr Chauke was saying that having the 
indictment before you is sufficient.  Is that correct? 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 38 of 77 
 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  What do you make of Mr Chauke’s stance? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was the DPP for South Gauteng himself.  So he 
was in – except that he was not acting and you were acting, but you 
were on the same level.  You were Acting DPP for KZN.  He was for 
DPP for South Gauteng.  What did you make of his stance that there is 
no reason for you to want a prosecutor’s memo? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Chair that is the reason I draw your attention to the 
last sentence above paragraph 3 of my e-mail. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  On page 8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  You can see the tone there when I was responding. 
“The impression I derived from your behaviour is 
that you nourish this lavish mentality that you are 
the only one so fortunate to be able to see.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  So was this something that was shocking to you that 
he expected you to sign an indictment without a prosecutor’s memo in a 
matter in which you had not previously being involved? 
20 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  In fact Chairperson before I even request – made a 
decision to request a memo.  I first went through the indictment myself.  
As I was going through the indictment I had that very nagging feeling 
that the quality of the indictment was not above reproach.  So that was 
the first thing that gave me that sense of discomfort ...(intervenes).

CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  And then what aggravated that.  The nonexistence 
of the memo to explain ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  The indictment ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  And then in the telephonic conversation when I 
request the memo or the report.  Now I am being probed or asked what 
is it that I am talking about.  As if there is resistance to give me the 
memo and then fourthly, any prosecutorial decision whether you call it 
10 
office notes or memo will stay in the file explaining when was that 
docket received. 
What evidence was there?  What decision was there?  In an 
instance where there is disagreement between the prosecutors, 
because the way I understood it then.  I do not know now.  For my 15 
years working in the Office of the DPP you find that if the State 
Advocate is making a decision. 
That decision had to be endorsed by the Deputy Director of 
Public Prosecutions as somebody more senior in the entity.  I thought 
that that used to serve as a …(indistinct) in an instance where wrong 
20 
people are prosecuted or people who are supposed to be prosecuted 
are not prosecuted. 
So one would always presume that when that indictment was 
drafted it should have been on the basis and strength of something that 
was – so which would have made it easier for my colleague to say here 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 40 of 77 
 
– is this what you want.  So that also gave me sleepless nights.  That if 
it exists why am I not ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you had a suspicion that it did not exist? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  I was not comfortable at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  That nagging feeling ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Did not want to divorce me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you able to say for every matter in which you ever 
signed an indictment while you were Acting DPP.  There would have 
10 
been or there was a prosecutor’s note ...(intervenes). 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or would you say ...(intervenes). 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Who. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There were some where there might not be a 
prosecutor’s memo? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Who – as I indicated with 15 years of my experience 
in the DPP Office KZN.  All cases where the indictment is signed.  
There will be an office note in the file, but at the time when I assumed 
a position as the Acting Director of Public Prosecutions KwaZulu-Natal I 
20 
decided to have my own personal parallel process.  A parallel process 
in terms of which I bought myself black books. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  From day one of my acting until I was recalled. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 41 of 77 
 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Where I would record ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  All my engagements, my interactions ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Decisions. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  And including my decisions including the dockets 
where – cases where the police would approach me, because I was 
accessible at the time to discuss the docket maybe with an inquiry file 
without the docket and where I would have given them an advice and 
the return date upon which we can meet again to discuss the case 
further. 
10 
So I also used to record that in the event I am not in the 
office and then they call.  Maybe I am attending a meeting.  I am able 
to refresh my memory.  So ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  So this idea that you should sign an indictment in a 
matter without a prosecutor’s memo or note was something unheard of 
as far as you are concerned? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  In my experience as a prosecutor it was something 
unheard of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Unprecedentedly. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Unprecedented? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Mr Nicholson I see we are a few minutes 
past quarter past.  I think I must take the tea break and then when we 
resume you can then take it from there. 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 42 of 77 
 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Chair that is fine Chair.  I do not have 
many ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Very many questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Have I taken – have I asked most of the 
questions you wanted to ask? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:  You have done so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, but during the tea break you could reflect and 
see whether there are other matters that have not been covered that 
should be covered. 
10 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  We take the tea adjournment.  It is nearly 20 
past.  We will resume at 11:35.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes Mr Nicholson? 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Mr Mlotshwa we have dealt with the 
issue, you said that there was no request from your side to have the – 
have prosecutors from outside the province prosecute the Cato Manor 
20 
case. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   That is correct. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   You’ve also dealt with the issue that no 
prosecutor has been charged as one of the reasons put forward for 
having prosecutors from outside of the Province. 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 43 of 77 
 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   That is correct. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Now just one other issue, at the meeting 
of the 29 t h of May 2012 you just made reference to it now, you 
indicated that one of the other issues that was put forward for having 
outside prosecutors was that there was some security issues that 
needed to be taken into account. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   Yes. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Were those security issues ever fleshed 
out? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   Unfortunately I will have to go back to the 
10 
outstanding pages of my e-mails, that is where I raise all those 
concerns that even the issue of security as the Head of the Division I 
ought to have been taken on board.  In the outstanding pages of the e-
mail I make reference to a workshop, SOCA Workshop, S-O-C-A, Sexual 
Offences and Child something, something Workshop. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Child Abuse. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   Child Abuse yes, that workshop was held at OR so 
when I attended ...(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:   OR Tambo Airport? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   OR Tambo Airport.  So as we were attending that 
20 
workshop I stumbled upon a gentleman who was in the security and risk 
section in the NPA, I think his name was Kenny from the Eastern Cape, 
so as somebody who was in the Risk and Security Section of the NPA 
we exchanged greetings and then he asked if I would be leaving that 
workshop into one of the bedrooms, of the boardrooms at OR to discuss 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 44 of 77 
 
the issues of security surrounding the Cato Manor matter.  It is then 
that I became aware for the very first time that while we are attending a 
SOCA workshop there will also be a separate meeting to discuss 
security issues and concerns about KZN. 
 
So in the outstanding pages of the e-mail I also raised that 
aspect, that look I felt a bit humiliated as the Head of the Division that 
even the issue of security could be discussed without me being 
involved and Kenny was not the only one.  There was also another 
Advocate, Advocate Dawood at National Office, he – as I was going into 
the bathroom him exiting he also remarked similarly that I hope you are 
10 
joining us soon in the meeting to discuss the issue of security about 
the Cato Manor.   Then I just flashed a smile and then left, I did not 
attend that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You had not been invited to the meeting? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   I had not been informed about the meeting nor had 
I been invited to the meeting 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   And he also dealt with the issue of the 
Prosecutor’s memo, that you have not received the Prosecutor’s memo 
but simply an indictment. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe before that did you get to know who had 
convened that meeting that from – to which you were not invited? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   Other than this gentleman Kenny as well as 
Advocate Dawood to date I do not know who were the attendees in that 
meeting, I was never favoured with the agenda of the meeting, nor the 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 45 of 77 
 
minutes of that meeting.  I am not sure if NPA will be able to help the 
Commission with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’mm, h’mm, but you never got more information 
than what these two colleagues of your said? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   Not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Outside of this meeting were you ever 
briefed about what security issues should be taken into account? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   Chair the e-mail that I referred to on page 9 that is 
the e-mail from my fellow colleague, Advocate Chauke, particularly 
10 
paragraph number 2, the last sentence, you can see that he is also 
pending the issue of security.   He says: 
“There are serious issues of security in this matter 
which if necessary you will be briefed about, which 
are not relevant to you and I cannot expose such to 
you at this stage.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So that’s what you knew about allegations of 
security issues in relation to the Cato Manor matter? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   That is the position Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   And as I have said we have dealt with 
the issue that you were expected to sign an indictment, although you 
have not seen neither the docket nor a prosecutor’s memo. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   That is the position. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Did you in fact sign that indictment? 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 46 of 77 
 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   Up until I was recalled on the 9 t h day of December 
2012 I had not put my signature on the indictment. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Now that ties up that part of the 
evidence, if I can just briefly deal with the racketeering matter in the 
Amigos case.  Were you involved in drafting of the charge sheets or the 
indictment for racketeering? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   With the Amigos case maybe to give the context, as 
I indicated I was appointed on 17 May, I became aware of it end of May 
and as soon after that date I requested a meeting with the prosecutor 
at the time.  So at that time no one had been apprehended in the 
10 
matter, so the prosecutor will be the gentleman who is now with the 
ICC, Advocate Anton Steinberg.   
 
So when I looked at my notes last night the first meeting I had 
with him about the matter was on the 9 t h of June 2012, him to come sit 
down with me in the office and tell me what is it that he is having in 
that matter. 
 
After that I requested another meeting with Asset Forfeiture 
Unit with the SAPS particularly the Investigation Team being led by the 
gentleman, I think Lt Col du Plooy, as well as the Forensic Auditing 
Team led by Trevor White. 
20 
 
Thereafter we had a battery of meeting to discuss the matter 
because I had to assemble a team that was going to substitute Anton 
Steinberg as Anton Steinberg was about to leave the country for a 
position at the ICC and indeed I ended up assembling the team led by 
Advocate Dunywa, who was and still is a senior State Advocate in the 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 47 of 77 
 
Office of the DPP KZN, I think the other one was Advocate Nomfundo 
Sipunzi, she is now Regional Court Magistrate in Empangeni, and 
another one is a Magistrate in Pietermaritzburg, Mr Vincent Ntanjana 
and one senior advocate but junior advocate then, Advocate Mthembu. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Okay, now evidence has been led, that is 
indeed there was a racketeering certificate signed by the then National 
– the then NDPP, the one before Jiba, were you involved in having that 
racketeering certificate signed? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   In fact in light of the fact that that matter had 
reams and reams of documents plus minus 220 000 if my memory 
10 
serves me well, not only were the consultations and meetings 
continuous between myself and the Prosecution Team, there were also 
meetings and consultations held with the then NDPP Advocate Menzi 
Simelane, who would time and again have one of his deputies, 
Advocate Silas Ramaite, Willie Hofmeyer, because of this aspect of 
asset forfeiture. 
 
Then eventually after I had satisfied myself that we could enrol 
the matter in court with the charge of racketeering it is then that I took 
my team with the memo to Head Office to do a presentation before 
Advocate Memzi Simelane, as well as his deputies and Willie Hofmeyer 
20 
and then at that meeting there was a great deal of unanimity that my 
Team and myself could safely enrol the matter in court. 
 
So which means the National Director, Menzi, signed the 
racketeering certificate and then as the head of the Division, KZN, I 
signed the indictment which includes among other things a charge of 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 48 of 77 
 
racketeering and money laundering. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Can you recall who was at the meeting 
when you briefed Advocate Memzi Simelane about the possible 
racketeering charge? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   Obviously it will be myself as the Head of the 
Division and then the Prosecuting Team, the members that I have 
aforementioned and then from the head office it used to be the National 
Director of Public Prosecutions at the time, Advocate Memzi Simelane 
as well as his deputy, Advocate Silas Ramaite and Advocate Dawood. 
 
Because of the fact that the Amigos case in KZN was 
10 
umbilically connected with another Amigos case in the Northern Cape a 
decision was taken that each time we meet at National Office to discuss 
the matter that the head of that division in Northern Cape, that would 
Advocate ...(indistinct) be also present with the Team that was 
prosecuting the Amigos case that side.  I am not sure if it was also 
called the Amigos case but as far as I remember it involved one 
gentleman by the name of John Blogg and I think the matter was 
finalised a year or two ago, as well as the Investigating Team led by Lt 
Col du Plooy, and I think the forensic auditor Trevor White would also 
be present. 
20 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Okay, now evidence has been led before 
the Commission by two witnesses, that is Mr Trevor White and Colonel 
du Plooy, that a meeting was arranged for the 23 r d of March 2012 in 
Durban where Advocate Mrwebi stated at the meeting I have decided to 
withdraw charges against Mr Mike Mabuyakhulu and I want to know 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 49 of 77 
 
what evidence you have against Ms Nkonyene.  Were you consulted 
about that? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   In relation to that meeting first and foremost I did 
not attend it, I think I had a meeting with the prosecutors in Ladysmith 
if not Newcastle.   However at the time when the meeting was held I do 
not know how it escaped me, I had not seen that indeed Advocate 
Mrwebi had transmitted an e-mail suggesting that the meeting be held, 
an e-mail wherein I was also copied, so I became aware of the meeting 
because I received, I think it was an SMS from my Line Manager at the 
time saying look there’s a problem it seems our learned colleagues in 
10 
the media are chasing us, they want to know what happened at that 
meeting, the journalists have information that Du Plooy, as the 
investigation officer, had confronted Mrwebi asking him if he was there 
to instruct ...(indistinct) to withdraw, so to cut a long story short I was 
not present at that meeting. 
 
At a later stage when going through the e-mails it is then that I 
realised that when Advocate Mrwebi sent an e-mail that he was coming 
down to KZN to meet the Prosecuting Team he had indeed copied me 
in, in respect of that e-mail. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Were you consulted about the 
20 
withdrawing of those charges? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   I think after that ...(intervenes).  
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   I am talking about before the meeting. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   It is a bit confusing, I would say after that meeting 
there was also another meeting that was held in May 2012, that would 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 50 of 77 
 
be the last meeting me present to discuss the Amigos case, then 
June/July then I was recalled, I do not know what happened thereafter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is the position that you can’t remember whether 
anybody spoke to you prior to that meeting and said we are going to 
withdraw charges against particular accused persons in this matter or 
we are contemplating withdrawing charges and would like to have your 
input.   Is the position that you can’t remember whether anybody spoke 
to you about that? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   Chair that did not happen until the last meeting, I 
am speaking about, that we had to discuss the Amigos case, that would 
10 
have been on the 23 r d or 29 t h of May. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think there is reference to 29 t h of May in your 
...(intervenes).  
ADV MLOTSHWA:   Yes, that would be the meeting where the 
chairperson of the meeting, my Line Manager Advocate Jiba, would 
have said guys let us sit down and talk.  I think her view was there was 
a great number of accused is there no way that we can cut down, and 
then at that meeting I think Advocate Silas Ramaite came up with the 
suggestion that if that were to happen it is not an easy process, we 
must first discuss what meeting, what evidence was there when the 
20 
initial decision was made to enrol the matter in court, to charge people, 
so as to be able to make a determination if at this stage something 
ground breaking exceptional would have happened to justify us 
interfering with the original decision to charge, and then after that 
discussion a decision was reached that there appears to be no reason 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 51 of 77 
 
to tamper with the original decision to charge, then I left that meeting 
with the Prosecuting Team on that note, and as far as I remember the 
DPP Northern Cape Advocate ...(indistinct) was also present but her 
Team from Northern Cape wasn’t, but the detectives, Lt Col du Plooy 
and the forensic auditor as well were not present. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was the meeting of the 29 t h of May that you’re 
talking about before the meeting that you missed in KZN attended by 
Advocate Mrwebi and Advocate Mosing and Col du Plooy and I think Mr 
White when you had gone to have a meeting with prosecutors in New 
Castle, did it come before or after that meeting? 
10 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   I will say the meeting that we had in May was 
precipitated by the March meeting that I did not attend. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So at the meeting that you attended in May was 
Advocate Mrwebi there? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   When the meeting started the Chairperson had 
indicated that on that morning he had reported to be unwell so she 
indicated that she wasn’t sure whether or not Mr Mrwebi was going to 
join us at a later stage. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   What about Mr Mosing, was he present at that 
meeting? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   No Mr Mosing was not present but at the initial 
stages of the meeting Mrwebi came in and joined the meeting as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You mean towards the end of the meeting? 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 52 of 77 
 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   At the initial stages of the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh he came after the meeting had started? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   Yes, after the meeting had ...(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:   But soon after it had started. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   Soon after it had started, at the time when the 
Chairperson was – because when attending that meeting we had not 
been favoured with the agenda of the meeting and so on and so forth, 
so the Chairperson was still outlining the purpose of the meeting and 
as to how the meeting was going to progress, so before she could finish 
off in respect of the introductory remarks fellow colleague Mrwebi 
10 
stepped in. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did the Lead Prosecutor in that matter was it Mr 
Dunywa in KZN 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   It was Advocate Dunywa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did he attend that meeting? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   He was a leader of the Prosecuting Team so I came 
with all members. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So he was – he attended that meeting. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   He was present because at the time when we were 
discussing at the meeting there was a firm view that a person who does 
20 
the presentation for all in terms of identifying that was there in the 
original decision as well as the evidence that was existing at the time 
of reconsidering, if I may call it that way for lack of better words, so it 
would be more appropriate if that is being done by Advocate Dunywa so 
he was also present but my team has changed if I am not mistaken 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 53 of 77 
 
because of promotions and so on and so forth, if I am not mistaken 
Advocate Nomfundo Sipunzi had been appointed to act as Regional 
Court Magistrate in Western Cape so I drew up the new members but 
the lead prosecutor was still there Mr Dunywa ...(indistinct) Mthembu 
and the head of the SACU KZN, Advocate Vimbani, Bulelwa Vimbani, so 
they were also present as members of the Amigos Prosecuting Team. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now after the meeting that you missed, which was 
attended by Advocate Mrwebi, Advocate Mosing in KZN did you get a 
briefing as to what transpired in that meeting? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   Obviously after I had received an SMS from my 
10 
Line Manager saying please liaise with this spokesperson, the 
spokesperson at the time was Advocate Mthunzi Maka and see how you 
deal with these questions that are coming through. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The media queries.   
ADV MLOTSHWA:   The media queries, I requested to meet the 
Prosecuting Team.  It was during that meeting where I was informed 
that it would appear that the meeting with Mosing and Mrwebi did not 
end on the right note, there were heated exchanges, the investigating 
officer confronting Mrwebi about – because it was already in the media, 
the newspaper had already started writing articles that I was refusing, 
20 
there was a perception that I was refusing to withdraw and then I was 
going to be forced to withdrawn certain counts and so on and so forth, 
so at that meeting it would appear that Lt Col du Plooy confronted 
Mrwebi exactly with that allegation, is it true that this is what you 
intend doing so that’s the report I got. 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 54 of 77 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But were you also told that Mr Mrwebi had said they 
intended withdrawing the charges against I think Mr Mabuyakhulu I 
think. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   Yes Mabuyakhulu. 
CHAIRPERSON:   With regard to either Mr Mabuyakhulu or Ms Peggy 
Nkonyene, as I understand the evidence of Mr White and Colonel du 
Plooy in regard to one of them Mr Mrwebi had said a decision has been 
taken to withdraw charges against this one.  Tell me what evidence 
there is against this other one, I just can’t remember whether it’s 
...(intervenes).  
10 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Chair if I can assist here it was Mr Mike 
Mabuyakhulu that Advocate Mrwebi indicated he is withdrawing charges 
against. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Were you told that that is what had happened at that 
time? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   Chairperson I might have misunderstood, the way I 
understood it was that during that meeting it was a confrontation 
between the investigating officer, Lt Colonel du Plooy confronting 
Mrwebi with the allegation that the sole purpose why Mrwebi had 
requested the meeting is because he wanted to achieve this objective 
20 
of withdrawing charges against certain accused. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So what you were told was more general about 
specific two individuals? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   It was more general. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, who did you get your report from? 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 55 of 77 
 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   I think I met the Prosecuting Team. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The whole Team? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   The whole – with the ...(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or some of them? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   We normally met every Friday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   In respect of that project. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   So I think it was one of those normal Friday 
meetings with the team just to get the heads up. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now you said that at the meeting of the 29 t h of 
May, which Mr Mrwebi attended, you said that the conclusion was that 
no charges were to be withdrawn, did I understand you correctly? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   That was the unanimous decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which means even Mr Mrwebi went along with that 
decision? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   Including Willie Hofmeyer, Silas Ramaite, 
...(Indistinct), as well as my team. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, thank you. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Now just to be clear the evidence of 
20 
Colonel du Plooy and Trevor White is that at the commencement of the 
meeting of the 23 r d of March 2012 Advocate Mrwebi almost in his 
introductory remarks he said: 
“I 
intend 
withdrawing 
charges 
against 
Mr 
Mike 
Mabuyakhulu and what evidence do you have about 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 56 of 77 
 
Ms Nkonyene.   
Were you consulted about the withdrawal of the charges 
against Mr Mike Mabuyakhulu? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   No. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Does Advocate Mrwebi have the authority 
to withdraw charges – to withdraw those charges? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   My understanding of the situation was that 
Advocate Mrwebi was a Special Director, Specialised Commercial Crime 
Unit at the National Office.  So a decision to prosecute had been taken 
by myself as the Head of the Division obviously in conjunction with the 
10 
Prosecution Team in the matter.   So when it comes to a direct answer 
whether or not he could withdraw I think if one looks at the nature of 
the law that could happen in conjunction with or in consultation with the 
DPP, but in the light of the fact that the certificate had been signed by 
the National Director of Public Prosecutions I think that would have 
necessitated a thorough comprehensive presentation to the National 
Director of Prosecutions in terms of demonstrating what is that would 
have changed to warrant the interference with the original decision and 
make the decision that has been made. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Okay, so you have already testified that 
20 
subsequent to the March 2012 meeting – a meeting on the 29 t h of May 
2012 this issue was rehashed and it was agreed that charges will not 
be dropped. 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   That was the unanimous decision. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   In August of 2012 charges were 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 57 of 77 
 
withdrawn against Mr Mike Mabuyakhulu and Ms Nkonyene, were you 
consulted on the decisions to withdraw those charges as well as four 
other people? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   When the decision to withdraw charges was made I 
had already gone back to my position as a Deputy Director Public 
Prosecutions so I was no longer the Head of the Division so – but to 
answer you directly I was not consulted regarding the withdrawal of the 
charges. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the point you make is that there was no need for 
anybody to consult you at that time because you were no longer acting 
10 
DPP? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   I think so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you would need to be consulted if you were still 
acting as the head, isn’t it?   Or did you remain part of the Prosecution 
Team in the case in which case maybe then you may have needed to be 
consulted in that capacity, not in the capacity of Acting DPP? 
ADV MLOTSHWA:   The day I stepped down, on the 9 t h, you will see as 
I testified Chair in the Mokgoro Commission of Inquiry I had made an 
undertaking to prepare a handover report for my successor.  The 
following Monday would have been the 12 t h of July 2012, so during that 
20 
weekend I put together the handing over report including the sensitive 
files that I had in my custody, the huge projects that I was handling in 
the matter including the certificates that I had that my successor had to 
be aware of.  So, the following Monday the twelfth I gave the successor 
the handover report with all the files that I was handling.  That was the 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 58 of 77 
 
last time I knew what was happening in the matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but the question was if you were no longer 
acting DPP would there have been any basis upon which it can be said 
you should have been consulted after you had stepped down. 
MR MLOTSHWA:   In the world of idealism, Chair, ideally as a person who 
had been handling the project since 9 June 2010, it is now July 2012.  
Two years later.  Ordinarily, it will not have been unreasonable for one to 
expect a person to say Mlotshwa you seems to be au fait with the ins and 
outs of the project merely to reduce certain things to dimension how does 
X Y happen?  So, I was completely out of the picture.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR MLOTSHWA:   That is the world of realism. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, okay. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Now, in August 2012, when the charges 
were withdrawn, the evidence was led that you were no longer, that was 
the, the decision was taken by Advocate Noko.  Is that correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well he was no longer there. 
MR MLOTSHWA:   I was no longer acting, I was also reading it in the 
newspapers  I think that will be those articles, that you – that are 
attached to these bundles.  I was also following the matter in the 
20 
newspapers …(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I think it is enough that you were no longer there.   
MR MLOTSHWA:   Okay. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Now, how were you – when did you formally 
become aware that you will be removed from your role as Acting DPP? 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 59 of 77 
 
MR MLOTSHWA:   That I was going to be removed, I think from February 
2012 until July time and again in the newspapers that would crop up that I 
was bucking under pressure.  There was a firm view that a need is there 
for me to be removed and even when I was attending the funerals during 
the weekends, some people will approach me and give their sympathies to 
me, that they sympathize with me, this was an axe was about to fall on 
my head. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Besides the media reports and the informal 
conversations that you had, when were you formally advised that your 
time for DPP is now up – acting DPP is now up? 
10 
MR MLOTSHWA:   If I am not mistaken there was a point where my 
successor, because she was the Head of the Tax Unit had a meeting with 
her Unit in Durban, somebody at that meeting, one of her subordinates 
did call me to say:   
“Haibo here the Supervisor is saying, she will be 
taking over from you as the DPP.” 
 
On the basis and strength of that call, I wanted to know with 
certainty to whether or not that was the position.  I decided to transmit an 
e-mail to the then Acting CEO in the Chairperson, Advocate Karin Van 
Rensburg.  In the e-mail, I was particular.  Rumour is flying fast and thick 
20 
that my days are numbered, I will be removed as the Head of the 
Province.  Tag take me into your full confidence, is this rumour true?  She 
responded in a Veritas e-mail, one or two lines, saying:  
“No formal position has been taken in that regard.  
Consider 
yourself 
as 
being 
the 
Head 
of 
the 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 60 of 77 
 
Province.” 
 
That is why my lower jaw dropped a day or two when I received 
a call from Advocate Jiba saying, can you please come to Head Office on 
a Friday, that was the 9t h.  So, I could then relate what I had had with the 
invitation for the meeting at National Office.  So psychologically I was 
prepared, so indeed when I went to the Headquarters NPA, upon entry in 
her chambers she was with Advocate Thoko Majokweni, the Acting Head, 
Prosecution Services at the time, and my successor was also there.  
Other than short exchange of greetings, my Line Manager Jiba told me 
that Simphiwe you have to hand over to your successor, a decision had 
10 
been made that she takes over.  She thanked me for the excellent job that 
I had done in the Province.  I also on my own accord took her into my full 
confidence in terms of assuring them that I was prepared, willing and 
ready to put together the handover report, so that my successor could 
have a soft landing on the acting job the following week.  Hence I had to 
give her the handover report on a Monday, on 12 July 2012. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   So, your evidence is, you were formally 
informed on the 9t h of July 2012 and you did the handing over report on 
the 12 t h of July 2012. 
MR MLOTSHWA:   Yes.  And this happens in the full context of the fact 
20 
that initially I was appointed for six months.  After six months there was a 
view that I had done well in the Province.  That six months had to be 
extended by another six months.  During that time they were trying to 
clear up that position of the DPP at the time.   Advocate Shamila Batohi 
with the ICC, so after 12 months of my acting a memo was circulated 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 61 of 77 
 
throughout the country to all the prosecutors saying up until the situation 
of Shamila was, Advocate Shamila Batohi was cleared up, I would remain 
the Acting Head of Prosecutions in KZN.  Which was contradicted by a 
record, because if that circular was saying up until the situation of 
Shamila is cleared, and then now I am recalled before that situation was 
cleared.  Hence I indicated that there were some colleagues in private 
practice were prepared to represent me pro amico in terms of taking both 
the Minister and the President to court in relation to a legitimate 
expectation because in these circumstances, the expectation for my 
permanent appointed was not self-induce but was induced by my 
10 
communication with the entity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where is that circular?  It is not here because I did not 
see it here.  You are not aware that it is here? 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   It is not here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Looking at Mr Nicholson, he does not think it is here.  
Would you be able to find it? 
MR MLOTSHWA:   I will be sending the first appointment of six months, 
the extension of six months, the e-mail saying up until the position of the 
permanent DPP was cleared up, I will remain acting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, now you said that on the 9 t h of July 2012, when 
20 
you met with Miss Jiba and Miss Noko and Advocate Majokweni I think 
and Miss Jiba said you hand to hand over to Miss Noko.  Did you say that 
she thanked you for an excellent job done? 
MR MLOTSHWA:   Yes, yes.  She told me I had executed – I had 
acquitted myself well as the Acting DPP KZN. 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 62 of 77 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you sure that that is what she said? 
MR MLOTSHWA:   Yes, I can …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are sure about that? 
MR MLOTSHWA:   Yes, I am. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, now, you had been acting in this position for about 
what? 
MR MLOTSHWA:   Two years. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Two years.  During that time would there have been 
performance appraisals about how you were performing as Acting DPP? 
MR MLOTSHWA:   I think yes, I had succeeded in getting a cash 
10 
performance bonus. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MLOTSHWA:   And then most importantly my qualifications are Chair, 
I had a Baccalaureus LL.B Masters Human Resource I think I was busy 
with my BA Honours in Philosophy ...(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MLOTSHWA:    So, everybody in the division including the judicial both 
in the Low Court and High Court will say the same whenever I stumble 
upon them that we are looking forward to your permanent appointment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But now I am looking at whether there were any 
20 
performance assessments or appraisals done within the NPA by your 
superiors which reflect what they thought about your performance for that 
time …(intervenes). 
MR MLOTSHWA:   Ja, in terms of …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is there something in writing? 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 63 of 77 
 
MR MLOTSHWA:   I think if one goes through the archives in NPA in 
terms of rankings when I was appointed I think the division was number 8 
subject to corrections of course.  But in the following year 2011 March or 
April I think we were number 2 and then I got a cash performance bonus 
…(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
MR MLOTSHWA:    Monetary reward. 
CHAIRPERSON:   For good performance. 
MR MLOTSHWA:   For good performance.  Yes, and most importantly if 
you look at the Public Service Act it stipulates, I have not checked now I 
10 
checked then, it stipulates that if you act in the Public Service you cannot 
be remunerated for a period exceeding 12 years.  Meaning, the last time I 
received a salary for being the Acting Head of the Prosecution was 2011 
in May.  When I was having all these problems you were seeing in the 
media I was not even getting paid for it, I was getting paid for the Deputy 
Director Public Prosecutions position.  Of course, with that indication that 
itinerant it would appear that you will have been appointed permanently 
so I don’t  worry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, but – I am asking whether somewhere there you 
should be document or documents that record how your performance was  
20 
viewed by your superiors during the time you were Acting DPP. 
MR MLOTSHWA:   My understanding is that the Acting – the CEO at the 
time was Advocate Karen van Rensburg I think that would be the person 
at the time best place to have the documentation I think she 
…(intervenes). 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 64 of 77 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you saying there should be documentation? 
MR MLOTSHWA:   There should be documentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Were there performance assessments there were 
conducted on your performance?  Or on the performance of your office 
Acting DPP. 
MR MLOTSHWA:    The NPA generally after three months there will be 
those performance assessment with the difference being that some are 
formal some are informal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MLOTSHWA:   But, with the last annual performance assessment it 
10 
will definitely be formal and it is on the basis and strength of it that a 
determination is made whether you deserve a monetary reward for 
excellent job or not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, the one in respect of which you were given a cash 
bonus or payment for good performance, when did that happen?  Just 
before you stepped down or much earlier? 
MR MLOTSHWA:   I think that would have happened in 2011. 
CHAIRPERSON:   2011? 
MR MLOTSHWA:   Yes, 2011. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would you remember whether it might have been 
20 
towards the end of 2011. 
MR MLOTSHWA:   My understanding then I do not know now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MLOTSHWA:   The Government financial year commences on I think 
1 s t of April to end of March the following year.  Yes.  So, the one that I am 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 65 of 77 
 
making reference to will be the one that would have wrapped up I think 
2011, March. 
CHAIRPERSON:   March, okay. 
MR MLOTSHWA:   But more often than not you will find that even though 
the year ends in March but the processing of the assessments 
…(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, continue. 
MR MLOTSHWA:   Will be a bit delayed and then you find that the 
payments in relation to that cash performance bonuses maybe are paid in 
May, June or July. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but did you say that when you started as Acting 
DPP in terms of performance the KZN DPP’s office was ranked number 
eight out of nine provinces, is that what you said. 
MR MLOTSHWA:   As far as my memory serves me well that was the 
position. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And when you stepped down do you know where it 
was ranked. 
MR MLOTSHWA:   When I stepped down I think it had it was I think it was 
– I would have  go back to the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well you can if you remember for sure you can tell us if 
20 
you are not sure you can say you think it was ranked whatever 
…(intervenes). 
MR MLOTSHWA:   I cannot remember the position, but it was no longer 
...(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:   Leave room for …(intervenes). 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 66 of 77 
 
MR MLOTSHWA:   It was still performing well but no longer number two it 
is just that I do not have the specifics when I stepped down. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would it have been around three or four? 
MR MLOTSHWA:   I cannot put my ...(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:   You cannot remember?  But had there been a huge 
improvement in the performance of that office since you took over, can 
one say that? 
MR MLOTSHWA:   I can safely say that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Is there something you can find later on 
and send to the Legal Team that might reflect what the position was or is 
10 
that something that would be difficult to find after so many years? 
MR MLOTSHWA:   As I have indicated that I am no longer in the NPA the 
only documentation that I will be able to present here at the Commission 
will be the document explaining my appointment for first six months, the 
extension of six months, and the circular saying up until the position of 
the permanent DPP’s clarified I would remain the Acting Head. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and you say that at the time you were asked to 
step down the position relating to Advocate Batohi had not been finalized 
as far as you recall? 
MR MLOTSHWA:   As far as I recall she was still with the ICC at the 
20 
Head. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Okay, alright. 
MR MLOTSHWA:   But I think, at that time there was a suggestion that 
she had taken I am not sure whether a contract of five years or seven 
years. 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 67 of 77 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay. 
MR MLOTSHWA:   So, in other words it had been clarified. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MLOTSHWA:   Warranting or justifying the permanent appointment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that is fine.  And Miss Noko, what position did 
she hold at the time she – you stepped down when before she became 
Acting DPP? 
MR MLOTSHWA:   She was one of the Deputy Directors of Public 
Prosecutions Head in the Tax Unit in Durban. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Okay, no that is fine. 
10 
MR MLOTSHWA:   In fact, she was my subordinate reporting to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She was your subordinate.  Okay.  Mr Nicholson. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Okay, now just to wrap up on this point the 
issue of Miss Noko – Advocate Noko being appointed, in which office did 
she work?  You say she was your subordinate in which office did she 
work? 
MR MLOTSHWA:   She was in the Tax Unit, Durban. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   What does the Tax Unit do? 
MR MLOTSHWA:   That will be the Unit assigned with the duty and 
responsibility to prosecute the Tax VAT transgressions. 
20 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Okay. 
MR MLOTSHWA:   Offences. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Do you know how long she was in the NPA. 
MR MLOTSHWA:   No, no. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Are you able to comment on her court 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 68 of 77 
 
experience? 
MR MLOTSHWA:   You mean in terms of me seeing her to go to court 
during the time when she was my subordinate? 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Well, can you say anything about her court 
experience? 
MR MLOTSHWA:   Ay, I do not remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Did Miss Jiba tell you – give you any particular 
reason why you were being asked to step down at the time that she asked 
you to step down, particularly in the light of the circular that you talked 
about? 
10 
MR MLOTSHWA:   Chair, at the time when she indicated that I had to do 
had to handover and at that time I was personally I wasn’t okay because 
of stress as you could see in the newspapers that they were reporting 
that I was bucking under pressure.  That was indeed the position to such 
an extent that in June 2012 I was supposed to be running my third or 
fourth Comrade Marathon my – the family doctor had made a 
recommendation that I should not run because of my state of – emotional 
state.  So, to me it came as a great relief.  The only thing I could do to 
her was to thank her on behalf of the NPA for having accorded me an 
opportunity to get an experience and explore whatever ideas I had that I 
20 
could convert into deliverables within the entity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It sounds like you wanted to get out of the position, is 
that true or not really? 
MR MLOTSHWA:   No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not want to get out of the position? 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 69 of 77 
 
MR MLOTSHWA:   All I am trying to say is that the circumstances were so 
unbearable. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR MLOTSHWA:   To such an extent that I was expecting anything not 
that I wanted to ...(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:   Get out of the position? 
MR MLOTSHWA:   To get out of the position. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was bringing about this – what was causing this 
stress that you are talking about in, because I assume it was work related 
obviously, I am not interested in personal matters. 
10 
MR MLOTSHWA:   It was quite a number of professional reasons.  Among 
others, when I took over as the Head of the Division.  Risk and Securities 
Services conducted an investigation, and when the investigation was 
conducted it was then that the investigation was able to unearth that my 
life and that of my family was not safe. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Were you in danger? 
MR MLOTSHWA:   So, we were in danger.  On the basis and strength of 
that I was afforded, and I was given security bodyguards and security at 
my house.  So, as people were talking about all these things me being 
under pressure.  On the side, I was also having a problem – an allegation 
20 
that in the first place I never deserved security and then there were 
certain allegations people saying I am abusing security. 
 
  Myself and my kids, and my family we are inseparable, people 
starting to question how come when they go to school I am there with 
security and so on and so forth.  So, and then when I stepped down when 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 70 of 77 
 
I left the office I used to arrive early in the morning and leave late, seven 
o’clock, six o’clock.  As we were leaving with the bodyguards received a 
call prior to my calling, they received a call I think few meters out of my 
office saying I must be dumped on the road.  So, because I had worked 
with them for a number of months after receiving that call they told me 
that:  
“Ay look the call that we are receiving is that we 
need to dump you here on the road.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   This is now on the ...(intervenes). 
MR MLOTSHWA:   That is 2012. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Day after …(intervenes). 
MR MLOTSHWA:   No, around March. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, long before you stepped down. 
MR MLOTSHWA:   Long before, a month or two before I stepped down, I 
had been – the security had been removed from me.  So as – they 
received that call in the car they told me that they were receiving an 
instruction to dump you here on the road, what do you say? 
 
 Then I told them that:  
“Guys I do not give a damn even if I lose a job with you, I 
feel sorry for you guys.  Make a decision if you will not be 
20 
fired by proceeding to take me home because we are now 
seven kilometres away from my house, if your job is safe 
we can proceed and you can drop me off at home, or if you 
drop me here I can call the wife at home to come and pick 
me up.  I will tell her where I am and then they said it was 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 71 of 77 
 
very, the situation was very sour in the car, they said no 
we will rather drop you off at home, we will see what they 
do at work.” 
 
 So, few minutes later they also received a call.  Bodyguards from 
the security guards at home because they were stable guards who were 
guarding my house.  So those security guards were calling the 
bodyguards asking if they received any call because they had also 
received a call saying they must leave my house.  So, it was a cocktail 
...(intervenes).   
CHAIRPERSON:   It was a number of factors. 
10 
MR MLOTSHWA:   Accumulating effect of which, so I had to be 
hospitalized for bloods and so on and so forth.  And the doctors were 
saying they could attribute it to nothing else but a stressful 
...(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:   Stress. 
MR MLOTSHWA:   Environment I was finding myself in.  So, when I 
received that call to go there …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, that was the context why you had to leave. 
MR MLOTSHWA:   So, in a way what they were saying accept whatever.  
Yes, yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Do I understand that very abruptly the 
guards were removed from you? 
MR MLOTSHWA:   That was the position. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   And who provided these protectors and 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 72 of 77 
 
security guards at your home? 
MR MLOTSHWA:   As I indicated there were threats at my house, there 
were threats in the office, people calling not telling, not indicating who 
they were, buzzing at the gate at home and so on and so forth, reported 
to 
Crime 
Intelligence. 
Crime 
Intelligence 
conducted 
their 
own 
investigation, I think I also have those reports.  They conducted their own 
investigation after the investigation they came back saying the situation 
warrants that I be assigned with security.  So, on the basis and strengths 
of that I had to be given security.   I mean the bodyguards and then at 
home the security guards.  I would say it was the Department of Justice in 
10 
conjunction with NPA. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Okay.  And who gave the instruction to very 
abruptly remove those security measures? 
MR MLOTSHWA:   Ay the way I was – the condition I was in mentally and 
emotional at the time including my family I did not even bother to ask 
because I could feel that at the time I was swimming against the tidal 
wave. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Ja.  But it may have been somebody from 
either the NPA or the Department of Justice? 
MR MLOTSHWA:   To date I never …(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But he does not know. 
MR MLOTSHWA:   Even ask the bodyguards nor the security guards. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Okay.  You also mention, you referred to 
the media reports that said that you were buckling under pressure, the 
pressure you were buckling under, has it related to the normal work that 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 73 of 77 
 
you were doing in the DPP’s office? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, first ask whether he was buckling under pressure 
in the first place?  
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Are those reports correct? 
MR MLOTSHWA:   You know with media sometimes; it is difficult if they 
have not given you the foundation upon which they are making the 
allegation.  But to cut a long story short the prosecutorial job is, it comes 
with a lot of pressure as well.  The Head of the Prosecution is worse. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There certainly was pressure.  Is that correct? 
MR MLOTSHWA:   If you look at the projects that were in the delivery, 
10 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, there was pressure.  But, are you able to say you 
were able to handle the pressure or are you saying that you were not able 
to handle the pressure? 
MR MLOTSHWA:   I will say I was able to handle the pressure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay. 
MR MLOTSHWA:   If I was not I would have voluntarily …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:    Resigned 
MR MLOTSHWA:   Came in and resigned. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   So, the issues that lead you to be 
20 
hospitalized, the issues that lead you to miss the Comrades Marathon, 
was that normal work pressure? 
MR MLOTSHWA:   Not that I missed the Comrades.  I said I ran against 
the – my medical practitioners’ advice.  Their view was I shouldn’t  but I 
did.  So, I think it was work related. 
27 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 220 
 
Page 74 of 77 
 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Was it normal work pressure?  That is the 
question I want to get to. 
MR MLOTSHWA:   I would say it was an abnormal pressure. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Did you say abnormal pressure? 
MR MLOTSHWA:   I would say it was abnormal if it culminates in one 
being seen by the doctor. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Okay.  Now, just to wrap up your evidence, 
after spending nearly all your adult life as a career prosecutor and rising 
to the ranks of Senior Deputy DPP and in fact Acting DPP, why did you 
join the Bar? 
10 
MR MLOTSHWA:   In fact, when I picked up all these problems in 2012. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I guess the more appropriate question is, why did 
you leave the NPA? 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Why 
did 
you 
leave 
the 
NPA

…(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where you went is might be neither here nor there.  But 
why did you leave the NPA after so many years? 
MR MLOTSHWA:   I thought I had done everything in the NPA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay. 
MR MLOTSHWA:   From the …(indistinct).

CHAIRPERSON:   It was for career reasons.  It was for career purposes. 
MR MLOTSHWA:   That is the position. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Okay, and are you able to given the fact 
the issues that we dealt with in the Cato Manor prosecution the way

prosecutors were being imposed into this province – into your province, 
given the way charges were withdrawn after you had left can we draw any 
conclusions from your no longer acting as a DPP?  Can we draw any 
conclusions from that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe don’t put it like that.  Are you able to tell us why 
you were asked to step down? 
MR MLOTSHWA:   Chair, I would think that falls particularly within the 
personal knowledge of the people who recalled me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You, yourself are not able to say why you were not told 
and you have not analysed what happened and come to any conclusion as 
10 
to why you were asked to step down? 
MR MLOTSHWA:   After I had stepped down I was also looking at the 
speculations including the timing of the withdrawals and so on and so 
forth, that possibly my recalling could be attributed to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Could be attributed to? 
MR MLOTSHWA:    That the main reason why I was recalled was to make 
certain decisions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, alright.  Thank you. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Chair, those were my questions for this 
witness. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, Mr Mlotshwa for coming to give evidence.  
We appreciate it.  But for now, you are excused.  If there is a need for us 
to call you back, we call you back.  But thank you very much, you are 
excused. 
MR MLOTSHWA:   Thank you Chair.

CHAIRPERSON:    We are going to adjourn for the day.  There would be no 
hearing tomorrow.  There would be no hearing next week as well.  But as 
things stand it is intended that the hearings should resume on Wednesday 
the week after next week.   
 
The venue for the hearing will no longer be this venue beyond the 
end of February.  The plans are that the hearings will be held in the old 
Chamber of the Johannesburg Municipality.  Arrangements are being 
finalised but as I understand it, it is just the formalities.  
 
 In substance an agreement has been reached and the 
Commission for the rest of the year, its seating’s will be in the old 
10 
Chamber at the Johannesburg Municipality.  So, but in due course there 
will be a media statement once all the formalities has been finalised.  We 
adjourn.
