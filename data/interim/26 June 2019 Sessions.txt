PROCEEDINGS ON 26 JUNE 2019  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Good 
morning 
Ms 
September, 
good 
morning 
everybody. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes we are Chair.  Before we begin 
Chair there are legal representatives of certain persons in the 
proceedings today in regard not only to this witness but also implicated 
parties.  With your leave may they place themselves on record please?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think Mr Katz. 
ADV ANTON KATZ:  Thank you Mr Chairperson my name is Anton Katz 
from the Cape Town bar. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ANTON KATZ:    I am instructed by Ms B Xulu and Partners on 
behalf of Mr Vuyisile Kona who is potentially an implicated person in 
respect of the witness that is going to be called today.  Thank you 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much. 
20 
ADV LUDWIG BARENDS:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning.

Page 3 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LUDWIG BARENDS:    We are here on the behalf of the witness  
Sizakele Mzimela today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV LUDWIG BARENDS:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Ms September.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair.  Chair today we 
present the evidence of an ex-employee of South African Airways who 
is currently an employee of South African Express.  Her evidence is 
primarily focussed on governance at SAA and she will take us through 
10 
certain events that she experienced during her tenure at SAA in 
relation to aspects of governance.  In doing so the evidence  that she 
presents is by and large confined to her term of office which was 1 April 
2010 until October of 2012.  Parts of her evidence Chair certainly 
relates to evidence that has already been placed before this 
commission through the witnesses of amongst others or rather in 
particular Ms Vytjie Mentor, Ms Cheryl Carolus and to a certain extent 
Ms Barbara Hogan.  In that context the evidence that this evidence – 
that this witness presents today augments evidence that has already 
been placed before this commission.   Alternatively just corroborates 
20 
versions that have been placed before this commission.  In so doing the 
bundle before you Chair is marked with your leave DD14 and with your 
permission I would just like to take you through what is contained in the  
bundle? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The lever arch file containing the statement or 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 4 of 218 
 
affidavit of Ms Sizakele Petunia Mzimela will be marked Exhibit DD14.  
Yes you may go ahead. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair.  Chair before you 
the bundle contains two parts.  The first part is from pages 1 to 215 
that is 215 and that is the sworn statement of this witness in addition to 
the annexures that will be referred to today.   
CHAIRPERSON:  As the sworn statement and annexures?  It is the – 
her sworn statement and the annexures to her statement?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes Chair.  Then… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said in addition to so I was wondering whether 
her statement is 200 an something pages.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay right. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  That is the full bundle of her 
evidence. And then the second part of the bundle includes an affidavit 
by an Advocate Sandra Coetzee that can be found from pages 216 to 
229. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Chair Advocate Coetzee will not be 
giving evidence today at these proceedings.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Who? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Or rather will not be…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Advocate Coetzee. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 5 of 218 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Advocate Coetzee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Will not be giving oral testimony at 
all and the affidavit that appears in the bundle was actually only 
received yesterday.  Notwithstanding that the affidavit in a statement 
form and not deposed to before  a commissioner of oaths does in fact 
form part of this witness’ bundle as Annexure 6.  In other words at Tab 
6 Chair you will find the statement of Advocate Sandra Coetzee, Sandra 
Julie Hester Coetzee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it signed? 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  It is signed on the last page as a 
statement which appears… 
CHAIRPERSON:  It appears to be an affidavit?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Sorry Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  It appears to be an affidavit, is it an affidavit?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  No Chair it is just a mere statement.  
The signature on page 107…  
CHAIRPERSON:  But – but at the beginning she says she states under 
oath and at the end I think I see a commissioner’s – a commissioner of 
oaths signature – yes I do. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the 25 June 2019.06.2  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :   Yes that is the – that is the affidavit 
at the end of the bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 6 of 218 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  That… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why – why is it not an affidavit then?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  No Chair you are in fact correct that 
is in fact the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  But the exact same document 
appears in the form of a statement.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  At page 101. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Of the bundle which is an annexure 
to this witness’s evidence.  In other words when it was clarified that 
Advocate Sandra Coetzee will not be coming to give oral evidence her 
statement was converted into an affidavit and that was merely then to 
transpose it into – sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who clarified that she would not be – who clarified 
that she would not be coming to give evidence?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  It was the decision of the legal team 
in consultation with the investigators as I understan d it to be Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but you cannot put in an affidavit on the basis that 
20 
the legal team decides that somebody will not be called.  I decide in 
the end whether somebody will be called.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  As it pleases Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They can take a view whether they think it is 
necessary but they must put that to me and I decide that.  
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 7 of 218 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  As it pleases Chair and so by your 
direction we are guided by you as to whether or not you wish Ms 
Advocate Coetzee to come and give evidence. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  And why – why did the legal team 
think she should not be called?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  The evidence that she presents in 
her affidavit is merely corroborative – it merely corroborates the 
version of… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is not a ground for not calling – you know not 
calling a witness. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  As it pleases Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have – what I have indicated before is that if – if a 
witness’ evidence does not appear to be in dispute o r is unlikely to be 
challenged provisionally one can work on the basis that an affidavit 
would be sufficient but steps should be taken to see whether there is 
somebody who might wish to challenge it and if it appears that there is 
somebody who will challen ge it that witness may have to be called.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  As it pleases Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so I think that therefore any impression that 
may have been created in her mind that she definitely will not be called 
20 
should be corrected. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether she is called or not will be a decision that 
can be taken later. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  We will be guided by you Chair. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 8 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  To that extent though R ule 3.3 
Notices were in fact prepared yesterday.  Notwithstanding the fact that 
we only received the signed affidavit yesterday and I understand from 
the secretariat that it has in fact been sent out this morning.  So there 
were 3.3 Notices – three notices in particular that were sent out this 
morning and none of it has returned as not received.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But why is it so urgent that her statement or her 
affidavit should be part of today’s proceedings if notices have not been 
issued and she is not here to give evidence today?  
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  I do not understand your question 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why is Ms Coetzee’s statement or affidavit part of the 
bundle before state – Rule 3.3 Notices are sent out and have been 
received by the relevant implicated persons when she is not here to 
give evidence.  Why can all that not wait?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Chair the crux of her evidence is 
integrated or parts of the evidence that she gives on affidavit is 
integrated into the evidence of this particular witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I know Mr Katz is itching to say something.  Mr 
20 
Katz if it is something that – if it is not an objection then I can hear you 
immediately but if you have an objection I can hear you after finishing 
with her.  Ja okay.  Yes Ms September.  So why should her evidence – 
her affidavit be here in this – her affidavit be in this bundle in 
circumstances where those who may be implicated in her affidavit have 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 9 of 218 
 
not been given Rule 3.3 Notices?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Chair they have been given 3.3 
Notices. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  In respect of the affidavit they were 
given them this morning.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  In respect…  
CHAIRPERSON:  But is that in compliance with the rules?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SE PTEMBER:  No Chair it certainly does not 
10 
comply… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what is the justification for not complying with the 
Rules? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Chair according to the sequence of 
events Ms Mzimela deposed to her affidavit and Rule 3.3 Notices were 
sent out in respect of her evidence.  The very three people who are 
implicated by Advocate Coetzee in her affidavit are also implicated in 
the evidence of – or may be implicated sorry in the evidence of Ms 
Mzimela.  And so there is a commonality in not onl y the identity of the 
parties who may be implicated but also the type of evidence that may 
20 
be led which may implicate them.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me hear Mr Katz. 
ADV ANTON KATZ:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Katz.  Yes. 
ADV ANTON KATZ:  I am not sure whether what I am going to say 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 10 of 218 
 
constitutes an objection or placing something on record.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ANTON KATZ:    But this morning ten minutes ago I was given the 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ANTON KATZ:    Of Ms Coetzee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ANTON KATZ:    I have looked at it literally in two minutes and 
what I can say 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV ANTON KATZ:    Is that we would disagree with Ms September.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
 ADV ANTON KATZ:   Advocate September’s description of it being a 
confirmatory or integrated affidavit.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ANTON KATZ:    There are facts 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ANTON KATZ:    Which are wider than that deposed to by the 
witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV ANTON KATZ:    In Ms Coetzee’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV ANTON KATZ:   Which I have not even had an opportunity to 
consider. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 11 of 218 
 
ADV ANTON KATZ:    They are wider. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ANTON KATZ:   So it is not correct to say that it is a confirmatory 
of one page confirmatory which would be a different thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ANTON KATZ:    It is a substantive affidavit with new facts.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ANTON KATZ:    And I wish to place that on record.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ANTON KATZ:    As it pleases. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  Well then maybe before you sit down Mr 
Katz I am – I am concerned all the time that implicated persons should 
give – should get proper notice.  Sometimes it might not be as full a 
notice as the rules require but then they must be proper justi fication.  
There is provision in the rules as you will be aware for an implicated 
person who feels that he or she was not given enough time in terms of 
their Rule 3.3 Notice to approach the Chairperson for whatever relief 
and attempts would be made to try and strike a balance.  So I am 
concerned about that part.  I note that from your side you have not had 
enough time to look at the affidavit and probably that explains why you 
20 
are not sure whether to put it as an objection but you just want to place 
on record that the affidavit appears to go beyond what the particularly 
this witness has said. 
ADV ANTON KATZ:    And I 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 12 of 218 
 
ADV ANTON KATZ:    And I suppose I would want an opportunity to 
consult with my client. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ANTON KATZ:    As to whether the factual allegations made by the 
Coetzee affidavit are correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ANTON KATZ:   And if they are not correct then I will advise him 
as to what options are available. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ANTON KATZ:   Then I would approach the commission 
10 
accordingly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ANTON KATZ:    But at this stage it would be unfair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV ANTON KATZ:    It would be unfair for me to suggest  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ANTON KATZ:    Anything other than as far as this witness is 
concerned that her evidence includes the affidavit of Coetzee at this 
stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
20 
ADV ANTON KATZ:    So we would – I suppose prima facie we would 
ask the Chairperson to rule that the evidence of Coetzee is not to be 
considered as part of the record or the commission until such time as 
my client has had an opportunity to consider it and make a decision as 
to whether he wishes to place any evidence before the commission, 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 13 of 218 
 
cross-examine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ANTON KATZ:    But certainly not through this witness.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Maybe what we – maybe what one of the ways 
of dealing with it would be to arrange that this witness for the next 
maybe two hours does not give evidence that would relate to this 
particular – to what is covered – what is not covered – what is not 
covered in her own affidavit – in other words does not go – does not 
deal with issues that your client has not been notified about okay.  
Maybe she was not going to do so because this affidavit – those 
10 
matters may be fall outside of her knowledge and they fall within the 
knowledge of Ms Coetzee only. 
ADV ANTON KATZ:   That would be [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So maybe if she – maybe if she were to just focus on 
what is in here affidavit because your client has  had notice of that. 
ADV ANTON KATZ:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then that would be fine and – and either later maybe 
about tea break you might have had a chance to properly look at Ms 
Coetzee’s affidavit.  You might have had a chance to speak on the 
phone with your client and at that stage maybe we talk again and see 
20 
where we go.  Is that alright?  
ADV ANTON KATZ:    I think – yes that might be – we cannot have an 
objection to that process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For now yes. 
ADV ANTON KATZ:    That seems to me. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 14 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So let me make no decision now but let us do that 
other than that Ms Mzimela’s – Ms Mzimela must be led only in regard 
to what is in her affidavit.   
ADV ANTON KATZ:    Yes the other aspect is I suppose also just 
thinking aloud. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ANTON KATZ:    It would also – my client’s attitude might also 
depend on the commission’s ruling as to whether Coetzee is to give 
evidence or not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
10 
ADV ANTON KATZ:    Because if the affidavit goes in…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADV ANTON KATZ:    Without her giving evidence we would have no 
opportunity to cross-examine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV ANTON KATZ:    We might have a particular stance which would 
mean make an affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV ANTON KATZ:    If Coetzee is going to give evidence we might 
need to cross-examine but that would depend on the commission’s 
20 
ruling so those are the kinds of dynamics there are.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ANTON KATZ:    That are in play. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. No, no that is fine.  I think you ca n take it that my 
approach would be that if a witness’ evidence appears to be 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 15 of 218 
 
controversial or in dispute as far as possible they should come and give 
evidence. 
ADV ANTON KATZ:    I am not even in a position to say whether my 
client disputes what is in…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes so I am just saying to the extent that that 
might help you in understanding what is likely to happen.  I just make 
that statement known.  
ADV ANTON KATZ:   Thank you, thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But at a certain stage then a decisio n can be taken.  I 
have not read the affidavit of Ms Coetzee I have read Ms Mzimela’s 
10 
affidavit so I …  
ADV ANTON KATZ:    I also have not read it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So [talking over one another] 
ADV ANTON KATZ:    So we in the same boat Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. Okay alright so we – so you – we will proceed on 
the basis that Ms Mzimela will give evidence in accordance with her 
affidavit and after tea we will re -visit the matter after you have had a 
chance to read the – Ms Coetzee’s affidavit. 
ADV ANTON KATZ:    Thank you, thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  Ms September.  
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Good day Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what I intend doing, is that fine with you?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Chair before – while we are 
obviously guided by your direction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 16 of 218 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And your decision on this particular 
matter I wish to place the following on record.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And that is to ensure that there is an 
accuracy of the steps that have been taken insofar as the Rule 3.3. 
Notice are concerned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but those Rule 3.3 Notices as far as I understand 
– as far as I understand from you in regard to Ms Coetzee were only 
taken either this morning or yesterday.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SE PTEMBER:  Chair the submissions that I would 
10 
like to put on record is specifically to that which my learned colleague 
has presented here today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And so insofar as what he has 
mentioned I would like the following…  
CHAIRPERSON:  He said they do not agree with you that Ms Coetzee’s 
affidavit is simply corroborative of Ms Mzimela’s affidavit.  She said it 
goes – it goes beyond that at least that is the impression he has got 
after reading it for a very short time.  He has not had time to look at it 
in more detail. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And I certainly do note the 
submissions that he makes but with your leave.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  I would just like to clarify something 
Chair.  Chair in regard to my learned colleague’s client in particular Mr 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 17 of 218 
 
Kona he had received Rule 3.3 Notices in respect of both this witness 
Ms Mzimela and that was sent to him timeously on the 12 June.  
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no.  Ms Mzimela’s one is not as far as I 
understand is not in dispute.  It is Ms Coetzee’s one.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  If I may just clarify a few …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  So Mr Kona had received the Rule 
3.3 Notice in respect of Ms Mzimela’s evidence on the 12 June 2019 
which is a timeous sending of that notice.  Having said that that notice 
included a copy of the statement of Ms Sandra Coetzee and that 
10 
statement forms part of the bundle of Ms Mzimela.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it signed? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it identical to this? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  The statement is – yes Chair it is 
exactly the same document.  The only difference between Annexure 6 
to Ms Mzimela’s affidavit and the affidavit which was signed off 
yesterday is that the one was deposed to be fore a commissioner of 
oaths. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The one is an affidavit?  
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And the other one was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The other one is a statement. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  So insofar as knowledge of what is 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 18 of 218 
 
contained in the Rule 3.3 Notices concerned.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  I find it very hard to believe that 
there cannot be any knowledge of what is contained in the…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you are – you are – you are telling me …  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Affidavit…  
CHAIRPERSON:  That part for the first time.  You should have told me 
before Mr Katz stood up to say although this affidavit of Ms Coetzee 
has not been sent to – is it Mr Kona? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  It has been sent twice. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no the name of the person.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Mr Kona yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You should have said although this affidavit has 
not been sent to him a statement that was not an affidavit that is 
exactly identical was sent to him together with Ms Mzimela’s affidavit.  
That is what you should have said.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  I ought to have been clearer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That – that – that may give a different you know 
colour to the whole matter.  But whatever happens maybe what we 
should do is after tea break when Mr Katz has had a chance to take 
20 
instructions on everything and let me hear what the position is but in 
the meantime there should be no problem in us continuing on the basis 
that I indicated because sh e is not – Ms Mzimela is not going to finish 
her evidence before the tea break.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  We certainly will not reach that 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 19 of 218 
 
evidence before tea. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so – so I think let us put everything in a bag after 
tea I will hear what the latest is. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  One other thing to just bring to the 
attention of the commission Chair is that we have certainly received 
two  we have received information that two o f the parties who are 
implicated in this witness – in the evidence of Ms Mzimela may bring an 
application as some later stage. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja we will see it when it comes – when the 
applications come. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Exercise [indistinct] but there is 
nothing we have. 
[CHAIRPERSON AND ADV SEPTEMBER SPEAKING OVER ONE 
ANOTHER] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And so with your leave can the oath 
please be administered?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes please administer the oath or affirmation/  
20 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Sizakele Petunia Mximela. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections to taking the prescribed 
oath? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  No. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 20 of 218 
 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be  binding on your 
conscience? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you solemnly swear that all the evidence that you will 
give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing but the truth; if so 
please raise right hand and say, so help me God.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  So help me God. 
REGISTRAR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may proceed. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Ms Mzimela before you you have a 
bundle and that is marked D D14.  Can I ask you to turn to page 1 
please?  Do you recognise this document?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Yes I do. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  What is it? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  It is a document that I prepared. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  For submission to the state 
capture commission. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Can I ask you to bring the 
microphone a little bit closer please it is soft.  Thank you.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes your voice was soft maybe you might need to 
raise it but maybe now that the microphone is closer it might not be 
necessary so let us see.  Okay.

ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Can I ask you to…Sorry. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  I was confirming Chair that I am 
familiar with the document in front of me as the affidavit that I actually 
provided. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I ask you to turn to page 37 
please?  Whose signature appears on that page above the word 
deponent? 
10 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  It is my signature. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Is it therefor correct that you 
deposed to this affidavit before a commissioner of oaths on the 6 June 
2019? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Is it also correct that for accuracy of 
record when you deposed to the affidavit you did not do so with the 
inclusion of the annexures to the affidavit?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  That is also correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you. 
20 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Ms Mzimela can you please list or 
explain/discuss your academic qualifications to the Chair please?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Chair I hold a BA in Economics 
and Statistics and have obviously also benefitt ed from other executive 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 22 of 218 
 
development programs and further professional development programs.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  What position do you currently hold 
Mr Mzimela? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  I currently hold the position Chair 
of Interim Chief Executive Officer for South African Express Airways.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And in particular what position did 
you hold during the time of 1 April 2010 until about the 8 t h or 9 t h 
October 2012? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  I held the position of Group Chief 
Executive of South African Airways.  
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And is it correct that your evidence 
today relates to your tenure as Group Chief Executive Officer of South 
African Airways? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  On page 2 you give a listing of your 
employment history.  Can I ask you to please take us through your 
employment history with the particular focus on any roles in which 
governance played a dominant aspect?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Without going into every single 
position. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes there are very many. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Yes indeed.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Just those that you consider important in the context 
of governance. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Indeed Chair.  So firstly I mean I 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 23 of 218 
 
do have over 22 years in aviation as most of my time has actually been 
spent in the aviation space.  I have also been in a position as 
Executive Vice President so in terms of the executive positions 
Executive Vice President of Global Sales and Voyag er and also as 
Executive Vice President of Global Passenger Services.  Post that I 
was Chief Executive Officer for SA Express during 2003 up to March 
2010 at which point I then moved across to SAA as Group Chief 
Executive of SAA and I was there until 2012.   After I left SAA I was 
Chief Executive and Executive Chair of Blue Crane until I returned into 
the SOC as part of the Ministerial task team in June 2018 when SA 
10 
Express was grounded.  And as of the 1 August 2018 I am now the 
Interim CEO of SA Express. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  So by and large the roles that you 
have had during your employment history included many roles of – in 
executives positions or very senior managerial positions, is that right?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  That is correct and I did also have 
the benefit of being a non-executive director on various other entities 
and boards. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  So through your experience in your 
employment history at the very least you have a good understanding or 
20 
you are required and were required to have a good understanding of 
governance principles? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  That is correct Chair.  It was also 
something that was emphasised by the then board of South African 
Airways even as part of the interviewing process in joining SAA as  
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 24 of 218 
 
Group Chief Executive. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you.  And now if we can just 
look quickly to SAA being South African Airways as an organisation and 
in particular the framework under which it operates.  Are you familiar 
with the framework under whic h SAA operates? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Yes I am Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And is it then correct that like all 
person in South Africa which is obliged to observe and uphold the 
constitutional principles of the constitution of the Republic of South 
Africa SAA also subscribes to principles of the South African Airways 
10 
Act, the Public Finance Management Act and applicable treasury 
regulations and it also subscribes to the King Report on governance.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Is there any other aspect or 
principles that you are aware of which may augment this framework?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  In this regard obviously within SAA 
there are various documents that existed such as the MOI.  The 
significance and materiality framework and the shareholders compact 
and the corporate plan. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  Before we look at those 
20 
documents in a bit more detail or rather before you share your evidence 
in relation to that as a natio nal public entity it is – it subscribes to the 
principles of the Public Finance Management Act, correct?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And Chair we know that the object of 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 25 of 218 
 
that 
Act 
is 
to 
secure 
transparency 
accoun tability 
and 
sound 
management of the revenue expenditure assets and liabilities of the 
institution.  We also know that through the Public Finance Management 
Act that funding is from the National Revenue Fund which I understand 
to be the Government Purse.  In so doing does SAA – who does SAA 
account to? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  SAA accounts to the shareholder 
representative which in my case at that time and still is today was the 
Department of Public Enterprises. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And is it correct that at it accounts to 
10 
the shareholder through the Cabinet Member who has been appointed 
for the particular portfolio under which SAA falls?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Sorry could you please repeat 
that. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  No problem. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Is it correct that SAA would account 
to Parliament – sorry … 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Through the Cabinet Member under 
20 
whose portfolio SAA falls?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So during your tenure as Group Chief 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well is that – is that – is that accurate – the through 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 26 of 218 
 
part – is it accurate?  Is the position not that both SAA Management 
and S - the SAA Board could be called by the relevant portfolio 
committee to Parliament and to – to account quite apart from whatever 
obligations the relevant Minister might have had or might have?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That was also correct – I mean – 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Indeed we can - the Board or the 
Management is often called …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Directly – I mean – by Parliament. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  I understood the question to be 
more who the representative is …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Of |Government and who liaises  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  With Government between the 
entity in Parliament. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I – I understand.  Maybe the question might 
20 
have wandered back but the through part – I think – what I was 
concerned about because it could create a wrong impression.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I am – I am indebted to you for the 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 27 of 218 
 
clarity Chair.  During your tenure as Group Chief Executive Officer of 
SAA under which department did SAA fall?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  SAA fell under the Department of 
Public Enterprises. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so the responsible Minister 
would have been the Minister of Public Enterprises?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And during your office of April  2010 
until October 2012 who were the Ministers under whom you served?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  I – so Chair initially …  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Ja.  So initially …  
CHAIRPERSON:  She did not serve under a Minister.  She did not serve 
under a Minister. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  My bad choice of word. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She is – I think the question is who was the Minister 
of Public Enterprises? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  At the time? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes indeed.  So thank you Chair.  
When I initially joined SAA the Minister of Public Enterprises was 
20 
Ms Barbara Hogan but by the time I left in 2012 the Minister was 
Mr Malusi Gigaba. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So the then Minister Malusi Gigaba 
and who was there at the time when you left when - do you recall when 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 28 of 218 
 
he took office? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  I would not actually – Chair I 
would not recall the exact date but I think it will be around 
November 2010 if I am correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I have heard evidence by other witnesses that 
Ms Barbara Hogan 
was 
dismissed 
as 
Minister 
at  
the 
end 
of 
October 2000 … 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  2010. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2010. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think 2010 and that Minister  Gigaba was appointed 
as her – as – as her successor.  So he would have starte d in 
November 2010. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  November 2010. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  Now to look particularly 
to 
governance 
– 
governance 
principles 
the 
implementation 
of 
governance.  What is your understanding of good corporate governance 
based on your experience and knowledge acquired over the years?  
20 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Chair my understanding of good 
corporate governance is when there is a very clear framework or r ule 
book that ensures that there is fairness and there is transparency and 
in that regard there is very clear allocation of duties in order to - to 
ensure that transparency and fairness and also to ensure that we – we 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 29 of 218 
 
adhere to compliance in relation to decisions that are taken within the 
organisation. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you and in your understanding 
how are good corporate governance principles implemented within an 
institution? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  In my understanding we ensure 
that via the various documentations that would – which I see more as 
delegations of authority between what would be the shareholder and 
the Board, the Board and management and management and – sorry – 
the Board and the CEO and CEO to – to management. 
10 
That is the one but also it is ensuring that within the 
organisation itself that there is very clear distinction in terms of what is 
the Board responsible for and how do we actually ensure that when 
decisions are taken they go through the correct processes which in t he 
case of SAA at the time there were various sub -committees that had 
actually been formed to process some of that work through to the 
Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess also what the shareholder representative can 
do or cannot do would fall under governance – proper governance 
rules? 
20 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  There – there is a line beyond which he or she 
cannot or should not go …  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And also in relation to the Board - as you have 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 30 of 218 
 
mentioned – what areas they should not go into and what areas they 
need to deal with? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Before we look at some of the 
regulatory documents in a bit more detail who are t he primary 
stakeholders that is involved in upholding governance principles within 
a State Owned Entity such as South African Airways?  You have already 
mentioned the shareholder. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What – was the question who the stakeholders are? 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Who the primary shareholders are in 
upholding governance ….?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Shareholders? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Who the primary stakeholders are …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Stakeholders? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In upholding governance principles 
within a State Owned Entity?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Chair my response to that would 
be that – well the shareholder representative is definitely a key 
stakeholder in ensuring governance and I say a key stakeholder 
20 
because they would also – I think earlier on you mentioned Parliament 
and Cabinet that they are representative.  
So I take it that they are also ensuring that they not 
instruction but ensure that they apply governance or compliance to 
governance according to what would be expected from Parliament as 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 31 of 218 
 
well and then as I have said the shareholder is – is the next one – I 
mean – who would ensure - I mean – governance. 
For me after that it would be the – the Board of the entity who 
… 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Before we turn – before we turn to 
the Board who appoints the Minister?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on – hang on.  She has not finished telling you 
the stakeholders. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were asking her …  
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Ja, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To tell you the stakeholders. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Okay and then in terms of 
ensuring it would be the Board and as I already indicated the Board 
then utilises various committees to ensure that they oversee specific 
areas of governance within the organisation or compliance to – to 
governance in the area but within the organisation itself there are also 
additional individuals who would be employed to ensure that there is 
20 
compliance to the – to the rules and regulations or good governance.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And who would those additional 
people be? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  In the case of SAA at the time it 
would obviously be the – the person who heads up the Risk and 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 32 of 218 
 
Compliance Portfolio.  It would be the person who looks – the Legal – 
the Head of Legal would also be responsible for that compliance.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But the – would the CEO also not be a person who 
must ensure that the organisation he or she leads complies  with good 
governance? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  You are correct Chair.  I think I 
just forgot myself in the loop. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You forgot yourself? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Thank you. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 Thank you and so 
you 
have 
mentioned the shareholder which is the Minister.  Is that right?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA: 
 
That 
is 
– 
the 
shareholder 
representative because the shareholder …  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The shareholder representative is the 
Minister? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And who appoints any particular 
Minister?  Do you know?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh Ms September.  Everybody knows who appoints 
20 
Ministers. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In that instance then who was the 
President at the time of your tenure?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA: 
 
The 
President 
was 
President Jacob Zuma. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 33 of 218 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  Can I know ask you to 
turn to page 5 of your affidavit please?  Chair the diagram on this page 
is really small and so we have in fact presented – included on the next 
page a bigger …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Copy of the diagram itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  What does this diagram represent 
Ms Mzimela? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  This diagram represents what I 
10 
was already to in terms of how governance was managed at SAA at the 
time I was there.  So it indicates the – the Ministry and that the Board 
reported to the Ministry … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  And that – below – below the 
Board you had various sub-committees and I have listed those sub-
committees. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is the company secretary put at the right place in that 
diagram?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  In terms of the company s ecretary 
20 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of the hierarchy?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA: 
 
So 
the 
company 
secretary 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 34 of 218 
 
reported to the Board and should have probably been below the Board 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is what I am talking … 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  But was placed there in order to 
also indicate that some of the correspondence to the Ministry would go 
through the company secretary at the office in order to ensure 
compliance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that should not be a reason for her to be or him 
to be above the Board in the diagram?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  You are correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  It is just that it is important because the - as I 
understand it the diagram is supposed to show the structures as well as 
structures/officers/officials as well as the hierarchy.  That is – that is 
my understanding.  So when I see the company secretary where – been 
before – between the Board and the Ministry it seemed unusual to me 
but you – you say – you say my thinking is right?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Your thinking is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Thank you.  I interrupted you.  You may 
20 
proceed. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Please proceed. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Oh and then …  
CHAIRPERSON:  You … 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  There are the sub-committees and 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 35 of 218 
 
you then see that there was a Group CEO and because it was the 
Group CEO I then indicate the areas that actually fell under the – the 
Group CEO which were the CEO at the time which was CEO of SATC 
which is South African Travel Centre, the CEO of Mango the CEO of Air 
Chefs and the CEO of SA Technical and then the other – those were 
subsidiaries of SAA – and then the next layer indicates  – and it is not 
the more layer because they are more or less at the same level as the 
CEOs. 
The difference being that the others are called CEOs because 
they are CEOs of subsidiaries …  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  And then the GMs were the - the 
General Managers within SAA itself.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would the – would the Committees that appear in blue 
just under internal auditor would those be Board Committees or 
Management Committees? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Those are Board Committees 
Chair.  So when we talk about remuneration and the – and Human 
Resources Committee …  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Those were committees of the 
Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the Board.  Oh, okay.  No I was beginning to think 
I may have been wrong in thinking that it reflects the hierarchy as well 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 36 of 218 
 
because I see the Group CEO was below those committees but if they 
are Board Committees then – then that is in order. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Ms September. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  So just to clarify 
the Board reports to the Ministry but the Board has sub -committees.  
For the record can you read the – the names of the sub-committees 
please? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA: 
 
At 
the 
time 
we 
had 
the 
Remuneration and Human Resources Committee – Sub-committee.  It 
10 
was the Procurement and Tender Processes Sub -committee, Social and 
Ethics Governance and Monitoring Sub-committee, the Finance and 
Risk and Investment Sub-committee and the Audit Committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you and so if – unless my 
colour is out of sync – if we could look at the pink/purple colour.  Is it 
correct that that part of the diagram which is from Group CEO and 
below that would effectiv ely be the – the management within SAA?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And in doing so the first – rather the 
20 
sub-committee – the Board Sub-committees which in effect reports to 
the Board – what exactly is the purpose of these Board Sub -
committees? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Some – so there are sub-
committees which are statutory sub-committees such as the – the Audit 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 37 of 218 
 
Committee and – and the role of the – the Audit Committee is to review 
all matters relating to finances within the organisation and risk as well 
that would actually fall under that.  
In the case of SAA you would see that there was at the time a 
specific committee that looked or took responsibility for finance risk 
and investment and it was quite specific for a certain period and 
thereafter it folded back into the Audit Committee which was – which is 
the correct home for it to actually reside but because there were 
specifically challenges during that period the Board felt it was 
necessary for them to form a sub-committee which looked at the risk 
10 
and investment quite specifically within the organisation.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
Before 
you 
move 
onto 
the 
sub-committee can you give us some example of matters that the 
finance risk and investment would consider for consideration by the 
Board? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  So examples of what the – the 
Finance Risk and Investment Committee would consider would be 
matters relating to the closure of – of routes or – or any project within 
the – the organisation that require money to – to be spent but – and – 
and as I said I mean also the closure of routes.  They were also 
20 
responsible for hedging - our hedging policies which is a very important 
part – you know - of the airline. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did these committees have decision making power or 
only power to make recommendations to the Board?  
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 38 of 218 
 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  All of the sub-committees were 
utilised to make recommend – to make recommendations to the Board 
but ultimately it is the Board that makes the decision.  The only 
sub-committee which is normal for all organisations is the Audit 
Committee where there are one or two matters that they can make or 
take a decision and that pertains to – you know – maybe the 
appointment of auditors and what the auditors are been paid but every 
other sub-committee was tasked to review whatever information was 
brought to its attention in detail to then be able to make the correct 
commendation to the Board. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  So you have explained 
the purpose of the Audit Committee and so to have you dealt with the 
Finance Risk and Investment Committee.  Can I ask you to do the same 
for the three remaining sub-committees please? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA: 
 
Okay. 
 
The 
Social 
Ethics 
Governance and Monitoring Committee would actually be a committee 
that ensures that the organisation manages its work in an ethical 
manner and not only that that it also looks at other matters which may 
not be financial but are important to the organisation. 
Such as what a – whether we have the correct policy – 
20 
policies in place for a key stakeholder such as our employees and 
making sure that they are safe in the workplace – they are safe and 
secure – I mean – in the workplace just as an example of some of the 
work that would be undertaken in the social and ethics and governance 
… 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 39 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  To that extent would there be some overlap between 
the work of that committee and the work of the Remuneration and 
human resources committee?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  What Chair – what normally … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or not really? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA: 
 
Yes. 
 
When 
you 
look 
at 
remuneration and human resources their function would be to look at 
how we – we pay our employees within the – the organisation.  Their 
function would be to ensure that we do have policies that actually 
manage our relationships with our employees within the organisation.  
10 
The difference between – and yes there is bit overlap in some 
instances between that sub-committee and that Social and Ethics 
Committee but the Social and Ethics Committee would be looking at it 
in terms of maybe ensuring that all of these policies are in place and 
that the organisation is doing the right things as it pertains to its 
employees. 
Not so much that we – that we do have a policy for example 
which is a – talks to how we manage people say with HIV within the 
organisation and yes the Human Resources Committee would probably 
have driven the policy but the Social and Ethics would want to ensure 
20 
that it is aligned to best practice.  So just a slight (intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:  Slight overlap? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then the Procurement and 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 40 of 218 
 
Tender Process Committee. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA: 
 
So 
– 
and 
then 
Chair 
the 
Procurement and Tender Committee – Processes Committee - was 
actually formed in order to review and recommend on behalf of the 
Board all of the big tenders that would be undertaken within the 
organisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess between that committee – the work of that 
committee to and the work of the Social Ethics and Governance and 
Monitoring Committee there could be some – some overlap in terms of 
particular governance and tenders.  Is that right?  
10 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct – I mean – Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  You do tend to find that the Social 
and Ethics Committee is one of those that overlaps and ordinarily over 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  A number of the committees … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Because it is to ensure that they 
are doing things correctly. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is corporate governance?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And lastly the Remuneration and 
Human Resources Committee. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 41 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  She – she already said but I do not know if she wants 
to add anything Ms  Mzimela. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  You are correct Chair.  I had 
already indicated that the Remuneration a nd Human Resources 
Committee would look in terms of how we remunerate our employees 
within the organisation and to ensure that we have policies in place 
that manage our relationships with our – with the employees. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you and so once matters are 
considered at Board sub-committee level it then gets escalated to the 
Board for a decision.  Is that right?  
10 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If we can then look to some of the 
key governance documents within SAA and we are now still on page 5 
or your affidavit and in particular paragraph 8.  You have listed four 
documents 
in 
particular 
the 
first 
being 
the 
Memorandum 
of 
Incorporation. 
The next is the Significance and the Materiality Framework.  
The third is a shareholders compact and lastly a corporate plan.  Can 
you please explain to the Commission what are the key and salient 
features and importance of – let us start with – the Memorandum of 
20 
Incorporation? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  The Memorandum of Incorporation 
would actually detail the case of SAA was a Schedule 2 Airline.  It is an 
airline that has been formed under an Act – you know – of Government 
and it will also talk to how the Directors are appointed to the Board and 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 42 of 218 
 
the relationship between the share – the shareholder and the 
organisation in terms of the Directors of the entity.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I think she would like you to say something on all 
those four documents. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Okay Chair and then in terms of 
the Significance and Materiality – I mean – Framework in … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In fact can I just interrupt you for a 
second and ask you to go to page 39 before we close off on the 
10 
Memorandum of Incorpora tion?  What is this document which appears 
before you? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  It is the Articles of Association.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For SAA? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  For South African Airways that is 
correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And in line with the evidence that has 
been given Chair Directors and its provisions relating to Directors 
20 
regulated at paragraph 21 which is on page 63.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well do you now want her to finish first mention – 
saying something on each one of them and then if you want to go to 
more aspects on each one then you can do that.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Guided by you Chair. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 43 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In that instance please go back then 
to explain the Significance and Materiality Framework.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  The Significance and Materiality 
Framework in simple terms I would describe it as a Delegation of 
Authority from the shareholder representative to the – the Board 
because what it would actually contain are those matters that – most 
importantly the matters that need to be referred to the shareholder 
representative which in this case was the Department of Public 
Enterprises but because obviously this is a state entity.  
10 
There was also the requirement in most instances for a 
concurrence with the Minister of Finance as well on some of those 
decisions that are contained there.  So it was quite specific about those 
matters that needed to be escalated to the shareholder.  
CHAIRPERSON:  It is – it is an unusual title or name for the document 
– Significance and Materiality Framework as opposed to Delegation of 
Authority which appears to be quite common with a lot of parastatals.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there insignificance on the different naming or not 
really? 
20 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  I would not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that you know of. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  I mean I would not know Chair …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  But that is what it was actually 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 44 of 218 
 
called. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay but you say it is for all intents and purposes it 
serves the purpose of a Delegation of Authority.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  A Delegation of Authority. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair – Chair I can place on record 
that the significance and materiality framework is in fact a compliance 
requirement under the Public Finance Management Act.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In specific Sections 54 to …  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it is – it is termed like that?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it is termed like that?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  It is not for some other strange 
reason it is broken up into two parts.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  It is compliance with Section 54(2) 
and 55(2) of the PFMA.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Thank you.  Please proceed 
Ms Mzimela. 
20 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  In terms of the shareholder 
compact Chair it would be a document where the shareholder is 
communicating its strategic intent to the organisation and would 
actually contain performance targets that would be monitored between 
the shareholder representative and the organisation and is a document 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 45 of 218 
 
that would normally be reviewed on an annual basis in order to look at 
those targets. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is – (clearing throat) – excuse me – is it – is it – 
(clearing throat) – excuse me.  Is it a – a document/agreement between 
the shareholder representative and the Board or – or it includes 
management? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  You are correct Chair because 
ultimately it has to be approved by the Board …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  And then it is signed off by the 
10 
shareholder. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  So it is the relationship that 
(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but it – (clearing throat) obviously it places – it 
contains to – to say the least expectations …  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By the shareholder and maybe the Board of among 
other things management’s performance what they should pursue what 
objectives what priorities they should pursue.  
20 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is why they even developing 
the shareholders compact. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 46 of 218 
 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Management would be involved in 
terms of providing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would be fully involved?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA: 
 
In 
providing 
the 
necessary 
information to the Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So is it then understood if I 
understand you correct – your evidence correctly that it is almost 
10 
driven from the bottom up – if we could use that terminology – in that 
the performance indicators for the company is determined and decided 
by management first? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Maybe just a correction that it is 
not so much about – it is – it would – it would be driven from internal in 
terms of those performance indicators that pertain specifically to the 
financial type – I mean – indicators because management would say 
this is what we plan to actually deliver but it is a proposal that gets 
tabled at the Board which then the Board must interrogate and see 
whether management is s tretching itself or not in terms of the targets 
20 
that they are putting forward and what drives some of what they are 
proposing as part of that shareholder compact.  
 
Once the Board is actually satisfied with having interrogated – 
so the Board would still hav e a right to go back to management and say 
we’re not comfortable with the following we would want you to change 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 47 of 218 
 
on the basis of whatever the case may be at that point in time.  
Likewise, once the Board has actually approved that document and it’s 
taken through to the shareholder the shareholder equally has the 
opportunity to interrogate what is presented to them and can either 
accept or come back to the Board to say we’re not comfortable with the 
performance indicators that you have stipulated.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you for that clarity.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:    On D which is the corporate plan, 
this is the three-year plan that seeks to actually project further than 
just the one year in terms of implementing or talking to how a strategy 
10 
which has been approved would be implemented over the years.  So it 
would actually contain, in the case of an airline, our focus areas from a 
route perspective, what are the routes that the airline would want to 
focus on and the reasons behind that, it would  also contain what is – 
what would be required by the organisation in order to deliver on what 
would be stipulated in the corporate plan and there, what I’m talking 
about, is either it’s financial support or the requirement to make 
changes to items such as  the fleet, which is the aircraft that we utilise 
as airlines to generate revenue but it’s a forward looking plan, a three -
year plan that talks to what needs to be done in to the future.  
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Is it correct that the corporate plan is 
also a legislative requirement?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Yes it is Chair, we are required 
to submit that to the shareholder.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :   Chair, in fact, just for the record it’s 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 48 of 218 
 
regulated by Section 52 of the PFMA in particular to regar d to schedule 
2 entities for which SAA is.    Ms Mzimela, it’s correct that SAA also 
needs to prepare annual reports. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :    What is the process in relation to 
the preparation of annual reports and its submission?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    So the reports would be prepared 
internally within the organisation, we do have 
– which is a 
responsibility – finance department with the CFO driving the process on 
a day-to-day basis in the preparation of those Annual Financial 
10 
Statements.  Once they have been – and they work very closely with 
internal audit, the reason why we have internal audit is they need to 
work very closely as well with the finance department in the preparation 
of those Annual Financial Statements to ensure that they actually meet 
or they’re compliant in their nature.  Once the financials have actually 
been concluded, they are then tables, so obviously I’m speaking 
specifically about the CFO but I’m talking about the te am overall 
because once the CFO who reports this CO has finalised those 
statements then the CEO will then present those statements to the 
Board…(intervention). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry Ms Mzimela probably both you and Ms 
September realise that I seem like I want to say something, why do we 
need all of that? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :   Chair it’s really just to set the 
landscape for the regulatory framework within which SAA operates and 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 49 of 218 
 
to the extent of governance matters that are then addressed at a later 
stage…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    Well I read Ms Mzimela’s statement, I don’t recall 
anything that really would make that necessary, is there something I’ve 
missed, how an annual report is processed.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  It’s really more so the reporting 
structure that I was concerned about, which I thought may be relevant 
for 
purposes 
of 
the 
evidence, 
having 
said 
that 
we’ll 
move 
on…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    I want us to get to Mr Mzimela’s real important 
10 
evidence as soon as possible. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Some of the things were important to mention but 
just reconsider some of the things, I think it seems to me that some 
that you have touched on were important but I’m not sure about the 
need for the details abo ut how an annual report gets processed.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases Chair, there’s just two 
quick questions then on this aspect.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :    The first is were there delegations 
20 
of authority in place and did  you implement any delegations of authority 
when you took office? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Yes Chair there were delegations 
of authority, there was a delegation from the Board to myself and post 
that finalisation of that delegation of authority, I t hen equally, I gave 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 50 of 218 
 
delegations to the next level within my team.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you and then the last question 
on this point, is how did you communicate any financial and operational 
updates to the shareholder’s representative?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:    In the case of SAA at the time, 
firstly, obviously there are periods where we need to actually provide 
an update on not just only the financial performance but the overall 
performance of the organisation in terms of quarterly reports that get 
provided to the shareholder representative, so that was the one but in 
addition to that, because it so happened that it was the conditions of 
10 
the guarantee that had been provided to SAA there were also monthly 
monitoring – monitoring meetings held  between the shareholder 
representatives being National Treasury and the DPE with the team 
within SAA to provide those regular updates of performance.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :    And so then on a monthly basis the 
shareholder’s representative would be well versed with what is 
happening at an operational level and at a financial level borne out of a 
government guarantees that were given to SAA is that right?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    So just for clarity, we’ve been 
using the term, shareholder representative and in my view I’m talking 
20 
about more the Minister in that case.  For the monthly monitoring 
meetings it would be representatives of the Ministry, so that would be 
present at those meeting, so they have what they call, the aviation 
teams or people who are allocated to the aviation stream to specifically 
manage those type of matters and my assumption would then be that 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 51 of 218 
 
they’re doing it in order to feedback themselves through their own 
system. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Than you, Ms Mzimela when Minister  
– the then Minister Gigaba took office did he take any issue with any of 
the regulatory documents that you’ve explained and explained to this 
Commission about? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :      As I recall he did have some 
concerns relating to the MOI and  his concerns…(intervention). 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Ad the MOI, for the record is the 
Memorandum of Incorporation. 
10 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Yes the MOI because I believe 
that he wanted it to be a lot more specific in terms of how the CEO 
would be appointed and in the case of SAA it was clear that the Board 
that would actually make the appointment of the CEO with – not the 
concurrence but they would obviously put forward the recommendation 
to the Ministry to confirm their comfort in terms of that appointment 
with the CEO but – and I don’t really have, I mean, the actual specifics 
in terms of the clauses that he had concerns about but his general 
concern was that he felt that the SAA one did not give enough power to 
the Ministry in terms of their in volvement on the appointment of the 
20 
CEO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At that stage, the actual decision for the appointment 
of the CEO for SAA was – did it vest in the Board?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the Board might consult the M inister or have 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 52 of 218 
 
some discussion with him but the final decision would vest with the 
Board? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Indeed Chair, the Board would be 
the one that makes the recommendation to say, we followed our 
process, this is our recommended candi date which then they would put 
forward to the Minister because as you would know Chair, that it is 
something that also needs to go all the way to cabinet for approval as 
well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but what I’m trying to establish is, because it 
depends what it goes to cabinet for, you know, it could go there for 
10 
purposes of information, it could go there for purposes of their views on 
the suitability of the candidate, it could go there for whatever reason, 
it’s important to understand who actually makes the de cision, is it the 
cabinet during that time in regard to SAA as far as you understand, you 
might not know the details because you wouldn’t have appointed 
yourself as CEO but you – was it the Board who would make the 
decision but before they made the decisio n there was a process which 
included the name that they were thinking of – the person that they 
were thinking of appointing going to the Minister before they announce 
and maybe ultimately the Board to cabinet but in the end it was their 
20 
decision or was it the Minister who would make the decision after the 
name had been presented to cabinet and the Board’s role was simply to 
make a recommendation? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    So no Chair, in – during my 
tenure anyway, the decision was actually made by the  Board on this is 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 53 of 218 
 
their candidate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but there was some process …(intervention).  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    But there was a process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You might not be sure now exactly how that process 
would go. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and you say Minister Gigaba was concerned 
about the process or the power to appoint the CEO.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And now how would you describe 
your experience of governance under Minister Barbara Hogan as 
compared to Minister Malusi Gigaba?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    I think that if I’m going to do a 
comparison of both Minister ’s under Barbara Hogan I would say that 
governance was very well managed and that the Minister ensured that 
here communication was with the Board or the Chair of the Board who 
represented – the Board as a whole and at the CEO’s counterpart was 
the DG, the Director General within the public enterprises and  that – 
what I found if I look at  differences is that Ms Barbara Hogan or the 
20 
individuals under the Ministry during Ms Barbara Hogan would ensure 
that any communication with the organisation was formal written 
communication in all instances. So I would sa y that was actually 
managed quite well.  We also knew of who the individuals were who’d 
interact with the organisation so it was very clear, as I indicated that 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 54 of 218 
 
the DG would contact the CEO if there was something that he or she 
actually needed to establish  from the organisation and likewise in terms 
of those monthly monitoring meetings, we knew who our team was on 
our side that would be meeting with some of those shareholder 
representatives on a monthly basis. So there was very clear levels of 
communication and transparency in that regard but not everybody could 
just come into the organisation and request information and for me that 
was the difference between the one Minister and the other Minister 
because under Minister Gigaba what we then soundly found is that we 
had lots of people from the Ministry, who in the past had never had any 
10 
– let me not say right but had never actually come into the organisation 
or understood they needed to come within our organisation to request 
information.  So things were begin ning to fall through the cracks, in 
terms of the management of information, the management of requests 
that were coming through from executives – not executives but 
members of the Ministry, who, in the past really had no relationship 
with the organisation which is, for me, was a breakdown in good 
governance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think it’s time to take the tea adjournment, Mr Katz 
you look like you want to say something to me, do you want to come 
20 
forward. 
MR KATZ:    Thank you Chair, Chairperson I’ve considered  the position 
and I wish to make three points and then Chairperson you could 
perhaps just consider them over the tea break.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 55 of 218 
 
MR KATZ:    The first point is that my learned friend suggested that the 
statement of Coetzee dated December 2018  is identical to her affidavit 
dated today and I conferred with one of the document persons of the 
Commission, Mr De Beer who indicated – I asked him, was it identical 
and he said they were twins but not identical, which I thought was an 
apt way of looking at it and I said to him, perhaps he did my job for me 
but he explained what the difference was.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KATZ:    At first blush, when I said to you this morning that I was 
taken by surprise was that the numbering is different and the reason is, 
10 
there’s a break in the numbering but importantly there’s one sentence 
which is added to paragraph 17 of Ms Mzimela’s affidavit which is in 
the affidavit but not in the statement.  It doesn’t implicate my client so 
it’s not (indistinct) but it’s an important sentence and she will deal with 
it, it’s nothing to do with my client, but what is important is this, in the 
rule 33 – that’s the first point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KATZ:    The second point that I wish to make is, in the rule 33 
statement dated 12 June 2019 sent to my client, importantly in 
paragraphs 2 and 3 or in paragraph 2, it is suggested that the relevant 
20 
paragraphs of Ms Mzimela’s affidavit which implicate my client are in 
paragraphs 91 to 102 and when one has regard to paragraphs 91 to 102 
there’s no reference to Coetzee’s affidavit.  Ms Coetzee’s affidavit is 
only referenced in paragraphs 44 and 45 of this witness’s affidavit.  So 
from a fairness point of view, one would expect a rule 33 notice to 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 56 of 218 
 
identify that which is the possible difficult y and it didn’t happen on the 
12 t h of June.  What did happen on the 26 t h of June, today, there is a 
new rule 33 notice which points to Coetzee’s affidavit and indicates 
particular paragraphs and particular problems with what is said in those 
paragraphs, potentially for my client, that’s paragraphs - I’m actually 
not sure, I’m not sure what the paragraph numbers are but not 
important for present purposes.  So the submission that I wish to make 
as a final concluding point is this, were the Commission to admit  
Coetzee’s affidavit as evidence before the Commission we would ask 
for an opportunity to file an affidavit. On the other hand, were the 
10 
Commission to, for example order Coetzee to give evidence, we would 
ask to consider an opportunity to consider whether we’d ask for an 
opportunity to cross-examine and there are three specific aspects of 
her affidavit which we would think are something that my client would 
want to cross-examine Coetzee about.  I’m not sure that it’s State 
Capturing, earth shattering evidence against my client, but at the same 
time there are things said about my client, which require some 
consideration. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What do you think of us proceeding – I mean from 
what you have said, to me, it does appear that whatever it is that may 
20 
be in Ms Coetzee’s affidavit, which was not in her statement that was 
sent earlier on…(intervention). 
MR KATZ:    Doesn’t affect my client. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Doesn’t – it’s not something that matters so it seems 
to me that in that event maybe it would be a fair stri king of the balance 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 57 of 218 
 
if  we were to proceed on the understanding that should you wish to 
bring -  your client wish to bring an application to cross -examination Ms 
Coetzee, that would be considered at the time and as I say I haven’t 
read it but if – what you could do if I – if you, in the meantime before 
you know whether Ms Coetzee will be called or not, if you in the 
meantime, or your client, prepares a statement or affidavit responding 
to whatever he may wish to respond that would help in saying, is there 
a dispute, it’s a serious dispute and then whether or not Ms Coetzee 
gets called it might, among other things, depend on that.  
MR KATZ:    That would, in our submission strike the balance.

CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KATZ:    I would want some time to prepare the  affidavit of my 
client dealing with Coetzee’s affidavit.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KATZ:    It would be a short affidavit by my client…(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:  No that’s fine. 
MR KATZ:    But it would still need to take on three small facts which – 
and of course this witness plays no role in respect of my client.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes well the – Ms Coetzee’s affidavit your client is 
only getting today, from what I understand…(intervention).  
20 
MR KATZ:    Although we’ve had it as a statement.  
CHAIRPERSON:  They got the statement but in terms of the affidavit 
they will get it maybe today…(intervention).  
MR KATZ:    There are two things, the one is we receive it as an 
affidavit today but also importantly, the rule 33 notice of today 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 58 of 218 
 
identifies the parts of Coetzee’s affidavit which it is suggested 
implicates our client and I want to focus on those aspects which we 
haven’t had the opportunity to do.  
MR KATZ:    No, no that’s fine, I think you – in terms of the rules you 
would have something like 14 days to file somet hing if you want to and 
that should be enough time. 
MR KATZ:    May I suggest, today is, I think, Wednesday the 26 t h if you 
imposed upon us a deadline of say next Friday which is the 5 t h of 
…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  That will give you, not more than 1 4 days isn’t it? 
10 
MR KATZ:    It’s less than 14 days. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KATZ:    I’m going on holiday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That’s fine, let’s say you undertake to file an affidavit 
by Friday of next week. 
MR KATZ:    Friday of next week which we’ll be dealing  with, effectively 
what’s contained in today’s rule 33 notice.  
CHAIRPERSON:  No that’s fine, that’s fine. 
MR KATZ:    Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you very much.  Ms September I’m sure 
20 
you have no problem with that?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We’ll take the tea adjournment now and we’ll resume 
at twenty to twelve, we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS  
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 59 of 218 
 
INQUIRY RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us proceed. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you.  Ms Mzimela before the 
short adjournment you were describing your experiences under the – of 
governance under Minister Hogan as compared to Minister Gigiba.  Just 
two particular points on that.  How would you explain or describe the 
manner and style of communication between SAA and the Ministries 
under each of those Ministers? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think she did deal with that.  She did say that under 
Minister Barbara Hogan communication was formal.  The ministry would 
10 
send formal communication and they knew who to deal with at the 
ministry in terms of representatives and under Minister Gigiba that was 
not the case and I am putting it in my own words everybody and 
anybody could just come to SAA that they did not know to be part of a 
team that they were dealing with.  Ms Mzimela have I put words into 
mouth? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  No Chair I think you have actually 
summarised it very well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Thank you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And then just on clarities of protocols 
of engagement who was the counterpart of the Minister within SAA?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  It was the Chairperson. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Who was the counterpart of the DG 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 60 of 218 
 
in SAA?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  It would be…  
CHAIRPERSON:  She said that as well. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  The CEO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She says the CEO would deal with the DG and the 
Minister would deal with the chairperson of the board.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair it was certainly my 
recollection that there was not absolutely cla rity on the protocols of 
engagements but I am indebted to you Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Ms Mzimela it is understood that SAA 
is a network carrier as compared to a local carrier, is that right?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Yes Chair so just I mean to clarify 
difference I mean it is.. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Please. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is a network carrier as a point to a local point to 
point carrier. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And what ex – can you elaborate a 
bit more on the differences in operation between a network carrier as 
compared to a local carrier?  
20 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  So a point to point carrier and a 
typical example would be some of the low cost carriers that we have in 
South Africa where you are actually opera ting routes between 
Johannesburg and Cape Town or Johannesburg and Durban and the 
passengers that are sitting on your aircraft actually originate from 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 61 of 218 
 
those destinations being Johannesburg or Cape Town, Port Elizabeth or 
whatever the point of entry would b e.  When you are a network carrier 
even the way in which you review the performance of the route what 
you would look at is not just the point to point but how much that route 
is contributing in terms of connecting traffic as well.  So in the case of 
SAA 
there 
are 
certain 
routes 
which 
and 
I 
would 
use 
the 
Johannesburg/London 
route 
as 
an 
example 
where 
on 
Johannesburg/London the people originate I mean from London they 
come, they land in Johannesburg but the reason why possibly they 
choosing SAA even as a carri er is because SAA can connect them 
10 
immediately to the ultimate destination which could be in Zimbabwe or 
anywhere else.  So when you are network carrier you are always trying 
to put together a system that allows that flexibility for passengers to 
connect as quickly as possible out of any of the hubs that you have.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  One route that you particularly deal 
with in your affidavit is called the Mumbai route.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Can you please give a brief 
description of what this Mumbai route entailed?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  So Mumbai was a destination 
20 
which I operate – SAA operated on and at the time when I started – 
when I started I mean at SAA SAA operated between Johannesburg and 
Mumbai and they were the only operator on the route or rather only 
direct operator on the route. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  So you first became aware of it when 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 62 of 218 
 
you took office in 2010?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  So when I took office in 2010 what 
I became aware of in relation to the Mumbai route are the issues that 
the board had concern over.  Because obv – I had been at SAA I have 
been an executive, Vice President of Global Sales so I was also quite 
familiar with all of the routes because at some point I managed  all of 
those route I mean as well under the Global Sales Portfolio.  But in 
coming back to SAA in 2010 what was brought to my attention was from 
the board was the level of discomfort pertaining to a recommendation 
that had been put in front of them to clo se the Mumbai route.   
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And who – which board member 
approached you to have discussions informing you about the concerns 
on the Mumbai route? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  In my testimony I refer to a Mr 
Teddy Daka but I refer to h im in the context of him reminding me or 
sharing with me what had actually transpired prior to my arrival at SAA 
and why there was discomfort, there was such a high level of 
discomfort in relation to that proposal.  But in my capacity as the CEO 
of SAA the matter was raised by the board with me to say please could 
you look at reviewing this recommendation and come back with the 
20 
position – your position on how we should actually proceed with regard 
to this route. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And so…. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What were the issues of concern to the board that you 
became aware of with regard to the Mumbai route when you became 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 63 of 218 
 
interim CEO?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Correction Chair I was not interim 
CEO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh not interim. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  It is only now that you are interim.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  CEO at that time you were CEO.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay yes. 
10 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  The concerns I mean from the 
board I think were mostly well from Mr Daka sharing his experience is 
that his concern was more in terms of the pressure that was being put 
on the board to make a very quick decision in relation to the 
termination of this route.  So that is the first thing that made them 
uncomfortable.  The second thing that made them uncomfortable is that 
although there was a proposal put in front of them that actually 
indicated that the route was not profitable they questioned why that 
20 
particular route was the one that was being given priority because at 
that time SAA had challenges on a number of the international routes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Now you said that this one board – this one member 
of the board shared these concerns or issues with you or shared with 
you concerns of the board. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 64 of 218 
 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you said subsequently the board raised its 
concerns with you as well, is that correct?  Or they just asked y ou to 
look into the issues? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  So the board – maybe let me just 
go back in terms of describing the sequence of events.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  As it is set out in my affidavit.  
The board with me taking over as CEO of SAA they did ask me to say 
as one of the first things they would actually like me to review or look 
10 
at the recommendation that had been put in front of them relating to the 
closure of Johannesburg/Mumbai.  In my testimony I make specific 
reference to a discussion that I had with Mr Daka in reminding me when 
I was having the conversation around – as part of me preparing my 
affidavit and he said by the way this was some of what happened prior 
to your arrival at SAA which is part of what made us uncomfortable as a 
board and the key issue was just how it was being rushed and we were 
being – they calling special meetings or committee meetings to try and 
get the approval through.  And they were wondering why?  You know 
the level of discomfort was on the basis of saying why all this urgency 
20 
when there are other routes that equally are challenged.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  At which forum was the submission 
considered? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  It was considered at the Finance 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 65 of 218 
 
Risk and Investment Committee. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I ask you to turn to page 82 
please.  Do you recognise this document?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  I do Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  If you turn to page – in fact the 
document is under the head ing of Finance Risk and Investment 
Committee.  It is to FRIC being the acronym for the sub -committee and 
it is from General Manager Mergers and Acquisitions and it is dated 13 
February 2010 under a subject title of Termination of Flights from 
Johannesburg to Mumbai.  If I can ask you to turn to page 86 please?  
10 
Whose signature appears under the – point 1 as the person who had 
compiled and recommended this document?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  It is the signature of Jan Blake. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And what position did he hold?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  At that point he was the General 
Manager of Mergers and Acquisitions.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And at point 2 whose name and 
signature appears as indicated to have been approved by EXCO?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  It is the signature of Chris Smyth 
who was the acting Chief Executive Officer prior to my arrival.  
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you.  And having considered 
this document what are the salient features of this document that you 
can highlight to the commission?  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry before that was this document prepared 
and submitted to FRIC before your time?  
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 66 of 218 
 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that is the document you were talking about when 
you said when you arrived you understood that a submission had been 
made relating to a recommendation for the cancellation of the route 
Mumbai route? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And EXCO I see that at page 86 it is in dicated 
under 2 approved by EXCO and then Chris Smyth acting Chief 
Executive Officer.  EXCO I assume would have been a number of 
people who were in the committee or not really – what was the 
10 
position? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Yes Chair ordinarily if there is 
reference to EXCO the implication is that it is all the executive 
committee members. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have agreed. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so – okay so when he – so this approved by ESCO 
means it was not just approved by him it is approved by that group of 
people?  Is that how you understand it?  I am looking for your own 
understanding of what this is supposed to mean?  Normally it would – 
20 
documents to say approved then the name of the person and his or her 
designation then it means that is the person who has approved and that 
person signs.  Here it says approved by EXCO then appears the name 
Chris Smyth then acting Chief Executive Officer but there is no 
provision for any other member of EXCO to sign so I am wondering 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 67 of 218 
 
what your own understanding was when you saw it or the knowledge 
that you gained subsequently about whether this represented that the 
group of people who formed EXCO had approved this.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Maybe Chair if I could respond in 
the following manner.  It is unusual firstly that it – he signs as an 
acting CEO and says approved by EXCO.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Because the EXCO approval is 
normally documented in a separate forum which is the EXCO meeting.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  If that matter had actually been 
discussed and signed off by EXCO.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  So that is the one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  In terms of my subsequent 
knowledge in relation to how this actually came about I do not believe 
that I can confirm that it was all EXCO that approved.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  This document. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  There were one or two membe rs of 
EXCO that had been involved. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  In this process but not as an 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 68 of 218 
 
EXCO team. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As individuals? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay thank ou. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you.  So having considered 
the document what in your view are the salient features and points of 
any concern arising from the document?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe let us start with obviously you have read 
this document, you read it many years ago and you have r efreshed your 
memory on it. 
10 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One it recommended the cancellation of the Mumbai 
route, is that correct?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZI MELA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What are the main reasons that it gave as to why the 
Mumbai route should be cancelled?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  The reasons that were provided as 
part of the recommendation was that the Mumbai route was a lo ss 
20 
making route and that the team that was putting this proposal forward 
saw an opportunity – were highlighting that additionally they saw an 
opportunity that in cancelling the route they would free up aircraft that 
would be utilised on other destinations and the third point that they 
table as part of this document is that there is Jet Airways that is 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 69 of 218 
 
coming onto the route and their motivation basically then is that SAA 
must cancel the route and rather purely co share on Jet Airways.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And when you – when you saw this recommendation 
or document for the first time had the body to which it was addressed 
had the chance to deliberate on the recommendation already or had it 
not yet? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  To my knowledge Chair that had 
already deliberated on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  And indeed had also raised 
10 
concerns which were tabled. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okayl. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  As part of the resolution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe you can – you can deal with what you 
understood to their concerns where and then you can give your own 
views of the proposal what view you took of this recommendation.  Yes 
you go. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  So – ja – so Chair I mean as 
20 
indicated what were their concerns as I understand it is that they were 
concerned that whilst it was true that Mumbai from a point to point 
perspective was not making – was making a loss but they were 
concerned that it was not the w orst performing route in the network and 
they could not quite understand…  
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 70 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is now FRIC? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  That is FRIC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Yes.  They could not understand 
why there was a recommend ation to close off the route given that it was 
not the only loss making route or the highest loss making route.  They 
were also concerned about the motivation being based on a codeshare 
agreement with Jet Airways who had actually announced their 
intentions to start flights between South African and Mumbai.  And 
raising the concerns from a timing perspective to say why you are 
10 
rushing prior to this carrier even coming onto the route before we can 
talk about the possibility of a potential codeshare with them.   And they 
also asked – raised questions around why only Jet Airways had actually 
been considered and that were there no other opportunities to possibly 
I mean codeshare with other carriers as well.  That is what I understood 
to be their concerns. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And on that can you go to page 88 
which you may have been on already.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And the evidence that you have just 
20 
given then documents those four key points of concern, is that right?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And at the end of the document it 
informs the resolution that was taken for the record can you read that 
into the record please?  
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 71 of 218 
 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  It reads as follows : 
“That resolve that the submission be submitted to the 
SAA board for consideration taking into account the 
concerns raised by FRIC as indicated above.”  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  What did you then Ms Mzimela?  Did 
you take any steps after  learning about this concern in relation to the 
route closure? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Indeed I did because I had been 
requested by the board to actually do that.  So I then tasked I mean our 
10 
commercial team to go back and review the route and the an alysis that 
had been provided as part of this recommendation.  And I do need to 
make the point that what was found is that this document which was 
submitted to FRIC was quite comprehensive in terms of the information 
that it actually provided but it was also quite silent on other issues 
which I think were quite critical in – for the board to make their 
decision.  The document does talk about the fact that SAA is a network 
carrier. It talks about the fact that when you look at the performance or 
at least it hints on that. When you look at the performance of the route 
if you are a network carrier it is important to also consider connection 
20 
traffic and also the cargo contribution of that route.  But it is then silent 
or rather it also mentions how significant t he connecting traffic was on 
the Johannesburg/Mumbai route but then it becomes quite silent about 
once you have added the connecting revenue and you have added the 
cargo revenue what does the actual performance of Mumbai really look 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 72 of 218 
 
like. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  What markets did the Mumbai route 
allow SAA to access? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  I will respond in the following way 
that for SAA or at least the team that I worked with I mean at SAA for 
us the Mumbai route was not – we did not review it only  on the 
performance which is important only on its route performance but it was 
about its strategic value to SAA on other destinations as a network 
carrier.  What I am talking about there is that Mumbai route fed a lot of 
traffic onto some of our regional routes such as Johannesburg/Ghana, 
10 
Accra and it was also the fastest link from Asia like in India to South 
America and so therefore it was a critical feeder to our South America 
route as well as SAA.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well please just repeat for me the two points I think 
you made.  You made the one point which you said that document 
recommending the cancellation of the route highlighted but you then 
mentioned the point that it was silent on which you regarded as quite 
important.  Just repeat that part for me?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  What was I highlighting Chair is 
20 
that in relation to the reasons why the route should be closed and 
specifically when they also mention numbers they highlight what the 
number is in relation to the point to point…  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is passengers? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Passengers 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 73 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Ja point to point passengers and 
revenue.  The document does speak to the fact that this route is 
important it is a strategic route because it actually contributes 
significantly in terms of connecting traffic to other destinations such as 
South America and to the rest of the continent.  However that is where 
it stops.  It then does not say based on the importance of these two 
elements if you then add those numbers and be quite specific in terms 
of the number this is what the performance of the route actually looks 
at.  So they stop the reporting of the route at a particular line and do 
10 
not go below that line to add  the connecting traffic and the cargo 
revenue which is critical on this route and it is contributing to the 
overall network performance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I can understand the – the determination of what 
revenue is affected by low numbers in terms of passenger s and by high 
numbers so to the extent that one attaches monetary value in terms of 
revenue. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the numbers of passengers that SAA had in that 
route that I can understand and as you say that is important.  
20 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I would like you to enlighten me on the actual 
significance of the part that you say they did not deal with.  Whether its 
significance has got anything to do with revenue or whether its 
significance relates to other issues other than revenue?  
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 74 of 218 
 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  So Chair in response I mean to 
your question I think that when the team and I then put the proposal 
forward to the board highlighting some of the things that have not been 
taken into consideration it formed two elements.  One as in pertains to 
actually revenue that would have been part of what I called the 
connecting revenue because there is a number that you can attach to 
the connecting revenue.  There is also a number that you can attach to 
the cargo uplift between the two destinations.  So that was the first part 
in terms of – from a pure monetary perspective to say this is something 
that – I would say the documents hints on but does not give the detail 
10 
to the board that was the one bit.  The second reason why our proposal 
was different to the board was the strategic value of this route for SAA 
especially in growing its network to South America.  And we spoke 
about that to say if you look at – we always spoke about the fact that in 
terms of our geographical location as in South Africa for anybody 
coming out of most of the destinations in Asia it is probably quicker for 
them to go via Europe to go via other places before they get I mean to 
their final destination.  But where we had the real strategic advantage 
was to be able to move people from in this case India to South America 
because it was the quickest way or the quickest route so it was a 
20 
strategic advantage I mean for SAA.  Another element that we 
highlighted when we put forward a reco mmendation not to close the 
route was that there was one thing that had also been missed in the 
recommendation which is the Indian carrier or any Indian carrier coming 
to South Africa would not only benefit from taking over passengers, 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 75 of 218 
 
flying between Johannesburg and Mumbai but very specifically because 
they had the ability or they had been awarded what we call fifth 
freedom traffic rights they would have been able to also pick up 
passengers from South Africa and take them to South America.  Which 
then our recommendation was that you cannot make a recommendation 
in isolation of the impact that would have on other routes as well.  And 
if you look at all of that in totality it actually did not make sense at all 
to actually be putting a recommendation to termin ate the route. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of – does what you say suggest that in terms 
of their recommendation for the cancellation of the Mumbai route when 
10 
they talked about numbers of passengers did they talk about 
passengers that come from South Africa and go to Mumbai and from 
Mumbai and come back, is that the revenue emanating from those 
passengers that they talked about and neglected revenue that SAA got 
by way of passengers who may have come from other centres but in the 
other places – but in the process  to reach their destinations had to in 
part use SAA to Mumbai?  Is that…  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  No abs – you are correct.  You are 
correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the correct thing. 
20 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  That is the correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But how could they leave that out insofar as they 
would seek to say how much revenue does this route give SAA?  Or is 
that part – that is part of what your problem was?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  That is precisely what I had a 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 76 of 218 
 
problem with or I and the team had a problem with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  That if you read the document they 
talk about the importance of those but then they do not include it.  
CHAIRPERSON:  They do not factor the revenue.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The part that those passengers bring when they say 
this is the revenue that the route generates.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  And you say it did not make sense to 
10 
leave that out? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you.  So through the 
discussion or through the submission…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe let me just – maybe let us round this aspect 
of – when the revenue that SAA would get through the passengers that 
they – whose revenue they left out when that revenue was taken into 
account together with the revenue that they took into account how much 
difference did it make in terms of your teams investigation?  
20 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  It made – Chair through – it made 
a significant difference because the connecting traffic was quite 
significant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  As also articulated by them in their 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 77 of 218 
 
document to say 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  It is significant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Connecting traffic. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  And also the cargo revenue was 
substantial.  It did not mean that by adding all of those the route 
suddenly became profitable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  But it definitely demished. 
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  What would be deemed to be the 
loss on that route? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Particularly when you have to compare it with other 
loss making routes I would imagine.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay thank you.  Ms September.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And so it is then your evidence if I 
understand it correctly that the Mumbai route was not the worst 
20 
performing route to SAA at the time?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Did it then make any sense to you as 
to why this particular was being identified?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  No it did not. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 78 of 218 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Rev… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did – I am sorry.  Insofar as the passengers from 
other places - that we talked about a few minutes ago – apart from the 
failure to take into account the revenue coming from them is th ere 
something else that the team who prepared that recommendation 
appeared not to have taken into account or that you and your team 
thought should have been taken into account.  
I think you mentioned at some stage strategic importance of – 
I do not know whether those passengers or the connection.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes.  So that is correct Chair 
10 
because we viewed it as a very strategic route for us in feeding into 
South America which we wanted to actually grow as part of the network 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  And as already indicated in 
addition what they had not taken into consideration was that because 
Indian carriers – well for some strange reason do have the ability to 
pick up traffic.  So it is unusual for - and – but it is unusual for a 
carrier to have the ability to pick up revenue passengers from a foreign 
country to another foreign country.  
20 
Normally what happens – not – it is – so basic – when I say 
it is unusual it does not mean that it is not – it is one of the freedoms 
of the air. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  So – but it is highly unusual …  
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 79 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  To find that country to country 
there has been approval for freedom traffic rights.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  They exist as part of the Chicago 
Convention - everything else – but ordinarily when you do that first of 
all it is reciprocal because you think as a country there is probably 
value as well for your own carriers to benefit from picki ng up 
passengers from a foreign country to another foreign country and we do 
not have many destinations as far as I know or as far as I knew at that 
10 
point in time where – who had been provided with the ability to exercise 
that right and we felt quite stron gly that they had not taken that into 
consideration nor highlighted it to the Board to say you may be thinking 
that we are terminating or we are talking about a Johannesburg/Mumbai 
Route but whatever you do in terms of providing another or an Indian 
carrier into South Africa – into South Africa is that there was a very 
good possibility that the next step which – what I would have done or 
would be to then say because we have that – we have this freedom 
traffic rights awarded to us as Indian carriers I am als o now going to 
provide a service where I pick revenue paying South Africans from 
20 
South Africa in competition with SAA further to South America.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Ms Mzimela is it correct that a Code 
Sharing Agreement is – was the basis for collaboration between SAA 
and Jet Airways? 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 80 of 218 
 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Now please help us to understand 
exactly what a Code Sharing Agreement is.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Is it correct first that it is common 
though to the industry?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Code Sharing Agreements Chair 
are very, very common.  In fact especially for network carriers it is 
something that you are continuously trying to put in to place with – with 
other partners.  So is it a partnership but they take various forms.  
10 
They … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  To – sorry – to explain those forms 
can I take you to page 12 and perhaps through practical examples we 
can understand what a Code Sharing Arrangement is. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Okay.  So they can take - Code 
Sharing Partnerships can take various forms.  They can take the form – 
maybe just to explain – what we call a trunk route which the main route.  
Let us say it is the route between Johannesburg and Frankfurt.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You call it a chunk route?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Trunk. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Which is like the main route. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  So they either take the form that 
there are two carriers that are flying on that route and they decide to 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 81 of 218 
 
Code Share on each other which basically means when a passenger 
goes into the system they see seats under the SA Code but you find the 
– the actual carrier that is flying that route would probably be a 
different carrier - let us say - Lufthansa in that instance but both 
carriers are flying on that route and they decide to partner up and offer 
a Code Share. 
There is also – I mean – Code Shares where it is only one 
person who is flying on the trunk route.  It does not – the other partner 
does not fly on that route but they agree to then say let us Code Share 
so that at least I have my Code showing as well on that route and I 
10 
make the example that if you look a t Johannesburg/Dubai Route today 
SAA 
flies 
or 
SAA 
will 
show 
in 
the 
system 
that 
they 
fly 
Johannesburg/Dubai but they do not effectively.  
They are using the Emirates Metal or aircraft to fly between – 
but they have seats allocated as a result of the Code Sha re.  Then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would – would it also include a situation where SAA 
does fly to a particular destination but if on a particular day it realises 
that there are too few passengers but the – the other airline has got – 
does not have enough but has m ore.  Then they could move them to the 
other airline so that SAA does not have to fly and does not have to 
20 
incur expenses when they only have too few passengers.  Would it 
include something like that or not really?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  As part of the Code Share 
Agreement it would not be geared to actually accommodate …  
CHAIRPERSON:  To (intervenes). 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 82 of 218 
 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That type of issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  However from an operational – the 
day to day operational perspective it is one of the things that you could 
do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  So let us say for example 
suddenly you experience a technical …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  And you already have an existing 
10 
Code Share Arrangement with a partner on that same route.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  You could actually move all your 
passengers to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Practically. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I was wondering because I think I have had 
situations where I think I am on SAA and then the next thing I am on 
another – I am put into another aircraft that does not belong to SAA but 
maybe it is that kind of situation.  
20 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That would be in the situation 
Chair where there is a Code Share Arrangement in place because on 
the system you as a passenger unless you are familiar with aircraft 
systems and so forth would not be able to tell …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 83 of 218 
 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Whether this is going to be on an 
SAA … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Aircraft or is going to be on a 
Lufthansa (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Maybe – maybe … 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  But – but … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Ja. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Ja. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Maybe just to explain those two 
before we get to the third by way of examples.  The diagram on page 12 
has a trunk route between Frankfurt and Johannesburg.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  On the left hand side there are 
connecting destinations one being Amsterdam, Brussels and Zurich.  
On the right hand side the connection destinations from Johannesburg 
would be Durban, Port Elizabeth and Cape Town.  SA A and Lufthansa 
are identified here as the two airlines travelling the trunk route.  
In the first example that you have given as an example – 
20 
common example of Code Share – you mention that there are two 
airlines that both fly the trunk route …  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then the benefit to passengers 
would – would mean what exactly in that instance?  
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 84 of 218 
 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA: 
 
Well 
the 
benefit 
to 
– 
to 
passengers if it is only on the trunk route is that you have a wider  
choice.  So if I am flying at 10 o’ clock I have a Code Share with 
somebody who flies at 12 o’ clock.  It provides a passenger with a 
wider choice in terms of timing – the flexibility of timing but which is 
the third one I was going to get to …  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Which actually works for both the 
two that I have already described which is the behind and beyond Code 
Shares which is where the real benefit of the Code Share especially for 
10 
carriers that are already partnering up on – on a trunk route are the 
additional points that you get out of your – they get out of your home 
town or your home base and the additional points that you get out of 
their home base or hub in order to be able to connect your passengers 
seamlessly. 
So in this example that I actually provided I was actually 
demonstrating that you would have – if we have a Code Share for 
example between SAA and Lufthansa the real benefit - even though you 
are sharing on the trunk route – the real benefit for SAA are those 
beyond points such as Zurich, Brussels and so forth because SAA now 
20 
has the ability to be able to sell a flight or to sell Brussels as a 
destination but it does not necessarily fly itself all the way to Brussels.  
On one leg you could be flying to SAA you connect still on 
your SAA code to your final destination because there is a partnership 
that exists and when you do that it is normally reciprocal because as 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 85 of 218 
 
you give they also need to get so that it works for both parties.  It 
would … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if we …  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  If we look at the diagram at page 12 in 
regard to what you are saying the trunk – would the trunk route be the 
route between France and Johannesburg?  Is it France that FRA?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Is it Frankfurt and Johannesburg.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Frankfurt? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, Frankfurt. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know – ja so that is Frankfurt and Johannesburg?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would that be the trunk route?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes not beyond? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Now you both in your affidavit and in your 
evidence now you have talked about there is something and beyond?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just give me that term again?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Behind and beyond. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 86 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Behind and beyond ja. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  What does that talk about?  In this – in the 
example of this diagram at page 12 is the behind and the beyond 
talking about Brussels, Amsterdam and Zurich?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As well as Durban, Port Elizabeth and Cape Town 
when you come to South Africa?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that – that is what it refers to?  
10 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now you have said that there is a certain benefit and 
I got the impression that it is quite an important benefit this behind and 
beyond.  So just explain what – what is the – this benefit for the carrier 
and for the – for the passengers? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  So the benefit for the carrier is 
that in the system for passengers firstly passengers would be looking to 
fly – they want to buy one ticket …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  And one ticket is one carrier not to 
20 
find themselves having to buy one ticket …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  With SAA and having to buy 
another ticket with somebody else …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 87 of 218 
 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  And if anyone has the ability to fly 
– fly them directly …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  To the ultimate … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ultimate. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Destination …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  They are the ones who w ould 
actually be picked first. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, yes. 
10 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes.  So therefore the real value 
for an entity such as SAA to have a Code Share which takes beyond 
people beyond this is …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That now the passenger can buy 
one ticket …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  And is it on SAA …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  And it shows the SAA Code all the 
20 
way to – you know - to say Brussels or to Zurich …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  But it does not necessarily mean 
that SAA is flying on its own metal …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 88 of 218 
 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  All the way to Zurich … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  But the passenger can buy one  
ticket … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  And it is seamless in terms of 
connections because key to the Code Share Agreements is that you 
choose your partners on the basis of them being able to connect your 
passengers out of your destination hub as quickly as possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  So if I am a passenger even 
though I land in Frankfurt if you do not have a Code Share that is in 
place where the partner already has a flight that leaves within say 
two/three hours there is no real benefit.  So the timing of those 
connections becomes an important factor …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  In choosing a Code Share …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Because in the absence of that I 
might as well as a passenger buy two tickets …  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  If I have to fly to Frankfurt and 
wait for a day before I connect …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  On another carrier to Brussels. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 89 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the benefit has got nothing to do with whether for 
example in this example at page 12 …  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If I am coming from Johannesburg – it has got nothing 
to do with whether in Frankfurt I will get out of the one plane and then 
take another one to Brussels.  It has got nothing to do with that.  All it 
has is simply that I should be able to proceed the same day or 
something like that? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  You are able to proceed as – as 
quick as possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As quick as possible. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  As quick as possible yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it is not a particular benefit that you will not have 
to connect.  You may still have to connect? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  You do – definitely Chair – you do 
still need to connect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  You would know when you land in 
20 
any foreign country …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  You still need to go through …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Immigration …  
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 90 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  But – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  So the benefit would be that you 
are connecting but you are connecting as quickly as possible.  
Secondly you are only buying one ticket …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  On SAA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Even though even the second …  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  The second portion is not SAA.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  So it is one ticket. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the Code Sharing Arrangements are they only 
possible where on an international level not when you move around 
domestically? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Code Shares are not very common 
20 
on – on domestic but it is not as if they are only on international …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Because they are mostly driven by 
trying to improve a network – especially for network carriers they have 
typically been on the international routes, yes.  
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 91 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No thank you.  So – but in this example at 
page 12 it would not be anything like somebody could fly from 
Johannesburg straight to Brussels.  You would still have to go to 
Frankfurt and – first before proceeding to Brussels?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  So in context SAA 
had a flight from Johannesburg go Mumbai.  Is that right?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And Jet Airways was wanting to come 
10 
on board – excuse the pun – to conclude a Code – cannot believe this 
word has just … 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Code Share. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Code Share Agreement with SAA in 
that regard. Having explained the common types of Code Share what 
exactly did Jet Airways require of SAA in order to conclude that Code 
Share? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  So just to step back there.  There 
is absolutely nothing wrong with Code Shares and you can implement 
Code Shares with two carriers being on the same route.  The difference 
20 
here is that Jet Airways does not say I would like to Code Share with 
you.  You are already on the route.  Let us work together to try and 
improve the performance of the route by us Code Sharing on each other 
on the trunk and having beyond points.  It does not say that.  
Jet Airways comes with a propos al that says SAA you 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 92 of 218 
 
terminate your operation – you terminate your physical operation 
between Johannesburg and Mumbai and you Code Share on us – put 
your passengers on us but you stop flying Johannesburg/Mumbai.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And I guess part of what is strange is how can 
somebody else come and make that demand to somebody else who is 
running their own business say get out I want to get in because did not 
– did it not amount to that?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Quite simply it amounted to that 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  They said get off.  We are coming 
onto the route. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  But you then Code Share on us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and as far as you know and maybe you will – you 
are still going to deal with this later and you can say if you are going to 
deal with it later.  If the – if the route was making such losses that it 
was just – it would be justified for SAA to close it or to stop running it 
why would it be fine for them to – to run it or they – maybe they thought 
they could – they knew something that SAA did not know and they were 
20 
going to do a better business. 
Is that something that emerged in the discussions at any rare 
- at any stage or not really?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Not really Chair but you actually 
raised an important point.  They possibly – I am not saying this is it – 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 93 of 218 
 
they possibly would have been of the view that they had a better 
product … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Than SAA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  The one thing that did come up …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  As part of the discussions is that I 
think SAA at that point was operating four frequencies – and I stand to 
be corrected. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Only four frequencies a week 
between Johannesburg and Mumbai …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  And they were saying they have 
the ability to be able to operate a daily service …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Because they have got the aircraft 
to be doing … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  To be able to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A daily service? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  A daily service. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were running how many …?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Four flights per week …  
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121

CHAIRPERSON:  Four flights a week. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  And they were saying they had the 
ability to offer seven frequencies per week.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that not strange if you say this route is making  a 
loss for somebody who - who uses it four times a week and then you 
say you will use it for seven days a week?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess you might not be.  Okay, alright.  Okay, thank 
you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  What was the Board’s position in 
10 
relation to the recommendation made by FRIC – the FRIC Committee? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Is this the first recommendation or 
when we – as the - let us call it the new team?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
Yes. 
 
In 
fact 
once 
the 
recommendation is then – then made you then take steps – as I 
understand it – to include the Commercial Team to take necessary 
steps in that regard and at some or other stage it gets pres ented.  Is 
that right? 
20 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct Chair.  We then 
present the proposal to the Board and the recommendation is not to 
terminate the Mumbai Route but there is acknowledgement that there is 
work that will need to be done to improve the profitability of the 
Mumbai Route much like - you know – other initiatives that were being 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 95 of 218 
 
pursued on other routes and that – in that regard we had no problem 
with looking at a Code Share Arrangement that helps to benefit SAA 
and specifically when it – not specifically in terms of the behind and 
beyond – I mean – points out of Mumbai. 
If we are able to do that there was recognition from the team 
that it would improve the profitability of Mumbai.  So that was the 
proposal.  We also had actually r ecommended that there be a change in 
the – I cannot use technical terms – in the gauge of the aircraft – the 
type of aircraft – in the type of aircraft that is utilised on the route 
because the type of aircraft that he used also can make the difference 
10 
between profitability and loss making.  
So it was the second recommendation that had been made.  
Essentially we were basically saying the route should not be terminated 
but there is work that can – should be undertaken to improve the route 
and therefore in that regard we had no problem in having a discussion 
with Jet Airways about a possible Code Share on those behind and 
beyond routes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then on page 14 of your affidavit 
– of the bundle paragraph 32 you talk specifically to document s that 
have been provided to you by the Commission’s investigators.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Be – before that – before you made your 
recommendations to FRIC or the Board was it to FRIC?  Your – your 
own team’s recommendation was it presented to FRIC or to the Board 
or to both? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  I stand to be corrected on that 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 96 of 218 
 
Chair because we are actually trying to find the actual documents 
without much success … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  But I suspect that because it had 
already been elevated to the Board …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  It went directly to the Board in this 
respect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Be – before that stage where it was presented to the 
Board did you or your team get a chance to engage with those who had 
written the other recommendation for the – the recommendation for the 
cancellation to engage them on their reasons and why they had left out 
things that appear to be important to your team and hea r what answers 
they had for your questions or arguments?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Indeed Chair we did get an 
opportunity to do so because post my appointment Mr  Chris Smyth fell 
back to his original position which was GM of Operations.  So he was 
still in the system and Mr  Jan Blake remained in the system only for a 
20 
short while before we restructured the area but he was there for a few 
months – you know – as well at the …  
CHAIRPERSON:  And he was the compiler of that memorandum 
recommending cancellatio n? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct Chair. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 97 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Ja.  So we did actually get an 
opportunity to engage with both individuals on – on this.  I think 
Mr Jan Blake and you can – I can tell at least – in terms of the quality 
of the document is a person – if he is the one I mean who compiled it – 
that he ensured that from his side he – the document contains 
everything that it needs to contain expect for being specific and so that 
is the one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  So that was his issue to say – well 
10 
he was asked to actually compile the document and he ensured that he 
highlights the issues about the route being a strategic route …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Having significant – connecting 
traffic and so forth but it seems like there was a decision that was 
already made or being made somewhere.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes but when there was a counter 
– I mean – proposal none of the two gentlemen argued against what 
was then subsequently put forward to say but on the basis of the 
20 
following … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  This is what it now looks like 
versus what you … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 98 of 218 
 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Actually presented …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  To FRIC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm; does that mean that once they were apprised of 
what your team was saying in terms of this recommendation and – and 
of the recommendation that your team wanted to ma ke to the Board and 
the reasons why you wanted to make that – that recommendation they 
did not have any – any argument against your recommendation.  Is that 
– is that what it means? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That – that is what it is – I mean – 
10 
Chair and just to be clear they obviously also formed part of my team.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  The difference … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Is that I had actually allocated it 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  To the department that should 
have been responsible … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  For undertaking this analysis 
which is the  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Commercial Department …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 99 of 218 
 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Who worked very closely with the 
Asia Team that was based ... 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  And looked after the Mumbai 
Route as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So they were part of your team that came up with the 
recommendation? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Indeed. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So ultimately in effect …  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They – they were persuaded that the recommendation 
for the cancellation of the Mumbai Route was not the correct 
recommendation and they went along with the latest recommendation to 
say do not cancel but there is work to be done towards achieving a 
Code Sharing with Jet Airways?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  I will place it differently. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  I mean - Chair and say they could 
20 
not argue against the recommendation …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA: 
 
Because 
the 
– 
the 
final 
recommendation raised and addressed issues th at they had not raised 
… 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 100 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  And therefore they would have to 
be – there was acceptance from their part …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  And that was the case and that 
was a true reflection …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Or a true status …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Of the route at that point in time.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Okay, alright but they – they never 
withdrew their recommendation formally?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The earlier document because I see the risk – the 
FRIC what the Chairperson wrote in the document that we looked at 
earlier did not seem to take a decision but simply said we have raised 
concerns.  The issue must be looked at.  So – so in other words it may 
well be that technically that recommendation would still be before FRIC 
or the Board now together with the new recommendation and the Board 
would have to look at both?  
20 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Was 
that 
your 
understanding 
or 
was 
your 
understanding that the latest recommendation took the place of the 
earlier one? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  The latest recommendation took 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 101 of 218 
 
the place of the earlier one but making reference …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  To the previous one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  To say this is what had been 
presented to FRIC …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  But this is what was actually 
missing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  This is what has been considered 
in the new …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Proposal …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  And hence the recommendation is 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is … 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Different. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  From the one that had been 
previously tabled. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  Ms Mzimela is it correct 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 102 of 218 
 
that Ms Cheryl Carolus was the Chairperson of the Board at the time?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And are you aware of any exchange 
of communication between the Ministry who was Minister  Barbra Hogan 
at the time with the Chairperson of the Board?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes I am aware. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that on the issue of the Mumbai Route?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I ask you to turn to page 9 4 
10 
please?  Who is Mr Naresh Goyal? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA: 
 
Mr Naresh Goyal 
– 
I 
think 
Executive Chair or CEO or Executive Chair and CEO of Jet Airways.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms September I just want to make sure that we are on 
the same page.  When we come to this – to page 94 is it when the 
Board had made a decision on the recommendation or not yet?  If – if it 
is after I would like us to finalise that and know what the Board’s 
decision was. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it before? 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Let me ask it through the witness.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  At the date of 1 September 2010 
which is the date of this particular letter are you aware as to whether or 
not the Board had been at this time taken a d ecision in not adopting the 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 103 of 218 
 
closure or the Mumbai Route?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    I’m not in a position to confirm 
the exact date. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:    As to when that decision was 
made but just recalling that I started  in April and it was one of the first 
things that the Board asked me to review because they were under 
such pressure to make a decision.  I think I can comfortably confirm 
that at this stage the Board had already made the call that they were 
not terminating the route. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the Board’s decision was that – was to approve 
your – the recommendation of your team?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay, thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And so on page 94 appears a letter 
from the then Minister of Public Enterprises, which appears although 
faintly marked dated 1 September 2010 and its addressed to Ms C A 
Carolus, being the Chairperson of South African Airways and the 
subject title is meeting with Mr Naresh Goyel l, Jet Airways on 31 
October August 2010.  You are aware of this letter, is that right?  
20 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Can you please just explain to the 
Chair what the very nature of this letter was?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:    My understanding of this 
correspondence from the then Minister addressed to the Chairperson is 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 104 of 218 
 
a request for information in terms of trying to get a better 
understanding as to the relationship that exist between South African 
Airways and Jet Airways and this is of – as a result of the Minister 
being approached by Mr Naresh Goyell with regard to the Johannesburg 
Mumbai Route. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And at the second bullet point on this 
letter in follow up to the last sentence of the first paragr aph which 
reads: 
“I have adhered to your request and would appreciate your 
urgent reply in relations to the following...”  
10 
Second bullet point 
“In what way my meeting with Mr Naresh Goyell would impact 
such matters.” 
The second last bullet point queries abo ut what the existing 
relationship between Jet Airways and SAA?   And the last one in what 
way does SAA expect the relationship between Jet Airways and SAA to 
develop in future.  Does the contents of this email suggest or confirm 
that this was particular to  the Mumbai route? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Indeed Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Do you know whether or not there 
20 
was a response that was sent to Minister Barbra Hogan?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    I believe there would have been 
a response. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And then can I take you to page 96.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Yes. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 105 of 218 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Chair despite several numerous 
efforts to get better copies of this document we have unfortunately not 
been successful in doing so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the letter from Mr Barbra Hogan to Ms Carolus 
was it not dealt with when those two witnesses gave evidence?  Both of 
them have given evidence amongst others on the Mumbai route.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Certainly the contents of evidenc e 
that have been given talks – the contents of the evidence that was 
given talks to the Mumbai route as Ms Barbra Hogan was approached 
on it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, the next one that you want to go to is addressed 
to Ms Barbra Hogan by who, by Ms Carolus.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
So 
I’m 
wondering 
whether 
there’s 
particular 
significance that you want this witness, who is not the author and the 
not the addressee, whether there is something significant you want her 
to talk about in it? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Through you Chair.  Ms Mzimela are 
you aware of the reply that was sent by Ms Carolus to Minister Barbra 
Hogan? 
20 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Yes I am. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And in – bearing in mind that we 
have such a really faint copy of the letter itself can you give clarity to 
what your recollection is of the communication that was sent by Ms 
Carolus to Ms Barbra Hogan?  
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 106 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you at any stage at that time see it, the letter?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:    Chair I would have, in looking at 
the letter and the way in which it’s actually written I can confirm that 
the bulk of the information that Ms Carolus has actually used in her 
response to the Minister is actually part of the information that we 
presented to the Board as motivation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Of why we should keep the route. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Because her response relates to 
10 
why we believe it is important for us to stay on Johannesburg Mumb ai 
but it also talks to the – not the decision but the initiatives that 
management are happy to pursue with Jet Airways in terms of putting 
together a co-chair arrangement that is mutually beneficial to both 
parties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you have any recollection whether before 
responding to this letter from Minister Barbra Hogan Ms Carolus as 
Chairperson of the Board may have discussed with you the letter from 
Ms Barbra Hogan as Minister and that in formulating the response she 
might not just have relied on wh at was placed before the Board but she 
20 
might have relied on her direct communication with you.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :   So Chair my testimony I make the 
point that Ms Carolus was actually very good in sharing information 
with both management and the Board, so when the letter had – or 
communication had come through from Minister Hogan it’s information 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 107 of 218 
 
that she would have shared at the Board and it’s information that she 
would have actually shared with me as well, which is why as I indicate 
that it is not surprising that the bulk of her response is basically based 
on what was submitted by management to the Board.  
CHAIRPERSON:  What you had said to her, okay, thank you.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Chair I am being informed that for 
the sake of accuracy Ms C arolus didn’t talk about the specific 
correspondence exchanged but certainly spoke to the communications 
as such. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
10 
ADV 
VERUSCHKA 
SEPTEMBER : 
 
Ms 
Mzimela 
those 
two 
communications being the exchange between Ms Carolus and Minister 
Barbra Hogan is that not a typical example of the proper protocols if 
engagement within SAA? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    My response to that would be 
yes, because Ms Carolus letter or response is not very clear, but I 
believe that part of the response, and I wish it was clear to one could 
confirm that, that part of her response would have been firstly as I 
indicated to update the Minister in terms of where we are, but 
emphasizing once again that the Minister should allow Jet Airways to 
20 
speak directly with the organisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    And that it was not right for Mr 
Naresh to be trying to go via the Minister to discuss issues pertaining 
to SAA. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 108 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  At page 16 paragraph 38, when you 
considered the letter you were informed that Ms Carolus informed the 
Minister that S A management including yourself had met Mr Naresh 
Goyell to discuss how the two entities can reach a mutually beneficial 
arrangement.  Do you have any comment to that? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    My only comment which is 
contained in my testimony is that I can confirm that the executives were 
already meeting with Jet Airways, the only thing that I was highlighting 
is that it may be correct to say I met with Mr Goyell prior to subsequent 
10 
meetings that we had at the Ministry.  I knew the gentlemen, 
professionally, but I do not recall ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  You had net met him? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Yes, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm, mmm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So at what meeting did you formally 
meet him?   
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    I meet Mr – so I knew 
professionally, because of the various aviation forums that we’re both 
attended or or were part of, but I met him formally in relation to SAA  in 
20 
a meeting that was held with the then Minister Gigaba.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And is it correct that that meeting is 
what took place on the 10 t h of January 2011? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you get to that meeting I am going to take you 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 109 of 218 
 
back to something that we dealt with some time back, but I need t ask 
you something.  When you were dealing with the recommendation that 
had been made to Frick that the Mumbai, Johannesburg/Mumbai route 
be closed, you said something in relation to – you said something when 
you were talking about your team reviewing and looking at the whole 
issue, and you said maybe a decision had already been taken or 
something like that, is my recollection correct of what you said?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :   Even I cannot remember my exact 
words I mean Chair ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  But something to that effect. 
10 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Yes, something to that effect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and are you able to elaborate on w hy you think 
so and whether it was in fact so, or whether – what the indications were 
which made you think maybe a decision had been taken somewhere and 
what that decision was.  I’m sorry to take you back but I think it may be 
important to establish that. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Chair I don’t believe that it is 
actually taking me back because I probably made that comment in 
relation to the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you are still going to deal with?  
20 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    That is this 10 t h of January. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Of 2011. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, maybe then you will talk about it more when 
you have dealt with a meeting, would that be more convenient?  
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 110 of 218 
 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  No Chair I can ...(intervention) 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can deal with it? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Very specifically that at that 
meeting ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  ...where Mr Rajesh Goyell was 
actually present when he was raising an issue as to why SAA was 
refusing to move off the route and in his view the decision had already 
been taken and when I then pushed to try and understand who at SAA 
had agreed to move off the route his response was ...(intervention)  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were the CEO? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  I was the CEO then but I was 
trying to understand who then had given him a comment that SAA would 
withdraw from the route.  He mentioned the name of Chris Smythe, yes, 
so hence ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay, no thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Chair we need to deal with this 
meeting in a little bit more detail, I do note the time though, but I am – 
which is ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think we still have five minutes.  
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Five to, I’m happy to proceed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let’s use the five minutes ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Ms Mzimela so you’ve given evidence 
that there was a meeting that took place on the 10 t h of January 2011, 
how did this meeting come about?  
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 111 of 218 
 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  The request for the meeting was 
sent to the Chairman of the Board, Ms Cheryl Carolus, for myself and 
her to come to a meeting at the Department of Public Enterprises to 
meet with the Minister, the then Minister Malusi Gigaba, in order to 
provide him with an update relating to the Mumbai operation.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So this was at a time when Minister Barbra Hogan 
had left and Minister Gigaba was the Minister.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  She has now left, that’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  So the invitation came and 
10 
unfortunately Ms Carolus was not able to attend the meeting, so she 
recommended that I attend the meeting with the then Chair of the audit 
committee, then, now since deceased Zakela Sithole.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you, and did you do any 
preparation for this meeting?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Yes I did.  So what I did was that I 
had actually prepared a memorandum of the issues, because they told 
us it was about Mumbai I had prepared a memo randum which actually 
highlighted what had happened to date with regard to the relationship 
between ourselves and Jet Airways and what were the issues that we 
20 
were still considering with Jet Airways and I sent that memo to the DG 
because that was my counterpart, but I had the opportunity as well to 
go through that with the then Minister prior to the meeting that we were 
called for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you can still remember how long before the meeting 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 112 of 218 
 
did you send the memo to the DG? A few days, one day?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  I don’t remember Chair but it 
would have been very soon after getting the request.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  When you arrived at the meeting 
firstly where did the meeting take place? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  The meeting took place in Pretoria 
at the offices of the Department of Public Enterprises.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And what happened when you arrived 
10 
at the meeting? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  We arrived at the meeting and we 
were told firstly told to wait because there were going to be other 
people who would be joining us as part of the meeting.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And who informed you of that 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  I believe it was the Minister’s 
special advisor, Mr Mahlangu, and so that’s what I mean we were 
actually told.  It is also at this point where the Minister then asked for a 
pre-briefing as well, and we went through, to take him through what I 
had actually outlined in the memorandum.  
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So after you had arrived and before the meeting could 
start the Minister asked you to take him through what the issues were 
and so on and so on. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  That’s correct Chair. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 113 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which is what you did? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV 
VERUSCHKA 
SEPTEMBER : 
 
Did 
you 
consider 
in 
your 
communications with the Minister whether or not Jet Airways was a 
partner to be trusted? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  I did raise concerns in the memo, 
so one I felt that there was value because of the network that they had 
out of Mumbai to partner up with them to provide us with that additional 
link into India, but in that same memo I also highl ighted that I had 
10 
some concerns about the way in which Jet Airways tended to conduct 
themselves and very specifically that I had actually discovered as well 
that they owed SAA money which had not been paid, as of the date at 
which we were going to have this meeting and this pertains, and I don’t 
know the exact details but there was an aircraft that had been leased to 
them and they had not made full payment on that, so it’s one of the 
items that I highlighted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was your briefing to Minister Gigaba every much 
along the lines of the memo that contained your recommendation to the 
Board? 
20 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Who was all present at the time that 
you had the debriefing session with the Minister?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  I cannot recall exactly who came 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 114 of 218 
 
into the meeting, I do not know that we went into the Minister ’s office to 
provide the briefing, so Mr Sithole would have been with me at that 
point in time, but what I can’t remember is who made up the team from 
the DPE side when we gave Minister that briefing.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Was the Minister’s advisor there, 
present at the meeting?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  The Minister’s advisor was present 
at the meeting, but I’m saying what I cannot recall is who was present 
at the briefing prior to the meeting.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you.   You mentioned then that 
10 
you were waiting for ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  This might be the convenient time.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will take the lunch adjournment and we will 
resume at two o’clock.  We adjourn.  
INQUIRY ADJOURNS  
INQUIRY RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes we are Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us proceed. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Before the adjournment Ms Mzimela 
you were explaining the commission about the meeting that you 
attended with the then Minister Malusi Gigaba on the 10 January 2011 
and in particular before the adjournment you spok e about the fact that 
you had debriefed the Minister in relation to the memorandum that you 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 115 of 218 
 
had prepared on the topic of the Mumbai route, is that right?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you had the – the Minister had asked for a 
briefing and you gave him a briefing what I would like you to tell me is 
whether in response to the briefing that you gave him which you said 
was very much in line with the memorandum that had been sent to the 
board about the Mumbai route wheth er there were any aspects of what 
you had to say to him with which the Minister disagreed or appeared to 
disagree or not to become [indistinct] about  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  No Chair he just accepted the 
10 
briefing as [indistinct]. 
[CHAIR SPEAKING OVER  WITNESS] 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he – he did not express any different views to the 
views you – to the comments and views you expressed?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Indeed Chair he did not express 
any view whatsoever. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whatsoever. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Except to say that let us just wait.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh either way. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  For the meeting to start – yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And so we on page 18… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, I am sorry Ms September.  Did a lot of 
time lapse between the end of the briefing and the actual meeting with 
the result that if he had any issues with what you had said he could 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 116 of 218 
 
have – there was time for him to raise those issues with regard to the 
briefing? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Indeed Chair I think that in my 
affidavit I actually mentioned that we waited for a very long time.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  For the representatives of Jet 
Airways to arrive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  For the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  Thank you.  
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And on that point of waiting how long 
did you wait for the Jet Airways representative to arrive?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Again because obviously I was not 
watching the time accurately but it was a good over two hours in my 
view that we waited for them to arrive and during that period of waiting 
and trying to understand why we were waiting for so long we then 
overheard Mr Mahlangu saying he Jet Airways representatives were 
actually on their way flying from Cape Town to Johannesburg on their 
private jet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when you say you waited for about two hours 
20 
would that be from the time you arrived or the time after you had 
finished the briefing of the Minister?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  For me Chair…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Or the difference might not be much?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Ja.  For me Chair I count the two 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 117 of 218 
 
hours from the time at which we expected the meeting to start.  
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  To when it actually started. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  What was the time that it had – you had been 
told the meeting would start?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  I cannot recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot recall? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Recall yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but obviously you – or probably you arrived on 
time? 
10 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  In your experience Ms Mzimela and 
your particular engagements with Ministries over the years was it 
normal for a Minister ’s office to wait that long for anyone to attend a 
meeting with him or her?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  So Chair the reason why I actually 
remember that we waited for so long is because for  me it seemed very 
unusual that we were waiting for so long for people to arrive especially 
because it also had a direct impact even on my diary based on what we 
20 
had been – well the time that had been stipulated for the meeting.  I 
had worked out that I wo uld probably be done and able to take a 
subsequent meeting on my return to the office.  And that is why despite 
it being so many years ago I recall you know at that point in time for 
me I was quite surprised that we were waiting as long as we did for 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 118 of 218 
 
these individuals to arrive.  And indeed in particular reference to say 
that even for the Minister to accommodate such a long wait.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well prior to your coming to the meeting what was 
your understanding of who would form part of this meeting?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  So Chair as I recall we had no 
idea that there would be external individuals.  Our understanding is 
that we were meeting with the Minister in order to discuss the 
Johannesburg/Mumbai route. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZI MELA:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when you arrived the Minister was there and who 
else was there apart from Mr [indistinct] that came with you?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  When we arrived – Minister was 
there – the Minister ’s advisor was there and at the poi nt at which we 
then started the meeting… 
CHAIRPERSON:  The advisor being Mr Mahlangu.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  That is Mr Mahlangu. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja do you remember his name?  Or not really?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Siyabonga Mahlangu. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Siyabonga Mahlangu. 
20 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Yes it is Mr Siyabonga Mahlangu.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  So Mr Siyabonga Mahlangu was 
also you know present and there were other officials of DPE that were 
present. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 119 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the department? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Of the department yes.  So by the 
time we go into the meeting I do actually share that for the ones that I 
actually remember quite specifically being present at the meeting is the 
Minister, it is the Deputy Minister at the time, Mr Ben Martins, it is Mr 
Siyabonga Mahlangu, myself and Mr Zakhele Sithole.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is when the meeting actually got to start?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes those were the peo ple who were present. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  That is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Did you receive any phone call 
during your wait Ms Mzimela?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Yes so while we were waiting for 
the meeting to start I then get a phone call from the office and the 
phone call is from Ms Advocate Coetzee who is a little bit perturbed.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You want to put – to say – also give us her name – is 
it Susan, Ms Susan…  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Oh okay I received a call from 
Advocate Sandra  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Coetzee. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Just for the record Chair it is Sandra 
Julia Hester Coetzee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 120 of 218 
 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  And who at the time was employed 
at SAA as the head of legal – head of the legal department.  So she 
calls me that there is a gentleman who is supposedly in possession of 
an agreement and he is demanding that this agreement be signed and 
this agreement pertains to SAA agreeing to terminate their operation on 
the Mumbai route.  Then this actually surprised me and I said I am not 
– I am a bit confused as to what she is talking about but because we 
were still waiting for the meeting to start I said look I am re ally 
confused the meeting has not started.  We have already – I have 
already briefed or myself and Mr Sithole have already briefed the 
10 
Minister so this is news to me.  So my simple suggestion to her was 
that look try and find a way to stall because I am re ally confused and 
maybe after this meeting I will have a better sense as to what is going 
on and why would this gentleman be under the impression that there is 
an agreement that SAA should be signing to confirm that they would 
terminating the route. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And from which company was this 
particular gentleman? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  He was from Jet Airways.  He was 
a Jet Airways representative. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  What was the significance about the 
call that you received…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let us just get his name if you were told.  At that 
stage you were not told who the person was, the name?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Unfortunately I was not told. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 121 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  What was the name of the  
gentleman? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Except for him being a 
representative of Jet Airways. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And Chair the affidavit of Advocate 
Coetzee which appears under Tab 2.  
CHAIRPERSON:  The one we saw in the morning. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  At page 220 the version of events as 
corroborated at paragraph 17 and 18 as indicated by this witness and 
with your leave I am happy to read that part in to the record? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no it is not necessary. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  If so necessary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja just continue. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  What was the significance of the call 
that you received from Advocate Coetzee and particularly the  timing of 
20 
the call in your view? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  As already indicated Chair I found 
it very strange that there is a Jet Airways representative that is 
presenting a document or trying to present a document to SAA to sign 
and this is the time when – if the meeting had started obviously the 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 122 of 218 
 
meeting would have ended possibly at that point in time at which he is 
putting a call through to SAA to say I have an agreement that needs to 
be signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But also even that that would have been q uite strange 
even if an agreement had been reached in the discussions at the 
meeting for there to be – for one of the parties to have an agreement 
that has been typed and that is ready to be signed?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But before we move forward can I ask whether – 
during the time when you were waiting before the meeting could start 
10 
and after you had briefed the Minister whether you at any stage sought 
to find out why are we being made to wait so long?  Or anyt hing to that 
effect either from the Minister or from his staff?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  I do recall that Mr Sithole did 
actually ask the question to say how long are we still going to be 
waiting because obviously he also had meetings that were planne d.  
And we were told no the representatives of Jet Airways that we were 
waiting for are on their way and they will be there shortly.  And that is 
the only response that we actually received.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Were you surprised that suddenly there were to be 
20 
other people attending the meeting that you had not been told about?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Yes we were actually surprised in 
that in coming to the meeting we did not know that there were going to 
be other people joining the meeting.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 123 of 218 
 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  But we already knew that there 
would be people coming through because after the briefing with the 
Minister the Minister did pose the question to say, do we know, to his 
team so how long are these gentlemen still going to be  before they 
arrive? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh but that was the first time you got an indication 
that there would be other people coming or you had already?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  No Chair I think when we got I 
mean to DPE and we were then – well the first thing was to – was 
asked to brief the Minister but by the time we walked in to brief the 
10 
Minister there was already an indication that this meeting was not just 
going to be between ourselves and the Minister but there were other 
individuals that were going to be joining us.  Hence the pre briefing and 
not going straight into the meeting kind of stuff.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Okay.  okay.  And the Minister during that 
period of waiting was the Minister away from where you were and your 
team and everybody was  in his office or was everybody just waiting 
where the meeting was supposed to take place?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  The meeting – we briefed in his 
office and then we – once we had concluded the briefing we went back 
20 
into the boardroom that was going to be utilised for the meeting and the 
Minister remained in his office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when you were in the boardroom were his staff 
with you or not really?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  His staff were there in and out. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 124 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Because there had been an 
expectation that the meeting would already have started or be starting 
at that point in time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair.  And we are now on 
page 19 from paragraph 46  of your – of the bundle.   
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  So… 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Please take us through the meeting 
on the arrival of the Jet Airways representative?  
10 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Okay.  So eventually the Jet 
Airways representatives arrived and – and the team was actually I 
mean led by Mr Goyal who I have already actually mentioned already as 
Executive Chair and CEO of Jet Airways and I do recall that there was 
definitely one other I mean representative there may have been more 
than one at that meeting.  And we all then convened into the meeting 
and as indicated present at the meeting is Mr Sithole and myself, the 
Minister, the Deputy Minister, Ben Martins, Mr Mahlangu and other DPE 
representatives also present in that meeting.  Then t he meeting 
actually starts and Mr Goyal commences the meeting by spending a lot 
20 
of time talking about himself you know and how important he is and all 
of the things I mean that he has actually done I mean in aviation.  So 
that is the first time I mean when  he gets a little bit annoyed with me 
because I respond because it is going on and on and I say you know we 
do know you and I know you professionally because we are part of the 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 125 of 218 
 
same sort of aviation committees or forums.  He then goes on to 
basically raise the issue that he has come to discuss.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But just before you get to that.  Everybody is at the 
boardroom now and the meeting is about to start.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who is chairing the meeting?  Who was chairing the  
meeting? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  So the chair of the meeting is then 
Mr Gigaba. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay does he – was he the one to start in the normal 
10 
way a meeting would start the purpose of this meeting is to discuss this 
issue we have so and so and s o and so Mr Goyal will you start or 
something like that? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Indeed Chair as chair of the 
meeting he does obviously welcome all the people present at the 
meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  And indicates that there has been 
a request to have the discussion and that the meeting is to discuss the 
Johannesburg/Mumbai route at which point then hands over.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  To Mr Goyal. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  To Mr Goyal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  So this is where then he takes 
over. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 126 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  You may continue. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  In beginning to introduce himself.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  You know and his organisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay then you may continue. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Yes.  He then actually continues 
he speaks faster than I do so he then continues to then talk specifically 
about the agenda item of the day which is the Mumbai route and 
indicates his unhappiness about the delay in the decision being taken 
and in his view again everyone is wasting time in that SAA should 
10 
already have closed off this route because his airline is better placed to 
be serving the Johannesburg/Mumbai route and he is quite surpris ed 
that we are just wasting time and not getting off the route and he would 
really like to actually suggest that we do so and do so you know I mean 
as quickly as possible and you know stop wasting time.  At that point I 
then respond because… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you responded did this come across like a 
demand as opposed to a request or a proposal that you close off this 
route, how did it come across?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  To me I say as far as I was 
20 
concerned he was using a very instructive tone as  if actually – maybe 
the way and I hope not – not all CEO’s speak to their EXCO’s like that 
but you know he is there, he is telling us this is what should be 
happening, we are wasting time can we actually just move on and do 
what needs to be done. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 127 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay ja continue. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  And because he then makes the 
point that as far as he is concerned anyway this decision was long 
made and the problem is more with this current management that is 
refusing to implement a decision that h as already been taken.  It is at 
this point at which I interject to actual ask the question to say I am not 
aware of any decision that had already been made prior to that date 
and if he feels so strongly that a decision had been taken and a 
commitment made to them as Jet Airways then could he at least 
disclose who had given him that assurance that SAA would be 
10 
terminating the route.  This is the – it is at this point that he then says 
it was Mr Smyth.  And to some extent I probably was – could 
understand his frustration because part of his frustration was that now 
they have on the basis of this commitment that was made they have 
now gone and they are like you know started operating services I mean 
to South Africa so he is very frustrated at this point in tim e because 
things have not gone according to plan according to him.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Sorry Ms Mzimela is he then allowed 
to continue and make these comments statements and demands 
uninterrupted? 
20 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Indeed he is which I ac tually found 
quite strange as well because now is also ends up being like he says 
and the only two people really talking are myself and he but he you 
know he is basically in a way basically trying to get me to say shut up 
and let us get on with this discussion this is what you actually should 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 128 of 218 
 
be doing.  And I quite surprised because maybe it would have been 
different if it was myself and he I mean on our own and he decides to 
speak to me in that manner but in my experience with the Minister and 
a Deputy Minister sitting in the room and this is a foreigner in our 
country and he comes and he takes that type of tone in a meeting and 
is allowed to actually carry on and speak in that manner I found that to 
be disturbing to say the least.  And he does this until a nd I would – I 
can only speculate but until Deputy Minister gets to a point where in my 
view he came across as someone who was now upset because 
obviously we were waiting for the chairperson who is the Minister to 
10 
step in, he does not intervene until you k now it is actually Deputy 
Minister Ben Martins who intervenes and says no, no, no please stop 
right there we have no problem we are all sitting here to try to listen to 
what your issues are and to try and find a way to assist if there is a 
way of assisting but please be careful about the way in which you 
speak to us and you cannot be talking to us as if you are giving us 
instructions in our own country. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes just continue in terms of giving us a full picture of 
the meeting. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  So at that stage Mr Goyal then 
apologised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before Mr Ben Martins intervened you had said 
something in response other than saying who gave you the impression 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 129 of 218 
 
that a decision had been taken already please tell us and he told you.  
Apart from that was there anything else of any significance you had 
raised or not really? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  I would have used the opportunity 
to once again raise the issue that I will re -emphasise what I had shared 
with the Minister which is we are not opposed to finding a workable 
partnership but as far as I am concerned what they are placing on the 
table is not something that we would ever consider and I just – and 
hence I went back to ask who  had actually confirmed that we are going 
to close the route because he kept on emphasising that SAA needed to 
10 
get off the route and I said that is not part of the discuss we are not 
aligned to that discussion.  Whatever discussions that we continue to 
have with Jet Airways are purely on a codeshare which we think should 
be mutually beneficial to both parties. But they are stuck on this issue 
of us not doing what they expected to do which is to get off the route 
completely by us sorry Chair I mean SAA.  
CHAIRPERSON:  At that stage did you have an understanding of how 
long before this meeting this decision that he said had been taken had 
been taken to his knowledge, did he give an indication of – was it a 
decision of a few weeks ago, a few days, or is that som ething that did 
20 
not emerge? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Based on what he shared at the 
meeting Chair he actually indicated that even prior to them as Jet 
Airways commencing the route to Johannesburg it was on the basis that 
SAA had already confirmed to them that they would be getting off the 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 130 of 218 
 
route. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh they were… 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  So this… 
CHAIRPERSON:  They were already operating between Johannesburg 
and Mumbai. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or they had always for a long time they had been 
operating the route they just wanted SAA out of the way?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  No Chair.  So as at this date when 
this meeting now takes place Jet Airways has now commenced with 
10 
frequencies to South Africa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the strength of this decision he is talking about as 
you understood the position?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Indeed according to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  According to him. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  On the strength of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  But you will recall that I – when I 
started off I said at the point at which we were also making the 
recommendation to the board to say we shall not be closing that route.  
20 
We were the sole – SAA was the sole operator on the route.  So they 
commenced operations into South Africa and according to him they do 
that on the basis that there is a commitment that was made to them that 
SAA would get off the route. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  You may proceed.  
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 131 of 218 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA : Um sorry.  Then he apologises 
when Deputy Minister at that time  
CHAIRPERSON:  Intervened 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Intervenes.  He then apologises 
and his tone is slightly different in terms of – obviously still raising the 
issues that he is disappointed, that we are not making progress and 
quite frustrated because they really think that they could be good 
partners I mean to SAA and at the moment he feels like we are not 
moving forward fast enough in terms of trying to finalise or formalise 
10 
the partnership.  That Chair was the gist of the meeting until Mr Gigaba 
who was basically silent right through the exchange even when there 
was an exchange between myself you know and Mr Goyal.  Even when 
Mr Ben Martins actually intervenes he had not said anything at that 
point in time except….  
CHAIRPERSON:  What was – I am sorry what was Mr Goyal’s reaction 
to you saying the issue of SAA closing the route is out of the question.  
That is not what we are here to talk about.  We are  here to talk about 
cooperation and code sharing.  What was his reaction to that?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  This is the time at which he was 
20 
still insisting that you are wasting time.  Get off I mean the route 
because this is – and so that exchange happens as well prior to Mr Ben 
Martins – in fact it probably also the reason why Mr Ben Martins also 
then intervenes to say, no, no, you cannot really be telling us what to 
do. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 132 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I just want say it is quite important that I get the 
as full a picture of the mood and the atmosphere as possible of that 
meeting and the way he was talking because I think I remember from 
your – from you affidavit that you got upset.  So I am just saying to the 
extent that you might not have described it as fully as  you think you are 
able to feel free to do so because it is important that I get a full picture 
but if you are satisfied that the way you have described it is sufficient 
is okay. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Okay.  No Chair I am actually 
satisfied with what I have said today. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  As I said I wanted to actually 
conclude or say in terms of how the meeting then concluded is that Mr 
Gigaba his contribution to the meeting is to then request that as a 
matter of urgency we should try and meet as SAA and Jet Airways to try 
and work through a solution of finding a solution to the partnership or 
building a partnership. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so he in effect suggest that the discussion should 
between SAA and Jet Airways should be  continued but he says to find a 
way to have some kind of partnership?  
20 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Indeed and he says it is urgent so 
he is basically as the Minister I mean instructing us I mean to hold that 
meeting as quickly as possible and with Jet Ai rways in order to have 
this discussion further.  But he is not indicating at that point in time 
whether he agrees with our position or he agrees with the Jet Airways 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 133 of 218 
 
position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  All he is saying is essentially can 
you actually and sure that there is an urgent meeting that is actually 
held between the representatives or the two airlines in order to find – 
well to finalise the partnership. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I know because you have said that you were not there 
to discuss a possible closure of the Mumbai route and from what you 
said Mr Goyal was not there to discuss anything else.  He wanted 
implementation of what he believed was a decision that had been 
10 
taken.   
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I just want to find out whether during that meeting 
there was any discussion of the merits and demerits of any of the two 
positions? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Chair there was not a detailed 
discussion except for my response back to Mr Goyal to say we have 
always indicated that we are happy to partner with them on a code 
share basis that is mutually beneficial to the airlines but what we are 
clear about is that we have no intentions of actually close or pulling out 
20 
the root completely because it does not mak e sense to SAA.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And how long do you think meeting took place from 
the time it started after Mr Goyal had arrived to the end more or less?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  If I exclude his introduction which 
was probably about fifteen minutes probably about thirty minutes, so in 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 134 of 218 
 
total about 45 minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you.  Ms Mzimela is it correct 
for us to understand that Minister Malusi Gigaba’s involvement in this 
meeting was but limited to the introduction at the outset of the meeting 
and his request…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Closing remarks. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  To the parties at the end?  Sorry?  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am saying his introduction and closing remarks.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes Chair.  His introduction and 
10 
closing remarks.  Is that the extent of his contribution towards the 
meeting? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Now how in your view did Mr  Gigaba 
– Minister Gigaba’s silence possibly enable the meeting discussion and 
the impression that was left at the end of the meeting?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Just to be clear the impression on 
me – left with me? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes.  In your view you attended the 
meeting? 
20 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Minister Gigaba’s engagement was at 
the outset.  It was at the closure.  There was nothing said in between 
despite the vigorous engagements, debates, attacks – so to speak – as 
you have indicated that was launched  against SAA with the aid of 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 135 of 218 
 
Minister (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe attack might not be accurate but I think 
the question is what did you make of the fact that the Minister was so 
silent during this meeting for most of the time other than introduc ing 
everybody or the introductory remarks at the beginning of the meeting 
and the suggestion he made at the end of the meeting that Jet Airways 
and SAA should continue discussions.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Chair I think for me it was 
disappointing bec ause a Minister sitting there as a shareholder – 
shareholder representative of the entity and at the very least - in my 
10 
opinion – he should probably have used the opportunity to reemphasise 
or in his own words I mean support what I had presented to him whi ch 
is we are happy to talk about cooperation but it has got to be on the 
basis of it being beneficial to SAA.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess especially because you had briefed him on 
these issues and he did not seem to have – he did not raise any 
problems with the approach that you representing management were 
taking. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Would Minister Gigaba’s silence have 
enabled then further discussions on the very strong proposals that Jet 
Airways were adamant to insist on?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  I believe that that is the case 
Chair because had Jet Airways also heard the same message from the 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 136 of 218 
 
shareholder representative they would not have continued – I am trying 
to find a polite way – they would have not continued to try and still 
push for the closure …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Of the route. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  I think for me it would have been 
an opportunity for them to actually underst and that we are all speaking 
with one voice and that the only issue that we are interested in having 
a discussion with them on is a partnership is it relates to a Code Share 
10 
which could benefit us as I said looking at the beyond points because 
at that point they are already operating to South Africa.  
We cannot stop them.  There is no problem with us actually 
Code Sharing with them.  There is value for us to get beyond points 
from them out of Mumbai and likewise we were happy to provide what 
we thought was equivalent benefit to them out of Johannesburg.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Following this meeting is it correct 
that a follow meeting was held on 24  January 2011? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes a meeting was held and I 
20 
attended the first part of the meeting just to make sure because as the 
only Executive who had been present with the – at the meeting with the 
Minister I thought it was actually important to be part of that meeting 
initially where now it is Jet Airways representatives and SAA in the 
absence of Mr Goyal. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 137 of 218 
 
So to actually then again confirm that the idea is to continue 
to – to speak to each other to try and find a partnership or to finalise a 
partnership that is mutually beneficial to all parties.  I then leave and 
continue with the rest of my work but then the team because at that 
point it is the Head of Commercial now who is now running with the 
process rightfully so and the alliance - the team that – that handled 
alliance arrangements. 
I – but the feedback was that nothing re ally came out of that 
meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And who – before you – we hear about the feedback 
10 
in terms of the composition of that meeting do you know how it was 
composed?  Who attended?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of names? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Okay.  Chair – I mean – from my 
side I can confirm that the – the Head of – of Commercial at that point 
in time was Mr Theunis Potgieter and he would have – you know – 
attended the – the meeting with his team from the Alliance D epartment.  
I cannot quite recall …  
CHAIRPERSON:  You might not recall the names of the teams?  
20 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And from the Jet Airways side do you know?  
Mr Goyal was not there? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes.  What I can confirm is that 
Mr Goyal was not there but he had his …  
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 138 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Other people? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Other people or representatives. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright and what was the feedback to you on 
the meeting? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  The feedback was that essentially 
they had not been able to make progress because Jet Airways was still 
stuck on trying to get SAA to move off the route.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So as you – in terms of the report that was made to 
you was the position basically exac tly the same as it was at the 
meeting which you had attended where Jet Airways was saying get off 
10 
the route and you were saying we are not getting off the route but if 
you want to talk Code Sharing we can talk?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Minister was not in that meeting?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, okay. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  This is a meeting now that takes 
place at SAA. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So this meeting similarly concludes 
on the basis that the parties cannot reach a consensus.  Is that right?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Just as a matter of interest w hat – 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 139 of 218 
 
how did the performance of SA – of SAA and Jet Airways relative to this 
route compare to each other if they could compare at all?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Well we would not have 
– 
definitely would not have privy to their performance statistics.  
CHAIRPERSON:  How they performed, ja. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Like the financials … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  I mean – in terms of how they are 
actually performing but what we would know is that they were hurting 
and when I say hurting because it was too much – they had gone in and 
10 
put in too much frequency into the market and they were not able to fill 
those aircraft.  So just understanding the – the airline industry and 
what you would normally require sort of like an average lo ad factor we 
were – we understood that they would be hurting.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  We … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us go back to the time between the meeting that 
you attended with the Minister and Jet Airways and the second meeting 
which you did not attend.  In between did you – did you confront 
Mr Smyth and say I heard from Mr  Goyal that you had told him that a 
decision had been taken by SAA that it would close down the Mumbai 
20 
Route, is that true and tell me how did that come about, what is going 
on? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Indeed i – I did Chair and it would 
probably have been on the very day when I got back to the office to 
have actually called him and said this is the situation that I found 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 140 of 218 
 
myself in – in the meeting where Mr  Goyal actually said the following 
and he denied it.  He said he had never …  
CHAIRPERSON:  He denied it? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes.  He said he had never made 
any commitments … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  To terminate the route … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Except for what they had put 
forward as a team as a recommendation …  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  To pull off the route but he said he 
never made a personal commitment …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  To Mr Goyal or provided them with 
confirmation …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That SAA would be terminating the 
route. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he indicate whether he had shared the 
20 
recommendation with Mr Goyal or with anybody from Jet Airways?  In 
other words had he told either Mr  Goyal or anybody from Jet Airways 
that he would be making a recommendation to the Board that the route 
be closed down? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  No Chair.  He did not actually 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 141 of 218 
 
indicate that at all.  I mean a t that point he is – he was like denying, 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  On page 21 at paragraph 54 you talk 
about a memorandum that you prepared to the DG on 11  April 2011.  
Can you please explain the purpose of this memoran dum to the Chair? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  The purpose of the memorandum 
to the DG was to actually provide her with an update on where we were 
with the discussions with Jet Airways as the person who I had liaised 
with at DPE in order for him to provid e further feedback to the – to the 
10 
Minister and I indicated in that memorandum that we had still not found 
a workable solution between ourselves and – and Jet Airways. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  To that end can I ask you to turn to 
page 1-1-6 please? 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the page number?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  1-1-6. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Do you recognise this document?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes I do. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  What is it? 
20 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  What it is – is a presentation that 
we would have actually put together as the SAA Management Team to 
not just say we are not prepared or rather to – to set out the basis on 
which we were happy to – to finalise partnership with Jet Airways.  So 
in terms of this presentation we talk about the various options and we 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 142 of 218 
 
say we are happy to conclude a Code Share relationship with them but 
it would be on the basis that they reduce the frequency that they are 
already operating in the marketplace so that it actually make s sense 
because obviously we are looking at the numbers now from an SAA 
perspective in terms of what would be the – the benefit to us. 
So those are the proposals that we then table as well to the 
DG as part of the letter that I sent to him as an update in order to 
demonstrate that we have applied our minds as to if – if we are going to 
proceed it will have to actually proceed on the following basis.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so to can I then ask you to read 
10 
the conclusions that appear on page 1-2-5? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  The conclusion is that: 
“SAA is connecting traffic is considerable and SAA 
is not in a position to adjust its schedule as there is 
a high risk of losing connecting traffic from and 
beyond Johannesburg.  That SAA remains open to a  
potential partnership with Jet Airways under the 
right conditions.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you and two pages – sorry – a 
few pages before that.  I ought to have taken you here first - on page 
20 
1-1-3. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Oh. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  There appears a memorandum that is 
written by yourself or let me wait for you first – 1-1-3. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  It is okay. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 143 of 218 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  There appears to be a memorandum 
from yourself to the Director-General for the Department of Public 
Enterprise Mr Tshediso Matona and it is dated 11 April 2011.  Is this the 
memorandum that you were referring to earlier?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  It is noted at the – on 
the next page though at page 1-1-4 that is it not signed.  You do 
however confirm this to be your memorandum?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So on 11 April 2011 you write a 
10 
memorandum which details and gives an accou nt on SAA’s position in 
relation to the Mumbai Route and that is preceded by a meeting you 
had in January on the route but three days later on 14  April 2011 is it 
correct that you get summonsed to Cape Town again?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct.  So the – the 
Chairperson once again gets a call indicating that in less than 24 hours 
we should make ourselves available for a meeting with the Minister in 
Cape Town.  Unfortunately once again Ms  Carolus - I think she was 
actually – had a planned trip at that time – was unable to attend the 
meeting.  She then requested Mr  Teddy Daka to accompany me. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr …? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Teddy Daka. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  She requested Mr Teddy Daka to 
accompany me to – to the meeting in – in Cape Town. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 144 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You get this call around when in April?  A few dates 
before the date for the meeting or what?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes.  It was 24 hours before. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  So within 24 hours we needed to 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  So … 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  In fact I think we got the call the – 
the previous afternoon and we had to be in Cape Town the following 
day. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Mr – it was very short notice to 
such an extent that whilst Mr  Teddy Daka initially was not going to be 
able to even accompany me to the meeting because he had a young 
daughter at that time that he – well was – he was taking responsibility 
for his daughter at that point in time and he indicated that he did not 
have anybody to babysit the little girl and therefore he would be unable 
to travel with us at very short notice.  
20 
In order to even accommodate hi m attending the meeting with 
me we even made arrangements to say we will find somebody to 
babysit his daughter when we get to Cape Town because it was 
important always again from a governance perspective that this was a 
request that had been put to the Board.  The Chairperson felt that 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 145 of 218 
 
Mr Daka was best placed to be the one to accompany me and 
especially because we went into that meeting not even knowing what 
was going to be discussed. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So you did not …  
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not know … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Receive an agenda? 
CHAIRPERSON:  At all what – why you were being called to a meeting?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  At all Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were just told come to Cape Town for a meeting 
tomorrow? 
10 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay; but you did not get the call.  You got – you did 
not get the call from the Ministry.  You got the call from the Chairperson 
of the Board who had been called …  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By the Ministry or the Minister?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Who was present at the meeting?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  In Cape Town? 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  So when we arrived – the meeting 
in Cape Town it was Minister  Gigaba who was the Chair of – of the 
meeting, Mr Siyabonga Mahlangu, Ms Raisibe Lepule … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Mr Mahlangu and …? 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 146 of 218 
 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Ms Raisibe … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Lepule was – I think she was the 
DDG or the Director-General – Director of Aviation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  She was one of those who looked 
… 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  For the record …  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  After aviation. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  For the record that is spelt R-A-I-S-I-
B-E and the L-E-P-U-L-E. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes and Professor Vusi Gumede 
who was the other advisor to the Minister.  I think more his economic 
advisor if I am not mistaken, the DG Mr Tshediso Matona and other 
departmental representatives. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Ms Mzimela is this the same DG that 
you sent the memorandum to three days later- three days earlier? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Indeed it is. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Please proceed as to what then 
transpired? 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and the venue of the meeting was where?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  The venue of the meeting was the 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 147 of 218 
 
DPE Offices in Cape Town. 
CHAIRPERSON:  DPE Offices, ja. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  DPE - yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  DPE Offices in Cape Town. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In Parliament? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  So as I indicated Chair that we 
had no idea what the meeting was about.  When Mr  Daka was asking 
10 
me I was actually speculating and thinking no maybe they are actually 
related to our request for a guarantee but we were just thinking all 
sorts of things …  
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not know what to take along?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  But we did not know what to take 
along. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And how to prepare for the meeting?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  And we … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the Chair who had told you about the meeting 
also had not – did not know? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  She equally did not know why the 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 148 of 218 
 
meeting had been – been called and as I say I have indicated the 
people who I recall who were there and as I said other DPE 
departmental personnel as well.  Mr  Gigaba as the Chair of – of the 
meeting then indicates at the start of the meeting that he has several 
items that he would like to discuss with us but first and foremost he 
wants to actually get an update of the Jet Airways/SAA discussions.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you say first and foremost.  I get the impressio n 
that that those were the words he used.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  He does say that.  I mean – first 
and foremost … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  What he would like to get an 
update … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  On the Jet Airways – on the Jet 
Airways/SAA discussions. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And for that particular item for 
discussion is it to be understood that he gave preference then to that 
20 
as above to any other matters which were urgent within the 
organisation? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  The truth of the matter if I could – 
so through – I mean - the meeting as well.  In the end we concluded the 
meeting discussing nothing else except – I mean – for the Jet …  
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 149 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Except that item? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Except for that item but he had 
actually opened up the discussions stating that there are a number of 
issues that he wants to discuss with us …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  But he wants to start first and 
foremost with the India/South Africa Route.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Based on your position as Group 
CEO at the time how did the urgency of this particular matter compare 
10 
to any other matters of urgency within SAA? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  It was – we had far more urgent 
issues and which is why even in responding to this urgent request to go 
– to attend a meeting in Cape Town our speculations at no point did we 
even image that the – the discussion topic was going to be about Jet 
Airways. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Jet Airways. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  You know we speculated about 
everything else thinking we probably need to discuss or provide an 
update in terms of the guarantee. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  You know – maybe it actually 
relates to some of the – the issues that we have been having ongoing 
discussions – I mean – with the department on what needs to be done 
within the organisation.  So long and short is that it was rea lly … 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 150 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  The least or our priorities. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm; before the discussion on this matter he did not 
articulate what those – the other issues were?  He just said they were – 
he had a long list but the - the first one was the – he wanted to be 
briefed on the progress on the discussions between SAA and Airways 
about the Mumbai Route?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Indeed Chair.  I do not recall …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA: 
 
Him 
mentioning 
any 
other 
10 
(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Any other, yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, continue. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Please. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  So it did take me a little bit by 
surprise that I was finding myself once agai n having to provide an 
update on the Mumbai Route especially because I had just a few days 
before had provided a written memorandum to – to the DG on where we 
were with our discussions with Jet Airways but I started and the 
20 
Minister to asked me to provide feedback.  So I basically started to 
provide the feedback on the basis of what I had shared with the DG to 
say this is where we are.  This …  
CHAIRPERSON:  The DG was present in the meeting?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  The DG was present … 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 151 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  In the meeting – to say this is 
where we are.  This is the progress that has been made or the progress 
that has not been made.  These are some of the suggestions or the 
options that we have tabled with Jet Airways but befo re I could even 
finish Mr Siyabonga Mahlangu intervenes very, very, very angrily ja and 
he starts to – you know – say he … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Without being allowed by the Chairperson just 
intervened abruptly? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes Chair which is why  I am 
10 
saying before I could even finish my briefing right in the middle of my 
briefing he intervenes and he says he is really tired of the amount of 
time that we are wasting on the matter.  As far as he is concerned we 
are wasting taxpayers’ money. 
There are toilets that need to be built and we are just wasting 
time and he is equally tired of these management who are always 
continuously presenting analysis and analysis to support their position 
on why a certain decision has been taken and all he sees is tha t we are 
just failing to understand that these are issues of national importance 
and we should just get off the route.  
20 
Mr Gigaba fails to reprimand Mr  Mahlangu.  So he continues 
and completely unacceptable and rude behaviour in my view and he 
goes on and on about Executives who do not listen and in my view it 
gets to a point where I look at it I say this is getting quite personal 
now.  He is now attacking me if he starts to talk about Executives who 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 152 of 218 
 
do not listen and all they do as I said is just present an alysis on why 
things should be done in a particular way and because Mr  Gigaba is not 
intervening. 
No one is saying anything at that point in time I then just got 
to a point where I got really angry and upset okay because it was 
getting quite personal.  So at that point I then told Mr  Mahlangu that 
look stop it now – you know.  This is becoming quite personal and I am 
quite angry about this because do not personal an issue which is a 
business commercial issue. 
If you have issues which are more on a personal basis I am 
10 
happy to take the discussion outside of the room but this is not the 
place for us – I mean – to be having this discussion and I actually felt 
that he was being quite disrespectful because in my view and I share 
with him that I do not believe tha t I am every disrespectful – you know 
– to anyone. 
Even if you want – you have a different view point you can 
present that different view point but in a respect – a respectable 
manner and I actually felt that he was being very disrespectful in the 
manner in which he was talking. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I get the impression that the one feature which 
20 
was common between the first meeting which you attended with the 
Minister on this issue the Minister – with Mr Gigaba where Mr Goyal 
was present and this meeting where Jet Airways was not there but you 
were meeting with the Minister and his advisor and the DG and other 
departmental personnel the one feature that seems to be common is 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 153 of 218 
 
that there is somebody who just goes for SAA quite heavily?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Indeed Chair.  I think that in the 
second meeting it was now Mr  Mahlangu taking the place of Mr  Goyal’s 
attitude … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  In the first meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  The only difference that in the 
second meeting is that he is now – in his anger he is telling us how we 
are wasting South African taxpayers money by continuing to operate 
10 
that route and we do not understand that this is of national importance.  
I am not too sure why …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA: 
 
The 
termination 
of 
Johannesburg/Mumbai was of national importance …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  But he basically – I mean – takes 
that tone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But was his tone more or less as that  of Mr Goyal or 
the tone of talking to – to SAA about this issue?  
20 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  He was probably worse.  I would 
say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Probably worse? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Probably worse. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 154 of 218 
 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  And I say probably worse because 
as I indicated Chair that he actually started to become quite personal.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  You know – I mean as well in 
terms of ag these Executives. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  You know – who just do not 
understand what they should be doing …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  And do we not understand.  
10 
Essentially he was basically alluding to the fact that we should just 
basically be implementing an instructio n and not trying to present our 
own view point on what should – what decision should be taken on Jet 
Airways and yet having said that no one had ever said to us okay 
terminate – I do not remember them writing to us ..  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I – I was about to ask … 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because your position as SAA – you articulated your 
position quite clearly at the first meeting …  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Hm. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you were not talking – closing - about closing 
the route … 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you were open to discussions aimed at some 
partnership …  
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 155 of 218 
 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Mr Mahlangu was at that meeting?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this is another meeting.  He knows your position.  
He knows what Mr Goyal had said at the previous meeting.  He knows 
that you disagree.  He knows that at that meeting the Minister did not 
say he agreed with – with Mr Goyal at least not personally.  He – but 
now he – from what you said – it looks like he was speaking as if a 
decision had been taken by the department or by SAA or by the South 
African Government that the route should be closed and you are just 
10 
waiting time. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is my understanding of your – of your evidence 
correct? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Hence I was going to make that 
point that for me it was surprising because it is not as if we had 
received any official correspondence from them that SAA you shall 
close the route.  This is the point at which Mr  Daka also then 
20 
intervenes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before that am I correct to understand that 
another feature that is commo n between that first meeting and this 
meeting is that the Chair of the meeting keeps quiet when this kind of 
“attack” if – if one can talk about it – but this harsh criticism directed at 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 156 of 218 
 
SAA happens the Chairperson keeps quiet?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay continue. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    So it is at this point when Mr 
Daka also then intervenes and directs his communication to the Chair 
who is the Minister at that point in time where he then makes the point 
that he is not happy with the way in which Mr Mahlangu is conducting 
himself and that he wishes to confirm that the executives had done 
extensive work around the analysis of the closure of the routes and that 
the Board, equally had applied it’s mind  on the rec ommendations and 
10 
that they were comfortable with the recommendations that had been put 
forward by management and that when he wanted to make it very clear 
that we would not allow ourselves then to be bullied by anybody in 
regard to this decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At this stage, and maybe at the stage of the first 
meeting already, the Board had already made a decision in terms of 
which 
they 
accepted 
your 
recommendation, 
your 
team’s 
recommendation that the route should not be closed, is that correct?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:    That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that was the position even before the first 
20 
meeting? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in effect what you were being told to do, both by 
Mr Goyle but maybe more importantly by Mr Mahlangu who was advisor 
to the Minister was, do something that would be contrary to a Board 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 157 of 218 
 
decision. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Did Mr – did Minister Gigaba 
contribute at any stage in this meeting?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Because Mr Daka was now 
addressing Mr Gigaba directly in his comments, this is the point at 
which Mr Gigaba then responds and he responds by just simply stating 
that he will still like SAA and Jet Airways to try and find each other, 
those are his words, to try and find each other.  
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :   And then what happens?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    And then what happens is that at 
this point, he then says, the Jet Airway s personnel must be invited into 
the meeting.  So once again they’re inviting Jet Airways personnel to 
join the meeting, we were not aware that they were sitting outside the 
meeting, just as much as we were not aware that the discussion for the 
day related to the Johannesburg/Mumbai route. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    Did any further discussions take 
place then, in relation to the Mumbai route after Jet Airways 
representatives joined the meeting?  
20 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    No Chair, because they walk in, 
they are introduced, that is Mr Gwena, representative, so the 
introduction is more – I mean with Mr Teddy Daka who had not met 
them up until that point and it is essentially to say, these are the Jet 
Airways people and again Mr Gigaba repeats how he woul d like to get 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 158 of 218 
 
Jet Airways and SAA to find each other but nothing further.  It’s not like 
they sit down, like the first meeting, where we have like a further 
discussion as to what is meant by this, try and find each other, it’s just 
an introduction and that is where the meeting actually ends.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And this is circumstances where a meeting was held 
at which – which was attended by SAA, Jet Airways and chaired by Mr 
Gigaba at which it was quite clear that the parties were not anywhere 
close to discussing the same thing.  The one was discussing that – or 
was saying the other must pull out of the route and the other one was 
saying, well we can talk about a partnership and then there had been a 
10 
meeting which didn’t involve the Department of Public Enterpr ises, 
between SAA and  Jet Airways, again, the report you got was, no 
progress was made and then there was this meeting which maybe it is 
difficult to say was attended by Jet Airways because they were not 
there during the meeting but they came at the tail end and not much 
was discussed after that where it was quite clear that between SAA and 
whoever was at the meeting who spoke in favour of the closure of the 
route there was a big gap, is my understanding correct?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Your understanding is correct 
Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and is that how the meeting ended namely with 
the Minister suggesting that SAA and Jet Airways should continue to try 
and find each other? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 159 of 218 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Did Minister Gigaba give any 
directive at the end of the meeting on further engagements?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:    What he indicated is that the DG 
would then be tasked to ensure that the discussions took place and 
would be managing any further, or coordinating any further discussions 
between – from his side in any rate, coordinating any further 
discussions between Jet Airways and SAA.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know whether the Minister might have certain 
benefits that he thought were quite important to both parties if they 
were to reach agreement, did he share with you, maybe any particular 
10 
benefits that he felt were really important that SAA could obtain if the 
parties could reach agreement?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    No Chair he didn’t share 
anything in that regard and as much as these are the examples I’m 
using in my testimony, I will still make the point that each time we were 
taken by surprise in terms of the importance the Department was 
placing on this route because we would attend the meetings, but going 
back into the organisation you prioritise the things that are important.  
So discussions are ongoing but for us it was not a priority we had so 
many other things which were of much greater importance to the 
20 
organisation than this Jet Airways (indistinct) Chair, as much as it 
would have actually – we were happy to have discussions because it 
then proved our performance on the Johannesburg/Mumbai but it was 
really not the top of our priority list.  So it continued to pu zzle me as to 
the amount of time and effort that the Department was spending in 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 160 of 218 
 
trying to find a solution or find a workable solution between SAA and 
Jet Airways. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And each time these meetings happened they 
happened at very short notice certai nly for SAA. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now have you had much experience in dealing with 
advisors of Ministers in the positions you had held before this 
encounter with the Minister – Minister Gigaba’s advisor, Mr Mahlangu?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    No Chair, I was – I had not, that 
was something that I actually found quite strange as well between the 
10 
experience under the then, Minister Barbara Hogan and Minister Gigaba 
at the time, was that I knew, and I was aware that Mi nister Hogan had 
advisors at the time, but they had never involved themselves with the 
day – I’d say day-to-day or operational matters pertaining to the 
entities.  My understanding was that the advisors were there to advise 
the Minister and even if they’re  present in the meetings with each of 
the entities, that the main role was to advise the Minister but it was 
different with Mr Siyabonga Mahlangu.  It just changed, I mean 
overnight, this was an individual who would spend a lot of time within 
the SAA system getting involved in matters such as this but even 
20 
beyond where he had a very great interest in other issues especially 
pertaining to procurement within SAA which was very odd.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Do you recall ever meeting with the 
Minister again regarding this particular issue of the Mumbai route?  
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 161 of 218 
 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    No I don’t recall any further 
meeting pertaining to the Mumbai route.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And so let’s put things into a time 
perspective, with your help of course.  Through your evidence you’ve 
informed that, as we know, that Minister Malusi Gigaba was appointed 
on the 1 s t of November 2010, is that correct?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    That’s correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And the first engagement that you 
have with him, particularly in relation to this, of the Mumbai route, is on 
the 10 t h of January 2011 when you get called to a meeting in relation to 
10 
that. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :   On the 24 t h of January there’s a 
follow-up meeting which is held at the direction of the Minister at the 
time for the parties to collaborate and see how they can find each 
other, on the 11 t h of April 2011 you write a detailed memorandum which 
gives a full update as to what the Mumbai route – or rather the status 
of the Mumbai route, is that right?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    That’s correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  About three days later, on the 14 t h  of 
20 
April – or rather let me precede that by saying that on the  11 t h of April 
when you write this memorandum you send it to the DG who is also in 
attendance at the meeting on the 14 t h of April, which is  but three days 
later after the date of that memorandum, is that right?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    That’s correct. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 162 of 218 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And this is all in the context of 
monthly meetings that take place between SAA and DPE on operational 
and financial updates which arise out of the government guarantees 
that have been given to SAA is that correct?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:    That’s correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  On page 25 of the bundle, there – 
you were presented with a letter by the Commissions investigators and 
I understand that you’ve considered that letter.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    That’s correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Can I ask you to please turn to page 
10 
127 which unfortunately is another one of these letters that, despite 
efforts we could not find a better copy of.  Have you considered this 
letter Ms Mzimela? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    From what I can read because 
it’s not a very clear document, but yes I see that the letter is a letter 
that’s addressed to me by the DG and it talks specifically about the 
Mumbai/Johannesburg route and this is the DG requesting very detailed 
information from SAA relating to the Mumbai route.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And just for the record on page 128 it 
appears that the date of the letter is 9 May 2011 from what I can see 
20 
and on page…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    That looks like 3 May 2011, that lo oks to me like 3 
rather than 9. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  We’ve been informed that it’s a 9.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Is it a 9, okay. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 163 of 218 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  In fact that would also accord with 
what she’s written in paragraph 66 of …(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:    Ms Mzimela do you have a better idea whether it’s a 
9 or another number – another date? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    I cannot confirm Chair because 
to me it looks like it says 35. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  We’ll resolve on May 2011 then. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes okay no that’s fine. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :    On page 129, is a list of detailed 
10 
information that appears to be requested, in fact it lists 14 items.  What 
comment do you have to the type of information that was reque sted by 
the DG from you? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    I think my comment would be that 
this information is very detailed in it’s nature, it’s the type of 
information that the team would have actually utilised to even come up 
with 
the 
recommendation 
on 
w hat 
we 
should 
be 
doing 
on 
Johannesburg/Mumbai because it actually talks to issues like cargo 
loads, the split of revenue, seat capacity, cargo revenue, profitability, 
market share.  It’s the type of information that the commercial team 
20 
would 
have 
interrogated 
in 
coming 
up 
with 
the 
position 
on 
recommendation on what we do on the Mumbai route.  So my sense in 
terms of this request is that it actually felt like, oh somebody is going 
to redo the analysis that has already been done by SAA - by the SAA 
team which could only imply that you do not trust what you’ve been 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 164 of 218 
 
provided. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Do you know whether or not this 
information was indeed provided to the DG?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    I would imagine that it was, I do 
not fully recall as I s ay but any request that actually came through and 
was a written request to the organisation we would always respond.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You said that at the end of the meeting in Cape Town 
where the Jet Airways representatives were called at the end of the 
meeting, were called in at the end of the meeting, you said something 
like the Minister suggested that going forward, the DG should play 
10 
some role in trying to help SAA and Jet Airways to reach some 
agreement, is that right?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So this letter from the DG may have been pursuant to 
that suggestion by the Minister?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Indeed Chair except that it still 
surprised me in terms of the level of detail.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that was requested. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was your understanding of what that 
20 
suggestion meant in terms of the role that the DG was going to play, 
did you have a clear picture of what the suggestion implied he would 
do, would he call the parties and chair the meeting and try and get 
them to agree, or exactly what he would do, was that clear to you?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    The Minister, at the meeting did 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 165 of 218 
 
not make it very clear as to what role the DG was supposed to play b ut 
the way in which I interpreted his statement or him saying that the DG 
will play a much bigger role, is to – I understood it that the DG would 
ensure that meetings are taking place and that we are continuing to try 
and maybe speed up a resolution on a p artnership, not to actually get 
involved in the actual analysis. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course you say on the partnership, Jet Airways 
may have been saying on the closure of the airline but the Minister had 
used partnership at the meeting?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:    No the Minister had just said he 
10 
wants Jet Airways and SAA to find each other.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And then just on closure of that Cape 
Town meeting what happened a few days after that meeting held in 
Cape Town where Siyabonga Mahlangu - Mr Siyabonga Mahlangu had 
made these personal, verbal “attacks” on you?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    So what happened – because the 
meeting didn’t end very well as you can imagine but a few days later I 
got a call from Mr Mahlangu and he asked for us to actually meet very 
quickly at the Intercontinental at the airport, it’s not far from our offices 
20 
and I agreed to meet with him, curious of course to understand what 
the meeting was all about and at that meeting he basically – he was 
apologising, so he came and he was saying he wanted to actually 
apologise by the way he handled himself at the meeting, he accepts 
that it was incorrect and it was disrespectful of him to actually speak to 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 166 of 218 
 
me in the manner that he did but he goes on  to say that I need to 
understand though that he was only doing his job.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and what did you say about that part, that he was 
doing his job? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Chair I just listened to that I 
didn’t say anything.  I think on the  one level I appreciated the fact that 
he had actually come through and acknowledged that he needed to 
apologise but I didn’t want to get into a further discussion as to what 
does he mean that he was doing his job.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMB ER:   Then just to clarify what you state in 
your affidavit, Ms Mzimela at page 24 paragraph 62.1, the last sentence 
there is that, 
 
“he personally apologised to me for his bad behaviour and 
 
informed me to the effect that at the end of the day, he was 
 
just doing his job and acting on instruction”,  
 
Does that part of your sentence remain to be true and correct?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    What that he was acting on 
instruction? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :    Yes. 
20 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Those may not have been his 
exact words, that’s why I’m saying the gist of the – his apology to me 
that he was only doing his job and essentially working on instruction to 
do what he did at the meeting or to behave in the manner that he did at 
the meeting. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 167 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So are you saying, he might not have used the words, 
that he was acting on instruction but whatever words he used, you say, 
meant the same thing? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes did you have an understanding of who he was 
talking about as having given him an instruction?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:    As a person who is advisor to the 
Minister my assumption was that he can only be taking instruction from 
his boss who is the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can we then go to page 25, 
paragraph 69 and you talk about headway that is then made between 
the two parties, being SAA and Jet Airways.  What happens on the 29 t h 
of November 2011 and the 14 t h of December 2011? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    So according to this, I make the 
point that at some point, because we continued to have discussions 
with Jet Airways that at some point in 2011 Jet Airways conceded to 
what SAA was actually proposing and that there was a letter of intent 
that was signed on the 29 t h of November 2011 and that on the 14 t h of 
December 2011 the two entities signed an MOU to enter into a code -
20 
share agreement.  What is relevant at this point, is that at the point 
that this actually happens, Jet Airways has now taken the decis ion to 
terminate their operations on the Mumbai/Johannesburg route.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay Ms September, I’ve lost where you are.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Page 25 of the bundle paragraph 69 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 168 of 218 
 
which continues on page 26. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay thank you.  So Jet Airways concedes sometime 
during late in 2011 that – or conceded to the option of code-sharing? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you, is it correct that certain 
approvals may have been required for fin alisation of a service level 
agreement between – a code-share agreement, sorry between Jet 
Airways and SAA?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    I the case, by the time the actual 
10 
code-share agreement is being concluded with Jet Airways what has 
happened, you’ll recall that I said Jet Airways was – had come on to the 
route was operating the seven frequencies, they then indicate to us as 
part of the discussions that they’re looking to possibly reconsider the 
position on operating on Johannesburg/Mumbai and in fac t they then 
make the decision to – they initially announced it initially as a 
suspension of their service for a period of time but we knew that they 
were withdrawing from the route completely.  What that does is that it 
obviously changes the dynamics because we have competition rules 
that actually stipulate  that if there is one carrier on the – if there is 
20 
one carrier on the route and we are both going to code -share, in order 
to make sure that it is not seen as collusion especially because they 
had operated – were pulling out in order to code -share with us there 
was a need, we felt as the SAA team, to get an opinion, firstly to say 
should we be applying for an exemption in relation to the code -share 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 169 of 218 
 
agreement with the Competitions Commission or not and an o pinion 
was obtained and it indicated that, indeed, we should apply for an 
exemption because we’re trying to avoid finding ourselves where we get 
fined by the Competitions Commission for having broken any of the 
rules.  I think for those that remember what was happening around SAA 
at that point in time there were a number of anti -competitive matters 
that SAA was dealing with. So we were being extremely careful in 
ensuring that we do not fall foul of the competition issues.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :   And did this then eventually 
culminate in an agreement being concluded between the parties?  
10 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Yes it did and it did culminate an 
agreement being  concluded which is a code -share agreement with SAA 
operating the route, Johannesburg/M umbai with SAA benefiting from 
that behind and beyond network of Jet Airways and likewise Jet Airways 
then could put their code as a marketing carrier, not operating carrier, 
as a marketing carrier onto the SAA route from Mumbai to 
Johannesburg and to some  of the points in South Africa. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And in the lead up to the conclusion 
of this agreement was there any engagement with the Department of 
Public Enterprises and the DG in particular in order to facilitate 
20 
processes? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:    Indeed there was an 
engagement, as I indicated that when we received the opinion that 
indicated that it would be good for us, I mean, to apply for an 
exemption from the Competitions Commission we then wrote to the DG 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 170 of 218 
 
to assist us to try and facilitate a quicker response from the 
Competition Commission because we had been advised that ordinarily it 
actually takes about six to twelve months to – sometimes, to get a 
response back from the Competition Commission.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Then can I ask you to please turn to 
page 148. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Is this the code-sharing agreement 
that was concluded between the parties on the 1 s t of October 2012? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    That is correct. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Is it correct that his agreement was 
concluded shortly before you left the organisation?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Based on the date, indeed it was 
the case. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And then can I ask you to please turn 
to page 180 and there appears to be the signatures of the contracting 
parties, who signed on behalf of South African Airways?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    The person that signed on behalf 
of South African Airways is Mr Theunis Potgieter who was the GM of 
commercial at that time together with Mark Cavaleur who was the head 
20 
of global sales and alliances at South African Airways.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And whose names appear as 
signatories on behalf of Jet Airways India Limited?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    It says here a Mr Nico Kadassis? 
and a Raj Sivakhuma? I don’t know them.  
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 171 of 218 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And then you have actually brought 
the following page to our attention and that is on page 183.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMB ER:  Can you please inform what your 
concern was around this particular page?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    My concern did not relate only to 
page 183 but it related to page 181 to 183 which is the Appendix A of 
the agreement and what I brought to your a ttention is that I can confirm 
that this agreement was the agreement that was signed because I know 
that this was the GM commercial Theunis  Potigieter who was in place 
10 
when I was at SAA an in charge of this communication but I had raised 
a concern in relation to page 181 to 183 which is Annexure 1 that forms 
part of this agreement, simply because Annexure 1  is now signed by 
different people to the individuals that signed the rest of the document 
being Theunis Potgieter and Mark Cavaleur.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you and so because you 
resigned in October 2012 which is but a few days later, you were not 
aware of how this particular agreement was implemented, is that right?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before we talk about implementation, the Annexure 
20 
about which you have expressed the concern that you have just 
articulated, is that Annexure referred to in the agreement?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I see that there is no indication on th e page – the 
last page of that annexure as to when those who appended their 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 172 of 218 
 
signatures there actually appended their signatures.  Do we know 
whether that annexure was signed on the same day as the actual 
agreement? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Chair what I was raising was 
precisely that.  To say there is no way that this annexure would have 
been signed on the same day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  That the agreement was signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes because same people would have signed.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Because – yes because had it 
10 
been signed on the same day the actual GM of commercial would have 
been the one signing this annexure as well.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  And he will – and you will note 
that the annexure A then gets signed by an acting GM of commercial.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Mr Manoj Papa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  And the person who pp’s with him 
is also not [indistinct] somebody puts a pp on be half of Mark. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And so – so your point is you have an agreement that 
refers to a certain annexure; 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  That is correct. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 173 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The agreement is signed on the  same – on a certain 
day. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The annexure is also signed but the two are signed by 
different people, is that right?  It is not everybody who is different or 
the – but some are different?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  They are – the annexure A is 
signed by two totally different people on behalf of SAA.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  As opposed to the rest of the 
10 
document and the rest of the annexures.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That are aligned to the document.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so you are able to say not only in relation to the 
agreement but also when you compare with other annexures.  So the 
other annexures were signed by the people who signed the agreement?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is the only annexure which has different 
signatures, different people signing on behalf of SAA?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  That is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and then you say based on that c ould not have 
been signed at the same time?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  At that time had you had a chance to see the 
annexure A that was supposed to have been part of the agreement I 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 174 of 218 
 
just want to see whether if you had seen it whether it was different in 
terms of content to this one that we see now?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Um. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or you might not have taken note?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA : No Chair.  From a SAA perspective 
the reason why it is there the GM of commercial and the head of Global 
Sales and Development and Alliances who signs this because at that 
point they do have I mean delegated authority to sign agreements on 
anything which is revenue enhancing in their space.  So I would have 
been aware for example which is what I confirm that I am aware that we 
10 
actually signed you know the letters or the MOI’s and the letter of 
intent and the MOI but the actual conclusion of the agreement the team 
would have worked with their respective departmen ts within the 
organisation in terms of setting out the detail along the principles that 
had been agreed.  So I cannot say this is how the first annexure looked 
like. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Without actually having it in front 
of me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. But based on what you knew to be the principles 
20 
that were supposed to guide your team in whether to sign or not to sign 
or negotiating an agreement are you able to say whether or not the 
contents of this annexure signed by a team diffe rent from the one that 
signed the agreement whether the contents appear to be in line with 
those principles or is that something that you have not had a chance to 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 175 of 218 
 
reflect on? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  I can confirm Chair that they 
would be line with the principles but the detail though is important.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Because whenever we say 
something is reciprocal if I give you access to Johannesburg – Cape 
Town – Johannesburg – Cape Town is a lot more valuable than 
Johannesburg – PE. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well… 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :   For argument sake. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am happy you did not say Johannesburg – Durban. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  I tried to avoid that Chair.  Is a lot 
more valuable for maybe SAA than Johanne sburg – PE.  So whenever 
we talk about reciprocal benefit you also look at that type of detail.  So 
that is why I am saying in terms of the principles or basically saying we 
provide them with beyond point out of Johannesburg and equally they 
do so out of Mumbai that is correct and it is here and it is line.  But the 
actual detail which is then contained in annexure 1 I am not too sure 
whether it is completely aligned because it then depends on which 
routes we gave for what. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So would it be corr ect then to say you are simply 
drawing attention to the fact that this annexure was signed by a 
different team on the side of SAA to the team that signed the 
agreement and all the other annexures but whether its contents – 
whether there is something wrong with the contents that is something 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 176 of 218 
 
you are not able to say?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It would be good to know even if by way of a 
supplementary affidavit it would be good to know whether if you take 
time after today to have a look whether you are able to draw my 
attention to any significant – anything significant in terms of what you 
expected and so I suggest that at the earliest opp ortunity later today or 
after today get a chance to have a look and be in touch with the 
10 
evidence leader and if need be a supplementary affidavit can be 
prepared to say you have had a look these are the observations you 
want to make if any.  If there are n o particular observations you want to 
highlight you can just tell the evidence leader that you had a look but 
there is really nothing you want to say.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Chair I would like to actually raise 
that it would be impossible for me to be able to do that in the absence 
of actually getting a copy of the original annexure A so that I can look 
to see what is the difference between the first annexure A and this one 
here. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well you can ask – you can if – I mean the legal 
team can try and see if that can be facilitated.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So just ask them to facilitate you getting that.  Okay 
thank you. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 177 of 218 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  We will certainly do our best to try to 
obtain the original if one so exists.  Chair at this particular….  
CHAIRPERSON:  And I think it is important because it is queer if one 
annexure out of a number of annexures and the agreement is signed by 
a different team and all the others and the agreement are signed by 
different – another team but it may be that  
1. there is no problem with the content or – and 
2. there is an explanation. 
Okay thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair.  Chair this 
10 
commission will recall before we move onto the next topic that evidence 
was placed before it by the witness of Ms Vytjie Mentor and that was on 
the 27 or 28 August 2018 where she specifically her version on matters 
relating to the Mumbai route.  And in this regard I would like to ask Ms 
Mzimela firstly before I advance the summar y that I have put together 
of that evidence if you are aware that Mr Vytjie Mentor had given 
evidence before this commission in relation to the Mumbai route.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Yes I am aware. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Chair in my own words having 
considered the evidence it is understood that when Ms Vytjie Mentor 
20 
attended the residence of the Gupta’s she was offered by Mr Ajay 
Gupta the position of Minister of Public Enterprises in the recent future 
when the President was going to reshuffle the cabinet.  At that time 
Minister Barbara Hogan was going to be reshuffled.  She – Minister 
Hogan being the incumbent to that position.  Ms Vytjie Mentor informed 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 178 of 218 
 
that she would become Minister if she agreed to abolish the South 
African India South Africa ro ute.  She also informed that when she was 
asked – when she asked sorry – when Ms Mentor asked Mr Gupta about 
what would happen to passengers and cargo for that route Mr Gupta 
informed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well – yes well why do you not – if there is something 
to put to this witness why do you not just put it to the witness to say if 
you want her comment.  I cannot remember anything that Ms Mentor 
said that may have related to this witness but it is a long time ago 
maybe I have forgotten I cannot remember.  
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases Chair then I will…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there anything that in her evidence that needs to 
be put to this witness?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes Chair in fact I would like her to 
comment on the version that had been presented.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I think just go straight to it.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  I will do that then.  Ms Mzimela it 
was the evidence before this commission that Ms Vytjie Mentor when 
attending the residence of the Gupta’s was offered by Mr Ajay Gupta 
the position of the Minister of Public Enterprises in the recent future 
20 
when the President was going to reshuffle cabinet.  It was also her 
evidence that Minister Barabara Hogan at the time was going to be 
reshuffled. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I think you starting far.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Sorry? 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 179 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think start much closer to where you must ask her.  I 
think you starting far at the back.  What did she say, what did Ms 
Mentor say that concerns this witness?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair the version that I wish to put to 
this witness for comment is more so about the sequence of events and 
whether or not she has any comments to the version that had been put.  
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the sequence that is important for this 
witness to comment on?  Is there anything that this witness has said in 
terms of sequence that is inconsistent with the sequence that was given 
by Ms Mentor? 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Excuse me Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there any sequence of events that has been given 
by this witness that is in consistent with the sequence of events that 
was given by Ms Mentor. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  No Chair but we do believe that this 
witness has comment to the sequence of events.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Yes what is it that is what I want 
to know?  What did she say that is Ms Mentor that you think is 
inconsistent with what the witness has said?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Ms Mentor – in a nutshell Ms Mentor 
20 
was offered the position of the Minister of Public Enterprises on the 
basis that she stops the South Africa and Mumbai route. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes this witness [not speaking into microphone]  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  I accept that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 180 of 218 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  The next point is that Ms Barbara 
Hogan was the incumbent of the position a t the time which accords with 
this particular witness’ evidence during her tenure as Group Chief 
Executive Officer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you do not want to put what is consistent with 
what she has said. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Having said that there was als o 
evidence given that Mr Gupta informed Ms Mentor when asked about 
what is to happen to the passenger and cargo that Mr Gupta informed 
that they were in partnership with an airline Jet Airways and that they 
10 
would see to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Ms Mentor rejected the offer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but what does that have to do with this witness.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And Mr Malusi Gigaba…  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the question. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what does that have to do with this witness, the 
evidence of this witness?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  This witness is certainly poised to be 
20 
in a position to share with this commission her observations based on 
her engagement with the ministry in relation to t his route and to the 
extent that she can offer her observations specific to her role.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes observation. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  We would appreciate… 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 181 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes she has told us about two meetings that she 
attended which involved the Mi nister and where the issue of the 
Mumbai route was discussed.  So far I am not understanding what it is 
that you want to put to her?  Is there something that Ms Mentor said 
which is inconsistent with what this witness has said or is there 
something else that she said which might not be inconsistent with what 
this witness has said but which you would like this witness to see 
whether she can confirm?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Let me ask the question then 
differently through you Chair.  Ms Mzimela was there an y peculiarity in 
10 
your experience and observations when engaging with Minister Gigaba 
and his office specific to the focus on the Mumbai route and its 
closure? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Chair I think I have already 
highlighted the fact that I did find i t strange as to amount of attention 
that this route was being given. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  And from the Ministry in the 
context of all of the other routes  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  That were probably a lot more 
significant to SAA that is the one.  I did equally find it strange that 
there was so much urgency each time that we needed to be – in 
response to issues relating to this matter.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 182 of 218 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you.  We then now on page 29 
where you talk about the Minister’s advisor in particular Ms Siyabonga 
Mahlangu.   
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  You address his conduct from page 
82 until 85 on page 31.  Can you explain Mr Siyabonga Mahlangu’s 
involvement in the operations or the workings of SAA relative to the 
position that he had? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  So Chair I had actually indicated 
that the difference between the advisors during Ms Hogan’s time and 
10 
Mr Gigaba’s time is that we hardly saw the advisors.  We only saw them 
when the Minister was actually present.  And the difference with Mr 
Siyabonga Mahlangu is advisor to the Minister is that he seemed to 
have a very keen interest on SAA’s operations and in particular the 
procurement side.  In my affidavit I actually give two examples which 
confirm some of that unusual behaviour.  And the first being in relation 
to an IT procurement tender where he seemed to have a very keen 
interest as to you know how that procurement process was being 
handled and I make the point as well that his approach would always be 
on the basis of indicating that he is only trying to respond to queries 
20 
that have been raised by black owned companies who feel that they are 
being excluded from some of these tenders.  I in particular – and I – in 
my documents I indicate that my response to him always was that and 
especially in relation to the IT tender.  Firstly even I had to go back to 
understand what was he talking about because it is not as if I would 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 183 of 218 
 
actually pay particular interest and on anything which part of the 
procurement process and was able to say he needs to be just to clarify 
SAA’s position that it is not about trying to exclude black owned 
companies that sometimes it is a matter of whatever is actually 
required being a very specialised system.  It might come across to 
people who do not understand that we are just simply looking for an IT 
system but the type of tender that he had an interest on was an IT 
platform that basically supports passenger bookings an d so forth highly 
specialised.  So that was my one response to him in assisting or 
attempting to assist him to respond to the issues that he raises that it 
10 
is black owned companies that are complaining that SAA is excluding 
them from the process.  But I eq ually indicated that I – from a personal 
perspective that I do not get involved in good corporate governance is 
such that there are certain processes and procedures that are in place 
to ensure that we follow the right processes and there is complete 
transparency on how issues are processed by the procurement 
department.  And one of those is to ensure that even a person like me 
who is the Group CEO at that point in time do not get involved in who is 
going you know being chosen. You only get involved at the p oint at 
which someone comes with a recommendation to be signed off and 
20 
even then provided that it is above their delegated authority for 
approval.  If it is one of those that requires Group CEO approval then it 
would make it to my table and at that point I  then need to apply my 
mind in ensuring follow the correct processes and I understand what 
was the background for them to recommend whoever it is they are 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 184 of 218 
 
recommending at that point in time.  So that was my response but I 
bring this and I include this here because it was not I mean the only 
time that he seemed to have really I mean a big interest on 
procurement within the SAA space.  I also make particular reference to 
feedback that I had received from Advocate Coetzee who also had 
attended a meeting relating to setting up a panel of lawyers for the 
SOC’s or there had been a meeting called by the SOC heads again it 
was on the basis that the black legal profession was raising concerns 
that they are not being given equal opportunity with regard to some of 
the work that is being undertaken on the SOC’s.  And her feedback to 
10 
myself is that the meeting which was meeting of all of the SOC legal 
individuals accepted that position and responded to basically saying 
yes because all of us would always be geared in terms  of trying to do 
our bit in transforming some of those areas that it would be something 
which would be a key focus area.   But she in sharing her feedback with 
me raised that she was though quite surprised at that very meeting 
because when her people in the meeting said we are happy to actually 
support the initiative and have always been aligned to try and improve 
the transformation however whatever gets done must be done according 
to internal processes.  That it is at that point that Mr Mahlangu seemed 
20 
to get quite upset and he took over the chairing of that meeting 
because he was not chairing that meeting to say no, no, no he is not 
very happy with people now telling him that they would still need to go 
back into their systems to ensure that whatever they do it is not 
breaking any governance not breaking any compliance issues within 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121

their own organisations. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Before you move onto the next 
paragraph at 85 on page 30. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :   Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Chair the affidavit of Advocate 
Sandra Coetzee which talks to these experiences that she had with 
Siyabonga – Mr Siyabonga Mahlangu is at page 221 to 22 paragraphs 
22 to 25. Please continue at paragraph 85 Ms Mzimela.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  I also Chair I can detail that Mr 
Mahlangu in particular was always I mean one of those people that 
10 
would actually accuse me of saying you know you are not a team 
player.  You are not a team player whatever that actually meant you 
know I mean to him and it seemed like th e bigger problem that he had 
or me being described as a team player is that he was raising issues 
that were never the – as I indicated under Barbara Hogan’s time 
whenever there was a request to the organisation it would be in writing. 
What we found which w as different in – under the then Minister was 
that all of a sudden we started to get all of these verbal requests for 
information which made us very uncomfortable because that was not 
the way in which we were used to operating.  So as a result in most 
20 
instances we would find ourselves confirming in writing from the SAA 
side the discussions that had been held with any of the officials within 
DPE and he seemed to take issue with that that we always want to 
reduce these discussions into writing because it woul d really be either 
myself or the team to just basically say just in summary as per the 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 186 of 218 
 
discussion that we had the following was raised by yourself and this is 
our position with regards to these matters.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And you just wanted to have a record of what had 
been discussed? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Indeed Chair because the level – 
the reason why we were uncomfortable firstly they were beginning – 
especially when it comes to procurement issues.  For us it was 
important to make sure that it is actually documented because it was 
unusual for a person like Mr Siyabonga Mahlangu to be requesting the 
type of information that he was requesting.  Even if it was guided in his 
10 
view by good intentions of ensuring that there was a change or 
improvement in the participation of black I mean individuals.  So it was 
important to actually put that in writing.  It was also an issue where the 
organisation had no problem with that and in fact we had a board that 
itself would always be quite considerate of how we wer e trying to do 
our bit in transforming each of the areas in our business.  So for me it 
was a little bit uncomfortable to be having a discussion which the board 
would not be privy to especially because there is no record of this 
discussion or these discussions that we are having with the 
department.  And therefore it was important to be able to put in writing 
20 
the issues that were raised but equally to put in writing what or view 
point was in regard to that.  Otherwise we would probably not be 
portraying the organisation correctly in being accused of not focussing 
on transformation issues and yet we were.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.   
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 187 of 218 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Page 31 from paragraph 86 you 
document the events which led to your resignation.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Can you please…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Wait I am sorry Ms September maybe this might be an 
opportune time to take a short break, comfort break.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  No problem Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It will just be ten minutes so w e will resume at five 
past four.  Ms Mzimela you may or may not have had in mind that we 
would finish at four what is your situation if we continue beyond four to 
10 
try and finish your evidence?  Is that fine with you?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Yes Chair I would really like to 
request that we do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would prefer that?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  Finish today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Okay let us take the short adjournment.  
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS  
INQUIRY RESUMES 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
Ms Mzimela 
before 
the 
short 
adjournment you were about to address the situation of the Board of 
Directors during the year of 2012.  Can you please proceed to do so?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  So what I – Chair is that during – I 
mean - 2012 the relationship between the Board, Management and the 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 188 of 218 
 
Ministry became more and more difficult and …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Had the Board changed in the meantime or was it still 
the same Board that was there when you started as CEO in 2010?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  It was the same Board Chair.  It 
was the same Board but I think the same Board started to feel more 
and more the frustrations between reporting to the previous Ministry 
and reporting to the – to the then Ministry at that point in time because 
they did not seem to be – let me not say - an understanding of the 
urgency on some of the matters but just to use the example even of 
Mumbai that there was a lot of attention paid – paid to matters such as 
10 
that which were of least priority and  all of the other things that required 
a lot more urgent attention were not getting proper responses in 
relation to that and a number of the Board Members actually started to 
complain because they felt that they were quite suspicious and that is 
the way they were – quite suspicious of DPEs motives and delaying 
some of these critical decisions that needed to – to be put into place. 
Over and above that there would – suddenly we had a number 
of these negative media stories being - and in our view at least - you 
know – from one or two of the Board Members the view was that a lot of 
it could only have come from DPE because we would normally share 
20 
where we were or the challenges that we had with the shareholder 
representatives and we thought it was in – in confidence in terms of 
where the organisation was but we wake up the following day or two 
days later it actually has made the news and some – and most 
instances also taken out of context.  
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 189 of 218 
 
I know that it may not be fair to say that but it just – you 
know – when that happens obviously as a Board you begin to – to 
question to say are those actually coming from the Board itself or are 
they coming elsewhere because the only other people who we would 
have had those discussions with would actually be the Ministry – so to  
speak. 
Very specifically there was also like a lot of noise in the 
media about a delay in the AGM and the – what was put in the public 
space was that the AGM is being delayed because the organisation has 
not submitted its annual financial statements on ti me and that was not 
10 
true. 
Annual financial statements had been delivered on time and 
there is a requirement that when you do submit your annual financial 
statement the – you – that the Ministry would sign and there would be 
proof that they were delivered o n time because if not then obviously the 
external auditors would find that you have – you would have a finding 
against not meeting – I mean – the deadlines. 
So it had been submitted and I think this formed part of my 
Chair’s submission to the Commission – which is Ms Cheryl Carolus – I 
would imagine that she would have actually touched on that.  Those are 
20 
just examples of issues where it just became more and more difficult to 
do what needed to be done in the organisation and the added 
dimension was that – as I indicate – that it actually felt as if we were 
then having to respond in the public space but to things that were 
firstly untrue and secondly there was a feeling that they actually came 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 190 of 218 
 
from the Ministry itself because in certain instances the Ministry  was 
being quoted as saying they had not – they postponed the AGM 
because they have not received any financial statements and yet they 
have. 
This is at the point at which then the – the Board … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was – did – did either the Board – I guess it could 
only be the Board because I would imagine that the CEO or 
Management would not go directly to the Ministry – to the Minister …  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you could – you could liaise with your counterpart 
10 
– the DG? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Did you or the Board ever raise these issues with 
the Ministry to say this is what we are concerned about matters that are 
coming out in the – in the media but we do not understand how the 
media would have known a bout these because these are matters that 
have been shared only between us and the Ministry and if you did raise 
them – those concerns – what – what was the response? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Chair I cannot speak on behalf of 
the Board and what they w ould have actually raised with the – the 
20 
Ministry in anyway or form.  I can confirm that internally between 
Management and the Board Management raised their concerns formally 
as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  I mean - to the Board to say … 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 191 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA: 
 
This 
is 
becoming 
hugely 
problematic …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  In its nature. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  with anticipation then that the 
Board would take it further and …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Would take it further, ja. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Have a discussion with the 
10 
Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But whether they did that you would not know?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Before you move on to page 32 
paragraph 89 you were in fact in your position as Group CEO you were 
the apex of Management and Executive Management within the 
organisation.  Is that right?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And in that particular position you 
20 
had learnt of various instances of corporate governance not been 
observed in the way that it should.  Is that right?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  What did you do about what you had 
learnt about, the experiences that you had and what appeared to have 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 192 of 218 
 
been corporate governance not being observed in the way that it 
should? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  So I raised these issues with the – 
the Chairperson of the Board because she and I we used to have 
regular meetings as well even outside of the Board in order to – for her 
to keep abreast with some of the issues and the challenges that we 
were facing in the organisation.  So she definitely was aware of some 
of these challenges and she – ja – she – and was completely aligned 
with Management that it was absolutely wrong for some of these things 
to occur in the manner in that they did.  So …  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was …? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  So the involvement especially of 
Mr Siyabonga Mahlangu on a number of issues within the organisation 
the Chairperson was aware of that and there is an instance which I 
think she actually even covered in her testimony where in the 
frustration and I described it as in the frustration  of not being able to 
get management to do what they wanted to do I think they attempted as 
well to try and see if they could go directly or Mr  Siyabonga – go 
directly to the Chairperson to raise the concerns in terms of 
Management not doing what they expected Management to do only to 
20 
find that the Chairperson was very clear on issues relating to 
governance and in that particular instance made absolutely sure that 
she came back to management to understand what was happening and 
would not attend a meeting wh ere they wanted to raise issues 
pertaining to operational matters without inviting me to be present at 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 193 of 218 
 
that meeting as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the Chairperson throughout your term as CEO 
from 2010 to 2012 was Ms  Carolus? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct Chair except 
possibly for the last week of my stay at SAA.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  At paragraph 89 on page 32 you talk 
about a key turnaround item that was tasked to you to attend to called 
the Fleet Plan which was aime d at supporting growth strategy.  Can you 
please explain to the Commission what exactly that entailed and why 
10 
was this initiated? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  So part of our – our turn – our 
strategy was actually a growth strategy.  What I mean by growth 
strategy is that we felt that the airline needed to grow - especially 
given that it is a network carrier – it needed to grow the route that it 
operated on in order to increase the – the profitability of the 
organisation. 
If you are sitting already with ver y huge costs you either 
looking at cutting the cost completely or you are growing the revenue 
that you get or take in order to cut the costs but as part of that or the 
20 
one major challenge that SAA had at that point in time related to the 
aircraft and the aircraft types that were operating.  A lot of the aircraft 
were actually coming – were due for renewal in terms of their leases 
because you either – you operate aircraft either as owned aircraft or 
leased aircraft. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 194 of 218 
 
So we had a combination of aircraft that w ere leased and 
some that were owned and some of those leases were becoming or – 
due for renewal which was the one issue.  The second issue is that in 
motivating for growth of certain routes or the growth strategy it 
required us to ensure that we were utilising the appropriate aircraft in 
order to be able to be profitable on the route.  
Where there were certain routes that were not – were not 
profitable at that point in time not there was no potential for them to be 
profitable but simply because we were using  the wrong equipment on 
the aircraft.  So these were the things that we needed to – to try and 
10 
finalise.  In addition to that the Management had also inherited – when 
I say inherited because it was a legacy – I mean – issue pertaining to 
the A320 Contract where SAA had paid deposits for these aircraft and 
then had not taken delivery of the aircraft.  
This team in particular felt that whilst it was still – still made 
sense to find a way to conclude the – the contract on the A320s by the 
time we are looking at the fleet there are even newer generations 
A320s than the ones that were initially in – in the contract.  So the 
approach was that let us not take an approach which is – you fix one 
thing but it does not really have a significant impact as part of the 
20 
turnaround strategy. 
So the Fleet Review Process was a significant portion of our 
turnaround strategy and in order to be able to do this work effectively 
what I did was to set up what I called like a Fleet Committee.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 195 of 218 
 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Which was a new – a new thing 
but also aimed at improving governance within the organisation 
because there had always been horror stories about what happens 
when there is procurement relating to aircraft.  These are significant 
numbers that we are talking about. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And what was the mandate of this 
committee? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  So the mandate of this committee 
was to review – to actually analyse all of the routes, to look issues 
such as when are leases actually terminating, what would be the 
10 
appropriate aircraft in supporting the growth strategy, analyse all of 
that work and then provide a recommendation in terms of where we 
should be heading and what type of aircraft we should be looking to 
bring into – into the system. 
So that Fleet Committee as I share here that we did put that 
together and I ensured that everybody was represented.  By everybody 
I mean Senior Executives from Legal, Commercial, Finance, Risk and 
Compliance and also to include the subsidiar ies such as SA Technical 
and Mango and it was important to also include those subsidiaries 
because sometimes you make the decisions on aircraft only from a 
20 
passenger perspective because it looks good but you forget to look at 
what it would cost to maintain the aircraft. 
So we tried to put together a Cross Functional Team that 
would look at the analysis of – of this proposal and as part of this we 
also – so they signed very confidential agreement which are very 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 196 of 218 
 
specific to this Fleet Committee because we wan ted to ensure that 
there were minimum leaks.  These are big numbers that are involved 
whenever 
you 
are 
looking 
to 
change 
aircraft 
or 
to 
put 
a 
recommendation forward. 
We also - in that regard I also make mention of the small 
consultancy by the name of Dayli ght which was also appointed to assist 
with the more complex financial analysis.  I then bring up the point that 
there were so many - part of the reason and to confirm why it was 
necessary to put together this committee in this manner is because 
there would be so many queries continuously around this – the fleet 
10 
and what we intended to do and not only from the two main suppliers 
being Boeing and Airbus trying to find out where we are in the process 
but what happens is that an aircraft – you are basically buying – buying 
a shell from each of the manufacturers.  
You can decide to go and buy the engines from somebody 
else.  So the people – there were people who wanted to have a sense 
of where we are so that they can also sell us their engines versus 
anybody’s engine and likewise Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So this particular committee which 
was established not only augmented governance principles but it really 
20 
created a transparent platform on which to conduct a review.  Is that 
right? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct.  That is correct.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then once the committee’s work 
had been concluded what was the process to be followed thereafter in 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 197 of 218 
 
relation to the outcomes of their work?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  So the process is that they would 
come through as – with a recommendation to myself which then in 
supporting that recommendation would table it with the sub -committee 
of the Board who would review the recommendations and then equally 
recommend it to the Board for approval and this was done and whatever 
was a recommendation of this committee was approved both by the 
sub-committee of the Board and the Board and was therefore onward 
tabled with the Minister because it falls under those items which are 
considered to be significant and material in nature. 
10 
So that we then communicated that the sub -committee to the 
Board had approved a particular position and it is one of those where 
we waited and waited and there were just no responses and it was 
unclear as to why we are not g etting – I mean – responses one way or 
another to say we either support or do not support or whatever.  It just 
went silent as to – you know – what the issues were there and yet we 
had actually highlighted how important timing was even in assisting us 
in relation to those negotiations. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  It is then understood that the date of 
27 September 2012 was a very important day in the life of South 
20 
African Airways. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can you please explain to the Chair 
what happened on the date of 27  September 2012? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  On 27 September 2012 a number 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 198 of 218 
 
of the Board Members then decided to resign from the Board of SAA.  
In fact all of the Board Members resigned except for three.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Resigned – did you say (intervenes)?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  (Intervenes) resigned from the 
Board except for three. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, except for three? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Except for three. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Of the Non-Executive Directors 
and … 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And who were the three who 
remained? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  The three who remained were 
Yakhe Kwinana, Ms Dudu Myeni and Advocate Lindi Thomas. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How big was the Board at the time of those 
resignations?  In other words how many people left and how many – I 
mean – the Non-Executive ones? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  I stand to be corrected Chair but I 
think that it was nine in total who resigned … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Because i think we were a Board 
of 14 with two Executives …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Which would have made 12, yes. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 199 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And those who resigned they resigned on the same 
day, within a few days of one another or how did or did they resign at a 
meeting? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  They resigned – well they resigned 
on the same day …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  And the reason why I know  that 
they resigned on – on the same day is that they had the courtesy of call 
– inviting me into a meeting as the Board and because I – I was the 
Group CEO and communicated to me the intention to resign.  So that I 
10 
heard it from them and not from any othe r source and it is at that – that 
meeting where when they shared with me their intentions to resign my 
response was I do not know why I would be remaining because I 
equally share the - the same frustrations that – that they were 
articulating in relation to  how things were being handled in the 
organisation but Ms  Carolus was the Chair before resignation then 
convinces me to say please you need to stay in the interest of the 
stability of the organisation and in her view she was saying stay 
because maybe the people they do not want is us as the Non-Executive 
Directors and things may potentially be different after we have left but 
20 
please in the interest of the organisation can you remain behind and do 
not make the call to also resign at the same time.  
I heeded her advice and said no I would stay but even then I 
did make it clear even to Ms  Carolus and I said I am happy to stay 
indeed in the interest of the organisation but what would actually 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 200 of 218 
 
determine me staying beyond a particular period in SAA is if there is a  
sense that things would change and I would get a better sense of that 
based on the calibre of people who they appoint on the Board and 
whether there would still be alignment in terms of values and ensuring 
good corporate governance because it was my view which I think I 
shared – I mean - with the Board that the biggest problem with this 
Board is that it was just so strict on insisting that things be done 
properly rather than anything else.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Will it be correct therefore to say your understandin g 
is that the nine Members of the Board who resigned at the same time 
10 
resigned because they believed that they were not receiving the 
support that the Ministry and the department were supposed to give 
them and SAA? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct – I mean – Chair 
and equally they were disturbed by that they were professionals who 
were now being portrayed as people who did not understand 
governance in the public space when there are media leakages that 
pertain to dates being missed and certain things that had not been 
done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So part of it was what was – what was finding its way 
20 
to the media and being said about SAA and - and/or the Board … 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the media in circumstances where the Board  or at 
least some Members of the Board thought it must have been either the 
Ministry or the Department of Public Enterprises that would have 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 201 of 218 
 
shared that information with the media?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  After the Board’s resignation or 
rather majority of the Board’s resignation on 27  September 2012 it is 
understood that you received a telephone call and that is intimated on 
page 34 paragraph 96 of the bundle.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe – I am sorry.  Can I just interrupt you?  You – 
you have said that you shared the sentiments which drove nine 
10 
Members of the Board to resigning.  Do you know whether the three 
Members of the Board who did not resign also sh ared those sentiments 
or – or not? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Chair I would not know except for 
one because at that meeting that had been called by the majority of the 
Board Members to indicate that they intended to resign the only other 
Board Member who was present in that meeting of the three who 
remained behind was Ms Kwinana and I think she was like honest at the 
meeting that she shares those sentiments.  
However in her view given that she is so dependent on 
20 
Government contracts she feels uncomfortable about how it would be 
perceived if she actually resigned as well as part of the group.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that is what she said?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is what she said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the meeting? 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 202 of 218 
 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  At the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  Can you please 
provide details of the telephone call that you received shortly after the 
Board resigned? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  I think it was a day or two at most 
because I was now waiting to hear who would be the new Chair of the 
Board and I received a call from Ms  Myeni to say that she was going to 
be appointed as the Acting Chair.  So she was calling me to actually 
request a meeting – that we set up a meeting urgently so  that I can 
10 
bring her up to speed on – on the matters. 
So that is the call I received from Ms  Myeni and then that 
very evening on the news – because that is how I found out – on the 
news Mr Vuyisile Kona then gets announced as the – the new Chair of 
the Board and not Ms Myeni.  So that meeting that she requested then 
never took place because there was no need – I mean – for that to be 
the case. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  At that particular point in time how 
long had you been in – how long had you known Ms  Dudu Myeni? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA: 
 
Ms Myeni 
was 
one 
of 
the 
20 
Non-Executive Directors when I got appointed as CEO.  So from the 
first day that I joined SAA as Group CEO she was also a member of the 
Board. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So then it was over two  years? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes that is correct. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 203 of 218 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  What was your reaction when she 
called you to inform you that she was the one that was to be appointed 
as the Chair? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Well honestly I was a little bit 
surprised and the …  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Why? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  The reason why I was a little bit 
surprised is because she did not actually have a fantastic attendance 
record – you know – as a – as a Director and my assumption wou ld 
have been that of – first maybe for continuity indeed they would have 
10 
wanted maybe to choose one of the three but I was quite surprised that 
the one who has the worst attendance record is the one who then is 
going to be the Chair of the Board.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Just to help me ensure that I 
understand when you say she had the worse attendance record does it 
mean that she attended but did not stay or she did not attend?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  I think overall she was also one of 
those who sometimes did not turn up for the meeting at all.  If she did 
turn up for the meeting I do not know of too many occasions where she 
stayed for the full time of the Board Meeting.  She was always one of 
20 
those that found a way to excuse herself prior to the en d of the Board 
Meeting. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And who would she provide the 
excuse to – to be excused from the meeting?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Well she would speak to the Chair 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 204 of 218 
 
and she would speak to me – you know – I mean as Group CEO to say 
look I am sorry.  I mean I have to run but maybe Ms – you know – her 
main excuse was that she now has to rush because number one has 
called her to a meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  She has to rush because number 
one has called her to a meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh she used to say that?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To you? 
10 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what was your understanding of who she was 
talking about? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  I understood her to be speaking 
about the President at the time which obviously for me was aligned 
because she was the Chair of the Foundation.  So I assumed she was 
being called for that reason. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  But Mr Vusi – Vuyisile sorry – 
Vuyisile Kona is the one then who is announced to - as appointed as 
the new Chair? 
20 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Did you meet with Mr  Kona? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes I did. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  After his appointment? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  Yes I did Chair and just to indicate 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 205 of 218 
 
that I knew Mr Vuyisile Kona because Mr Vuyisile Kona had been an 
Executive at SAA as a VIP.  I cannot remember his exact title but a VIP 
at the time that I was at SAA previously as EVP of the two portfolios 
that I had – held before I left the CEO of SA Express.  
So he arrives and shortly after his appointment – which is the 
next day – essentially I then met with him and as an individual who I 
knew I then share with him as wel l my frustrations which are aligned to 
the frustrations that have been shared by the Board and I indicate to 
hm that it would really be useful for him to try and establish whether 
there would be proper support going forward because in the absence of 
10 
proper support going forward it would really be difficult even for myself 
to actually continue in that environment.  
So we had a very cordial – as I said we knew each other 
because he had been an Executive at SAA.  So we have this discussion 
and – and so forth and I share quite openly – I mean – with him to say 
look – you know - it really is challenging because I am faced with these 
issues where continuously I am actually been seen as if I am not toeing 
the line much like what I think that is the way in which the Board was 
perceived. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well was that not true? 
20 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  It was true.  I will – I will be 
honest that yes it is true that I was not toeing the line, okay.  So I 
share quite openly with Mr  Kona and he is very understanding an d he 
shares with me look Siza you know me and we will – let us try and work 
with each other and he has every intention to actually work well with 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 206 of 218 
 
me knowing and understanding my expertise and so forth.  So we part 
on – on that basis …  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  But my issue that I start to have is 
that within days of Mr Connor being appointed, in fact he had that 
discussion direct with me, he then says oh he would like to understand 
where we are in relation to the aircraft procurement processes.   
 
Now there’s nothing wrong with that, he is the Chair, it was 
approved, I can actually talk to him, you know in terms of where we 
are, absolutely nothing wrong. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Especially with big issues like that.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:   Indeed.  What did disturb me 
though is that he did make that comment at that meeting where he says 
he has been specifically asked to make sure that that’s one of the ones 
he looks at closely, no problems Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  He said he had specifically been asked? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Been asked to ensure that one of 
the first things that he reviews is where we are with this aircraft 
common process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay, okay. 
20 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    And as I indicated Chair that 
there’s nothing wrong, he is the new Chairperson, it’s a big 
procurement matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, he would need to have an idea of what’s urgent, 
what needs the Board’s attention, urgent attention and so on and so on, 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 207 of 218 
 
in terms of giving guidance w herever. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Ja, so that is the case, but then 
also what then also disturbs me is that he wants the actual 
documentation which goes back to even the work that the fleet 
committee undertook, not the recommendations, so I am comfo rtable if 
he’s asking me as the CEO to tell him what was the recommendation 
,what was it based on, and to share the type of information that would 
have been shared with the Board in order to reach the decision that 
was taken by the Board, but it makes me u ncomfortable that he seems 
to want a little bit more information than what ordinarily a Chairperson 
10 
would request and I indicate my level of discomfort and as a result 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  You indicated that to him 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Yes I indicated my level of 
discomfort. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, this was still at your first meeting with him or 
subsequently. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    It would be probably the very 
next day because the first day we were just talking generally and he 
was happy,. I welcomed him into the environment.  The very, I mean 
20 
very short which was probably the next day this is what is happening 
because he wants to know you know about this aircraft procurement 
process and I indicate you know that look I am a littl e bit 
uncomfortable, I know what you’re saying but I share with but why 
would you want to actually get details in terms of documents and 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 208 of 218 
 
probably see documents that even have not requested because if I have 
satisfied myself that he proper processes were fo llowed that should be 
adequate in getting a level of comfort and I did not handle the I mean 
the documents that he requested. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By the way you said that the two of you knew each 
other before he was appointed as Chairperson?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Ja, okay, alright. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Because we had both been 
employed by SAA at some point together in the past.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    But then it doesn’t stop there, 
then ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  So you provided the information he wanted or you 
arranged for your team to provide it or not really?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    No I don’t arrange for my team 
to, but I give him an update. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You give him the information?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :   Yes I give him the update which I 
think is the correct update to provide him with but I don’t instruct my 
20 
team neither do I actually hand over any of the documents, but then I 
established that he then decides that he will be requesting all of this 
information that relates to tenders by calling executives directly which 
then becomes I mean hugely problematic for me because I’m like okay, 
now I even have the Chairperson behaving badly, it was one thing you 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 209 of 218 
 
now to let’s say push back, you know on some of the individuals from 
the ministry but how am I going to do that with the Chairperson who is 
also now beginning to request information that they shouldn’t be 
requesting and calling the executives directly, which is bad protocol, I 
am there and he should not be doing that and getting involved in 
operational issues. 
 
I do then decide this is not going to work because essentially 
as I had already indicated for me it was about waiting to see who i s 
going to bet appointed and what the value system would be going 
forward, so I prepared my resignation letter and I go to Mr Kona 
10 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  So hang on, soon after this incident where you hear 
that he is approaching your executives y ou decide that’s it, that’s 
enough. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    That’s correct Chair, because 
he’s not approaching them on asking what is the performance of S A 
Technical for argument’s sake he’s actually quite specific about 
requesting information tha t pertains to procurement, so this is what 
makes me very uncomfortable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Die the information that he was look for relate only to 
20 
the aircraft issue, I think was it a tender or what you were working on, 
or SAA was working on, or was it on vario us procurement issues or 
tenders 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    No the information that he 
requests is on various large tenders, the one that he raised 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 210 of 218 
 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, various large tenders. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    The one that he raises with me 
directly is the one that pertains to the aircraft purchase.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    But subsequent to that he is 
calling people in the technical area because that’s also where there is 
a big procurement and w anting to obtain information with regard to 
procurement processes there, with regard to fuel processes you know 
and so forth, so he’s calling people directly, I think he’s calling I mean 
10 
the cargo people I recall I mean as well, you know the GM of cargo he  
gets called, you know as well to ask about various issues that pertain 
to procurement so at that point I decide no now I don’t even have a 
defence mechanism from a  Board perspective to assist me in pushing 
back and I decide I am going to resign, but I di d not just hand in my 
resignation letter, I went and I met with Mr Kona and I did share with 
him that look I had a first meeting with yourself, I did share some of the 
concerns that I had and it was fortunate because you are behaving in a 
particular manner which I find I mean unacceptable and as a result of 
that I also feel that it is best that I terminate my services with you know 
20 
SAA.  He tries to persuade me, he says no, no, no, you know I mean 
it’s a little bit unfortunate maybe you misunderstood and so  forth but 
please don’t make this decision.  I said no I have already made the 
decision unfortunately, I mean thought hard and long on this decision, 
so this is it, I am actually handing in my resignation and in my 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 211 of 218 
 
resignation I was obligated to serve a th ree months notice and I 
indicate to him that this is what I am obligated to do which is to serve a 
three months’ notice but I will be guided by him on how long they would 
want me to stay but if they would be in a position to release me earlier 
I would be more than comfortable to do that. 
 
I then received a call on that same day from Advocate Lindi 
Thomas who request an urgent meeting with me that same evening, and 
I accept ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Was she a board member at the time or was she 
previous board member? 
10 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :   She was still a board member, 
one of the three. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One of the three who had remained, okay.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Indeed.  So I agreed to meet with 
her and I go and meet with her at Chamb ers actually and while I’m 
there, you know she wants to try and understand why have I decided to 
actually resign and most importantly why am I resigning with immediate 
effect, which catches me by surprise, because I then say look I don’t 
understand because I never said I am resigning with immediate effect.  
In my letter it’s very clear that I have a three months notice but if I 
20 
could be released earlier of course I would be grateful, I mean for that, 
but I definitely did not resign with immediate effect.   
 
She then says well that’s very surprising and she actually even 
shows me a round robin resolution which has been sent to her by the 
Company Secretary, I am going to assume, but this to appoint Mr Kona 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 212 of 218 
 
as the Executive Chair and which they want the remaini ng board 
members to approve and the motivation for him being appointed as 
Executive Chair is because I have resigned with immediate effect 
according to the communication or the resolution.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Executive Chair would be what in this context, there 
is a Chair of the Board, there is a CEO, a Group CEO, so Executive 
Chair would in where? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    So there isn’t a position, or 
wasn’t a position called Executive Chair but essentially what he was 
trying to communicate that with the CEO, the Group CEO resigning with 
10 
immediate effect somebody needs to step up and also manage the 
Executive functions of the organisation, so his recommendations that 
he be the individual who is the Chairperson but is Executive Chair 
because it then allows him the room to also basically run the 
operations, run the organisation in an executive capacity.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But the – I take it that that person, Mr Kona was a 
member of the Board? 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in the structure of SAA was there a position 
called Executive Chair?  
20 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :  There wasn’t a position called 
Executive Chair, Chair but essentially maybe let me put it differently 
you know without actually putting a title to it, but what Mr Kona is 
requesting is that he be given permission to also assume executive 
powers. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 213 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which would be CEO powers?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :   To also assume executive powers 
which would be CEO powers because the CEO has decided to resign 
with immediate effect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so he would be – he would remain Chair of the 
Board but also effectively be CEO.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Combine the two. 
10 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:    That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you would be called Executive Chair?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    So maybe I mean for me what is 
incorrect is to use the ter m Executive Chair but I am trying to describe 
that it is a Chairperson who takes ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  The actual function yes, ja.  It was he wanted to be to 
perform the duties of a non-executive Chair as well as those of the 
Group CEO together. 
20 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Just on the point of your resignation 
can I ask you to turn page 205 please.  Is that your letter of 
resignation? 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 214 of 218 
 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    That’s my subsequent letter of 
resignation which then talks to with immediate effect, but this is not my 
original resignation letter. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you. 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Because after the conversation 
with Advocate Thomas where it’s clear that the Chair wants to assume 
executive powers I then drafted this second letter to indicate that now 
that he has decided to assume and request the rest of the Board to 
approve him also taking over executive powers then indeed I would 
want to actually exit the system with immediate effect.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So strictly speaking this is not your resignation letter 
but it’s a letter in which you state your position after certain 
developments, since you handed in your resignation?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA:    That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And then through you Chair that 
concludes the main focus of the evidence of this witness.  However at 
page 36 of the bundle through the position that this witness holds as 
interim Chief Executive Officer of South African Express she is able to 
share with this Commission an update on the Northwest Ground 
20 
Handling and EML transactions that this Commission has been hearing 
about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, let’s do that, let’s cover that.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    I think Chair the only thing that I 
can share with regard to these two issues is that at S A Express there 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 215 of 218 
 
is a relatively new board, I made mention that I became interim CEO of 
S A Express in August of last year, post the grounding of S A Express in 
May, so S A Express gets granted on the 24 t h of May 2018 an this is a 
day after the new board has been appointed, and so for the first part or 
the first few months of their tenure as the new board it was really just 
focused on making sure that we get the airline back into the skies, 
which is how I originally as well, as part of a task team to assist with 
that.  
 
Once that had been done it really has – and part of the work 
that was being done was obviously to look at issues relate d to 
10 
governance and governance breakdowns, one of which related to even 
issues relating to commercial agreements or un -commercial agreements 
in terms of the airline.  This is where the Board’s attention was brought 
in relation to some of the work that had already been undertaken at 
that point relating to North West, the North West grounding agreement 
and the EML.  In fat my knowledge by the time this new Board takes 
over there was already one case that’s lodged against Mr Brian van 
Wyk in relation, by S A Express in relation to the North West matter, but 
this Board ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, when you say there was at least one case 
20 
lodged 
by 
SAA 
against 
Mr 
van 
Wyk 
what 
does 
that 
mean 
...(intervention)  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    S A Express. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...what kind of case and where was it lodged?  
Criminal case, disciplinary case or what?  
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 216 of 218 
 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    No Chair in relation to Brian van 
Wyk I believe that the case had already, a case had been opened with 
the commercial crimes unit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, a criminal case ja?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Yes a criminal case with regard 
to Mr Brian van Wyk you know only.  There were other individuals that 
were on suspension as well in relation to the North West matter an d 
also in relation to the EML matter, so the Board undertook to complete 
the investigation that was necessary to conclude on these matters, but 
I just want to be clear that the focus being on ensuring that action is 
10 
taken against those individuals that wer e directly linked were either 
employed by S A Express or with former employees of S A Express, and 
not beyond that, because as we all know right now that especially when 
it pertains to North West that it actually goes beyond even S A Express 
in its nature.   
 
That work at this stage has been completed, the people who 
were on suspension have subsequently been terminated or some of 
them opted to resign at the point at which they were under suspension 
but over and above that with some of the further work that has been 
done there have been further cases opened against those former 
20 
employees as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And then lastly it’s been brought to 
my attention that Vuyiselo Kona is spelt incorrectly at paragraph 96 on 
page 34, I just wish to place this on record, but those are certainly the 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 217 of 218 
 
questions from the legal team for this witness.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, that’s fine.  I see you haven’t talked in terms of 
names other than Mr van Wyk, it might be helpful if subsequently 
maybe a supplementary (indistinct) can be sent through and they would 
assist, it just talks about names, this is what has happened and these 
are the employees of S A Express who have – who were suspended and 
when did they resign those who resigned and if there were  disciplinary 
hearings this is what happened in regard to the disciplinary hearings so 
that the Commission has a complete picture.  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    I’m very happy to provide that 
10 
Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright, the legal team will be in touch with you 
for purposes of that supplementary affidavit.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, you are done? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, Ms Mzimela it has been a  long day, thank you 
very much for coming to share – to give evidence in the commission, 
we appreciate it.  Thank you very much, you are excused.  
20 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Well I wanted to say – you look like you 
might be wanting to say something?  
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It’s just a sign of relief. 
26 JUNE 2019 – DAY 121 
 
Page 218 of 218 
 
MS SIZAKELE PETUNIA MZIMELA :    Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, alright, thank you, you are excused.  Yes, 
we can adjourn now and tomorrow we start at ten. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  We will adjourn then for today and tomorrow we 
will start at ten.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 27 JUNE 2019
