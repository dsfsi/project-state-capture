Page 7 of 218 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  He is simply placing his version Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He just wants to place. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  His version. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  He is not asking to lead evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He is not – yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  He is not even asking to cross-examine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  In regard to Mr – or Brigadier Thabo Ramela 
10 
who applied for leave to simply place his version before the commission 
the order I make – the decision I make is that his affidavit is admitted 
and should the Chairperson or the commission’s legal team consider it 
necessary to have him called to give evidence he will be called. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  As Chair pleases.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then I have the application of Lieutenant General 
Yolisa Matakata.. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who seeks leave to give evidence. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But not to cross-examine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No to cross-examine.  That is correct 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At least provisionally he says. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes Chair. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 8 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  She wants to be given a chance to reconsider her 
election at a later stage. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And she is – she seeks to give evidence in regard to 
General Johan Booysens’ evidence. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  And she also sought 
condonation Chair for the late filing of her affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I think I am going to postpone this one. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because it is not very clear to me that there is any 
10 
material – serious material dispute. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of – of fact in their versions.  But I may have missed 
something. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  In fact Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I was under the impression that I had asked 
somebody to read it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – before we could deal with it but I am – I am not 
sure. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is your recollection? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair – Chair my recollection – we – in 
respect of this one we are going to apply for that order Chair – for the 
reasons that General Matakata Chair would recall she makes reference 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 9 of 218 
 
to a particular affidavit that was given to her by General Booysen but 
that affidavit is not attached.  And for those reasons we were of the 
view that you did not have all the information and would have asked – 
we were going to ask that you – this one be postponed.  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so this one will be postponed. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And –and sometime not later than end of this week I 
would like to have it back. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  To deal with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have it back so that one can look at the issues.  
10 
Maybe somebody in the legal team could. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Make short submissions on what should happen to it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  We will go so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  There is also an – an application by Ms Redi Tlhabi 
for leave to give evidence and to cross-examine the former President 
20 
Mr Jacob Zuma. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair just to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  For the record I have just – the secretariat 
is seated behind me.  That – that particular matter did not form part of 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 10 of 218 
 
the list of the matters that were furnished for decision today and for 
that reason I believe that she had notified the parties – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no, no, that is fine.  I am aware it was not – I 
am not going to give an outcome but I want to issue directions. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In this matter the former President did not file any 
affidavit to oppose the application but simply filed a notice to oppose.  
I do not see it here but I think I have seen – seen it.  The directions I 
am going to issue are as follows: 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   
1. If the former President Mr Jacob Zuma has anything to say in 
opposition to Ms Redi Tlhabi’s application for leave go give 
evidence and to cross-examine him he must deliver written 
submissions on or before Monday the 9 t h December and 
thereafter I will deal with the matter in a manner that I will decide 
after seeing whether he has filed written submissions and 
depending on the contents of the submissions.  So I think I am 
going to rephrase the direction so that… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair – it is clear. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
1. If the former President Mr Jacob Zuma wishes to say anything in 
opposition to Ms Redi Tlhabi’s application for leave to give 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 11 of 218 
 
evidence and to cross-examine him he must deliver written 
submissions to the secretary on or before Monday 9 December 
2019. 
2. Once or rather if no written submissions are delivered to the 
acting secretary of the commission on or before Monday the 9 t h, 
2019 the Chairperson will deal with the application in the manner 
he will deem appropriate including making a decision thereon. 
3. If the former President Mr Jacob Zuma does deliver within the 
timeframe indicated written submissions in opposition of Ms 
Tlhabi’s application the Chairperson will take account of the 
10 
written submissions and either announce the outcome thereof as 
soon as possible thereafter or invite Mr Tlhabi if necessary to 
respond to those written submissions in which case the matter 
will be decided at a later date. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  As Chair pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I would like you to make sure that the directions in 
regard to this matter of Ms Redi Tlhabi. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are sent out today. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair we will… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because – ja – ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  May we just approach you around teatime? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 12 of 218 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So that Chair would have [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is – that is fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  Chair may I then… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  If that is the end of the applications may 
we then be excused and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no before that I think I must just say. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That with regard to applications for leave to cross-
examine I just want to say because there will be representatives of 
parties who are in – in the hearing or there may be others watching or 
listening that it is possible that in all of them or in some of them I may 
direct that the implicated person who has applied for leave to cross-
examine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A witness should give evidence first. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And subject himself or herself to questioning by the 
20 
commission’s legal team before embarking on cross-examination. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if anyone of the persons who have been granted 
leave to cross-examine today has any objection or difficulty with such a 
procedure they must indicate that they have such an objection by no 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 13 of 218 
 
later than Friday next week.  In which case their objections would 
receive due consideration.  But if there are no objections it will be 
taken that they have no difficulty with that approach. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The approach simply would seek to make sure that as 
far as possible the legal team is and the Chairperson are aware of how 
wide the disputes of fact between the versions of the witness and the 
implicated persons are before the implicated person cross-examines 
the witness.  It is hoped that that could help shorten the cross-
examination if both the witness and the implicated person have given 
10 
evidence and subjected themselves to questioning. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By the legal team. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is not final but that is what is envisaged could 
happen in some of the applications or in all of them. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But anyone who may have difficulty must give notice 
as indicated. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  You are excused. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
ADV DANIEL WITZ:  Thank you Chair may I also be excused at this 
[indistinct]? 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 14 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you are excused. 
ADV DANIEL WITZ:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 Thank 
you. 
 
Will 
you 
manage 
without 
any 
adjournment? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I think we will Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We are pretty prepared. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Oliphant is going to be our first witness 
today. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  She is just getting herself set up at the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Witness table. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair if I may just in the interim deal with one 
or two procedural aspects? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Oliphant’s affidavit you will find in the file 
before… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one second. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Certainly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know whether it is the – something technical 
but you not as audible as you ought to be.  I do not know if it is the air 
conditioner also.  So let us continue I think they will – they will check 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 15 of 218 
 
what it is. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair our first witness today is Ms Oliphant.  
Her affidavit is contained in the file before you under the third tab.  
May I request that we enter it into the record as Exhibit NN3? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The – the affidavit of Ms Nelisiwe Mildred Oliphant 
will be admitted as NN3 together with the annexures attached to it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  If I may then request that Ms 
Oliphant be sworn in? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please administer the oath or affirmation? 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Mildred Nelisiwe Oliphant. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections to taking the prescribed 
oath? 
MS OLIPHANT:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
conscience? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the 
20 
truth; the whole truth and nothing but the truth; if so please raise your 
right hand and say, so help me God. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Nkosi Ngisize. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Ms Oliphant I heard that you said Nkosi 
Ngisize.   Are you going to give evidence in Isi-Zulu or in English? 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 16 of 218 
 
MS OLIPHANT:  I can – I can mix Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Oliphant just to orientate 
you.  In front of you should be a file containing your affidavit, have you 
located that? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  We will be focusing in the main on 
that affidavit today but we will also be dealing with another file which 
should be in front of you and on the spine it is marked NN5.  Do you 
10 
have that readily to hand? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes I do. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Ms Oliphant in advance of today 
towards the end of last week you were sent some of the documents to 
which I propose to make reference today from NN5.  Can you confirm 
receiving those documents? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes I did. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Ms Oliphant if you could then 
please go to Exhibit NN3 which contains your affidavit? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And can you confirm that this is an affidavit you 
provided to the commission?  If you go to page 9 it indicates that it was 
signed on the 7 October 2019, is that correct? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And why did you provide the affidavit to the 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 17 of 218 
 
commission? 
MS OLIPHANT:  It is because I received a letter from the Chairperson 
saying I must come and give the evidence on the matter. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I would like to pick it up at 
paragraph 3 on page 1 of Exhibit NN3.  Because there you start to give 
the background of your time in public service.  Can you please tell the 
Chair about that? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes.  I was elected as a member of the Legislature in 
1994 to 1999 and from 1999 I was elected as the member of the 
National Assembly up until 2004.  And from 2004 to 2009 I was elected 
10 
as a member in the National Council of Provinces.  And from 2009 up 
until 2014 I was a member of the National Assembly.  And while I was in 
the National Assembly in 2009 I was elected as – or I was appointed as 
the House Chair on International Relations up until the 1 November 
2010 when I was deployed as the Minster of Labour. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And for how long did you hold the position of 
Minister of Labour? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Since 2010 until 2019. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  I think in paragraph you say until 
May of 2019, is that correct? 
20 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes May 2019. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I would then like to move over the 
page to page 2 of Exhibit NN3 because at paragraph 4 there you start 
to recount your appointment as Minister of Labour. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 18 of 218 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There is one point of clarification I just need to 
ask you.  Your paragraph 4 there begins: 
“On Saturday 29 October 2010.” 
Do you see that? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I have gone back and looked at a diary from 
2010 and Saturday was actually the 30 October.  So can you just clarify 
for us is what occurred at paragraph 4, something that occurred on the 
Saturday in which case we would need to make a correction to the date 
to bear 30 October or was it something that happened on the preceding 
10 
Friday which would have been the 29 October? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Maybe we have to change the dates to the 30 October 
because I arrived on Saturday from China where there was a delegation 
of Parliament led by the speaker of Parliament then Mr Sisulu. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Chair if I may then make the 
suggestion that we simply change the date on paragraph 4 to be the 30 
October and then Ms Oliphant there would be a consequent change it 
seems to me also at paragraph 5. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because at paragraph 5 you talk about Sunday 
20 
and we would need to change that date to the 31 October. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you confirm that as correct? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  That is fine. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 19 of 218 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course we not change it on the thing but I am just 
making a note. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we can have a supplementary later. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Certainly.  We will attend to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But for the purposes of today’s evidence we 
can take it Ms Oliphant that the story about your appointment as 
Minister of Labour starts on the Saturday? 
10 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The 30 October.  Can you tell us what 
happened then and the following day? 
MS OLIPHANT:  On Sunday I was called by President Zuma to say as 
the President of the African National Congress saying the officials of 
the ANC have decided to deploy me as the Minister of Labour and then 
he said I must come on a Monday for swearing in.  After that I was 
phoned by Ms Lakela Kaunda to make the arrangements to come to 
Presidential Guesthouse - that was known as Presidential Guesthouse 
then. 
20 
So when I arrived on Monday morning I was picked up by the 
- by the office - I must say by the Office of the Presidency, because 
they were the ones who arranged all the logistics for travelling and 
then when I arrived at the guesthouse there were officials from the 
Presidency where I was asked to look at my name in the attendance 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 20 of 218 
 
register and then sign next to my name. 
That is what I did on that day and then I was taken to the hall 
where we were - we were going to be sworn in as Ministers. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I - I would like to go into some 
more detail about those events in a moment, but if I may just ask one 
or two things in background.  In advance of today’s evidence 
Ms Oliphant have you had an occasion to look at the transcript of or 
watch the evidence of Mr Manyi or Mr Maseko that has previously been 
received by the Commission? 
MS OLIPHANT:  No.  I have not seen their - their evidence. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and just in terms of background 
again can you assist us with your understanding of how heads of 
departments are appointed under the - in the Public Service?  What is 
your understanding of how that takes place? 
MS OLIPHANT:  My understanding is that when particularly the 
Director-General when is he going to be appointed.  There will be an 
advertisement and then - but that will happen in consultation with the 
Minister for Public Service and Administration.  I am raising that based 
on what I did when I was supposed to employ the Director-General - not 
to employ, because it is the President that employs, but the Minister of 
20 
that department will constitute the panel of Ministers that will interview 
those - those candidates and then after the interviews then we will 
recommend to the Minister for Public Service and Administration, 
because he is the custodian - he or she is the custodian of Public 
Service Act and then after that he - he will submit that proposal to the 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 21 of 218 
 
Cabinet and then the approval will be done by Cabinet based on the 
recommendations by the Minister for Public Service. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And the transfer of a DG how does that take 
place on your understanding? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Also in my understanding is that based on the 
delegated powers to the Minister for Public Service and Administration.  
He is the one who will be - he or she will be the one who will be 
responsible for that process. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And 2 February 2011 was a Wednesday of the 
week and it was - there was a Cabinet meeting on that day.  It was the 
10 
day on which the announcements of the transfers of Mr Maseko and 
Mr Manyi took place.  Do you recall that? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Even if I cannot say exactly say this is what has 
happened, but because it is the process I do believe so and also 
because the announcement was made by the Spokesperson of the 
Cabinet.  Of course that issue should be decided by Cabinet on that 
particular day. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you recall whether you were actually in 
attendance at that meeting?  The Wednesday, 2 February 2011. 
MS OLIPHANT:  I cannot exactly recall that.  That is why I said it is 
20 
either I was there or not and the only way that I can find out if the 
Commission can request the attendance of the - the Cabinet Members 
… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS OLIPHANT:  From the Cabinet Secretariat.  That is when it will 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 22 of 218 
 
prove whether I was there or not, because it is - it was happen - it 
happened in 2010 and it is a long time ago. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well in 2011. 
MS OLIPHANT:  I mean in 2011. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Now I fully understand that, but for the 
purposes of today’s evidence.  Can I take it that you do not have a 
clear recollection of being present at that meeting? 
MS OLIPHANT:  For now I really do not recollect that. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  We spoke a moment ago about 
transfers of DGs.  Do you understand - what - what is your 
understanding of any other requirements for a transfer of a DG?  Are 
you aware of any other requirements that have to be met? 
MS OLIPHANT:  As I have said the - the person who should be 
responsible is the Minister for Public Service and Administration and 
that Minister can be able to give you the details on how the processes 
are done, because he or she is the one who leads that process. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what if the particular Director-General is 
moving from a particular department to another department.  Does the 
20 
Minister of either of those departments play a role in the transfer on 
your understanding? 
MS OLIPHANT:  It - it depends, because the Minister for Public Service 
and Administration particularly if that Minister has requested for the 
transfer of that particular person and also probably the receiving 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 23 of 218 
 
Minister they will - the Minister for Public Service will be able to say 
what is it that has happened and what were the reasons for that.  He is 
the one who can outline the details of that particular process. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Certainly.  We understand that.  We thankfully 
have Mr Baloyi who was the former Minister holding that position also 
giving evidence today.  So we will ask about that process in due 
course.  What we will come to in your evidence is your particular 
involvement insofar as the transfer of Mr Manyi is concerned, because 
he was - that was a transfer from your ministry to the Government 
Communication and Information Service.  You are aware of that are 
10 
you? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes.  I was the Minister then who was just appointed, 
but when I arrived in the department Mr Manyi was not there.  I found 
the Acting Director-General which was Minister Sam Morotoba and then 
I was not even aware during the briefings by the department that the - 
the DG was dismissed.  When I was trying to approach - when I was 
thinking of approaching the Director-General of - in the Cabinet then I 
received a call from Mr Jimmy Manyi, because I just received a call 
from a number. 
So I asked who this is and he said he is Jimmy Manyi and he 
20 
said he is intending to appeal or taking the Department of Labour to 
court and then I asked what the reasons are for that.  He said it is 
because he was dismissed unfairly and then I said well unfortunately I 
am still new in the department.  I am still getting briefing - briefings by 
the senior officials. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 24 of 218 
 
Can he wait up until I - I get the full briefing, because in that 
particular time Parliament was also dealing with the MTEB - I think - S 
no R.  It is Mid-Term Budget Review - Estimate Budget Review.  So I 
had to get that briefing, because I was supposed at a later stage to 
respond to those issues in Parliament and immediately after getting 
that call I approached for Minister Baloyi to say I have received this 
call and I am new in the department particularly when it comes to the 
Minister. 
Can he assist me on the matter?  Since he is the Minister for 
Public Service and Administration and I - I did that informally, because 
10 
we were just having - we part of the meeting of the Cabinet.  So I 
informally asked him if he can look at the matter and he said he was 
going to look at the matter and then after getting the briefings from the 
officials. 
Then at a later stage I decided after having the discussions 
with Minister Baloyi.  He advised that probably I may get some 
information from Mr Manyi.  That is when I called him to say can we 
have a meeting.  So that I can have a full understanding on what 
exactly has happened.  We had a meeting and then he said he was 
dismissed unfairly and he briefly said these are the reasons for that, 
20 
but even … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Oliphant … 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I am - I am so sorry to interrupt you.  Do you 
mind if I - I would like to take this a little bit slower if I may? 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 25 of 218 
 
MS OLIPHANT:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because there are aspects of the evidence that 
we have already received from Mr Manyi. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That occurs in the timeline that you are 
describing.  So if I may just ask we were in … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe - maybe before you do that … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr.  Ms Oliphant you referred to - when you 
referred to Minister a few seconds ago with your hands you seemed to 
10 
put that in quotation marks.  I just want that to be on record.  Do you 
want to explain that so that we know exactly why you are saying that or 
are you simply referring to doing that because he was Minister then, 
but is not Minister now? 
MS OLIPHANT:  I was referring to him as the - that is what I believe. 
Yes but, because he was no longer the Minister and he was now the 
Ambassador.  Maybe I have to refer to him now as an Ambassador, but 
then he was the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - you are referring to? 
MS OLIPHANT:  To Minister Baloyi. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No.  No.  I just wanted to make sure, because 
when you do that with your hands that does not go into the record.  
That does not and yet you maybe attaching a certain meaning to it. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 26 of 218 
 
MS OLIPHANT:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that - that is reason.  So - so he - he was Minister 
at a certain time.  Then later he became Ambassador … 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you just wanted to clarify that? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Maybe I must withdraw that what I was - I was doing 
with my hands. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  As long as we understand. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes.  He was the Minister then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  No that is fine. 
10 
MS OLIPHANT:  For Public Service and Administration. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  I would like to just take you 
back in time … 
MS OLIPHANT:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Oliphant, because your evidence as I have 
it thus far was.  You were contacted on the Sunday 31 October by 
former President Zuma and you notified about your deployment as 
Minister of Labour. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then your evidence moved to the travel 
arrangements that were made.  I understand you to say that happened 
on the Monday 1 November … 
MS OLIPHANT:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  2010.  Is that correct? 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 27 of 218 
 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that is where I need to pick it up, because 
we have had evidence in the Commission from Mr Manyi that he in fact 
met you at the airport when you touched down in Johannesburg on 
1 November 2010.  Do you recall that? 
MS OLIPHANT:  No.  I did not meet with him.  I did not - I did not meet 
with Mr Manyi at the airport. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So when he said he met with you at the airport 
and he had a conversation with you at the airport and he was waiting 
around for you.  Do you say that that was false? 
10 
MS OLIPHANT:  No.  I - yes.  I can say it is false, because I did not 
meet with him at the airport. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was a reference to him congratulating you.  I 
just cannot remember whether he said he did that - excuse me.  
Whether he said he did that at that - when ye met you at the airport or 
whether he said he did that on a - in a telephone conversation.  Do you 
have any recollection about … 
MS OLIPHANT:  If … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe him doing that in a telephone conversation? 
MS OLIPHANT:  If I recall Chair he - he congratulated me when he was 
20 
saying to me he is intending to appeal or to take us to court in terms of 
his dismissal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that was on the Monday or much later? 
MS OLIPHANT:  No.  It was not on a Monday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 28 of 218 
 
MS OLIPHANT:  I think it was - it is either two or three weeks after the 
appointment.  He only person who phoned me when I was just arriving 
at the airport was the Acting DG Mr Sam Morotoba who congratulated 
me and also indicated that if I need any help particularly about the 
transport I must just call him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Oliphant that call that you received from 
Mr Manyi you deal with in your affidavit and I will not take you there 
10 
immediately, but certainly your affidavit’s chronology suggests it was 
about two or three weeks later. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that your recollection? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because there is a letter which you were sent 
at the end of last week which I will take you to now.  It is a letter that 
was written by Mr Manyi’s attorneys on 3 November and it was sent to 
yourself and to Mr Baloyi and that letter refers to the fact that Mr Manyi 
had already met with you by 3 November. 
20 
Now 3 November was a few days later.  It would have been 
the Wednesday of the week that you came up on the Monday and you 
went to the Presidential Guesthouse to be sworn in.  Was that also 
false? 
MS OLIPHANT:  I think they - they - it is either he - he misled his 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 29 of 218 
 
attorneys, because I did not meet with him, because after swearing in I 
went back to KwaZulu-Natal.  I have seen that letter from his attorneys 
and also is that Minister Baloyi received that letter.  While I was getting 
the briefing in the department firstly I did not immediately deal with the 
correspondence, because I said they must take me through on all 
things that are being happening in the department. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you ever come to see this letter? 
MS OLIPHANT:  It was for the first time for me to see it in this 
evidence. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let us go there if we may?  Chair it is - and 
10 
Ms Oliphant it is in EXHIBIT NN5 and you will find it at page 2-9-7. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the letter dated 3 November 2010 from Lana 
Attorneys? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Addressed to the Honourable Ms Mildred Oliphant 
Minister of Labour as well as Honourable Mr Richard Baloyi Minister of 
Public Service.  That is the letter? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Oliphant is it your evidence that until you 
20 
received this last week from the Commission you have no recollection 
of receiving this letter? 
MS OLIPHANT:  I received this - this copy yesterday. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yesterday? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 30 of 218 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you do not recall seeing it in 2010? 
MS OLIPHANT:  No.  I do not recall seeing it in 2010. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If I can just direct you to where this point is 
made … 
MS OLIPHANT:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In the letter.  You will find it at page 3-0-1.  It 
is the last page of the letter. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR: 
 
You 
will 
see 
there 
is 
a 
heading 
“Reinstatement”. 
10 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you see that? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The lawyers for Mr Manyi record there: 
“Mr Manyi has advised us that he met with the new 
Minister 
of 
Labour 
and 
they 
had 
a 
cordial 
interaction and Mr Manyi is excited at the prospect 
of working under the guidance and instruction of 
Minister Oliphant.” 
MS OLIPHANT:  As I have said it is either Mr Manyi misled his 
20 
attorneys, because I did not … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You had had no interaction? 
MS OLIPHANT:  I did not meet Mr Manyi on the 3 r d. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is …? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Or - or prior to the 3 r d? 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 31 of 218 
 
MS OLIPHANT:  Or prior to the 3 r d. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because his evidence was on the Monday when 
you flew up to O R Tambo he met you at the airport.  You say that is 
false? 
MS OLIPHANT:  No.  I did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it is - it is a long time ago.  Just make sure you - 
your recollection is fine. 
MS OLIPHANT:  My recollection is that I met Mr Manyi after having 
discussions with Minister Baloyi and we met at Sheraton where I was 
booked for accommodation. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But is - is your recollection so clear that you - you 
are certain it did not happen or is there a room that it might have 
happened?  I am just thinking - wondering whether he might have - you 
know this letter was written it would appear on 3 November.  He would 
have met you - would it have been the previous day if - if that had 
happened - on Sunday?  You arrived on Sunday or …? 
MS OLIPHANT:  I arrived on Monday morning at the airport. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was the 3 r d Monday? 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No, the - the … 
MS OLIPHANT:  It was no the 1 s t. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Flight up was the 1 s t.  Monday. 
MS OLIPHANT:  (Intervenes) was on the 1 s t. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 32 of 218 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  1 November. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is when Mr Manyi’s evidence indicated he 
met with Ms Oliphant … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  At the airport. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  This letter dated 3 November … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Two days later. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is two days letter the Wednesday of that week. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  The reason why I am just asking that you 
try and make sure that you - you are certain whether you are saying no 
such encounter happened at all or you say it may have occurred.  It is 
simply that maybe it might be difficult to think why he would make that 
story up that he met you at the airport and two, the letter is written two 
days after. 
So maybe his memory would have been much fresher when he 
spoke to his attorneys, but I just wants to make sure that you - you are 
able to say maybe it did happen.  I cannot remember because it has 
been a long time or you say no, no, no.  I know it did not happen.  If 
20 
that is the position. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Thank you Chair.  Chair, I - I do not really remember 
meeting him on that day, because when I arrived we find people with 
the boards with our names and we just whisked to the cars.  So I do not 
know when I can meet Mr Manyi that particular period.  If I recall very 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 33 of 218 
 
well I did not meet with him, but may … 
CHAIRPERSON:  He might not have - he not be talking about a formal 
meeting.  He might be talking about seeing you coming through and 
then going to you.  Greeting you, shaking hands and walking with you 
and talking a bit while you are on your way to your transport or 
whatever. 
MS OLIPHANT:  I do not recollect that Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MS OLIPHANT:  I do not recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - you do not recall? 
10 
MS OLIPHANT:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Oliphant is your evidence that the first time 
you spoke to Mr Manyi after becoming Minister of Labour when he 
called you? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes.  That - that is what I recall, because that is when 
he told me about intending to take us to court based on his dismissals. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Was there any debate in your mind when you 
had that conversation with him that he understood that he had been 
dismissed as the DG of Labour? 
20 
MS OLIPHANT:  That is what he said to me and that is why he was 
intending to take us to court or make an appeal. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And your evidence as I understand it is that 
that occurred about two to three weeks … 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 34 of 218 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  After you became Minister.  Is that correct? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You became Minister and replaced former 
Minister Mdladlana.  Is that correct? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  do you …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just - just before you … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr.  That discussion that you have given 
evidence about between yourself and Mr Manyi about two/three weeks 
10 
after your appointment.  I think you said first it was in a telephone 
conversation.  He called you and then later there was a meeting at the 
Sheraton Hotel.  Is that correct? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now you - you have said that he said he had been 
dismissed and he was going to take the department to court or - or was 
there some - somewhere else also there which he talked about?  Was 
going to take you to court or where? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   
MS OLIPHANT:  He said it is either he was going to make an appeal or 
20 
take … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes. 
MS OLIPHANT:  The department to court. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes and that is why I immediately after that discussed 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 35 of 218 
 
the matter with Minister Baloyi … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS OLIPHANT:  To advise me on the matter, because I was just new in 
the department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Mr - Mr Manyi gave evidence and said that he 
did not know that he had been dismissed.  I think until he got 
correspondence from the Commission? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in other words until this year.  Are - are you - are 
you certain that that is what he said to you?  That he had been 
10 
dismissed unfairly.  I think that is what you said earlier on.  That he 
said he had been dismissed unfairly and that he was going to take the 
department either to court or he was going to appeal.  Are you certain 
that that is what he said? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes Chairperson.  That is what he said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS OLIPHANT:  And then also after that I asked the Acting DG … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS OLIPHANT:  To tell me what exactly has happened … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MS OLIPHANT:  And he said the best people to - to brief me … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Was the Legal Services Team … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS OLIPHANT:  From the department … 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 36 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS OLIPHANT:  And he said he - he was going to arrange a meeting … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS OLIPHANT:  For me with the Legal Services Team … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS OLIPHANT:  And I met with the Legal Services Team three - two or 
three days after … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Meeting with the Acting DG then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MS OLIPHANT:  And the - the Legal Services Team was led by 
Advocate Baja (?)- Pascha (?). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Who was the - who was the - the Head of the Legal 
Services … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS OLIPHANT:  But there was also the - I think it was also 
Advocate Tokota who was part of - he was a legal counsel … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS OLIPHANT:  And - and then they briefed me on what has happened, 
20 
but also they did not give me the full briefing.  That is why I had to go 
back to Minister Baloyi as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think Mr Tokota was senior counsel already.  So … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is - it is likely that Mr Pascha led the Legal Team. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 37 of 218 
 
MS OLIPHANT:  Mr Pascha was leading the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but … 
MS OLIPHANT:  The Legal Team based on … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS OLIPHANT:  The - the legal services of the department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  No.  No.  That is fine.  I know you are not a 
lawyer.  So I am just mentioning. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  At least that was your understanding of the 
situation? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  You - you may proceed Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  If I can just go backwards a 
bit to Minister Mdladlana and your replacement of him.  Were you given 
any explanation for why he was removed as Minister of Labour and you 
were to replace him? 
MS OLIPHANT:  No.  It was not my call, because my understanding is 
that it is the ANC that deploys and redeploys.  So I was under that 
20 
principle in terms of understanding. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  Just to be clear though.  Did anyone 
ever tell you - give you a reason why he might have removed as 
Minister … 
MS OLIPHANT:  No. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 38 of 218 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of Labour? 
MS OLIPHANT:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Oliphant I - I understand your evidence to 
be that letter dated 3 November 2010 did not come to you at the time 
and you saw it for the first time when you were given it by the 
Commission. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that correct? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes.  It is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There is another recordal in that letter … 
10 
MS OLIPHANT:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  About Mr Manyi’s understanding of why Mr - 
Minister Mdladlana was removed.  You will find that at page 2-9-9 in 
EXHIBIT NN5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did say why Mr - Minister Mdladlana was removed? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes and replaced by … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Oh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Minister Oliphant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No.  I thought you - it - I thought it was a 
mistake. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are linking it to … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  A reference to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  A dismissal of Mr Manyi? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 39 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We are now at - what I would like to understand 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  What - what page did you say? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  2-9-9 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is the same letter we were looking at 
previously and Ms Oliphant just to be clear.  I am - I am probing now 
what if anything you knew about the reasons for Mr Mdladlana being 
removed as Minister of Labour and I understand your evidence to be 
10 
you were not given a reason at the time. 
MS OLIPHANT:  No.  I did not know anything about that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There is a recordal here that I would just like 
your comment on then as to whether you have any knowledge about it 
at all.  You will see in paragraph 5.1 on page 2-9-9 what the lawyers for 
Mr Manyi there record is that - let me read it for the record: 
“Honourable Ministers, on 28 October 2010 …” 
Being the date of the hearing.  Ms Oliphant that is a 
reference to the disciplinary hearing that Mr Manyi was involved at the 
time.  Just for context.  The letter goes on and reads. 
20 
“The former Minister instructed the Department’s 
lawyers and the State Attorney to withdraw and 
abandon the charges against the DG as he had 
decided to terminate Mr Manyi’s employment with 
the department with effect from 30 November 2010.” 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 40 of 218 
 
And then it goes on – and this is the relevant sentence: 
“Simply put the former Minister should have known that he 
was going to be axed as there was no other plausible reason 
for find in his favour for uncharacteristically withdrawing and 
abandoning charges against the DG only to accelerate his 
premature determination of the probation period which was 
only due for review 44 days later.” 
Do you see that? 
MS OLIPHANT:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Did Mr Manyi every discuss with you that he 
10 
thought Minister Mdladlana had been axed because of his conduct in 
firing Mr Manyi? 
MS OLIPHANT:   No we did not discuss that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Would it be unusual to you to learn that a 
Minister would be removed because he had taken a decision to remove 
a DG? 
MS OLIPHANT:   No I do not know that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   But your understanding I have from your 
evidence previously is that the ANC as an organisation makes decisions 
about deployments of Ministers, is that correct? 
20 
MS OLIPHANT:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Have you known the ANC ever to take a 
decision to remove a Minister and replace him because of the decision 
the former Minister took to fire a DG? 
MS OLIPHANT:   That is the responsibility of the President. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 41 of 218 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you. 
MS OLIPHANT:   To discuss that matter with the ANC officials, because 
he is also the ANC official. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.   Ms Oliphant let’s then move to 
the place that you were when the Chair was asking you questions, 
because that was when you started finding out what had happened with 
Mr Manyi when he was in the Department.  So can we just go back to 
get the chronology right.    You first get a call from Mr Manyi, is that 
correct, and that is two or three weeks after you have taken up the 
position of Minister of Labour? 
10 
MS OLIPHANT:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Until that point who is occupying the position 
of Director General? 
MS OLIPHANT:   It was the Acting DG Mr Sam Morotoba. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And then please tell us what you did after you 
received that call from Mr Manyi. 
MS OLIPHANT:   I asked Mr Sam Morotoba to brief me on the letter, as 
the Acting DG, and he said the best people to give me the briefing is 
the Legal Service Team from the Department. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you, and then I understand we can pick 
20 
it up in your affidavit at page 4, paragraph 11, you say at the end of 
that paragraph 11 you say at the end of that paragraph precisely what 
you have indicated in the evidence, you called Mr Morotoba, and he 
said he would arrange a meeting with the Department’s Legal Services 
who were familiar with the issues. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 42 of 218 
 
MS OLIPHANT:   Hmm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And then you go on at paragraph 12 to indicate 
that two or three days later you met with that Legal Services Team, 
correct?   
MS OLIPHANT:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And just to go back for us if you will and tell 
us what was conveyed to you at that meeting? 
MS OLIPHANT:   In that meeting they did not – the Legal Team did not 
give me the full information, except that they said Mr Manyi was 
dismissed, and one of the reasons was that he didn’t respect the 
10 
Minister. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And at that point did you ask to see any files 
relating to Mr Manyi, did you ask for a disciplinary file to be provided to 
you? 
MS OLIPHANT:   Advocate Pascha said all the files are with the 
Department for Public Service and Administration. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Did you have occasion to obtain those files at 
any point? 
MS OLIPHANT:   No I did not precisely because when he was saying he 
is intending to appeal or go to court, of course he was not going to 
20 
appeal to the Minister of Labour then because he was dismissed by the 
Minister of Labour so he had to appeal, his appeal was supposed to go 
to the Public Service and Administration. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   How do you come to that view, that the appeal 
had to go to the Department of Public Service and Administration? 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 43 of 218 
 
MS OLIPHANT:   It is because you cannot appeal to the very same 
Department that has dismissed you and the Public Service and 
Administration they do have Public Service Commission, ja that was my 
view and that is why I had to approach Minister Baloyi on the matter. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.   In your course of dealing with Mr 
Manyi and receiving this information from the Legal Services 
Department did you ever have occasion to consider the charges that Mr 
Manyi faced in his disciplinary proceedings? 
MS OLIPHANT:   No I did not because Mr Manyi – when we met with Mr 
Manyi at Sheraton he brought three big files and I said no since he 
10 
wants to appeal the only way that he has to do is to appeal to the 
Minister for Public Service and Administration and because I had the 
information on how the processes are done, then I further requested 
Minister Baloyi to say can you look at the procedures whether they 
were done properly or not, because he is the custodian of Public 
Services Act. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.   So just to be clear, you did not 
ever obtain his disciplinary file and look at it yourself? 
MS OLIPHANT:   No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   You did not ever obtain information about the 
20 
charges that he faced, correct? 
MS OLIPHANT:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And you didn’t obtain information about his 
responses to those charges correct? 
MS OLIPHANT:   No. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 44 of 218 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No you didn’t obtain information of his 
responses? 
MS OLIPHANT:   Yes because when I  met with him he indicated that 
there are issues that he is concerned with, particularly because, one, in 
terms of any decision that he was supposed to take the approval was 
done through submissions and then that’s why he was saying he was 
going to take us to court or appeal the decision because everybody was 
involved in that and I said therefore if he appeals then they have to 
deal with all those issues through the Minister for Public Service and 
Administration. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And when he brought the three files to your 
meeting you did not take them from him? 
MS OLIPHANT:   No I did not take any file from him. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.   I would then like to move a little 
bit further on in the chronology, because there was a letter that Mr 
Baloyi wrote to you at the end of November 2010, it is a letter that you 
have also been provided by the Commission, you will find it in EXHIBIT 
NN5 at page 216. 
MS OLIPHANT:   Yes I see the letter. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Do you recall receiving this letter in November 
20 
of 2010? 
MS OLIPHANT:   Even if I can’t recall but what I can recall is that I 
discussed the matter informally as well, I think we were in the National 
Assembly with Minister Baloyi before the letter came, because he told 
me that he has written a letter but I said there is no letter that I have 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 45 of 218 
 
received and then he briefed me that well based on what I briefed him 
about and also to look at whether the procedures were followed 
properly then he has decided and also he wants to advise me that I 
must write a letter for withdrawal and then put him on a special leave 
and that’s what I did, but I did that after also further discussion those 
issues with the Legal Team of the Department. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Right so let’s just go to this letter itself if we 
may, you say you are not certain that you received this letter is that 
correct? 
MS OLIPHANT:   Probably I may receive it but I think I received it, it is 
10 
either at a later stage not before we further discussed the matter 
because Minister Baloyi told me in the National Assembly before it rises 
that, one, he has written a letter, of which I said I have not yet received 
the letter, but he briefed me on what is it that we have to do in terms of 
the procedures, so that is why at a later stage I wrote that letter that 
was withdrawing the dismissal and the I said I am putting Mr Manyi on 
a special leave until further notice. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Well let us look at what is contained as Mr 
Baloyi’s advice in this letter, you will find that in the concluding, well 
the penultimate paragraph on page 217.    
20 
MS OLIPHANT:   Hmm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And page 217 in paragraph 3 he says: 
“In light of my observations in paragraph 2 above you are 
advised to ...” 
And then there are four things set out there.  Ms Oliphant did you have 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 46 of 218 
 
occasion to read this letter when you received it from the Commission? 
MS OLIPHANT:   Yes I did. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   What did you understand the advice to be that 
was reflected in the previous paragraphs of the letter? 
MS OLIPHANT:   Firstly was to give enough time for Minister Baloyi to 
look whether the matter was done procedurally and secondly to give 
him enough time to deal and finalise the matter, so that’s why as well 
because if you look at C under paragraph 3 it says I must place him on 
two weeks special leave to allow us space to find a suitable solution to 
this matter.  I decided not to give him only two weeks based on my 
10 
experience as a shop steward, as a former shop steward because when 
you deal with the cases when it comes to disciplinary hearings in the 
work place it does not take two weeks, so I decided to say this is 
special leave until further notice. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Let’s just go back a moment because my 
question might not have been entirely clear and I apologise for that, 
what – in paragraph 2 of the letter which starts on the previous page.  
Minister Baloyi sets out there certain observations that he makes, as I 
understand your evidence because he has been looking into this for 
you, is that correct? 
20 
MS OLIPHANT:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And what did you understand him to have 
determined in relation to the dismissal of Mr Manyi? 
MS OLIPHANT:   To me it was saying firstly the proper procedures were 
not followed, precisely because if you recall or if I recall, but I believe 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 47 of 218 
 
all of us we can recall that, around 2000 there was a court case 
between the Minister and the DG, I was still a member of Parliament at 
that particular time, and everybody knew about it, where the Court 
made  a ruling to say the Minister does not have powers, one, to 
discipline or to dismiss, without the authority from the President, and 
everybody knew about that particular issue at that particular time. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   What time was that Ms Oliphant? 
MS OLIPHANT:   I think it was around 2000, if I am not mistaken. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Oh, is it not the decision involving the Director 
General of Home Affairs? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Apleni 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Mr Apleni. 
MS OLIPHANT:   No, it was the decision dealing with the issue of the 
Minister for – it was for Intelligence then. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Oh, the Mr Masetla’s decision. 
MS OLIPHANT:   Masetla, yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Right, no indeed, that is a particular provision 
governed by its own legislation but is that the one of which you were 
aware? 
MS OLIPHANT:   Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  So you understood his 
observations to be that proper process had not been followed, is that 
correct? 
MS OLIPHANT:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And part of that related to the issue of who 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 48 of 218 
 
has the power to appoint or dismiss, is that correct? 
MS OLIPHANT:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Do you accept that Mr Masetla as the Head of 
the National Intelligence Agency is not necessarily in the same position 
as a Director General in the Ministry of Labour or was that not 
something you considered? 
MS OLIPHANT:   The reason why I left it and also take the advice or 
took the advice from Minister Baloyi is precisely because he understand 
very clearly the Public Service Management Act. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed.   Chair I see we are just at quarter 
10 
past eleven, it may be a convenient time to take the break. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, we will take the tea adjournment and we will 
resume at half past eleven.   
 
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us proceed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Oliphant I would still like 
us to spend a bit more time on that letter that we were looking at 
20 
before the break. But before we go back there can I just ask what at 
this stage was your attitude to having Mr Manye come back into the 
Department of Labour as Director General? 
MS OLIPHANT:  I must say based on – I did not have a negative 
attitude but based on the – the letter that I received immediately from 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 49 of 218 
 
the Rep of NEHAWU immediately there was a – a red light reflection 
that says -  it means the officials are divided in the department.  So 
there was instability and also based on what Advocate Dakota said that 
particular time so I just requested that I will be very happy if he can be 
transferred to any other department wherever there are positions in – in 
any other department so that I create the stability in the department. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In your affidavit… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one second Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe the air conditioner can be either switched off 
10 
for now or I will – it can be lowered a bit.  I think it may be interfering 
with me hearing what the witness is saying.  But if it becomes hot we 
will – we will put it on again.  Yes thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Oliphant in your affidavit 
and you will find that in Exhibit NN3 at page 6 paragraph 17.  You deal 
there with your attitude to having Mr Manyi return to the Department of 
Labour.  If you pick it up midway down that paragraph you say: 
“I then requested Mr Baloyi to please transfer Mr Manyi to 
another department for the following two reasons. 
a. The fact that he was dismissed by the Department of 
20 
Labour and 
b. Because I wanted to create stability within the 
department.” 
I would like to focus on a there.  What do you man when you say, one 
of the reasons you wanted him transferred out of the Department of 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 50 of 218 
 
Labour was that he had been dismissed by the Department of Labour? 
MS OLIPHANT:  I think that was not the permanent attitude because 
Minister Baloyi indicated after having discussed with him if he can be 
transferred to another department.  He said, if he is able to get any 
other Minister who will allow Mr Manyi to be transferred to that 
particular department then it will be fine but if he does not get any 
positive results then he will be forced to transfer Mr Manyi back to the 
department.  So I was not going to have any choice if that is what 
happened. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Oliphant just help me there.  He would not 
10 
have been transferred back to the department.  If you withdrew his 
termination he would have been reinstated as the Director General of 
the Department of Labour, is that correct? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes but that is why I put him on a special leave so that 
the processes by Minister Baloyi should be finalised before. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What were those processes? 
MS OLIPHANT:  In terms of whether the dismissal was done 
procedurally or not.  As I have indicated that I requested Minister 
Baloyi to look at the procedures whether they were implemented 
correctly or not. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But Ms Oliphant as I understand your previous 
evidence Mr Baloyi had already done that exercise.  He determined that 
the procedures were not followed and that is why he recommended that 
you consider withdrawing the termination, is that correct? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes.  But I discussed the issue of transfer at an early 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 51 of 218 
 
stage not only after the – the process was finalised. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well that is inconsistent with what you say at 
paragraph 17 on page 6.  You see at paragraph 17 on page 6 you say: 
“In or around January 2011 Mr Baloyi informed me 
that he had finalised the process regarding Mr Manyi.  
He further informed me that in accordance with 
procedures Mr Manyi would either have to return to 
the Department of Labour or be transferred to 
another department.  You say Mr Baloyi did not 
inform me of what procedures were followed nor of 
10 
their outcomes.” 
And then you say: 
“I requested Mr Baloyi to transfer Mr Manyi to 
another department.” 
And the first reason you give for that is the fact that he was dismissed 
by the Department of Labour.  So what did you mean when you said 
here you wanted him transferred out of the Department of Labour 
because he had been dismissed by that department? 
MS OLIPHANT:  It is based on – or based on the information that was 
given to me by Advocate Dakota to say he did not respect the Minister 
20 
then and therefore also based on the – the demand by NEHAWU so I 
saw that if he will be returned to the department then there is going to 
be instability.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS OLIPHANT:  And in fact when I was given this evidence initially we 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 52 of 218 
 
started with that statement that says I have requested even Minister 
Baloyi to consider transferring him to another department. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you accept that if that transfer had not 
taken place though you would have had him back as your DG? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Of course I was not going to have any choice. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm.  And would your concerns about stability 
have remained? 
MS OLIPHANT:  I was going to get for example the advice also from 
Minister Baloyi through the Public Service Commission because that is 
what – I have learnt that that is what the Public Service Commission 
10 
also do to assist to create the stability within different departments. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right so if we go back to that letter which Mr 
Balyoi wrote at the end of November you will find that in Exhibit NN5.  
We were looking at it before the break. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And at page 217 of that Exhibit. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Baloyi sets out in paragraph 3 there his 
advice based on his observations. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We have dealt with a the withdrawal of the 
Minister – the former Minister’s letter which terminated the DG’s 
services.  I will come back to that in a moment.  I would like to look at 
b.  He advises you to extend the DG’s probation for another four 
months.  Did you do that? 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 53 of 218 
 
MS OLIPHANT:  When I put him on a special leave it also covered that 
particular four months. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  How did it cover that? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Because the withdrawal of the dismissal was effective 
as from the 1 December of which the – the dismissal was supposed to 
start on the 1 December. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So were you aware that Mr Manyi was on 
probation before he was dismissed? 
MS OLIPHANT:  I think – I cannot recall but I think I did not have the 
full information about that because it was said he was the Director 
10 
General. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You see – because the difficulty I have with 
your answer is the probation that Mr Manyi was on ceased on the 30 
November 2010.  That is why Mr Baloyi and we will query him on this 
when he comes to give evidence later.  But if he had looked into this he 
would have established that Mr Manyi’s probation ended on the 20 
November 2010 and that is why he is saying to you, you need to extend 
that probation for another four months.  Do you see that? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So what action did you take to extend his 
20 
probation? 
MS OLIPHANT:  The letter that was written by Minister Baloyi he wrote 
it on the 29 t h November. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS OLIPHANT:  And then according to the dismissal Mr Manyi was 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 54 of 218 
 
supposed to leave the department as from the 1 December and 
therefore based on that advice that is why I said I withdrew the 
dismissal and automatically it reinstated Mr Manyi and that is why I had 
to put him on a special leave. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Oliphant special leave is something 
different to probation, do you agree with that? 
MS OLIPHANT:  No it is not different from probation because he was 
part of the – the institution as the Director General.  So even the 
probation my understanding was that when I give him this special leave 
automatically even the probation was going to be included in that. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But why then does Mr Baloyi deal with 
probation and special leave as two separate aspects in paragraph 3? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Unfortunately I cannot respond on behalf of Mr Baloyi.  
I think it will be better of – for Minister Baloyi to respond on but not 
me. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So what did you understand the difference to 
be between probation of four months and special leave of two weeks? 
MS OLIPHANT:  The reason I have indicated that – the reason why I 
said I put him on the probation until – I mean on the special leave until 
further notice it was because I was of the view and also after 
20 
discussing the matter with the legal services in the department that will 
give enough time for Minister Baloyi to deal with the procedural issues 
and then to have enough time to deal with those particular issues.  
Rather than to say it is going to be just for two weeks and in fact I even 
indicated to him to say, if we give him two weeks is it not going to be a 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 55 of 218 
 
shorter period of time? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What is the – your understanding of the reason 
that DG’s are put on probation? 
MS OLIPHANT:  The reasons for DG’s to be put on probation is in 
terms of the Public Service Management Act because one in that 
particular time the DG must perform according to the government 
programs and then the – while they are doing probation if there are 
weaknesses then the Minister must also guide the Director General on 
how he or she has to perform in terms of the role of that particular 
department. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So would it be fair to say that probation is 
there to enable the employer to test the performance of the DG? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes in terms of the Labour Relations Act that is what 
happens even beyond the Public Service even in the private sector. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS OLIPHANT:  When you put a – when you employ a person you put 
that person in a probation period of time and then while that person is 
on probation it is the responsibility of for example when it comes to the 
DG’s of the executing authority to make sure that he or she performs 
according to the – the strategic plan or the – the role of the department 
20 
including the – the performance agreement that the Director General 
has signed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  How can you test or monitor the performance of 
a DG who is on special leave? 
MS OLIPHANT:  You cannot test that because if he has been put on a 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 56 of 218 
 
special leave it is because there is something that is happening for 
example on this one there was an investigation of whether the 
processes were done correctly or not. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Oliphant you see my difficulty is I 
understand your evidence to be you did not put him on probation 
because you thought this special of an indefinite nature would take 
care of the need for probation, is that your evidence? 
MS OLIPHANT:  I cannot say that per se but I must say my 
understanding is that when I withdrew the dismissal immediately 
whatever it was supposed to be happening it was part of that.  So even 
10 
the issue of probation.  So what was going to happen was that: 
1. When he comes back because I was not there for a long time in 
the department I was just new.  So I was even going to request 
Minister Baloyi to further deal with that particular issue 
particularly because that was going – in fact when it comes to 
the interviews whether it is under the – the performance when it 
comes to monitoring Public Service Commission assists the 
various departments. So even if I was going to have that then we 
were going to have the interview of him assisted by the Public 
Service Commission. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you need to extend the probation in order 
for there still to be a need for Mr Manyi to pass his probation period, do 
you not? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Then Minister Baloyi was going to advise me on the 
matter. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 57 of 218 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well his advice… 
MS OLIPHANT:  That is why I am saying when I put him on a special 
leave it was based on the advice and also based on the issues that 
were being investigated whether the – his dismissal was done 
procedurally or not. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Oliphant this letter as we have read it 
summarises as I understand it and you can tell me if your 
understanding is different those investigations that Mr Baloyi made and 
his determination that Mr Manyi had been unfairly dismissed, is that 
your understanding of this letter? 
10 
MS OLIPHANT:  Well I think Minister Baloyi can explain that because 
he did not give me the full details on what exactly has happened but 
accordingly based on the advice it was clear that the proper procedures 
were not followed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  So I am interested in your understanding.  
I am not interested in what Mr Baloyi thought when he was writing this.  
Because I am interested in the decisions that you took after you got 
this letter. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So the first thing he advises you to do is to 
20 
withdraw the former Minister’s letter which terminated the DG’s 
services, correct? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes it is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The second thing he advises you to do is to 
extend the Director General’s probation for another four months. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 58 of 218 
 
MS OLIPHANT:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What was your response to that advice? 
MS OLIPHANT:  During our discussions with Minister Baloyi we talked 
– because as I have said we – we discussed the matter informally 
before I received the letter. 
1. Was to withdraw the letter that terminated the DG and also to put 
him on a special leave and that is what was the main discussions 
with the two of us.  And then later – I mean the letter probably 
came later after we have finalised everything. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So did you never take a decision not to extend 
10 
his probation? 
MS OLIPHANT:  No I did not because I was not going to do that 
precisely because I – I had not worked with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr you must remember that from my point of 
view Ms Oliphant’s evidence in relation to – actually any witness’ 
evidence with regard to Mr Manyi is only important as I see it insofar as 
it may throw light on the reasons for the transfer of Mr Maseko or the 
particular decision to replace him with Mr Manyi.  If there is something 
else that you have picked up you can let – let – you can tell me.  But 
whatever – whatever irregularities may have been there in how – 
20 
whether it is Mr Baloyi or Ms Oliphant dealt with Mr Manyi if it does not 
throw – if they do not throw light on those issues there – there might be 
difficulty.  But if you have in mind certain issues that might have 
escaped me you can mention them.  So I – I would not like us to take 
too long with her unless it becomes clear that her evidence does throw 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 59 of 218 
 
light on – on why Mr Maseko was transferred or why the replacement 
was Mr Manyi.  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair if I may just take a moment in relation to 
that concern of yours? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What I propose to pursue with Ms Oliphant is 
not only the selection of Mr Manyi as the replacement but the terms on 
which he joined GCIS.  Because Chair you will recall he was in a 
probation period. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  When the dismissal decision was taken. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Which means that there had not yet been a 
determination as to whether he met the standards of performance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether he was suitable.  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is relevant as the facts developed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is my submission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS OLIPHANT:  That when he is moved on the 2 February to GCIS. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  He goes there without any probation period. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Applicable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 60 of 218 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  He goes there without any charges which have 
not previously been – been withdrawn. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But are extant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In essence he goes there with absolutely clean 
bill of health. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To serve out the remaining year and a bit of his 
contract of employment. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And so it will be our submission in due course 
not only that the selection may be relevant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS OLIPHANT:  To the evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But the terms on which he went there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And it was as I understand the legal position 
Mr Oliphant’s role to determine whether to extend the probation. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON: Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  As I understand her evidence she did not take 
a decision in that regard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Which means as a consequence of these 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 61 of 218 
 
events. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Manyi moves to GCIS on the 2 February. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  With no probation in terms of which his 
performance will be assessed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And furthermore with no charges against him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So that is the background for why to probe this 
10 
at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is the full context which in due course our 
submissions will be of whether there was irregularity in this 
appointment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  I take what you say to mean that you are saying 
that whatever irregularities there may have been in the withdrawal of 
his dismissal and his transfer you want to say in the end they 
20 
transferred into Mr Maseko’s position somebody who was irregularly 
transferred or somebody who was unsuitable to put in there.  Now that 
may be – that may be so I think the question would still arise that 
appointment that transfer and so what in relation to the transfer of Mr 
Maseko?  A wrong decision and so on.  You see it is one thing if – if 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 62 of 218 
 
what would emerge is a concerted effort – maybe that is not the correct 
term.  Maybe a concerted effort to put into Mr Maseko or to GCIS a 
particular individual as opposed to just somebody who may be needing 
to be transferred to some other department and GCIS happens to be – 
to have a vacancy.  Of course there might be a lot of things that you 
and other members of the legal team might have to say later on about 
that.  I just want you to be alert that I am trying to keep an eye that we 
– we remain focused on – on the important aspects.  So I think continue 
but I would like us not to take too long before we finish if possible. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  To finish with her.  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  It will in due course be our 
submission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That there are various – there is conduct that 
needs to take place in order for state capture to occur within a society. 
CHAIRPERSON: Hm. 
ADV 
KATE 
HOFMEYR: 
 And 
irregular 
removals 
and 
irregular 
appointments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  May be part of that project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair we fully accept. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think that – that may be so.  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That you would need in addition. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 63 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Certain further facts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But those are the facts that we are seeking to 
probe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And we addressed with Mr Manyi precisely the 
role that he played in relation to spend with TNA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  After he joined GCIS. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I – but Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But mindful of that concern Ms Oliphant if I 
may then go to D – 3D on page 217 because you have dealt with C 
which was the special leave and you have explained why you placed 
him on indefinite special leave and not two weeks.  But D says during 
that two weeks that he is on special leave you should decide whether or 
not to pursue misconduct charges against Mr Manyi.  What decision did 
you take in that regard? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Wait I am sorry.  I am sorry Ms Hofmeyr.  I may have 
missed this but you did deal earlier on with the question of probation.  
Did you – did you know or appreciate at the time of deciding to 
withdraw Mr Manyi’s dismissal that when he was dismissed he was still 
on probation? 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 64 of 218 
 
MS OLIPHANT:  I must say Chairperson I – I think I did not look at the 
issue of – of Mr Manyi being on probation on that particular time.  
Because I – I was just relying on the advice of Minister Baloyi precisely 
because he was dealing with the whole issues as I have requested him 
to do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you – you – you said earlier on in response to a 
question by Ms Hofmeyr that you did not ask for Mr Manyi’s disciplinary 
file and you understood that either the file or certain files relating to Mr 
Manyi were in Mr Baloyi’s department, is that right? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes that is what the legal services team Chairperson 
10 
told me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS OLIPHANT:  That already the files. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Are with the office of Minister Baloyi in the Public 
Service. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS OLIPHANT:  And Administration. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I must just say that I am concerned by the fact 
that you come into the department – into a department, you are a new 
20 
Minister, you understand that the DG has been dismissed but you do 
not seem to want to fully inform yourself of the reasons why he was 
dismissed.  Particularly when  
1. He has said to you the same DG he is going to take the 
department to court.  He is going to lodge an appeal because 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 65 of 218 
 
that means it is somebody who still wants to come back to your 
department and I would have thought that you would want to fully 
inform yourself so that you can take a view whether what to do 
with him.  Even if you are going to get advice from somebody 
else because you are the Minister of the department he wants to 
be back in this department as DG.  
MS OLIPHANT:  Thank you Chair.  Chair as I indicated earlier that I 
was just new in this deployment.  I have not been appointed as the 
Minister before and that is the reason why I have requested Minister 
Baloyi to act on the matter so that he can be able to advise me on what 
10 
has happened whether everything was done procedurally.  So if he was 
going to be redeployed to the department or reinstated to the 
department of course that is when I was going to take through the 
issues on why firstly he was dismissed to have the full reasons.  Now 
as part of understanding that he has already lodged the appeal no was 
going to take us to court my understanding was that since the files 
were with the Public Service and Administration so there was no need 
for me to get the full details.  Probably that was my mistake. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I think – I think it – it was because I think what 
he is expected of a Minister who comes into a department and he or 
20 
she understands that the DG of the department has been dismissed.  
There is an acting DG but that DG wants to come back.  What is 
expected is that the Minister would say I want his file.  I want to read 
the documentation.  I want to find out exactly what did he do.  Because 
you might need to take a view.   
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 66 of 218 
 
If he says he is going to take you to court - you might need to 
take a view to say as the new Minister of Labour I fully endorse the 
decision that was taken by my predecessor.  It was correct.  It was 
justified.  So I will defend it or you might say I have studied the file.  I 
have looked at all the documentation.  I know what he - why - why he 
was dismissed, but I take a different view. 
So if he wants to take us to court.  My approach would be 
maybe to negotiate and reach a settlement, because I think we are 
going to be - we will have challenges in court defending this decision.  
Even if somebody else is going to advise you, because in the end that 
10 
other person cannot impose their advice on you.  They cannot make the 
decisions for you. 
You are the Minister of Labour.  You must decide whether 
your attitude is we will defend this decision or we will take him back.  
So - so I think that is what would be expected.  So I think to the extent 
that you might not have thought it necessary to fully inform yourself of 
that.  That might have been a mistake. 
MS OLIPHANT:  I do understand that Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS OLIPHANT:  But since I requested the Minister for Public Services 
20 
and Administration as the custodian of Public Service Management Act.  
I thought I have to wait for the investigation on whether the procedures 
were followed correctly and then after that that is when I was going too 
based on also the advice of both Minister Baloyi and the Legal Team in 
the department. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 67 of 218 
 
I was going to then start to look at the matter.  For example if 
he was reinstated to the department.  That is when I was going to make 
sure that I get the full information and then also if there were decisions 
to - to - it is either to charge him.  I was going to also work together 
with the Minister for Public Service and Administration in terms of the 
delegated power to the Minister for Public Service and Administration. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No.  I understand what you are saying, but I - I 
think you must put - you should have put yourself in the position where 
you could say to Minister Baloyi when he gives you advice.  I actually 
do not agree with you - this advice and you cannot say that unless you 
10 
are fully informed.  Let us assume that he was dismissed for fraud and 
Minister Baloyi says withdraw his dismissal. 
If you are fully informed yourself you would say how can we 
do that.  This man was dismissed for fraud, but if you have not fully 
informed yourself you might end up withdrawing the dismissal and 
everybody else says how she could do that.  This person was dismissed 
for fraud, but we - we can move on. 
I understand your - your explanation, but you understand 
what I - what I am saying as well.  Is that right? 
MS OLIPHANT:  I do understand Chair, but also based on the briefing 
20 
by the Legal Services Team when they said he was dismissed because 
he did not respect the Minister without giving me other full details.  So 
that is why I had to wait up until Minister Baloyi finalises due 
processes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but what if your officials were not telling you 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 68 of 218 
 
something else in the documentation that you would regard as 
important which they did not as important?  You see.  So there - there 
is wisdom in saying I hear you what you say, but I want to be fully 
informed, but I think you have - you have put your - your side of how 
you saw it. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes Chair.  Thank you very much and also Chairperson 
I think I relied on the information, because it was led by the Senior 
Counsel Advocate Tokota. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS OLIPHANT:  So I thought that that is the information that I have to 
10 
work on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Oliphant you received that briefing prior to 
receiving this letter from Mr Baloyi.  Did you not? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And at paragraph 3D on page 2-1-7 Mr Baloyi 
to whom you have gone to for advice says at D3: 
“During the two week period of special leave you 
20 
need to decide whether or not to pursue the 
misconduct charges against the Director-General.” 
Did you take that decision? 
MS OLIPHANT:  No, because my understanding is that when you advice 
- when you are advised you have to look at the advice and further get 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 69 of 218 
 
the clarity.  So since Minister Baloyi was dealing with those issues I 
said he must finalise everything before I deal with the matters.  So … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  When … 
MS OLIPHANT:  If he was reinstated to the department of course I was 
going to probably consider that also based on the outcome of that 
investigation. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Oliphant what is your understanding of a 
decision to withdraw the termination of a Director-General? 
MS OLIPHANT:  The withdrawal was based on - on that the proper 
procedures were not followed.  Firstly that the Minister was not 
10 
supposed to dismiss him, because that role is - is for the President to 
do.  Not the Minister. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what is the effect of withdrawing a 
termination of a DG’s dismissal? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Well what - what - the reason why I withdrew is 
because I was correcting the situation where it was not done 
procedurally and that is why I - I requested Minister Baloyi to further 
deal with the issues.  So that is why everything was that, because he is 
the leader.  In terms of the implementation of the Public Service 
Management Act is clear on how to deal with the issues. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But Ms Oliphant the question whether to pursue 
the misconduct charges against the Director-General was your decision 
to take.  Correct? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Can you repeat the question? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Whether to pursue misconduct charges against 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 70 of 218 
 
Mr Manyi.  That was your decision to take.  Correct? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Even that I cannot just take a - a decision as an 
individual.  I have to report that to the Minister for Public Service and 
Administration and - and guide me in terms of the Public Service 
Management Act. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But Ms Oliphant Mr Baloyi was telling you here 
that you needed to make that decision.  Did you understand what he 
was saying there differently? 
MS OLIPHANT:  As I said it is either this letter came at a later stage 
after we have discussed on how we have to deal with the procedures. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is your evidence that you never considered 
whether to pursue misconduct charges against Mr Manyi? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Because he was on special leave.  If - if the whole 
process was finalised probably that is when I was going to consider 
depending on the outcome of that investigation. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So between November 2010 and February 2011 
did you at no stage in that period try to understand what charges were 
levelled at him and whether you should pursue those charges? 
MS OLIPHANT:  No.  I did not take that, because I was saying 
Minister Baloyi is still investigating the matters whether everything was 
20 
done procedurally. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Oliphant I - I do not want to belabour the 
point, but do you accept that when he wrote that letter.  He had 
concluded those procedures and he had determined that he had not 
been fairly dismissed. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 71 of 218 
 
MS OLIPHANT:  What has happened he sent the letter on 29 November 
of which I am not sure when it landed to - to my office, because as I 
have said we discussed the issues informally in a session in 
Parliament.  So the date of the letter … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Does not mean that that letter immediately come to my 
office. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No.  I accept that, but you had that 
conversation before the rising of Parliament in December.  So at worse 
for us you got this information in December 2010.  Did you not? 
10 
MS OLIPHANT:  Well during that - that briefing session of which - of 
which we - we had the discussion on how we should deal with the 
issues procedurally particularly in terms of writing a letter of withdrawal 
and putting him on special leave.  We discussed that informally in a 
parliamentary session before the Parliament - the Parliament rise and 
immediately when the Parliament rises in most cases even the Cabinet 
does not take time and we all - we will all go to leave. 
That is what has happened and I - I think that is why even the 
letter that I - I wrote for the withdrawal was around January.  I think at 
the end of January. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you remember having a meeting with 
Mr Baloyi on 11 January 2011 at which these issues were discussed? 
MS OLIPHANT:  I cannot clearly recall that.  I must say. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I - I will take you to that in a moment.  Let us 
go to - back to your affidavit.  NN3 at page 7. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 72 of 218 
 
MS OLIPHANT:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You say there at paragraph 18 that: 
“Mr Baloyi advised you according to the procedures 
that ought to be followed in the transfer of 
Mr Manyi.  You must write a letter withdrawing 
Mr Manyi’s dismissal in terms of Section 5-7 of the 
Public Services Act and place him on special 
leave.” 
Do you see that? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What does Section 5-7 of the Public Services 
Act empower you to do? 
MS OLIPHANT:  It empowers the Minister to correct the situation where 
there is something that was done wrongfully and that is why I had to 
consider that based on also the advice by Minister Baloyi that certain 
procedures were not followed properly. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you have - did you look at the section in 
the Act before you took the decision? 
MS OLIPHANT:  We discussed with the Legal Services Team in the 
department. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So did they …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but the question is whether you looked at the 
section yourself? 
MS OLIPHANT:  I think yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let us go to it then.  It is a file also available 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 73 of 218 
 
to you.  Called the NN6 Legislation bundle and if you open it up at page 
35. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Bring it to me. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  At page 35. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You will find Section 5-7. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It reads there: 
“A functionary shall correct any action or omission 
purportedly made in terms of this Act by that 
10 
functionary if the Act or omission was based on an 
error of fact or law or fraud and it is in the public 
interest to correct the action or omission.” 
Do you recall looking at this section at the time? 
MS OLIPHANT:  I think so, because if I am not mistaken the - the 
Advocate Pascha even further explained on this particular clause and 
that is why we ended up drafting a letter based on 5-7. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Which part of 5-7 did rely on? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Is that if the action was based on an error. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Which of them, because it is an either an act of 
20 
fact or law or fraud.  Which was the one you relied on? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Is the - is an error of fact, because as I have said 
previously the Minister does not have powers to dismiss the 
Director-General. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what determination did you make about the 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 74 of 218 
 
public interest? 
MS OLIPHANT:  The public interest was that a - the Public Service and 
Administration Minister was going to investigate.  No, no, no.  Based on 
the facts that were given to me.  That the former Minister did not act in 
terms of the - of the Public Service Act and therefore I was correcting 
that mistake and I believe that it was based on the public interest. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Those are two different things Ms Oliphant.  I 
fully understand your evidence to be you understood that you were 
correcting something … 
MS OLIPHANT:  Huh-uh. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But there is a second requirement in this 
section.  It is that there be a public interest in correcting the decision. 
So what was your understanding of the public interest that was going to 
be pursued? 
MS OLIPHANT:  The public interest was that we were going to save 
one, the - the money from the department rather than to allow a 
situation where the matter should - will be taken to court and at the end 
of the day it was going to be the public that will be footing that bill in 
terms of the budget of the department that has been allocated to the 
department.  That was my understanding. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  When you took the decision to withdraw the 
termination you also placed Mr Manyi on indefinite special leave.  Is 
that correct? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes.  I said special leave until further notice. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  So no end point to the special leave 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 75 of 218 
 
was stipulated.  Correct? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Can you repeat the question? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There was no end to the special leave.  You 
said until further notice.  Correct? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes.  I said until further notice. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  When a person is on special leave are they 
paid a salary? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But they are not rendering any services to the 
department.  Are they? 
10 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes, because they are on special leave. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So would it have been in the public interest to 
reverse the decision on the termination of Mr Manyi, continue to pay 
him a salary for an indefinite period and not have him render any 
services to the Department of Labour? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes, because wanted to finalise the investigation and 
all processes precisely because if we did not do that then we were 
going to be taken to court and what was going to happen if Mr Manyi 
win that court case. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Oliphant withdrawing the termination put the 
20 
prospect of the court case aside.  Do you accept that? 
MS OLIPHANT:  What was going to happen is that when - when we 
spoke Minister Baloyi was that he wants to finalise these issues within 
three months.  So that is when probably I was going to consult him if 
that matter was not yet finalised. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 76 of 218 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But it was not about a risk of going to court.  
Was it? 
MS OLIPHANT:  If - if we went to court - if we went to court it is either 
that process was going to be delayed and then it is either - say for 
example if we take the case that happened between the Minister for - 
for Intelligence then.  The - the Director-General won the case and then 
the department had to foot that particular bill. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Oliphant when you decided to withdraw the 
termination of Mr Manyi’s dismissal he was then reinstated in the public 
service.  Correct? 
10 
MS OLIPHANT:  Huh-uh.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  He could not have gone to court to fight about 
anything then.  Could you? 
MS OLIPHANT:  No.  He was not going to fight. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  So my question to you was.  Is it in the 
public interest to bring someone back into the public service, to place 
them indefinite special leave, to pay them a salary and not have them 
render any services to the department and I understood your answer to 
be yes it is, because we needed time to investigate and to ensure that 
there was an approach to the courts.  Did I understand your evidence 
20 
correctly? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But my point to you Ms Oliphant on which I 
would like your response is once you have withdrawn the termination 
there is no risk at all that Mr Manyi was going to go to court.  Was 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 77 of 218 
 
there? 
MS OLIPHANT:  No.  There was no risk. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So do you maintain that it was still in the public 
interest to bring him back, pay him a salary and have him sit at home? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Because we are going to finalise … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh maybe - maybe you need to leave out the bringing 
back part, because that is the part that takes away the risk of litigation.  
So once you had brought him back by way of withdrawing, the dismissal 
there was no risk of him taking you to court.  Is that right? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you then - and I am probably going ahead of you 
Ms Hofmeyr.  If you then decided to pursue charges or to act on the 
understanding that by the way he still needed to complete his 
probationary period then that would be a different issue.  There would 
be no litigation that ought to arise at that stage in regard to that.  At 
least until you had made a decision whether charges should be pursued 
and the outcome thereof. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  You indicated that you spoke 
20 
to Mr Baloyi about the prospect of transferring Mr Manyi out of the 
Department of Labour.  Is that correct? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why did you have those discussions with him? 
MS OLIPHANT:  With Minister Baloyi? 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 78 of 218 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS OLIPHANT:  As I have - as I have indicated that based on the 
report by the Legal Services Team and also based on the demand to 
reinstate him by NEHAWU.  So it - it shows that there was going to be 
an instability in the department.  So I was trying to make sure that 
there is stability in the department. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What is your understanding of who has the 
power to transfer a Director-General? 
MS OLIPHANT:  My understanding is that the Minister for Public 
Service and Administration has to make recommendations, because he 
10 
has powers delegated to him by the President and then probably that 
issue will be further submitted to the Cabinet.  If I am not mistaken. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So do you - is your understanding that 
Mr Baloyi does not have the final decision to make.  It is either Cabinet 
or the President who makes that decision? 
MS OLIPHANT:  In terms of the Public Service Act the President 
employs the Director-Generals.  So since there is that delegated power 
through the Minister for Public Service and Administration and 
Minister Baloyi knew how to deal with those issues, but he cannot take 
a decision as an individual.  In most cases whatever relates to the 
20 
Director-Generals he will present that to Cabinet for the Cabinet to take 
a decision, because even when the - the employment of the 
Director-General by the President.  He employs them through the 
Cabinet. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You took the decision finally to withdraw 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 79 of 218 
 
Mr Manyi’s termination on 31 January 2011.  Is that correct? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Who did you communicate that decision to? 
MS OLIPHANT:  We had a discussion with Minister Baloyi and 
Minister Baloyi is the one that has to lead the processes on what 
processes are related to that.  It is his call to do.  Not me. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you recall when you communicated that 
decision to him? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Which decision? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The decision to withdraw the termination of 
10 
Mr Manyi’s dismissal? 
MS OLIPHANT:  It … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Withdraw his dismissal.  Apologies. 
MS OLIPHANT:  It was based on his advice.  So that is why we had to 
discuss that and that is why I entered up withdrawing that and I copied 
Minister Baloyi in that letter. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And did you have any conversations with him 
after that Monday 31 January about your decision to withdraw it? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Immediately after I have written that letter I submitted 
a copy to him and then he - after that he said he was going to finalise 
20 
the matter.  I think - I cannot remember when exactly did we have that 
discussion. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And did you communicate your decision to 
former President Zuma? 
MS OLIPHANT:  No.  I did not, because it is not my responsibility.  It is 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 80 of 218 
 
the Minister for Public Service and Administration who has delegated 
powers by the President. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you consent to the transfer of Mr Manyi to 
GCIS? 
MS OLIPHANT:  I was not informed to which department he was going 
to be transferred to, but Minister Baloyi just said he is going to be 
transferred to another department. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So when he was transferred on Wednesday of 
that week 2 February.  You had not consented to his transfer to GCIS at 
that stage? 
10 
MS OLIPHANT:  No.  I did not have those powers. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No.  I am asking a question of fact.  Did you as 
a fact consent to his transfer to GCIS between Monday and 
Wednesday? 
MS OLIPHANT:  I must say I do not have those powers precisely, 
because the processes are led by Minister for Public Service and 
Administration and he is the one who made the recommendations to the 
Cabinet, because my understanding was that that issue was reported to 
the Cabinet, but I cannot exactly say whether it was reported or not. 
That is why I even said to the Secretariat previously the best 
20 
person to respond on that matter is Minister Baloyi and also probably 
the Cabinet Secretariat can assist the Commission through your 
request as the Commission, because Cabinet matters are confidential. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you say you had not powers to consent, but is 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 81 of 218 
 
the position not that you had made it clear to Minister Baloyi prior to 
that date that you wanted Mr Manyi to be transferred to another 
department?  Not to come back to your department. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Chairperson, maybe if you can further clarify for me 
the consent, because my understanding when I was supposed to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no, no. 
MS OLIPHANT:  To give that.  I was supposed to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Forget about the consent. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no. 
10 
MS OLIPHANT:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Forget for now about the consent.  That was as prior 
question by Ms Hofmeyr. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just focus on mine.  Mine is - is the position not that 
prior to the transfer of Mr Manyi into - to the Department of GCIS.  You 
had made it clear to Minister Baloyi that wanted Mr Manyi to be 
transferred to another department.  You did not - you did not want him 
in your department or you would prefer not to have him back in your 
department. 
20 
MS OLIPHANT:  I have preferred Chairperson that if Minister Baloyi 
can transfer him to another department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You had communicated that to Minister Baloyi 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 82 of 218 
 
prior to Mr Manyi’s transfer to GCIS? 
MS OLIPHANT:  When I had the discussion before anything started.  I 
said if probably there are issues particularly when it comes to the 
implementation of the procedures I will be happy if he can be 
transferred to another department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So Mr Baloyi knew that? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes.  He knew it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but did you sign any documents at any stage to 
10 
say you are consenting or you support the transfer of Mr Manyi from the 
position of DG in the Department of Labour to the Department of GCIS? 
MS OLIPHANT:  No.  I did not sign any letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did anybody ever ask you to indicate your position in 
writing in anyway about that transfer? 
MS OLIPHANT:  No.  I do not know, but I think Minister Baloyi will be 
able to respond on that one, because I informally discussed that with 
him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but no.  We are not asking what he said.  We are 
asking whether anybody ever said to you - you wold have to …? 
20 
MS OLIPHANT:  No.  There is no one … (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Give us a document indicating that you agree or 
release Mr Manyi to be transferred somewhere else? 
MS OLIPHANT:  No Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not.  Okay. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 83 of 218 
 
MS OLIPHANT:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I understand you to say that you did not know 
that Mr Manyi was going to GCIS until the announcement by the 
Cabinet Spokesperson.  Is that correct? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes, because when Minister Baloyi briefed me he said 
he is going to be transferred to another department, but he - he was not 
specific to which department. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR: 
 
And 
that 
notice 
by 
the 
Government 
Spokesperson as we have the evidence before the Commission came 
out on 3 February which was the Thursday of the week after the 
10 
Cabinet meeting on the Wednesday.  Does that accord with your 
recollection? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Even if I cannot remember the exact date, but all the 
announcements are made immediately after the sitting of the Cabinet. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you withdrew the termination on the Monday 
and then there was a Cabinet meeting on the Wednesday where 
Mr Manyi was transferred to GCIS, but in that period you were not 
alerted to the fact that he was going to GCIS.  Is that correct? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes.  I was not aware that he was going to GCIS. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  When you learnt that he was going to GCIS 
20 
were you concerned that some of those decisions that you still needed 
to make based on Mr Baloyi’s advice about the misconduct charges and 
probation had not yet been taken? 
MS OLIPHANT:  I - I took that Minister Baloyi will be able to deal with 
all the issues that are relevant in terms of the Act.  So when he was 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 84 of 218 
 
transferred I was not even consulted at that particular time that now we 
are transferring him. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you ever make inquiries as to the nature of 
the charges that Mr Manyi faced while he was at the Department of 
Labour? 
MS OLIPHANT:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Were you aware that around the time of his 
dismissal those charges were leaked to the Sunday Times? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Sometimes I do not read newspapers. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So did you not know that one of the charges 
10 
that he faced was that he had pursued private interests in a meeting 
that he had had with the Norwegian Ambassador? 
MS OLIPHANT:  No.  I did not have that information. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And were you also not aware that one of the 
charges he faced was having instructed officials to write off a debt in 
the department? 
MS OLIPHANT:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But I understand your evidence to be you 
thought that those matters would be taken up by Mr Baloyi.  Is that 
right? 
20 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that despite the fact that he indicated to you 
in that letter or maybe in December that you needed to make a decision 
on the charges? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Well I - I cannot really say yes I knew, because I 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 85 of 218 
 
cannot recall getting this letter prior our meeting with Minister Baloyi 
which was an informal meeting of which he informed me that the letter - 
he has written a letter.  Probably I am going to receive that letter, but 
we discussed the - the matters informally as I have said. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just some clear in your evidence.  Did you then 
have an informal discussion at which Mr Baloyi conveyed to you that 
you will need to make a decision about whether to pursue misconduct 
charges against Mr Manyi? 
MS OLIPHANT:  No.  We talked about only two.  That was the 
withdrawal and also the special leave. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and can I also just get clarity.  
Between that Monday when you withdrew the termination and the 
Wednesday when the transfer was announced in Cabinet you had no 
interactions with former President Zuma? 
MS OLIPHANT:  No.  I did not have. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Chair those are our questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.  I think other questions may 
wait for Mr Baloyi.  Thank you very much Ms Oliphant.  If we need you 
to come back we will ask you to come back, but for now you are 
excused. 
20 
MS OLIPHANT:  Thank you very much Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Am I also excused to leave, because I have the flight 
to catch? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you.  Ja. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 86 of 218 
 
MS OLIPHANT:  And that also as a Christmas present. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS OLIPHANT:  During Christmas Day can you please read Johan 27. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MS OLIPHANT:  From verse 11 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MS OLIPHANT:  And also Exodus Chapter 1 from verse 13. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MS OLIPHANT:  That is your Christmas present. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that my Christmas present? 
10 
MS OLIPHANT:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Well has somebody written down those 
versus? 
MS OLIPHANT:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat the verses. 
MS OLIPHANT:  It is Johan 29 verse 11 - from verse 11 and then 
Exodus Chapter 1 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MS OLIPHANT:  From verse 13. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Up to - up to the end? 
20 
MS OLIPHANT:  Up - up until the end. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Thank you. 
MS OLIPHANT:  Thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 87 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Our next witness is Mr Baloyi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is it convenient for us to use the time before 
they lunch adjournment? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I was thinking if we - maybe if you need about 
five minutes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We could take five minutes and then start with him. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Certainly. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that maybe by 1 o’ clock we will have got rid of … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Preliminary issues.  So that after lunch we can go 
into the meet of his evidence. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We will indebted for a five minute break. 
MS OLIPHANT:   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So we will take a five minutes adjournment.  We 
adjourn. 
20 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, are you ready? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed, thank you Chair.  Chair Mr Baloyi who 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 88 of 218 
 
will be our next witness is legally represented, may I ask that that his 
lawyers place themselves on record? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, thank you. 
ADV PETER MAKE:   As the Chairperson pleases, I am Peter Make, I 
am instructed by Correia de Ramoda Incorporated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair, and then just in terms of the 
exhibit containing Mr Baloyi’s statements, you will find them in the main 
file before you under under Tab 4, and if I could ask that, those 
statements, I’ll identify them shortly, be introduced as Exhibit NN4.  
10 
Chair just to take you through what is contained in NN4, Mr Baloyi has 
given a series of statements to the Commission.  The first of those 
commences on page one it concludes on page 102 and it was – it is 
actually an affidavit deposed to on the 11 t h of October 2019.  It I may 
just be permitted to list all of them for the purposes of the record and 
then we can enter it as an Exhibit with your leave.  The second 
statement begins at page 107 it itself is undated but it appears with the 
Commissioner’s stamp of the 7 t h of November 2019 and that concludes 
at page 124.  There is then a set of Annexures which are required to be 
read with that second statement they commence at page 125 and they 
20 
run to page 149 and then there is a document entitled, supplement 
which commences at page 105 and concludes at page 151 that bears a 
stamp of a Commissioner of Oaths of the 11 t h of November 2019 and 
thereafter there is a letter and an Annexure all of which conclude at 
page 159. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 89 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what is at 160 or is that part of 159?  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes sorry the final Annexure which is an 
Annexure to the letter is an Annexure which commences at 159 and 
concludes at 162. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mmm the documents which appear under divider four 
will be admitted as Annexure NN4 they include two statements by Mr 
Baloyi and various other documents, that’s from page one up to page 
162, is that right? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair, indeed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Mr Baloyi in addition to providing 
10 
these statements to the Commission there were a set of documents that 
were made available to you a few ago in advance of today’s evidence, 
is that correct? 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Remember 
we 
haven’t 
– 
he 
must 
still 
be…[intervenes]. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Apologies Chair we have not sworn the witness 
in, please can we do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please administer the oath or affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record.  
MR BALOYI:   Makarenge Richard Baloyi. 
20 
REGISTRAR:   Do you have any objections to taking the prescribed 
oath? 
MR BALOYI:   No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
conscience? 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 90 of 218 
 
MR BALOYI:   Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the 
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, if so please raise your 
right hand and say so help me God. 
MR BALOYI:   So help me God. 
MR MAKARENGE RICHARD BALOYI:   (duly sworn, states) 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, Mr Baloyi before Ms Hofmeyr puts any 
questions to you I just want to say that I am aware that your affidavits 
deal with various matters in quite some detail and there may be – some 
of the matters may be quite important to you to be placed before the 
10 
Commission but I just want to say that the areas in which I’m interested 
are very narrow so, we’ll allow you to say something about your 
background and your commencement in Parliament and highlight here 
and there but it won’t be a long time, I don’t want it to take more than 
five minutes.  The areas which I’m interested in are very narrow but 
they are very important.  So I just don’t want you to feel bad if we don’t 
deal with a lot of things which you have put on the affidavit, they are 
there it’s just that we want to use our time as fruitfully as possible.  So 
you’ll find that the questions will be directed really to very limited 
areas.  Certainly from my side it’s very much on the issue of what you 
20 
know and what your role may have been in regard to the transfer of Mr 
Maseko from GCIS to your department and ultimately how he left your 
department and then with regard to Mr Manyi what you know and what 
your role was in having him transferred to or him being transferred to 
GCIS but as you may have heard earlier on even with regard to that it’s 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 91 of 218 
 
not necessarily the full scope that we are looking at, you understand? 
MR BALOYI:   I understand, thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes you can keep your mic on throughout, yes just – 
ja thank you, Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Than you Chair.  Mr Baloyi I do apologise for 
commencing my questions before you were under oath.  The question 
just related to a set of documents that you were sent, if I recall it, in 
the middle of November by the Commission in preparation for today’s 
evidence, can you confirm having received those documents? 
MR BALOYI:   Thank you very much, I’d received them only on 
10 
Tuesday. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Tuesday this last week? 
MR BALOYI:   Last week. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Have you had an opportunity to consider 
them? 
MR BALOYI:   I glanced through, luckily some of them are documents I 
know the contents of it’s not initial. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed, if at any point in the evidence you’d 
like a bit more time, please let us know and we can make arrangements 
for you to be able properly to consider them. 
20 
MR BALOYI:   I will. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Mr Baloyi I went through in the introduction, 
the set of statements that are contained in Exhibit NN4, as I mentioned, 
sometimes they are stamped by a Commissioner of Oaths but not dated 
where you have signed them.  Can I ask you whether you are 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 92 of 218 
 
comfortable as you sit there to confirm the contents of all of those 
statements that I referred to as being true and correct? 
MR BALOYI:   I confirm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Chair in the course of this morning 
I was given a further statement from Mr Baloyi, it was really a 
repetition of many of the statements he’s already given and my 
arrangement with his legal representatives is that I will simply ask him 
questions based on the statements that we’ve seen there’s nothing new 
in what was handed up this morning but certainly I indicated to Mr 
Baloyi’s lawyers that at the conclusion of my questions, if there’s 
10 
something that’s been omitted that he regards as pertinent I will 
certainly indicate to him if he would like to make mention of those 
aspects with your leave. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that’s fine.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Than you.  Mr Baloyi if we can then start with 
the Cabinet meeting of the 2 n d of February 2011, the Commission has 
received evidence previously that you did not attend that meeting, is 
that correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well Ms Hofmeyr I know I’ve just said a few minutes 
ago that probably Mr Baloyi would like to say a little bit about his 
20 
background. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Of course. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So let’s give him that chance. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I like the idea of going straight to the issues. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 93 of 218 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Of course. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I promised him a few minutes for him to say the 
background to give us his background that he considers to be 
important. 
MR BALOYI:   Okay thank you very much Chairperson.  I’m Makarenge 
Richard Baloyi [indistinct] documents referring to me before I’ll be 
referred to as Masiyane Richard Baloyi it’s still me, I changed my name 
in the process.  I joined the National Assembly because I want to talk 
about things that are related to the subject matter, I joined the National 
Assembly when I was elected to be a member of Parliament on the ANC 
10 
Province Tour National List in June 1999 and then I became involved in 
activities in Parliament having been a whip serving in various portfolios 
I became a whip both the portfolio committee on Public Service and 
Administration, I became it’s Chairperson, I served in parliaments 
adhoc committees, quite a few of them including the adhoc committee 
that was dealing with looking at, one the Public Protector and the other 
that was looking the African Peer Review Mechanism that’s when the 
country, South Africa was going through a peer review process for the 
first time. Dealing with issues of good governance, I was a Chair of that 
sub-committee.  So I then became a Minister, appointed as a Minister 
20 
for Public Service and Administration in 2008.  I served in that position 
from 2008 till October 2011, I was appointed then as a Minster for 
Corporate Governance in Traditional Affairs and then after that I was 
posted as a Diplomat representing South Africa in the central African 
state of Congo Brazzaville as an Ambassador. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 94 of 218 
 
 
I have to indicate my background academically is that I hold a 
degree in Political and Administrative Sciences specialising in Public 
Administration and Political Science. I was one of the team members 
that were sent just after we as a ruling party, the ANC, after adopting 
the document in 1992 ready to govern.  Sent for training in as far as 
issues of a Senior Management Leadership.  So that’s what I can 
actually indicate except that in related to the subject matter of the 
Commission, in my position even before I became Minister I got 
involved in dealing with quite a number of issues that have to do with 
us upholding the constitution in as far as Chapter 10 is concerned 
10 
which deals with Public Administration making sure that the three main 
aspects of that chapter are actually respected, which one is in terms of 
Section 195, the values and principles of our Public Administration and 
Section 196 the issues around the role of the Public Service 
Commission 
and 
then 
197 
the 
Public 
Service 
which 
is 
the 
implementation mechanism for whatever we’ll see is Government 
functions.  So I developed an interest in those and I want to thank the 
Commission, what Chairperson, I would have said, in my statement as I 
requested is firstly to place on record thanking the Commission for the 
assistance given to me because you see it is about 11 years since I 
20 
was a Minister for Public Service and Administration I moved on after 
that, dealing with quite a number of things and having to be expected 
to respond based on recall is a difficult task.  It was made easier, on 
the first day I had with investigators, Chairperson it was a very 
interesting issue, I even said to them, but look I said I need some 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 95 of 218 
 
documents, I’m coming in here and now you ask me quite a lot of things 
but that was basically – it was not to be like un-cooperative  but was 
basically to say, you know, in the cracks of oblivion over a period 
exceeding ten years, and when a person has not been static, you’ve 
moved on to other things and you are not actually idling at the moment, 
you are busy with other things as well, it is just – you meant to actually 
not recall some of the things.  We battled with investigators more 
specially when it came to dates, when did this happen, I said, oh no 
that’s a serious issue but then having said this, I’m saying thank you 
but if I were to raise, and I’ll come specifically to those things, if the 
10 
questions will direct to some of the issues where I may request is a 
situation where I then said,  having noted that the Commission assisted 
me to get documents, the question may be asked, have I got all the 
documents because I know which documents to look for but those 
documents are there in government they are in files they are in 
Cabinet, you know, I know where to look for but the issue is being 
outside of that you may appear like you’re not giving full support to the 
Inquiry, simply because you don’t have those.   
 
So  we relied on the Commission, the question is, my two 
statements and the addendum if I got some of these documents, some 
20 
of which I got last week on Wednesday, if I got the earlier would there 
have been a difference in context in terms of what I actually submitted 
under oath, the answer I will give is there could be some adjustments, 
like I wouldn’t like to ask a question – to answer a question, the 
Commission asks me a question and they then say, I assume, I 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 96 of 218 
 
presume, may be, for me that’s not enough.  I will then say, I factually 
dealt with this issue but if you don’t have information there is nothing 
that you can do.  I even had to say Chairperson, so that when you pick 
this up, it wouldn’t appear like I’m being contemptuous I know that the 
– I don’t have to refer to my communication with the Commission to any 
other person, I have to deal directly – but in certain areas I had to say 
to my employer at the time, the ANC, I mean look, I was a government 
representative in all what I did, what is going to be asked here is not 
asked in my personal capacity it’s asked to me because I was a 
Minister and these records are there, is it possible that some of these 
10 
issues you can facilitate me to have access so that’s the situation that 
[indistinct] but I have to place on record the Commission did indeed 
assist me, so to the extent that the Commission assisted, I’m here 
ready to respond to the questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No that’s fine, thank you Mr Baloyi if, I mean one, as 
with all witnesses as you give your evidence we will be mindful of the 
fact that a lot of time has lapsed since the events to which you will be – 
on which you will be giving evidence and  - number one, number two we 
will bear in mind that you no longer have the kind of access to 
documents that you would have had if you were still Minister and 
20 
number three to the extent that there might be documents that are, to 
you knowledge, not within the Commission that would have assisted 
you on giving evidence – in giving evidence and assisting the 
Commission on certain issues, do feel free as we go along and you are 
asked questions, do feel free to specify that there is a particular 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 97 of 218 
 
document which might assist and – so that to the extent that the 
Commission might not have received that or might not have been aware 
of it then attempts can be made to get it. 
MR BALOYI:   Thank you Chairperson, thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe Ms Hofmeyr let’s go to quarter past and take 
the lunch break. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair if I may then move 
immediately to that Cabinet meeting on the 2 n d of February I indicate, 
Mr Baloyi that there’s been evidence before the Commission previously 
that you weren’t in attendance at that meeting, is that correct? 
10 
MR BALOYI:   I’m not sure but that can be verified through Cabinet 
minutes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So as you sit here today you’re not sure 
whether you were or weren’t there? 
MR BALOYI:   I’m not sure whether I was there or not. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you, can I ask, just in terms of 
background Mr Manyi and Mr Maseko gave evidence before this 
Commission in the first week of November of this year, did you either 
watch their evidence or have you read the transcripts of their evidence? 
MR BALOYI:   No I didn’t watch that I – when I got a directive from the 
20 
Commission to say I need to respond in particular to what Mr Maseko 
said to me, I approached the Commission, and I said, give me that 
statement I want to read it and I got that statement, I only got it the 
time the Commission gave it to me and I had received feedback from 
other colleagues, there’s one senior comrade who called me to say, 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 98 of 218 
 
Maseko was speaking and he was saying something and luckily there is 
nothing bad about you that was the end of it but when I saw his 
affidavit that I got from the Commission it became clear that the – there 
is something that really I have to have interest in.  So in as far as Mr 
Manyi is concerned also I never watched that.  The only time I watched 
Mr Manyi is the latest, I think he was appearing for the second time. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  
MR BALOYI:   Ja that’s when I watched that but if you – I mean his 
appearance before, I didn’t and I had no record what he told the 
Commission. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So my question related to the evidence that 
they gave in November of this year, did you watch that evidence of Mr 
Manyi? 
MR BALOYI:   In November of this year? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MR BALOYI:   Ja…[intervenes]. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   A few weeks ago. 
MR BALOYI:   Ja part of it and with Mr Maseko I watched when he was 
– but it was not on the Commission thing, although they would bring 
clips of what happened in the Commission when he was talking, I think 
20 
is Frank Talk one programme of TV about that so that’s exactly that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you, it’s just helpful for me to know 
what extent of knowledge you may have of their testimony so I 
appreciate that.  Where it’s relevant I will make reference to what they 
said and I will ask for your comment on it. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 99 of 218 
 
MR BALOYI:   No problem. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Mr Baloyi can you assist us with 
your understanding of who takes the decision to transfer a Director 
General? 
MR BALOYI:   If I were to sing a song about answering that question 
I’ll say consent, concur, concur, approve, meaning that when there has 
to be a transfer of a Director General there must be an initiator and 
there must be the – and the initiator meaning that concurs that I’d like 
to see this Director General transferred.  Either it’s the receiving or the 
releasing then the Director General himself has to give consent and 
10 
that Cabinet has to concur and that the President has to transfer.  So 
that’s why I’m saying is consent, concur, concur, concur, approve or 
transfer. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   That’s helpful thank you.  We will use that as a 
guide to your evidence today.  Can I ask you to pick up your first 
statement to the Commission it is in Exhibit NN4 and I’d like 
to…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry, I’m sorry Ms Hofmeyr, you said there has 
to be an initiator? 
MR BALOYI:   Yes.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before there can be a transfer of a Director General 
maybe of any officer or employee but a Director General. 
MR BALOYI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who could qualify as an initiator of a transfer? 
MR BALOYI:   The Director General…[intervenes]. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 100 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or in other words who may initiate, who may be an 
initiator? 
MR 
BALOYI: 
 
 
Thanks 
Chairperson, 
the 
Director 
General 
himself/herself may initiate if he or she initiates his or her Minister 
need to concur.  The Minister where this person is being transferred to 
has to concur. Cabinet has to concur then the President signs a 
Presidential minute which is co-signed by the Minister of Public Service 
and Administration to effect the transfer but the Minister, one Minister 
can also initiate a transfer.  So if that Minister initiates a transfer he or 
she must get the consent of the official to be transferred and he or she 
10 
must have actually have found an alternative as to where this person is 
being transferred to and he or she must actually make sure that when 
this person gets transferred there he’s not going to be worse off.  So 
it’s either at the same level just like that, so those are the people who 
initiate but there are certain circumstances where the Minister of Public 
Service and Administration may initiate.  So if – Chair we have in as far 
as Executive Authorities we have what we call Line Function Ministers 
and a Line Function Minister is a Minister for a particular Ministry.  So 
a one Line Function Minister may initiate a – or the Executive Authority 
of DPSA may initiate but that is under certain circumstances that I may 
20 
refer to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So if I’m a DG I can initiate my transfer and then I 
need the consents, concurrences and approval that you talked about.  If 
I am the Minister, if I’m a Minister and I want to have my DG 
transferred I can initiate that transfer and similarly I would need the 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 101 of 218 
 
consents and concurrences and approval that you talked about? 
MR BALOYI:   Yes sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And under certain special circumstances the Minister 
of Public Service and Administration may initiate the transfer of the DG 
of another Minister not necessarily his or her own, is that right? 
MR BALOYI:   It’s right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s what you’re saying? 
MR BALOYI:   That’s what I’m saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Apart from being able to initiate the transfer of his or 
her own DG he or she can also initiate the transfer of the DG of another 
10 
Minister? 
MR BALOYI:   Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Every initiator of a transfer needs the various 
consents and concurrences and approvals that you talked about? 
MR BALOYI:   Exactly Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair, just before the break there’s 
one aspect of Mr Baloyi’s affidavit I’d like to go to and then hand up 
two documents because I think it will be useful for Mr Baloyi to look at 
them over lunch, if we may. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So if we could just conclude those two aspects 
before we adjourn.  Mr Baloyi I ask you to turn to page 12 of Exhibit 
NN4. 
MR BALOYI:   I’m there. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 102 of 218 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you and this is in relation to this broad 
question about your guidance on the process that is followed to 
transfer DG’s because if you pick it up at paragraph FF on that page, 
you say, 
 
“Because my offer was agreed to”, 
 
I’m going to come back to that in a moment but you there 
describe a process, you say, 
 
“I manage the transfer process and I think it should be in the 
 
records of DPSA and/or GCIS that due process was managed 
 
through, namely”, 
10 
 
And then I’m interested in this list right, can you tell us what 
these documents are that are required in the process? 
MR BALOYI:   The first one madam mentioned there is a written 
consent of the releasing of the Executive Authority because FF talks 
about a situation where I as Minster for Public Service and 
Administration then initiated and then I then said, 
 
“having initiated this then the due process was managed”, 
 
And what I’m saying in terms of that document is that if this 
due document is managed if I was keeping record of all these files I will 
then say, this is one, the consent letter, this is two, the Cabinet 
20 
memorandum, this is three the President’s minute co-signed and I’ve 
listed those document there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you. 
MR BALOYI:   In the process those documents are very important. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you in preparation for today’s evidence 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 103 of 218 
 
we were able to download off the internet, this morning actually a – 
what appears to be a standard form Cabinet memorandum which is the 
memorandum which must be filled in whenever appointments of DG’s 
are made in the Public Service and Mr Baloyi, given your extensive 
knowledge of the Public Service, I wonder if I could, make available to 
you that form, it is together with an Annexure which is a protocol 
document on the principles and procedures to be followed for the 
recruitment and filling of posts of Heads of Department and Deputy 
Director Generals at National level, are you aware of those documents 
as you sit here? 
10 
MR BALOYI:   Madam you can make that document available or you 
can ask a question on that document I can actually respond. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you, my suggestion Chair is that I make 
it available to Mr Baloyi now and to yourself and then we take the lunch 
adjournment and then I can traverse questions with him afterwards. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no that’s fine let’s do it that way. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you have a copy he can give the witness, you can 
give this to Mr Baloyi. 
MR BALOYI:   Thank you very much. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   No that’s fine, then we’ll take the lunch adjournment, 
we are going to take the lunch adjournment and we will resume at 
quarter past two, we adjourn. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 104 of 218 
 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS    
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us proceed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Baloyi before the break 
we were at page 12 of Exhibit NN4 and you had provided us with the 
list thereof the documents that comprise the process for a transfer of a 
DG.  I would just like to pick up on the first one listed there.  You list 
there the written consent of the releasing executive authority.  Is that 
something that will be placed before cabinet? 
MR BALOYI:  No it is not placed before cabinet.  It is placed with the 
10 
Minister for Public Service and Administration. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I missed that what is not placed before 
cabinet? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The written consent of the releasing executive 
authority. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But there is a cabinet memorandum. 
MR BALOYI:  But I – can I – can I continue there? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Certainly. 
MR BALOYI:  But the cabinet memorandum when it is written to cabinet 
20 
it will indicate that Minister so and so has given consent to. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right but the actual written consent itself will 
not be attached to that memorandum? 
MR BALOYI:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you list then the cabinet memorandum 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 105 of 218 
 
itself requesting cabinet to approve the transfer and then the third 
document is the co-signed cabinet Minister of the Minute of the Minister 
of DPSA and the President.  Can I just stop there?  You refer to it here 
as a cabinet minute but in your evidence earlier you referred to it as a 
Presidential Minute and you later in your statements refer to it as a 
Presidential Minute? 
MR BALOYI:  It is a Presidential Minute. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay so there is a correction that is required at 
the top of page 13. 
MR BALOYI:  That is fine. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is a Presidential Minute.  And the Minister of 
DPSA you were that Minister at the time of Mr Manyi and Mr Maseko’s 
transfers, is that correct? 
MR BALOYI:  Yes it is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And why is it co-signed by that Minister? 
MR BALOYI:  Come again? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why is the Presidential Minute co-signed by the 
Minister of DPSA? 
MR BALOYI:  Is the initiating Minister – if you look at it it is then 
Cabinet Minister – it is a requirement. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.   
MR BALOYI:  It is a requirement to be like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It might be something in the Constitution.  I am not 
sure certain things when the President signs if they concern the 
department of another – if a Minister is required. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 106 of 218 
 
MR BALOYI:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Minister to sign.  It might be or it might not be. 
But there is a requirement like that in regard to certain decisions taken 
by the President that may affect a department where there is a Minister. 
MR BALOYI:  Certainly Chairperson it is Chapter 5 of the Constitution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I – I do have a copy of it available 
I will get it in a moment just so that we can check that up.  Thank you.  
So those are the relevant documents and then before the break I – I 
handed to you what appears to be a – a template.  I called it a sort of 
10 
proforma for the type of Cabinet Memorandum that will serve before 
cabinet when there is an appointment of a Director General.  Have I 
understood the document in accordance with your understanding Mr 
Baloyi. 
MR BALOYI:  Yes it is a proforma Cabinet Memorandum. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  And then there is also annexure B which 
I handed to you which is a protocol about the principles and procedures 
to be followed for the recruitment and filling of posts of heads of 
department.  Do you see that? 
MR BALOYI:  I see that. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Was that operative at the time that Mr Maseko 
and Mr Manyi were being transferred? 
MR BALOYI:  The document – I think it is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think the question is whether at the time of Mr 
Maseko’s transfer and Mr Manyi’s transfer this type of proforma 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 107 of 218 
 
memorandum would have been what was used normally in such a case? 
MR BALOYI:  Exactly Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  If we look at annexure B it sets out 
in the first line of the table that the purpose of the document is to 
confirm the principles or procedures that apply in appointing HOD’s and 
DDG’s at national level and at point 2 it indicates that although HOD’s 
and DDG’s are appointed by the Executive Authorities Cabinet also 
plays a role in their appointment.  And then there is a reference to 
cabinet having adopted a protocol document.  Are you aware of that 
10 
document? 
MR BALOYI:  Yes I am aware. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  And then if we go over to what is the 
second from last page of that document under item 17.  17 records… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms Hofmeyr.  We have not – I have not 
admitted these. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I realised when you referred to them that it is 
awkward because… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We must – indeed. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you want to attach them to the end of Exhibit 
NN4? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair I think that makes sense. I will ask… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes then the numbering can – the pagination can 
continue. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 108 of 218 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can be paginated accordingly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So if we can start it just for the record? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then maybe we do not – we do not make them 
separate exhibits. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No.  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Even though also making them separate exhibits 
would be no problem. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We can either do that or just attach them at the end 
10 
as part of Exhibit NN4. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I think it useful just for future purposes to keep 
them in NN4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If I may make that suggestion? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then if I can suggest we start with 
annexure B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And it would be paginated from page 163 then 
20 
because that was our last existing page of Exhibit NN4? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Will somebody do the same for the witness 
there? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We will indeed.  If I may beg leave to have my 
learned friend. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 109 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just approach the witness for that purpose? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes to assist him ja.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  On my calculation Chair then annexure D which 
is the second document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Will commence at page 168. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The first one goes up to 167. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine.  Is the last page 174? 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I will just place on record that with the addition of 
two documents one being annexure B another one being annexure D or 
rather one marked annexure B the other one being marked annexure D 
Exhibit NN4 now goes up to page 17 – 174.  So 163 to 167 is a 
document marked annexure B and written Protocol Document on the 
Principles and Procedures to be followed for the recruitment and filling 
of posts of Head of Department and so on.  And then the next one is 
marked annexure D and it is written Ministry for the Public Service and 
Administration.  Ja. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair we are indebted.  I was able 
to just look at the Constitution in the break while we were doing that 
exercise.  And I think the section you had in mind is Section 1012 of 
The Constitution.  It provides that a written decision by the President 
must be countersigned by another cabinet member if that decision 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 110 of 218 
 
concerns a function assigned to that other cabinet member.  Is that the 
section that you were referring to in Chapter 5 Mr Baloyi? 
MR BALOYI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Then we were concerned with the 
document commencing at page 163 of Exhibit NN4 which in entitled 
annexure B and I had asked us to look at item 17 which you will find on 
paginated 166.  And at paragraph 17 there or item 17 it is recorded 
that: “In order to allow the MPSA” – what is that Mr Baloyi? 
MR BALOYI:  Minister for Public Service and Administration. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  “To add value and to facilitate the 
10 
appointment of nominated candidates to posts of HOD and DDG in 
national departments National EA’s” – what are those? 
MR BALOYI:  Executive Authorities. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  “Are required to forward information on these 
candidates to MPSA which I understand to be the Minister of Public 
Service and Administration.”  And then it says “for this purpose a 
proforma letter and a Cabinet Memorandum containing all relevant 
information should be forwarded to the MPSA at least four weeks before 
the Cabinet Meeting.”   Do you see that? 
MR BALOYI:  I see that. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  For practical reasons departments must deal 
with only one appointment per Cabinet Memorandum. 
MR BALOYI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then there is a note that certain things 
must be attached and that includes a Curriculum Vitae, is that correct? 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 111 of 218 
 
MR BALOYI:  It is correct Ma’am. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then at 19 it is recorded that after 
Cabinet’s concurrence has been obtained the relevant EA which you 
have indicated is Executive Authority will issue an appointment letter to 
the 
successful 
candidate. 
 
Is 
that 
in 
accordance 
with 
your 
understanding of the procedure? 
MR BALOYI:  Yes Ma’am. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Now Mr Baloyi I am mindful of the fact that this 
a protocol about the appointments of Head of Departments and we are 
not dealing with appointments at the moment.  We are dealing with 
10 
transfers from one department to another. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is it your understanding that the same 
procedure is followed? 
MR BALOYI:  Ma’am even when it comes to appointments practical I 
am not talking about theoretical I am talking about in practice what I 
experienced.  Depending on the situation you will find documentation 
referred to the Minister for Public Service and Administration giving a 
time that is sometimes far less than the four weeks.  It depends on the 
situation.  That is exactly.  And if you can go and dig into Cabinet 
20 
Memorandums the documents referred to Ministers of Public Service 
and Administration you will find that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So you – the material condition prevalent dictate what 
happens. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 112 of 218 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But can I establish what are not negotiable 
elements of the process?  Must there be a Cabinet Memorandum? 
MR BALOYI:  There must be a Cabinet Memorandum yes Ma’am I 
agree. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Must the consent of the releasing authority 
have been obtained? 
MR BALOYI:  In as far as transfers okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is the answer yes? 
MR BALOYI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And must Cabinet make a decision about that 
10 
transfer? 
MR BALOYI:  Okay – it is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you probably do understand that when Ms 
Hofmeyr ask these questions starting with must. 
MR BALOYI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She means that she expects you to make a distinction 
between situations where a certain requirement is a must, is obligatory 
and circumstances where there may be departures and that particular 
requirement is not met.  You appreciate that? 
20 
MR BALOYI:  Ja with that clarification Chairperson I indicated that the 
material condition prevalent dictate what happens and I have indicate 
that practically that there will be situations where you will get 
documents calling on you to act and that comes outside the prescribed 
timeline. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 113 of 218 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  Yes.  But just to follow up from the 
Chair’s question.  I understood that evidence and for example I think 
you gave that four weeks that we saw referred to in the protocol may be 
shorter in a given situation.  Is that correct? 
MR BALOYI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But what I understand… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Just articulate your response clearly so 
that it will be captured by the records.  You did say yes but I think it 
might not have been captured.  Did you say yes? 
MR BALOYI:  Ja I said yes.  I said yes Chairperson because when I say 
10 
material condition I am saying it depends on factors at play when a 
consideration is done for the appointment. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
MR BALOYI:  So you do not – you do not necessarily have to say on 
technicality you are sending this back.  For as long as – because the 
issue here it is in order to give enough time for the MPSA to do the 
necessary check check.  So it is possible to do that within a short 
period of time so – so it should be. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  But then just to be clear on your 
evidence.  I then moved on to what has to be the case?  What must be 
20 
the case?  In any circumstance and I understand your evidence to be 
what must be the case on your understanding of transfers?  Is that 
there is the consent from the releasing authority.  There is a Cabinet 
Memorandum and there is a Cabinet decision on the transfers.  Are 
those three things required for a transfer? 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 114 of 218 
 
MR BALOYI:  They are required. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
MR BALOYI:  And the fourth one a Presidential Minute. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I did omit that.  So those are the 
four requirements.  They must be there. 
MR BALOYI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In order for the transfer to be lawful.  Is that 
correct on your understanding? 
MR BALOYI:  That is correct Ma’am. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I would then like to go to the 
10 
transfer of Mr Maseko himself.  You deal with that in some detail in 
your affidavits.  And if I can pick that up in Exhibit NN4 at page 6?   
MR BALOYI:  I am there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And I would like to start for now at paragraph 
D. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before you start Ms Hofmeyr.  Mr Baloyi I just 
want to say to you before you – we get into this part of your evidence. 
MR BALOYI:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That this is a very important part of your evidence. 
MR BALOYI:  Okay. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I know that you did say at the beginning of your 
evidence that it has been a long time. 
MR BALOYI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And without having access to documents within 
government it makes it difficult to remember certain things.  So I just 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 115 of 218 
 
want you to know that when it comes to this it is quite important and it 
is quite important that we know if what you are telling us is something 
that you have a clear recollection of and we must know if you are not 
sure and so on.  Okay? 
MR BALOYI:  Thank – thanks Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  At paragraph D you talk 
about being approached.  Can you tell us who approached you and 
what was said when that approach was made? 
MR BALOYI:  Come again? 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  At paragraph D on page 6. 
MR BALOYI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You talk about being approached on the matter 
concerning Mr Maseko.  Do you see that? 
MR BALOYI:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can you please tell the Chairperson who 
approached you about Mr Maseko and what was said when that 
approach was made? 
MR BALOYI:  The – the Executive Authority of GCIS who was the 
Minister in the Presidency responsible for performance monitoring and 
20 
evaluation at the time is the one who approached me. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.   And just to be clear the person 
who occupied that position at the time was the late Minister Chabane.  
Is that correct? 
MR BALOYI:  Well you mentioning it.   
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 116 of 218 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes I want to know if my understanding of the 
facts is correct. 
MR BALOYI:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it Mr Chabane – Minister Chabane? 
MR BALOYI:  It was – it was Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was? 
MR BALOYI:  It was Chairperson.  It is just that one if not comfortably 
in a habit of singing names but it was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh ja.  It is quite important in this case at least. 
MR BALOYI:  Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes and it may be important for the record in 
due course Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So I will ask for that clarification. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Where it is required. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So the late Minister Chabane approached you 
and what did he say? 
20 
MR BALOYI:  What he said I think I wrote it in – it is there is the – in 
the affidavit. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
MR BALOYI:  That a decision has been taken that Mr Maseko should 
exit. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 117 of 218 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I would like to probe that further in 
a moment but can I just ask you do you have a recollection of when late 
Minister Chabane approached you for this conversation? 
MR BALOYI:  No it is around the time that is what I have indicated that 
I cannot remember exactly when that was. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well can I – can I raise this with you?  There 
has been evidence before the commission that former President Zuma 
was overseas between the 25 January 2011 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh do you want to say – I do not know if it is 
overseas or out of the country? 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Out of the country indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe out of the country is neutral. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is more accurate. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Neutral enough ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  Indeed.  He was out of the country. 
MR BALOYI:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  From the 25 January 2011 until the 1 February 
2011.  And there is also been evidence from a number of witnesses 
before the commission that there were interactions between former 
President Zuma and Minister Chabane about Mr Maseko’s exit from 
20 
GCIS when he was out of the country.  So can I ask do you have any 
certainty as to whether these interactions you had with late Minister 
Chabane occurred in that window period between the 25 January 2011 
and the 1 February 2011? 
MR BALOYI:  I am definitely not sure exactly.  I cannot remember 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 118 of 218 
 
exactly the date and – and I am not privy to the information of the 
President – former President’s movements.  So I will – did not really be 
factually correct in terms of that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm.  But could it have occurred in that week? 
MR BALOYI:  It is the same question Ma’am.  I have indicated that I – I 
cannot remember exactly when that happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe let us put it this way.  You will remember 
that I have just – I just said this is a very important part of the 
evidence you are going to give.  So it is important that we understand. 
MR BALOYI:  Exactly. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  What you recall and what you know and what you do 
not know.  You – you have of course been applying your mind to the 
issue of the – to the circumstances surrounding the transfer of Mr 
Maseko. 
MR BALOYI:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From GCIS to your department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the transfer of Mr Manyi from the Department of 
Labour to GCIS. 
MR BALOYI:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you – you – you have an idea of some of the – of 
those events maybe not everything because you did not have certain 
documents. 
MR BALOYI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – and you would know – you do know that that 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 119 of 218 
 
transfer occurred of both on the 2 February – February 2011.  You 
remember that?  You remember that from the documents you have been 
looking, is that right? 
MR BALOYI:  Ja it has been made clear to me by the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  Referring to a Cabinet meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  Around there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  So in as far as that is concerned. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  I am aware. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are aware. 
MR BALOYI:  But through my recollection. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  I cannot attest to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would not remember. 
MR BALOYI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  Yes.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay now would you be able to say that even though 
you might not remember exactly on what date Minister Chabane 
approached you but it was before this – the date on which Mr Maseko 
was transferred or would you not be able to say that? 
MR BALOYI:  I would be able to say Chairperson.  It was before. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 120 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was before? 
MR BALOYI:  It was before because it was that discussion I had with 
Mr – with the Minister concerned where I initiated his transfer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  I did not get – become aware. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  I initiated it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  The advice that was required of me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR BALOYI:  Was to then say how do we deal with exit management? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  Then I advised on two options. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  And I – and out of those options I recommended one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  So it was definitely before. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was before.  Now I think on Mr Maseko’s evidence 
before this commission the announcement to cabinet that he was to be 
transferred from GCIS as to your department was made during the 
20 
meeting of the cabinet or at the end of the meeting of the cabinet on 
Wednesday the 2 n d February 2011. 
MR BALOYI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – but the Presidential Minute might have been 
signed I think the following day I am not sure or the transfer in terms of 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 121 of 218 
 
the Presidential Minute might have been to the effect that the transfer 
would take effect one day after the signing of the Presidential Minute.  
So when you say – when you say before it was before would you say 
before the – the 2 n d the day of the meeting of that cabinet or you are 
saying before the 3 r d?  Or could it have been on the 2 n d on the day of 
the announcement to cabinet?  Or is it difficult to say? 
MR BALOYI:  No it is not difficult Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR BALOYI:  The Presidential Minute normally is signed after cabinet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  After cabinet yes. 
10 
MR BALOYI:  Because the President exercises his executive 
responsibility as the Executive Authority of the National Executive in 
consultation with a Minister.  And Ministers in a collective body called 
cabinet.  So cabinet has to concur first.  After cabinet concurrence then 
the President signs the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Presidential Minute. 
MR BALOYI:  The Presidential Minute. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  So the announcement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR BALOYI:  In a statement by the GCIS is a statement that get issued 
immediately after cabinet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  After the cabinet that took that decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 122 of 218 
 
MR BALOYI:  So it is either on the same day or the following day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  And then before the cabinet take a decision there has to 
be a Cabinet Memorandum that serve in cabinet.  And then that is the 
Cabinet Memorandum that recommend the transfer.  And that is the 
Cabinet Memorandum that ignite a discussion in cabinet that decide to 
concur. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  And it is that concurrence that then gives the President 
the authority to sign the President Minute.  I think in that sequence. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  But before Minister Chabane – because when I had a 
discussion and I have indicated it there.  When we had a discussion 
and I proposed that Mr Maseko should be – we should consider two 
options.  Either to re-determine his contract and allow him to go and I 
was not for that.  It was actually my – not my liking that at the slightest 
situation or slightest moment or caring we should kick a DG out of 
place.  I then said, let us look at if we have the only route is re-
determination.  If we can we can – we can transfer him.  And when we 
discussed that we agreed with Minister Chabane that that will only 
20 
happen if there is consent – if he agrees himself which is what I 
advised.  And we agreed that both of us should consult him individually.  
So I can imagine that when the decision – if the decision of cabinet was 
on the 2 n d it is a decision that should have preceded having preceded 
by this interactions. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 123 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The consultation? 
MR BALOYI:  The consultations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now are you able to say the approach to you by 
Minister Chabane was or would have been a few days before the 
cabinet meeting where the announcement was made?  Or would you say 
it may have been weeks before?  It may have been months before.  
What are you able to say in that regard? 
MR BALOYI:  I cannot remember Chairperson exactly as to when. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  I cannot – I cannot recall as to exactly when.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR BALOYI:  That actually happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But … 
MR BALOYI:  There is a letter that Minister Chabane wrote. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  And which letter I got from – from the commission and 
which letter will be helpful to deal with such issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think Ms Hofmeyr will take you to that letter at the 
right – at the right time. 
MR BALOYI:  Okay. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you able - would the date of that letter assist you 
to - to say maybe it was a few days before or - when we get to it we … 
MR BALOYI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We might not have to get - go - get to it, but 
Ms Hofmeyr might decide let us go to it immediately if that is going to 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 124 of 218 
 
help.  Would you think it might help you in terms of estimating? 
MR BALOYI:  I - I think so Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It may.  Okay.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair and Mr Baloyi you will find it in EXHIBIT 
NN5 … 
MR BALOYI:  NN5. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you will find it at page 43 - 4-3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say 4-6? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  4-3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  4-3. 
10 
MR BALOYI:  NN5 you say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you got NN5? 
MR BALOYI:  I am - I am … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you got NN5?  Just go and assist … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And it is page 43. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Assist him to … 
MR BALOYI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - you need to look at the spine of the file to see 
whether it is NN5 or not and then … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Baloyi I think you might be ibn NN1 to four.  
20 
The other file - the large file in front of you … 
MR BALOYI:  This one?  Oh.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is probably NN5. 
MR BALOYI:  Five. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 125 of 218 
 
MR BALOYI:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then if you go to page … 
MR BALOYI:  Sorry. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  43 - 4-3. 
MR BALOYI:  Page 43? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  That is the letter I think you are referring 
to, but you can tell me if I am in correct. 
MR BALOYI:  You say it is page? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  4-3 - 43. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 43.  Page 43.  You look at the - for page 
10 
numbers you look at the red numbers at the right hand corner at the 
top. 
MR BALOYI:  Oh.  The red numbers? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  The red numbers at the top. 
MR BALOYI:  Oh, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Look for - when you say - when you say 43.  It is 0-4-
3 but we … 
MR BALOYI:  Oh, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But we do not - we do not say zero. 
MR BALOYI:  I am there. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are there.  Okay.  Ms Hofmeyr do you want to 
take it from there? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Baloyi is that the letter you were referring 
to? 
MR BALOYI:  That is the letter I am referring to. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 126 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That letter is dated 2 February 2011 which would be 
the Wednesday of the Cabinet Meeting.  Can you see that? 
MR BALOYI:  I - I see that Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and it is addressed to you. 
MR BALOYI:  It is addressed to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By Minister Chabane? 
MR BALOYI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It says: 
“I concur subject to the President’s approval with 
the transfer of Mr T J Maseko the Director-General 
10 
of the Government Communication and Information 
System - GCIS - in terms of Section 12(3)(a) to the 
post of Director-General of the Department of 
Public Service and Administration - DPSA.” 
MR BALOYI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  “The proposed effective date of the transfer 
namely the date following the date that the 
President signs the President Minute is also 
supported.” 
MR BALOYI:  Okay. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is - it is - he - he signed it on 2 February. 
MR BALOYI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The same date of the Cabinet Meeting. 
MR BALOYI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When then do you think he approached you? 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 127 of 218 
 
MR BALOYI:  I think it - it could be that week before … 
CHAIRPERSON:  During that week? 
MR BALOYI:  Before - ja.  Before the 2 n d. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And - and you are fairly confident that it must be 
during that week? 
MR BALOYI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am not saying you are certain. 
MR BALOYI:  Oh.  Yes.  I am - I am … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I am just saying you are fairly confident. 
MR BALOYI:  I am - I am fairly confident Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  Thank you.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Baloyi if I can then ask 
you to go back to your affidavit which is in NN4 which is the other file 
you had in front of you a moment ago. 
MR BALOYI:  The other file.  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are going to NN4? 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair and if you - if I can suggest Mr Baloyi 
just to keep NN4 available to you, because we will keep going back into 
it. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 128 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  NN5? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  NN4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  For the moment, because Mr Baloyi put that 
away when he moved to NN5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So my suggestion is just to keep it available … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because we will be working with your 
statements and then on occasion we will have to go to NN5 … 
10 
MR BALOYI:  No problem. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  For a document. 
MR BALOYI:  No problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So I asked you to go back to NN4 and then if 
we could pick it up at page 14 - 1-4, because here you start to give 
more details about that interaction that you had with Minister Chabane. 
MR BALOYI:  Ja.  I am there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you have given evidence on this a moment 
ago in your testimony.  If you could pick it up at paragraph B on that 
20 
page. 
MR BALOYI:  B, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You say there: 
“It was in that discussion …” 
And you are describing a discussion between yourself and 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 129 of 218 
 
Minister Chabane. 
“…where I made a proposal for Mr Maseko’s 
transfer to the Department of Public Service and 
Administration after it came to light that there was a 
decision for his exit.” 
MR BALOYI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What - what does that mean Mr Baloyi?  What 
was communicated to you about Mr - from Minister Chabane? 
MR BALOYI:  It communicates that there was an Executive Authority’s 
position that a - a - Mr Maseko’s exit shall be managed and that is the 
10 
advice he was coming to me for. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And can I just be… 
MR BALOYI:  (Intervenes) Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before we go further was this discussion over the 
phone or in a meeting between the two of you? 
MR BALOYI:  It - it was not over the phone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were - you … 
MR BALOYI:  But I - I - I mean I cannot remember exactly where we 
were.  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But - but it was not over the phone? 
20 
MR BALOYI:  No.  It was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see together? 
MR BALOYI:  We were together. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  Alright.  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And as I have your testimony he said it is a 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 130 of 218 
 
decision of the Executive Authority.  Is that correct? 
MR BALOYI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what did you understand that to mean?  
Did you understand it to mean it is a decision of Minister Chabane or it 
is a decision of the Presidency? 
MR BALOYI:  No.  The Executive Authority who is a line function 
Minister 
and 
Principal 
of 
Mr Maseko 
is 
Mr Chabane 
- 
was 
Minister Chabane. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So he conveyed to you it was his decision? 
MR BALOYI:  No, no, no.  He - what he said there - there is a decision.  
10 
As to with who he consulted because remember madam their - their 
responsibility to appoint and to decide - to appoint and to transfer and 
to facilitate - to - to initiate exit has to be supported by the President.  
So - so I did not ask details as to whether you as Minister did you 
approach the - the President. 
He then said there is a definite decision that Mr Maseko has 
to - to leave and as Minister of Public Service can you assist us with 
exit management.  That is when then I came in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you proceed Ms Hofmeyr.  I wonder whether 
Mr Baloyi as far as you can.  You can just tell me that conversation 
20 
between the two of you as you remember it.  This is what Mr Chabane 
said.  This is what you said until you finalised the issue in that 
discussion. 
MR BALOYI:  Thanks Chairperson.  The - the initial point was that I am 
being informed there is a decision.  Mr Maseko - he has to leave and 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 131 of 218 
 
then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR BALOYI:  The advice we need from is on the exit management and 
then we discussed about that, because my input in the discussion was 
that who took - is it him who initiated the decision and the answer was 
no.  It is not Mr Maseko.  When I say him Chair I mean … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Ja.  You mean Mr Maseko? 
MR BALOYI:  Ja.  It was not Mr Maseko who initiated the move.  So - 
and I understood what that means and then I gave an advice in our 
discussion and what - what transpired in that discussion was when I 
10 
indicated that I - I personally have a problem, because it is a bad 
reflection of our - our - for our Public Service to have DGs kicked out at 
- at any opportunity that we feel like doing that. 
Does not augur well for stability in the Public Service and - 
and then the - the route that we can do, but if we have - there was 
nothing that we can do, because if - if you get to understand there is - 
there is what is referred to as irretrievable breakdown of - of trust and 
which is a common thing.  You have to then manage that - that one, 
because I asked is there anything wrong that he did and the - and the 
issue was no. 
20 
There is nothing wrong that has been done, but the time is - 
the decision is that he needs to - to exit and then that is the discussion 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So is my understanding correct that what you are 
saying is that he approached you.  That is Minister Chabane and said 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 132 of 218 
 
that a decision has been taken that Mr Maseko should leave GCIS.  Is 
that right? 
MR BALOYI:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and that he was seeking from you an advice on 
how to manage that exit. 
MR BALOYI:  Correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right and that you asked him the question 
whether it was Mr Maseko who had initiated the - the - his departure 
from GCIS. 
MR BALOYI:  Yes Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right and the answer was no? 
MR BALOYI:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and - and you - you then say you understood 
that. 
MR BALOYI:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
MR BALOYI:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So then from then you began to give advice.  Is that 
right? 
MR BALOYI:  Yes.  Correct Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  If we can then go to page 7 
of EXHIBIT NN4.  That is still in your affidavit. 
MR BALOYI:  I am there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  At “g” on that page you say: 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 133 of 218 
 
“I discussed with is Principal …” 
That is a reference to Mr Maseko’s Principal. 
“…and obtained concurrence.” 
Do you see that? 
MR BALOYI:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Who is the Principal you are referring to there? 
MR BALOYI:  Minister in the Presidency. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That would be Minister Chabane at the time? 
MR BALOYI:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then at “h” you say: 
10 
“I discussed with Mr Maseko and got his consent.” 
Do you see that? 
MR BALOYI:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Baloyi, Mr Maseko’s evidence before the 
Commission is that you did not obtain his consent prior to the 
announcement 
of 
the 
transfer 
in 
the 
Cabinet 
Meeting 
on 
2 February 2011.  Are you aware that that is his evidence? 
CHAIRPERSON:  In fact he says he had no discussion with you on his 
transfer before the transfer - before the announcement of the transfer - 
of his transfer in Cabinet. 
20 
MR BALOYI:  Yes.  Thanks Chairperson.  Thanks Madam.  I - I became 
aware of that version when I received the - the affidavit from the 
Commission and as I have indicated there.  I became so surprised to - 
to get to understand that, because as far as I am concerned from my 
recollection I had a discussion with him. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 134 of 218 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well Mr Maseko in - in answer to some of the 
Chair’s questions when he gave evidence last month - in November - 
said that he thought you might have been confusing two different 
discussions.  He said that he recalls a discussion with you when he was 
in DPSA after he had been transferred and he was coming to talk to you 
about exit and he said in the course of that meeting he discussed the 
fact that he wanted to leave Public Service and he says his assumption 
is that you may have concluded that - confused that later conversation 
with a conversation that occurred prior to his transfer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or - or … 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you have a comment on that? 
MR BALOYI:  I will - I will … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe that did not occur. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That did not occur indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja.  He - he said - he said he never had a 
discussion with you about his transfer from GCIS to DPSA prior to the 
day when he called you to tell you he was your new DG.  He says prior 
to that he had had no discussion with you whatsoever, but he says after 
spending some time in your department as DG.  He did have some 
discussion with you around the possibility of him leaving the - your 
20 
department … 
MR BALOYI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he says some of the things that you say in your 
affidavit - maybe it is one.  I am saying some of the things. 
MR BALOYI:  Hm.  Hm. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 135 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe it is one thing.  He says no, no, no.  That is 
something we discussed at the meeting when I was about to leave 
DPSA.  It is not something I discussed with Minister Baloyi before my 
transfer from GCIS.  He said I think the former Minister may have been 
genuinely confused about which discussion happened when. 
MR BALOYI:  Thanks - thanks Chair and ma’am, because you raised it 
that you said I could be confusing these things.  I - I would not use that 
strong word … (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe we must - maybe we must - my 
understanding of - of his use of that word was - was that he did not 
10 
mean anything bad.  He was simply saying it has been a long time … 
MR BALOYI:  I see. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I think that - that is what he - he meant.  That is 
my understanding. 
MR BALOYI:  In - in that context Chairperson, because I thought I 
would use the very same word, but it was so strong to me.  I cannot 
refer, but in that context I can actually say most probably - because 
that is his version.  Most probably if there was any confusion it could 
be honest, but I am quite clear Chairperson that I had a discussion with 
him and - and our discussion went very far. 
20 
We talked about quite a number of things.  He indicated to 
me, because there was not a lot of time remaining for the expiry of the 
contract and this where I committed that on chief.  If - if we - we look at 
this and if it may so happen that the time of your contract come to 
expire and you are still here and I am still here.  I am even ready to - 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 136 of 218 
 
to extend that. 
We discussed that about a lot of things.  So I did had a 
discussion with him.  I am not confused about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well would there be other aspects of that discussion 
that you recall that you can tell me about?  Obviously … 
MR BALOYI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Something that is - that you - you may say.  Just to - 
to - to indicate you - you recall that discussion with him quite well. 
MR BALOYI:  In our discussion Chairperson we even went to a point 
where I then said if you think maybe as a - as a DG you know at - at a 
10 
slightest opportunity that the Minister decides to then say go.  You - 
you are actually vulnerable and stuff like that.  I mean we discussed 
even about the possibility of him becoming my advisor.  I raised this 
thing with him and the other thing Chairperson was that he then said no 
look. 
Even if I come and work with you I have made up my mind I 
am not going to - to be long in the Public Service.  I have got other 
options to pursue.  That was part of the discussions that we had, 
because - because I was trying to prevent a situation where under a 
cloud he then leaves, because if - if you - you redetermine the contract. 
20 
I mean - in - in public eyes there is nothing else other than 
that that DG has been fired and it does not augur well for stability in 
our Public Service.  Those are the things that we - we offered to.  So 
honestly speaking I am not confuse Chairperson about - about this 
thing.  These are discussions that took place between us - the two of 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 137 of 218 
 
us and it was part of the agreement I had with Minister Chabane. 
To then say let us consult him individually and when 
Minister Chabane wrote this letter it - it was - it was I having given him 
feedback of the consent that was there.  So well it is upstream.  That is 
his nature. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are quite clear? 
MR BALOYI:  Come again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are quite clear? 
MR BALOYI:  I am quite clear Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and was this discussion with him over the phone 
10 
or you had a meeting with him? 
MR BALOYI:  No Chair.  It - it was not over the phone.  I - I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You had a - a meeting with him? 
MR BALOYI:  I had a meeting with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and would you recall whether that meeting may 
have been the day before the Cabinet Meeting? 
MR BALOYI:  That was the day before I gave feedback to 
Minister Chabane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  He … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  And - and he … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so … 
MR BALOYI:  I am not sure.  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it - it would have been before the Wednesday 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 138 of 218 
 
when the announcement of his transfer was made to Cabinet? 
MR BALOYI:  What … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your meeting with him. 
MR BALOYI:  What can also help is access to the Cabinet 
Memorandum … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  Because the Cabinet Memorandum as the pro forma 
indicates … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  Has a date. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  And - and the Cabinet Memorandum can be only 
developed when you have satisfied this … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  This requirement.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and you think in that memorandum you may have 
referred to the fact that you had a discussion with him or something 
like that or not necessarily? 
MR BALOYI:  Ja Chair.  In - in the transfer … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR BALOYI:  If it is a transfer in the Cabinet Memorandum Cabinet will 
like to see if there is consent from the releasing Minister.  If there is 
consent from the receiving Minister and actually if there is concurrence 
from the two Ministers and if it is consent from - from the official to be 
transferred.  It - it has to be indicated in the Cabinet Memorandum.  So 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 139 of 218 
 
if we can have to access to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but … 
MR BALOYI:  It might be actually clarify that thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I - I am not sure whether anything in such a 
memorandum if we find it saying that there was consent from his side 
would help, because I think that my understanding of his evidence is 
that ultimately the transfer did happen with his consent, but the point is 
what gave rise to the need for his transfer. 
Who initiated?  Where did this idea that he should be 
transferred come from?  Who did it come from and why?  So - so if - if - 
10 
if your memorandum would reflect that he has consented without saying 
that the consent - without saying that there was a discussion between 
the two of you.  It might not help on this particular issue … 
MR BALOYI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if it were to say that you had a meeting with him 
or you had a discussion with him maybe that might help, but you - you 
might not be able to remember whether it would say anything like that. 
MR BALOYI:  Ja.  No Chair.  Yes.  Thanks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  I - I maybe not be able to … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  To recall and on the - on the decision which is the reason 
for the exit like I have indicated.  That is surely outside the position the 
mandate of the Minister … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 140 of 218 
 
MR BALOYI:  For Public Service and Administration. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes. 
MR BALOYI: 
 
All 
what 
the 
Minister 
for 
Public 
Service 
and 
Administration was to do … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  Was to advice or facilitate the exit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The exit. 
MR BALOYI:  And - and I had to find a comfortable exit … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  And - and for me at the time the comfortable exit was 
10 
exactly around … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  Not taking him out of the - of the Public Service.  
Keeping him within. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  There are a few aspects of 
your recent answer I would like to pick up on … 
MR BALOYI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Baloyi. 
MR BALOYI:  Yes ma’am. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  As I understood your testimony you said when 
you were recounting for the Chair what occurred in this discussion with 
Mr Maseko. 
MR BALOYI:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You said you were discussing how there was 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 141 of 218 
 
not much longer left on his contract.  Do you recall that? 
MR BALOYI:  How the what? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There was not much time left on his contract.  
Do you recall saying that?  That is contract was coming to an end fairly 
shortly when you had the discussion. 
MR BALOYI:  I think I mentioned that when I - I talked about my offer. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  To then say even if it was to be - because his concern 
was that no it is the same.  I take you in - you take me in.  In no time 
my contract expires or at no time you also decided I - I leave.  So what 
10 
is the use?  That is when i then said no, no.  We can - we can look at 
this thing.  It was a decision I took to have him was looking at the value 
that he can actually add in the department. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes and as I understand your testimony that is 
part of what you recall about the discussion that you recall occurring 
before his transfer. 
MR BALOYI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that correct? 
MR BALOYI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Now what would have had to have been - that 
20 
conversation - towards the end of January 2011?  Do you accept that 
based on the time that we have worked out with you in your evidence? 
MR BALOYI:  You are saying it will be? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The conversation prior to Mr Maseko being 
transferred on 2 February.  Your evidence previously was it could have 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 142 of 218 
 
happened in that week before.  Do you recall saying that? 
MR BALOYI:  Madam I have responded to that and - and keeping and 
harping on the same issue. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  Is to push me to a point where I will have to - to - to then 
say look yes or - I have responded to that question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  No.  Mr Baloyi she is not pushing you to 
anything.  She is just wanting to make sure.  She has a question that 
she wants to ask you, but before she asks you she wants to make sure 
that she understood you correctly.  She just wants you to confirm that 
10 
you said that the consultation between you and Minister Chabane 
happened during that week. 
MR BALOYI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which is what you said.  All you need to say is yes.  
It had during that week. 
MR BALOYI:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then she asks the next question. 
MR BALOYI:  Exactly madam. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In January 2011 there was still 18 months left 
on Mr Maseko’s contract.  Are you aware of that? 
20 
MR BALOYI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So why would he be saying in that context that 
there is a very little bit of time left? 
MR BALOYI:  18 months is a short period of time compared to three 
years, compared to four years, compared to five years. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 143 of 218 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So in that context you understood 18 months to 
be a short period of time? 
MR BALOYI:  No.  No.  I - I did not raise it myself.  It was in our 
discussion.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is it not possibly more likely that when he was 
discussing with you his exit from DPSA which was later in 2011 around 
July. 
MR BALOYI:  July.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  As I understand his evidence. 
MR BALOYI:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  When there was less than a year left on his 
contract. 
MR BALOYI:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That that is when you might have had the 
discussion about there not being much more time left on the contract? 
MR BALOYI:  No.  No.  That is not.  I mean that - that is exactly not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can I ask you?  As I did with regard to your 
discussion or conversation with Minister Chabane.  Can I ask you to 
just take me through your conversation with Mr Maseko as it happened?  
You - you - the two of you met.  Can you just take me through … 
20 
MR BALOYI:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That conversation as far as you are able to in the 
light of the lapse of time?  This is how the subject was introduced.  You 
- you must have introduced the subject yourself … 
MR BALOYI:  Oh, yes. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 144 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then the discussion up to the end as you 
remember the discussion. 
MR BALOYI:  Yes.  Thanks Chairperson.  As I remember is I indicated 
to him that your Principal has indicated to me that when we need to 
manage your exit and I then introduced the option.  I then indicate that 
in our discussion I proposed to him that there - there are two routes to 
deal with that.  Either we take the route of redetermination.  In which 
case I will get officials from the department to calculate as to what the 
- the separation package is going to be. 
Is a fair mechanism of exit if that has to be, but I indicated 
10 
that - but I also identified that we can also look at the other - the other 
option.  That of retaining you within the broader Public Service through 
- through transfers.  That is - that is how I introduced the matter and 
that is when we discussed up to and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what was his response? 
MR BALOYI:   His response was I indicated to him that if I would prefer 
the one of – I recommended to him the one of transfer and he gave 
consent, he said it’s okay let’s work on it but do know that the – I have 
got other options, my stay in the public service I have been around and 
of course it is true, I have been around, I was a member of Parliament, 
20 
so I have been around, I don’t think I still have more time in here and I 
have got options that I am considering.   So that is the discussion but 
ultimately I got his consent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he raise any questions with you as to why he was 
required to leave GCIS, did he say anything, did he raise any question 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 145 of 218 
 
or did he express any unhappiness to you about him having to leave 
GCIS and so on, I just want to get as full a picture of that discussion 
between the two of you as possible. 
MR BALOYI:   Chair he did not indicate to me why or what he was told 
as the reasons for his exit, because he was aware also because when I 
indicated to him I said no my Minister has informed me about that, so 
he didn’t go in and I didn’t enquire more than that.  In as far as whether 
he was happy about that or he was worried about that normally I mean 
for a contract employee to have his contract having to come to the end 
not initiated by him for obvious reasons, I mean it can be expected that 
10 
– it is a cause for concern. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Chair if I may pick up on that Mr Maseko’s 
evidence was that he was informed that he would need to move from 
GCIS by Minister Chabane over the weekend prior to the meeting of 
cabinet on the 2 n d of February.   I understand your evidence to be when 
you had this conversation with him he had already been told by Minister 
Chabane that he needed to move, is that correct? 
MR BALOYI:   Ja, he said he was already told and ...[intervenes]  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Do you recall if you met him on a weekend or a 
20 
weekday? 
MR BALOYI:   No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   You don’t recall. 
MR BALOYI:   No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Okay but if Mr Maseko’s evidence is correct 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 146 of 218 
 
and he got informed on that weekend I think his evidence might have 
been the the Sunday but we can confirm that it was definitely at some 
point of the weekend, that would have left the Monday and the Tuesday 
before the cabinet meeting on the Wednesday to have had this meeting 
with him, do you accept that? 
MR BALOYI:   If he? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   If he had only been informed that he was going 
to be moved from GCIS on the weekend prior to the meeting on 
Wednesday then the weekdays left during which you could have met 
with him to have this discussion were either Monday the 31 s t of  
10 
January or Tuesday the 1 s t of February, do you accept that? 
MR BALOYI:   Well I have no comment on that, it is his version, it is 
not my version that he was told on the Saturday and stuff like that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed but you don’t dispute that it might have 
been that the meeting you recall happened on the Monday or the 
Tuesday? 
MR BALOYI:   I cannot dispute or confirm that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.   Mr Maseko’s evidence was that 
during those two days of the week prior to a cabinet meeting he – I 
forget what he said, he said he sort of goes underground because he 
20 
needs to prepare for that cabinet meeting being the cabinet 
spokesperson and so he goes through all the memoranda that are 
before cabinet etcetera, and he said it was for that reason again highly 
unlikely that he would have had a meeting with you in those two days.  
Do you still say that that evidence before the Commission of Mr Maseko 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 147 of 218 
 
was false? 
MR BALOYI:   I never said Mr Maseko’s evidence was false, I never 
said, I said I respect his version, in as much as he to respect mine.   
So I can’t respond there madam and say I am saying it was false, I am 
not saying that, I never said that, I will not say it, because for me you 
can only say false if you know that this person is saying something 
deliberately knowing that that is not the truth, so I am not at that 
space, and it is not my version, it is his. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Mr Baloyi I am not asking that you take a view 
on whether what Mr Maseko said was deliberately false, as I 
10 
understand your evidence it is that you are certain that you had to 
discuss a meeting with him prior to the 2 n d of February at which you 
discussed his move to DPSA and in which he gave you consent to being 
transferred to DPSA, is that your evidence? 
MR BALOYI:   The point I said is that in my discussion with Minister 
Chabane we agreed that both of us should consult him individually and 
then you say it was on a Saturday that he was informed and I am 
saying I cannot remember when was it that I actually had a discussion 
with him. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And Mr Baloyi that is why when I asked the 
20 
most recent question I didn’t put a time on it, because it’s very 
important for this Commission to get your evidence absolutely clear on 
this because Mr Maseko’s evidence is absolutely clear on this, so 
...[intervenes]  
MR BALOYI:   And I think mine also, sorry to interrupt, I think mine 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 148 of 218 
 
also is clear, the decision may be yours to decide, not ...[intervenes]  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed, not mine sir. 
MR BALOYI:   Not to accept it as clear, in as far as I am concerned my 
evidence is clear. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And that is to be ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe do you think Mr Maseko must be mistaken in 
saying or in saying that he had no discussion with you about his 
transfer before the announcement to cabinet? 
MR BALOYI:   What I am stating clearly Chairperson is that I had a 
discussion with him 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:   So you have two versions here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:   Richard Baloyi’s version. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:   And Themba Maseko’s version. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes,. 
MR BALOYI:   They are not aligned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:   But if they are not aligned there is no suggestion that 
20 
this one is more correct than the other one, I am speaking about what I 
know Chairperson and I never lied. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, you can say no more, you say this is what you 
know to be the truth. 
MR BALOYI:   That’s what I know Chairperson, exactly. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 149 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you – I think the question that Ms Hofmeyr was 
asking and also the one I was asking is just to see whether you have 
any reason to think he has a different version because of anything 
other than maybe a bona fide mistake of what happened because of the 
lapse of time, memory, or is it possible that you think there might be 
some other reason why – whether you might be thinking that he knows 
what the truth is, he knows that the truth is what I am saying but maybe 
he has another reason for not saying the same thing as I – which I am 
putting forward because it is the truth, or you say look I believe that if 
he says he had no discussion with me before the announcement to to 
10 
Cabinet I have no reason to believe he is deliberately misleading the 
Commission.   It must be that in good faith he thinks there was no 
discussion but from my side I am saying there was a discussion and 
that’s what you are able to say. 
MR BALOYI:   Exactly Chairperson, that is what I am saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That’s what you are saying. 
MR BALOYI:   I mean me and Maseko are coming to talk about these 
things now, some period lapsed, I never – in fact there was never any 
bad blood anything between us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, I think he says the same thing if I am not 
20 
mistaken. 
MR BALOYI:   He says the same thing, I think it is right, I mean I never 
– that is why I was surprised about other things I’m sure we will come 
to those questions, so it could be the fact is and I want the Commission 
to accept that I am not fabricating this position that I had a discussion 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 150 of 218 
 
with him.   So that is the thing, and that is why I am sure the 
investigators may have indicated on the first day when I came to me the 
investigators I said but is it possible that we can meet and really, I was 
so surprised and I am as surprised as it is now, but as you said 
Chairperson the possibility is the cracks of oblivion that I spoke about 
earlier on may not only be affecting one person, it may be affecting 
both of us so if there is a way of establishing, you might find that or 
maybe the truth is more or the reality is more on his side, or the reality 
is more on my side, so there is no malice, there is no malicious intent, 
it is the question of recall and when you deal with a call over a period 
10 
of time your ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, different people might have different 
recollections. 
MR BALOYI:   Different, unfortunately there is no file you can go and 
look at because we are not taking minutes of our discussions, so that is 
the issue.  So you are right Chairperson that is exactly, I am not saying 
he is lying, that is why I even said I did not use a strong word to him.  I 
can use a strong word to any other person, but I must have  a reason, 
and there is no reason that I can use to him because there was really 
no bad blood. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair.  I would like to go to the 
process again for transfers which you have outlined for us.   Mr Baloyi 
there have been engagements between the Commission and the Office 
of the Presidency in relation to that 2 February 2011 cabinet meeting 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 151 of 218 
 
MR BALOYI:   Mmm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   This was made known at the evidence of Mr 
Maseko but at that stage we had not yet obtained an affidavit from the 
office of the Presidency, we have subsequently obtained that, and it 
has been added to NN5, I will take us there in a moment if I may, but 
the evidence of the Presidency is that they have gone back and 
checked the minutes of the Cabinet meeting of the 2 n d of February. 
MR BALOYI:   Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And there was no Cabinet Memorandum that 
served before Cabinet on that day about the transfers of Mr Manyi or 
10 
Mr Maseko, are you aware of that? 
MR BALOYI:   No, no I am not aware, you remember I requested that 
some of the documents they are with the investigators, some of the 
documents that I requested was please let me have a copy of the 
Cabinet Memorandum, I didn’t remember that and if that is what the 
Presidency is saying let us leave it as the testimony of the Presidency, 
it is not mine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Right, but I understood your evidence earlier 
was that you can’t recall whether you were in fact present at that 
meeting of cabinet on the 2 n d of February is that right? 
20 
MR BALOYI:   Ja, maybe – yes I answered that question, I said it is 
right, maybe because you see the Presidency has indicated referring to 
the minutes have they indicated I was present? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   That we are following up with them over the 
break, because I had understood that it would likely be common cause 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 152 of 218 
 
that you weren’t at that meeting.  When you raised it in your evidence 
earlier we have been making efforts – can I just explain we have never 
received the minutes of the 2 n d of February because the way, if we had 
we would quickly be able to check the attendance, right, but the 
processes of the Commission are such that Cabinet minutes are 
generally classified, so we have to engage a process to request 
declassification and in order to do that we need to identify the items in 
the minutes in respect of which we require declassification. 
MR BALOYI:   Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So what happened is we engaged with the 
10 
Presidency, we said go to the minutes of the 2 n d of February 2011 and 
declassify so that we can receive the minutes anything dealing with the 
transfers of Mr Manyi and Mr Maseko.  The consequence of that is that 
they went and checked, I will take you to the affidavit now, there is no 
recordal of any discussion whatsoever in Cabinet on that day nor the 
decision taken by Cabinet on that day relating to the transfers of the Mr 
Manyi and Mr Maseko, nor any Cabinet memorandum in relation to 
those transfers. 
 
The consequence of that is we don’t get the minute, because 
what we identified for declassification doesn’t exist, I just want you to 
20 
understand the process. 
MR BALOYI:   I see, I see. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Right, so the evidence of the Presidency 
...[intervenes]  
MR BALOYI:   Maybe I should comment there, if the evidence you have 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 153 of 218 
 
is that there was not Cabinet but there was an announcement then 
that’s a question that the Chair of Cabinet definitely he can talk, it is 
something that falls outside, even if I am there if things happen like 
that it means it would have happened like that but like I said I don’t 
recall, but I think the Chair of Cabinet will then do, because it will be 
something that I am not sure is unheard of, that appointments are done 
through announcements and not done through the necessary processes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you see Mr Baloyi I was very keen from the 
beginning to hear what you had to say about this transfer and originally 
what I was interested in is what Mr Maseko had testified about because 
10 
in effect said my transfer to – from GCIS to DPSA was ultimately 
rushed so much that Minister Baloyi, who was not at the Cabinet 
Meeting, had to hear from me for the first time that I was his new DG, 
because on the day of the Cabinet Meeting, which was the 2 n d of 
February, he says it came to his and Minister Chabane’s attention that 
E-News or ENCA was running the story that he was being replaced by 
Mr Manyi as CEO of GCIS and he alerted Mr Chabane about this and 
they realised that a decision about where he was going needed to be 
done immediately because otherwise if there is a delay about that the 
impression out there to the public would be like he has been fired, 
20 
because if it simply says he has been replaced by Mr Manyi and there 
is no, nothing about he has gone to another department and then 
apparently Minister Chabane then approached the President and had a 
discussion during the – with him – or whispered something into his ear 
while the meeting was on and then before the end of the Cabinet 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 154 of 218 
 
Meeting the announcement was made, so he was – he then says, he 
says Minister Baloyi was not at that meeting of Cabinet on that day but 
now we had to – this whole thing had to be rushed and when I phoned 
him he was surprised and he said he was not aware of the transfer or 
something to that effect so I wanted to know that’s why initially I 
wanted to hear your evidence how did this come about that you are the 
Minister of Department, you’re getting a DG, you don’t know, is that 
something normal, is that how it happened blah-blah-blah-blah so when 
you say if there was an appointment or a transfer that happened by 
announcement and there was no memo, Cabinet Memo and so on, it 
10 
would be very strange.   
 
I am just saying part of what I found strange was that a 
Minister on Mr Maseko’s version a Minister would have a DG imposed 
on him like that, what was so urgent about that. 
 
So I am just giving you the background because you hinted on 
this being strange if the Cabinet would not have had any discussion, 
would not have made any decision but just an announcement would 
have been made, so you can understand, ja. 
MR BALOYI:   I do understand Chairperson and that is why I am saying 
if the due process was not followed, because a Presidential Minute is 
20 
there, I got it from the Commission, a Presidential Minute is signed and 
co-signed.  What needs to be established is whether there was a 
Cabinet Memorandum and what I am getting now is that it is like there 
was no Cabinet Memorandum to that effect, it was just an 
announcement, because it does happen, it happened a lot that due to 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 155 of 218 
 
commitments I will not be in Cabinet when appointments have to be 
done but always there will be a Minister who on my behalf will deal with 
that, so it never arose I mean if it was because of the urgency, I think it 
was 
an 
extraordinary 
urgent 
occurrence 
not 
in 
keeping 
with 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  How things normally happened.  
MR BALOYI:   How things normally happened because I will be duty 
bound sometimes to not be in Cabinet and then, but if I am out of the 
country there will be a Minister acting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who would be acting? 
10 
MR BALOYI:   And that Minister was acting as the one who is going to 
present the Cabinet Memorandum.  If I am in the country but not in 
cabinet there will be a minister who will do the same, so honestly 
speaking it is just that we need – these are some of the things 
Chairperson that raised my frustrations when I indicated to then say 
this is a State process, and as a State process that has a government, 
and it is not a new government, it is the same government.   
 
Now if we have to have access to records an there has to be a 
merry-go-round I mean really we are not helpful to the public and I 
think something needs to be established.  I there is no Cabinet Memo 
20 
recommending an appointment and there is an appointment it is 
something that maybe we may need to search further.   Like I indicated 
in my opening statement that I approached my employer all the time to 
then say they may be in a position to facilitate.    
 
I mean the records of DPSA you will find there’s documents 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 156 of 218 
 
there, it will be simple to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm, well Ms Hofmeyr you can take forward, I do 
know as you know that some documents that you have been given come 
from DPSA, the Commission’s Legal Team and investigators were in 
touch with the DPSA and certain documents were obtained, but Ms 
Hofmeyr can deal with that. 
MR BALOYI:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Much better. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair.  Mr Baloyi if we can go to 
page 18 of EXHIBIT NN4, that’s page 18, I would like to pick up on 
10 
what you say there about what transpired at the Cabinet Meeting on the 
2 n d of February but before we go there we have as we have been 
speaking Chair and Mr Baloyi had a response from the Office of the 
Presidency, they have checked the minutes for us and it is confirmed 
that Mr Baloyi was not present on the 2 n d of February, they very kindly 
come back to us under great urgency. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   We will ask for an affidavit confirming that 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And just also in relation to Ms Oliphant they 
20 
did confirm that she was present, so those were the two items from this 
morning’s evidence we wanted to follow up on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   But Mr Baloyi at paragraph F on page 18 you 
state there: 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 157 of 218 
 
“For  me everything was above Board and it was confirmed 
when the transfer memorandum served before Cabinet as 
there was no issue raised about the transfer.” 
Where did you obtain that information from? 
MR BALOYI:   I co-signed the Presidential Minute with the President.  
That comes after a Cabinet Meeting and ought to come after the 
Cabinet Memorandum.  That statement I wrote there is cut off those 
that are then supposedly, I think the process, the due process was 
followed.   This is what because you may not have a President’s Minute 
signed without the processes that are to come, if that was the case so 
10 
to answer your question I am getting this from them, because it is my 
signature that is on the President’s Minute as co-signing the 
President’s Minute. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So did you ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, do you have an independent recollection 
that there was a Cabinet Memorandum or are you saying you think that 
there was a cabinet memorandum because you can’t think of how there 
can be a presidential minute signed without there being a cabinet 
memorandum on the matter. 
MR BALOYI:   Exactly Chairperson, the latter part. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The latter, yes, so you don’t have in independent 
recollection that you did see the memorandum? 
MR BALOYI:   I don’t have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You don’t have yes. 
MR BALOYI:   Even the President’s minute I got it from the 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 158 of 218 
 
Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes okay. 
MR BALOYI:   And I then said can we get the Cabinet Memorandum 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:   Because that cabinet memorandum will assist a lot. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and ordinarily the kind of Cabinet Memorandum 
we are talking about here if it does exist or did exist, would have been 
prepared by your Department for you? 
MR BALOYI:   Exactly Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay but as things stand you don’t have an 
10 
independent recollection that there was such a memorandum, you just 
think it – you think it probably was there because all the time whenever 
there’s a Presidential Minute there there would have been a Cabinet 
memorandum before. 
MR BALOYI:   Ja, there would have been concurrence by Cabinet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:   And Cabinet during my turn has never given concurrence 
to a verbal announcement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR BALOYI:   So that is exactly what I – I mean I can’t base on what 
20 
one official in GCIS indicated that no I saw a Cabinet Memorandum but 
I am saying it can’t be but ...[indistinct] I am basing on the due process 
so I cannot imagine that something like that would happen that cabinet 
takes a decision based on an announcement and or no submission of 
the Cabinet Memorandum, it’s something that we would need to actually 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 159 of 218 
 
maybe Chairperson to agree that the Commission continue to get the 
information because that is where I get it from them, or my former 
employer, because I was an employee by that time, that is why as you 
said Chair in the opening remarks that I wrote quite a lot of things, 
some of them articulate to what normally occur. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR BALOYI:   So I would also use my own ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Contacts. 
MR BALOYI:  Contacts formally to actually look at that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR BALOYI:  Because the – the government I was working for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  Is still there.  It exists.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:   And there is no way that I have to be left – it has to be 
left on my own to keep records. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  Because when Ministers leave you do not take a 
briefcase of documents.  You leave them there.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
20 
MR BALOYI:  I am convinced if something is like that there was no 
Cabinet Memorandum I will be so surprised.  I will be so surprised 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  Actually worryingly surprised as to how does Cabinet. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 160 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  Concurs to a non-existing issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But remember I think Ms Hofmeyr told you earlier on 
that I think Mr Maseko said what happened was that there was no 
discussion of the issue of his transfer by cabinet.  And there was no 
decision taken by cabinet. 
MR BALOYI:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was simply an announcement to the cabinet 
that Mr Maseko was being transferred from GCIS to DPSA and Mr 
Manye was being transferred from Department of Labour to GCIS or 
10 
simply that Mr Manye would replace him.  That is my recollection of 
what his evidence was.  So – so on – on his version and he was there 
according to him. 
MR BALOYI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Cabinet was simply told that this is what is going to 
happen.  They were not required to make any decisions.  So if that – if 
that – if those facts are correct. 
MR BALOYI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would you not therefore understand why there would 
be no Cabinet Memorandum? 
20 
MR BALOYI:  Ja if those facts are correct really I will – I will – I will 
then understand why – why no but I definitely I am not sure how it will 
then be possible for a President Minute to be addressed.  That is why 
Chair my submission if – if it so pleases – my submission is that we – 
we – we would do a lot more search on this to establish as to whether… 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 161 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  We may not come with something like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  It will be surprising if such a situation happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would – would you – would you remember whether 
officials within your department who may have helped to prepare such a 
memorandum?  Who they would have been and whether maybe they 
might remember that no we definitely prepared a memorandum or 
maybe they might also not know with the passage of time.  Would you 
remember or – who they may have been or that is too difficult to say 
10 
after so many years? 
MR BALOYI:  Ja so difficult after so many years and – and I will then 
say if now I approach my employer about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
\MR BALOYI:  It has to be a formal thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  I will not do behind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR BALOYI:  The door. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
MR BALOYI:  The front doors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  Just to look at – let us see as to whether this is what 
happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 162 of 218 
 
MR BALOYI:  Because if really that is what has happened there was no 
Cabinet decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  There was no submission in cabinet.  There was an 
announcement it will definitely have been too strange an issue to think 
about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Baloyi can we go back to your co-signing of 
the Presidential Minute? 
MR BALOYI:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because you – your evidence is as I have it is 
that you did so on the 3 February, is that correct? 
MR BALOYI:  It is correct Ma’am. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So before you signed that what enquiries did 
you make about what had happened at the previous days’ cabinet 
meeting? 
MR BALOYI:  Ma’am I think if – if – we can agree that my proposal that 
will get more – more information on this matter will deal with that 
question. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Baloyi you see the only place that holds the 
20 
records of cabinet are the – is the Presidency and we have engaged the 
Presidency on the records of cabinet.  And I mentioned to you 
previously we obtained the affidavit of the Director General in the 
Presidency Doctor Lubisi.  He has looked at those – the minutes of the 
2 February.  He has confirmed that there was no Cabinet Memorandum 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 163 of 218 
 
serving before Cabinet.  He has confirmed that there was no discussion 
reflected and he has confirmed that there was no decision taken about 
the transfers of Mr Manyi and Mr Maseko.  So that is where the 
evidence would lie and those are investigations that the commission 
has undertaken.  My question to you was a different one.  Before you 
signed on the 3 February do you have a recollection of what you had 
before you or what questions you asked before signing it? 
MR BALOYI:  But Ma’am let me put it clear that the department the 
employing department will have records. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But not if there was not a Cabinet Memorandum 
10 
that served before Cabinet on the 2 February? 
MR BALOYI:  I am not convinced that there was no Cabinet 
Memorandum.  I want to be convinced that there was no Cabinet 
Memorandum. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But how would a record of DPSA convince you 
if the people who have looked at the minutes say it does not reflect 
there being a memorandum? 
MR BALOYI:  Well people are people I mean I do not think – unless if – 
if we then say that in an inquiry like this the evidence of a witness is 
not taken so serious to warrant that we actually look at that because I 
20 
am saying as far as I am concerned.  But – but is it possible that we 
can actually look at that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well… 
MR BALOYI:  Well then if we come back here and there was really no – 
no – no Cabinet Memorandum, there was no Cabinet discussion then on 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 164 of 218 
 
the basis of what was the transfer effected? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Am I right Mr Baloyi to think that if in fact after all the 
checking and the investigation that you think may still be done.  If in 
fact after all that you were to find that what Doctor Lubisi says in the 
affidavit that there was no Cabinet Memorandum and there were no – 
no minutes? 
MR BALOYI:  Hm; 
CHAIRPERSON:  That there were – that there was no discussion or 
decision taken by cabinet about these two transfers. 
MR BALOYI:  Hm. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of Mr Maseko and Mr Manyi am I right to think that 
that would shock you? 
MR BALOYI:  That will shock me Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That would shock you? 
MR BALOYI:  That will shock me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It should not be like that? 
MR BALOYI:  Come again? 
CHAIRPERSON:  It should not be like that? 
MR BALOYI:  It should not be like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR BALOYI:  It should definitely not be like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm.  Yes.  Okay.  Well I – I – I think it is – it is 
open to the commission to reflect on what else it can still do. 
MR BALOYI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To go beyond what we have.  I am not sure.  But I do 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 165 of 218 
 
not want you to get the impression that we are saying nothing further 
can be done.  
MR BALOYI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is possible that we can apply our minds and – and 
do – and do further but on – on the face of it and thinking that bearing 
in mind that this is quite a senior official the Director General in the 
Presidency. 
MR BALOYI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Deposing to an affidavit to submit to a commission 
such as this having been asked to check one would think that he would 
10 
have taken trouble to check properly. 
MR BALOYI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – but I am not saying that nothing further can be 
done to try and check that.  So certainly we can reflect and take it from 
there and – and from your side you might – you might also have 
suggestions or having been Minister you might have Minister of DPSA 
having dealt with these things you might have ideas of what else could 
– could be done. 
MR BALOYI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are not closing the door.  Ja.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Mr Baloyi I understand your 
evidence to be that former President Zuma did not consult you before 
the transfer of Mr Maseko and Mr Manyi took place, is that correct? 
MR BALOYI:  It is correct Ma’am. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And if the evidence as the Chair 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 166 of 218 
 
has indicated establishes that there was no Cabinet Memorandum that 
served before cabinet about those transfers on the 2 February and no 
decision of cabinet in relation to that.  How then would the President 
have known whether Mr Maseko’s consent to the transfer had been 
obtained? 
MR BALOYI:  The letter that was written on – on consent by Minister 
Chabane was written addressed to me.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  So – so but then the issue is if the question is how would 
if there has been no cabinet how will the President have known?  I 
10 
think these are things that the – what we are going to establish with the 
further work that has to be done here will actually inform that.  Because 
the question will not only be how he would know – how will he have 
known but then the issue would be how he will have got his signature 
on the – on the Presidents Minute. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes he might have put his signature there 
without knowing whether Mr Maseko had consented or not.  Is that not 
a possibility? 
MR BALOYI:  He – I take it as – as the – the Executive Authority of the 
National Executive he knew what had to happen.  So – and again I also 
20 
co-signed that President Minute.  So I think it is something that when 
we look at why his signature there what will have informed his – same 
question that then say, what would have informed my signature to be 
there?  And I think it is through what we are going to establish when we 
do further research on the matter. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 167 of 218 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I understand.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it – I am sorry.  Is it possible that you could have 
co-signed the Presidential Minute even though there was no Cabinet 
Memorandum simply because on what you have told me to have been 
your role in this transfer. 
MR BALOYI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Simply because  
1. You knew that a decision had been taken that Mr Maseko should 
leave GCIS. Minister Chabane told you as much. 
2. You knew that you were asked to advice on managing the exit. 
10 
3. You had on your version you had had a discussion with Mr 
Maseko and verbally he had consented to a transfer and 
4. You may have been told that look we have got the concurrence of 
Minister Chabane.  We have got the consent of the Director 
General Mr Maseko.  We have got your consent as Minister of 
DPSA if you need to give consent.  The President has no problem 
with the transfer to say the least.  He has no problem.  Now 
ENews has got this – is running the story and let us – let us sign 
and the paperwork will be fixed later. 
MR BALOYI:  No Chairperson if – if there was such a move to then say 
20 
let us sign paperwork will be fixed later.  We will be tracing that indeed 
paperwork was – was done but for me Chairperson it is just unthinkable 
that such a thing can happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but my question is a different one.  It is whether 
what I have just tabulated now if this was told to you or being aware of 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 168 of 218 
 
these things whether that would have persuaded you to say, okay even 
if there is – the paperwork is not there because we know this to be the 
position nobody is objecting to this thing and we do not want the 
impression to be created out there that Mr Maseko has been fired – let 
– I will sign.  I am asking whether knowing all of those things may have 
been enough to persuade you to co-sign the Presidential Minute even 
though the paperwork was not there. 
MR BALOYI:  No Chairperson.  What will then – what I would have 
done was to expedite.  I mean – but make sure that they due processes 
is followed.  That is why I – that is why I responded earlier to say, I will 
10 
be shocked if there is no Cabinet Memorandum to that effect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – but in this case when you – okay when you say 
you would have wanted to make sure that due process was followed.  
Do you include in terms of due process cabinet discussing the issue 
and making a decision? 
MR BALOYI:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You – you – are you saying therefore you would not – 
you would have been opposed to co-signing the Presidential Minute if 
there had been no due process including a discussion of the transfer 
and decision by cabinet. 
20 
MR BALOYI:  Exactly Chairperson.  Because the signing of a 
Presidential Minute. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  Is – is the last step. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 169 of 218 
 
MR BALOYI:  Is the approval of the action. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  But before that cabinet concurrence has to be in place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  And that is my – that is the process – that is the due 
process that I will – I will insist that it happens. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  That is why I am saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  I will really be shocked. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  If we sitting in a situation where the appointment – I 
mean the transfer is affected. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  But the transfer is not facilitated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  It – because that is exactly what it will mean. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What if your understanding I am not saying it was so 
but what if your understanding was that the President was happy that 
the Presidential Minute be signed and paperwork would be deal with 
20 
later because there was some urgency as he saw it?  Would you still 
have been opposed to signing without the paperwork? 
MR BALOYI:  I would be disappointed with myself Chairperson if that 
was the case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm; 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 170 of 218 
 
MR BALOYI:  Because I am not the type of a person who because 
somebody decide this has to be done even if it is not correct it must be 
done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  I – it is quite a lot of things that I – I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you do not operate like that. 
MR BALOYI:  Ja I do not operate like that.  That is why I am saying I 
will not only be shocked about what cabinet would have done I will also 
be shocked by my own actions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
10 
MR BALOYI:  So that is the position Chairperson.  For me that is why if 
I were to say I mean in our discussion with Minister Chabane that is 
what I indicated there when I then say transfer to another – you are 
then saying are you sure that – does it say, no that is what I need to do 
and I started in the beginning right on the day.  The date was 
announced that I was to be a Minister even before I was sworn in.  
Immediately after the adjournment of Parliament where it was 
announced the one Minister approached me to then say, oh now I see 
you there we are going to deal with these issues.  And I then said, 
because we have as a Portfolio Committee been opposed to this 
20 
arbitrary exist of Heads of Department.  That was my conviction.  So I 
will not only be dis – be shocked and disappointed by that disappoint 
by – by the decision for the transfer to have been effected without a 
Cabinet Memorandum.  I will also be disappointed by myself having 
appended my signature on the President’s Minute because for me it is 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 171 of 218 
 
not who says what but for me it is what is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you think it would – it would have been wrong to 
have a transfer without that due process and without cabinet discussing 
and making a decision on it? 
MR BALOYI:  It would have been wrong.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  I mean even the Department would have then said but 
where is the due process.  I mean what – really. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  Really I – it will be something very wrong. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair I note. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That we have just passed four o’clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I do not have a great deal more but there are a 
few aspects just to conclude on Mr Maseko’s transfer and then a few on 
Mr Manyi but we have traversed a lot. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of what has happened on the 2 February so 
20 
that will not be long.   
CHAIRPERSON:  No I am… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Would it possible to sit a bit later? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja we can continue because I would like us to finish 
with him. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 172 of 218 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because tomorrow I think I am starting early. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja so… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it fine if we continue a bit? 
MR BALOYI:  I am available Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Mr Baloyi.  I would like to take you 
to the affidavit that we received from the Presidency.  You will find it in 
10 
Exhibit NN5 and it starts at page 319. 
MR BALOYI:  11? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  319. 
MR BALOYI:  319 okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right at the end of that file.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say 219? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
MR BALOYI:  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes Ma’am I am there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  So at 319 is the first page of the 
20 
affidavit and it is an affidavit deposed to by Doctor Lubisi who is 
currently the Director General in the Presidency and who is also the 
secretary of Cabinet.  Mr Baloyi I would like you to have the benefit of 
what he says about his personal studying. 
MR BALOYI:  Okay. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 173 of 218 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of the minutes of the 2 February because I 
want to understand from you what possible further investigations could 
be done in the light of what is contained here? 
MR BALOYI:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So if I can just take you through the affidavit.  
If you go over the page to page 320. 
MR BALOYI:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You will see there that Doctor Lubisi talks 
about – well itemises there what specific requests were made by the 
commission in relation to the 2 February 2011 Cabinet Minutes.  And he 
10 
records there that the commission responded.  This was to a request 
for particularity as to what we were looking for in the minutes.  And he 
says: 
“The commission responded seeking those parts of 
the 2 February 2011 minutes that reflected.” 
And then there are four items there at 5.1 to 5.4. 
“The commission requested any and all noting by 
cabinet of the decision to transfer Mr Maseko from 
GCIS to the DPSA.  Any and all noting by cabinet of 
the decision to transfer Mr Manyi to GCIS.  Any and 
20 
all decisions of cabinet relating to the transfers of Mr 
Manyi and Mr Maseko and any recordal of any 
memoranda that were placed before cabinet at its 
meeting of 2 February 2011 in relation to the transfer 
of Mr Manyi and Mr Maseko.” 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 174 of 218 
 
If you go over the page you will find what Mr Lubisi says after he 
personally studied the minutes and you will find that at paragraph 9. 
Doctor Lubisi there says? 
“I have personally studied the Minutes of the Cabinet 
meeting of 2 February 2011 and can confirm that the 
minutes do not record any Cabinet Memorandum 
dealing with the transfers of Mr Maseko and Mr 
Manyi or indeed transfers of the Directors General of 
GCIS, DPSA or Labour having served before cabinet 
at the meeting of 2 February 2011.” 
10 
He says: 
“I can also confirm that the minutes do not reflect 
any discussion of or decision taken in relation to 
these transfers.” 
So Mr Baloyi what other possible investigations could be done other 
than asking the secretary of cabinet to look at those minutes and tell us 
what they contain? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe I could just say before Mr Baloyi responds.  As 
I was reading through this affidavit while she was also looking I noted 
that for the best part the Director General in the Presidency seemed to 
20 
talk about other officials having perused the minutes but when I came 
to the last paragraph, paragraph 9 where he says he personally studied 
the minutes then I thought okay well if he – if he personally studied 
that makes a big difference.  I thought he was giving us an affidavit 
based on what other people – other people’s observations.  I thought 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 175 of 218 
 
he had not studied the minutes himself.  I thought I must – I must just 
give you what I was thinking. 
MR BALOYI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To what I was looking for to say but it is not enough if 
he just tells us that officials in his office have looked at the documents.  
This is what they have told him.  But then I came to this paragraph 
where he says he personally studied the minutes.  But you – you may – 
you may respond.  I think the import of the question is, what were – 
what I – what were you thinking of, what do you have in mind of – that 
could go beyond this to try and – and establish whether indeed what he 
10 
is saying here is true? 
MR BALOYI:  Chair what – what I had in mind and it is what I have in 
mind still making a submission is that the receiving department which 
is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your department? 
MR BALOYI:  Which is DPSA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  Definitely should be having records in this – in this 
regard.  Because even the Presidential Minute – the Presidential 
Minute when it has to be done it is initiated in the department.  And the 
20 
Minister signs and then refers that to – to the Presidency.  So I will be 
surprised and to have these things in – that is why I am saying suppose 
what Doctor Lubisi has indicated here that is the final position and 
DPSA has no – no record about that, that is where I have indicated 
what my position will be.  That of serious disappointment.  I cannot 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 176 of 218 
 
imagine what would have happened to actually get to a situation like 
this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I can – I think I do get the sense Mr Baloyi 
that really when you look at the situation of a trans – such a transfer 
happening without discussion of cabinet the paperwork being before 
cabinet and a decision being taken by cabinet you – you really cannot 
imagine how that could happen? 
MR BALOYI:  I cannot imagine Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:   I cannot imagine how that can happen.  It would be – 
10 
that is why I am saying I will – I would be so disappointed about the 
process and also about my own signature in that piece of paper. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  Because really the requirement is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  That there has to be a Cabinet Memorandum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you see in the end after hearing everybody 
including what the former President has to say although he has already 
started giving evidence and has said put has given his version in 
regard to this transfer.  In the end being the person who must make 
20 
decisions and findings I have to ask myself various questions.  Now 
even with this ENCA – with the ENCA or ENews having got wind that – 
of the news that Mr Maseko was to be replaced by Mr Manyi. 
MR BALOYI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know whether that would be a sufficient 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 177 of 218 
 
justification for things not to be dealt with in the normal course.  Why 
could not - why - why could not - why could a media statement not be 
issued which would indicate something without having to rush anything?  
I am - I am not sure that the mere fact that a news channel got wind of 
part of the news would - would be enough, but the - Mr Maseko’s 
evidence included this Mr Baloyi which you may have picked up from 
his statements and his transcript. 
He says he was told by Mr - Minister Chabane - he was called 
by Minister Chabane who said to him that he had received a call from 
the former President. 
10 
MR BALOYI:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  While the former President was out of the country. 
MR BALOYI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who said that he needed to in effect get Mr Maseko 
out of G - GCIS.  I think he put it as - he put it on the basis that 
Mr Maseko had to be removed or fired from GCIS or transferred or put 
somewhere, but that he - that is the former President according to 
Mr Maseko relaying what Minister Chabane relayed to him.  The former 
President had said that by the time he arrived back in the country 
Mr Maseko should no longer be in GCIS. 
20 
MR BALOYI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now the information that - that is my recollection.  I 
hope I am right.  Ja.  I think Ms Hofmeyr nods.  So I think that is her 
recollection too.  So Mr Maseko said Minister Chabane said you know 
the President said by the time he arrives back he must not be in GCIS, 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 178 of 218 
 
but that he went on to say to him, because I know you are a good civil 
servant or public servant I will not throw you into the street. 
I will try and find a place for you.  That is - that is what he 
said and I think the information the Commission has suggests that the 
President arrived back into the country.  He was out of the country on 
some State business.  I think he had gone to a BRICS meeting if I am 
not mistaken and then to an AU meeting.  If I am not mistaken.  When 
he arrive - he arrived back on 1 February.  I think that is - that is - that 
is my recollection.  I do not know if it is the 31 s t. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair it was on the 1 s t actually. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the 1 s t.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So it is the Tuesday of the week before 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Before the Cabinet Meeting … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before the meeting.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  On the 2 n d. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he arrived on the - on - on the 1 s t.  The Cabinet 
Meeting was to be on the 2 n d. 
MR BALOYI:  The 2 n d. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So obviously arrived while Mr Maseko was still at 
20 
GCIS and then we - we - we have been told what happened on the 2 n d.  
So a question that one cannot avoid is to say if what Mr Maseko says 
he was told by Mr Chabane is true. 
MR BALOYI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then maybe the E! News factor added to some 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 179 of 218 
 
urgency that was there anyway.  I am not sure, but that is - that is the 
background … 
MR BALOYI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That Mr Maseko gave - gave. 
MR BALOYI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that something that you - you heard of at any stage 
while you were still Minister or is that something you - you heard for 
the first time after Mr Maseko had gone public about …? 
MR BALOYI:  Ja.  I - I heard about it after Mr Maseko had said 
something about - about this and I - I agree with you Chairperson that 
10 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  In - in - in the procedure that obtains which I was 
presiding over as in - in DPSA.  There will be no - the ENCA 
announcement will not have actually necessitated a departure from the 
normal practice, because a statement could easily be issues to - to 
clarify that and then we - we deal with the issues accordingly.  So that 
is why I am saying if - if the Commission would I know because from 
the Presidency will already have an affidavit. 
I - I can see that it - it might be difficult to go the route or 
20 
trying to establish, but I will submit - I will submit that my - my request 
be accepted.  I want to satisfy myself … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 180 of 218 
 
MR BALOYI:  That something amiss went on in our judgment or - or - or 
something.  It is - it is a - it is a … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR BALOYI:  I will not be surprised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You just cannot understand how you … 
MR BALOYI:  I - I just … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do anything like this … 
MR BALOYI:  Just … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Without process - due process. 
MR BALOYI:  Ja.  I just cannot understand. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if - you - you said that your - your department 
one would expect it to have documents including such a memorandum if 
it does exist.  Is that right? 
MR BALOYI:  Yes Chairperson.  I - I said that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Would - do you think it might help if 
arrangements were to be made with the Director-General of the 
Department of Public Service and Administration maybe for you in the 
company of maybe an investigator or a member of the legal team from 
the Commission to - to be allowed to go to the department and see 
whether that visit can help in anyway in terms of trying to look where 
20 
there could be information?  Do you think that is something that can 
help or is it something that you - you would like to do on your own? 
MR BALOYI:  We can combine both Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but - but that is one of the things you - you are 
thinking of? 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 181 of 218 
 
MR BALOYI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  To try and establish really what … (intervenes). 
MR BALOYI:  Try and establish, because really I - I cannot establish as 
to - I mean I cannot - I cannot … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Imagine that. 
MR BALOYI:  Imagine how things like those could have happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Could have happened.  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Ms - Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair there have been engagements with 
10 
DPSA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Precisely in relation to any records they had … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  On this topic … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And amongst the records we did receive … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR: 
 Is a document entitled an explanatory 
memorandum … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And I would like to take Mr Baloyi there in 
fairness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Baloyi it is in EXHIBIT NN5 and it is at page 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 182 of 218 
 
42 - 4-2.  Chair while Mr Baloyi is finding that page - NN5 page 42.  
Certainly it will be our submission that whatever might exist in the 
records of DPSA unless there is a basis to go behind what Dr Lebasi 
has said on affidavit.  It did not find its way to Cabinet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The records of that meeting indicate no Cabinet 
Memorandum before, no discussion of and no decision on, but there is 
this document.  We have traversed both Department of Labour, DPSA 
and GCIS for all possible documents related to these transfers and 
Mr Baloyi will tell us afterwards if he thinks there is still further 
10 
investigations that need to take place, but Mr Baloyi amongst … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you found that document Mr Baloyi? 
MR BALOYI:  Yes Chairperson.  I have found it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Now that is a document entitled explanatory 
memorandum.  Before we go there Mr Baloyi the usual process for 
Cabinet Memorandum placed before Cabinet.  We understood from 
Mr Maseko there is a whole process involved.  It is prepared.  It then 
goes to the relevant subcommittee and then it is served before Cabinet 
at a particular meeting.  Are you aware of that process? 
20 
MR BALOYI:  Chair if - if I can talk to this document.  It is one of the 
documents that was given to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  On Wednesday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Have you had a chance to - I assume you … 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 183 of 218 
 
(intervenes). 
MR BALOYI:  Clearly I had no chance to - to actually look at - at this 
and it comes in as an … 
CHAIRPERSON:  If course if you got it on Wednesday last week you 
should have read it.  You did have a chance.  You might not have read 
it, but you did have a chance. 
MR BALOYI:  Chairperson, I - it was sent to me electronically … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  And I - I actually read it on … 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the screen. 
10 
MR BALOYI:  On - on Thursday and I sent a message to the 
Commission through a - an email. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  Requesting for some more document … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  About - about that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  And of course this having not been introduced exactly as 
to what it is all about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR BALOYI:  One did not include, but it is the part of the things that if 
- if I am given a chance we - we could actually look at - at these things.  
I even requested Chairperson … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  To - to have documents assisting me to work on this 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 184 of 218 
 
thing.  It is - it is really a problem to look at that.  So I am hearing that 
this document is - was obtained in DPSA, but there was no - it was 
never referred to Cabinet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe let us take it step by step.  I think 
Ms Hofmeyr wants to ask you some questions … 
MR BALOYI:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And maybe Ms Hofmeyr I know there is an affidavit by 
the DG of DPSA somewhere.  Maybe we - we should start there, 
because I do not know whether in that affidavit he may be saying the 
documents he is sending you are all the documents that have 
10 
something to do with the transfer or not, but you - you would - you 
would be more familiar with that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair.  I will go there in a moment if I 
may. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Whether this is everything or not is not 
pertinent for my present questions.  My present questions are just 
dealing with this document. 
MR BALOYI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So if we could focus on 42.  There is a 
20 
signature on that page.  Is that your signature Mr Baloyi? 
MR BALOYI:  Yes madam. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And do you recall this document? 
MR BALOYI:  Come again? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you remember this document? 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 185 of 218 
 
MR BALOYI:  I - I saw it as it came. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  As you sent - as - as I got it on - but - but I - I do not 
remember like to then say verbatim this is what we were discussing, 
where and stuff like that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR: 
 
Well 
do 
you 
remember 
drafting 
this 
memorandum? 
MR BALOYI:  The - the drafting of documents in a Government 
department is done by officials and - and he referred to - to Ministers 
… 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
MR BALOYI:  And - and a document like this coming as one page.  
Definitely should be part of a - a submission or a file I referred to 
earlier on that some of these documents that we were supposed to 
comment on.  The information is readily available in the - in the 
Government department.  So to - to really then single out this document 
to then say 10/11 years ago this is the document sent.  Do you 
remember it?  Really.  It is a problem. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No.  I fully understand that and I - I am grateful 
or your evidence that drafting takes place by officials.  May I then just 
20 
ask as you sit here today do you remember receiving this document 
around the time of the transfers and feel free to say you do not 
remember?  I just want to be clear on what your recollection is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words does it ring a bell.  Do you say no I - I 
remember this document? 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 186 of 218 
 
MR BALOYI:  It - it rings a bell Chairperson … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  And my signature is there … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  But it is part of what? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  That is the issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What would that signature - what would your 
signature there on the document signify?  When you signed it - what - 
would it have signified approval of the document?  Would it have 
10 
signified that you have had had sight of the document or what would it 
signify? 
MR BALOYI:  Normally the signatures come at the bottom of a 
document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  It means that the - the totality of the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  You concur with and then here my signature comes on 
the side of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR BALOYI:  Paragraph 2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what I do not understand. 
MR BALOYI:  I do not understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  As to what was - maybe I was then saying okay.  I note 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 187 of 218 
 
that 
they 
say 
the 
President’s 
Minute 
proposes 
a 
transfer 
of 
Mr T J Maseko the Director-General, but then all what - what it means.  
It means the paragraph 2 it - it then clarifies what I said earlier on.  To 
say the President’s Minute was - was drafted according to paragraph 2. 
Was drafted at the Presidency.  Proposing the transfer of 
Mr Maseko to DPSA and then talking about the post in DPSA is vacant 
and then all that like that.  So my signature there is on the side.  It - it 
could mean that this is an explanatory memorandum to which the 
Cabinet - I mean the President’s Minute was attached.  It could - it 
could be that.  It - it - when I read it like that.  It - it could mean - that 
10 
that is exactly. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Baloyi you might be happy to - to learn that 
when I read this I had the similar view about it. 
MR BALOYI:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That it may have been an explanatory 
memorandum attached to the Presidential Minute … 
MR BALOYI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because it reads as though it talks about the 
Presidential Minute.  It talks about what it proposes, but what I am 
really interested in today is whether this is a Cabinet Memorandum. 
20 
MR BALOYI:  No.  This is not a Cabinet Memorandum.  I have indicated 
that a - I - I have not applied my mind fully on this document.  It comes 
in as a lose piece of paper.  For sure in the file in DPSA this document 
is not standing alone idly there.  It is a - it is - it is a document that is 
attached to some other documents that will be key for us considering 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 188 of 218 
 
that … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  Because when - when you look at paragraph 2 which is 
what I am - I am actually picking up.  Is that it talks about the - the 
President’s Minute having been drafted. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  So - and then calling for - for DPSA to then - to then work 
on it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What I would like to follow up on though is one 
other point in this memorandum at paragraph 3, because we have been 
10 
trying to locate it in time.  I should be fair and say the documents we 
have received from both DPSA and Department of Labour are in a state 
of disarray.  Certainly maybe at your time Mr Baloyi things were kept in 
an orderly fashion, but we - we have not been fortunate enough to find 
that in our investigations, but nonetheless at paragraph 3 you will see 
there it is recorded: 
“The responsible Executive Authority for GCIS the 
Minister of Performance Monitoring Evaluation and 
Administration in the Presidency concurs with the 
proposed transfer of Mr Maseko.” 
20 
And then it says: 
“See herewith a copy of his letter to the Minister for 
Public Service and Administration in this regard.” 
Do you see that? 
MR BALOYI:  I see it. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 189 of 218 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you will recall that previously we looked at 
a letter from Mr Chabane addressed to you. 
MR BALOYI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Dated 2 February 2011. 
MR BALOYI:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you accept that this memorandum therefore 
must 
have 
been 
produced 
after 
receipt 
of 
that 
letter 
from 
Minister Chabane on 2 February? 
MR BALOYI:  I mean from what - what the document is saying. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
10 
MR BALOYI:  We - we can conclude that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  I think that is fair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well there is something else in this memorandum that 
is interesting.  If you look at the last sentence of paragraph 4.  It says: 
“The 
proposed 
transfer 
was 
discussed 
with 
Mr Maseko and he is in agreement.” 
You remember you and I had a discussion and I was saying 
that if such a memorandum - if a Cabinet Memorandum exist or existed 
and it said Mr Maseko had consented to the transfer.  That might not be 
helpful enough. 
20 
MR BALOYI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where it might be helpful is if it indicates that you 
had a discussion with him … 
MR BALOYI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because you say there was a discussion.  You had a 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 190 of 218 
 
discussion with him.  He says there was no discussion between the two 
of you about his transfer before the announcement to Cabinet.  You 
remember that?  You remember that discussion between the two us? 
MR BALOYI:  I - I remember - I remember Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The - this last sentence there do you know whether 
that is a sentence that you might have had something to do with or you 
do not remember? 
MR BALOYI:  I - I do not remember.  The - paragraph 4 I say the 
proposed effective date of the transfer is a date following the - the date 
… (intervenes). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  It is the last sentence that I am looking at. 
MR BALOYI:  The last - ja.  The last sentence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not remember? 
MR BALOYI:  Is the date - no - no I do not remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Alright.  Let me just ask something else 
before I forget.  Ms Hofmeyr referred you to the letter from Mr Chabane 
to you that we looked at earlier … 
MR BALOYI:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And at the beginning of that letter Mr Chabane says 
he concurs to the transfer.  If I recall correctly.  What page is it again? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is the next page Chair.  Well … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  Next page - 43. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 191 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  He - he says: 
“I concur subject to the President’s approval with 
the transfer of Mr T J Maseko.” 
You know there is this question of where this - who initiated 
the transfer?  Where did the idea come from?  One way of looking at I 
concur maybe that somebody else has made a suggestion or proposal 
and you then concur.  Okay and I am wondering whether there is any 
significance to be attached to him saying that.  Is there any - have you 
got any comment? 
MR BALOYI:  To … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  To him saying I concur. 
MR BALOYI:  I concur. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He is writing to you. 
MR BALOYI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He says I concur. 
MR BALOYI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I am saying one - one interpretation might be as 
if you had suggested something and he is concurring to it. 
MR BALOYI:  Exactly Chairperson.  I suggested to him the transfer of 
Mr Maseko in the meeting I referred to. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  He approached me about exit management … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  And I - I introduced two proposals to him - two options … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 192 of 218 
 
MR BALOYI:  Redetermination and transfer … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR BALOYI:  And I - I suggested the best one is that of transfer … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  And we agreed that we need to approach him both of us 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  Individually.  If he gives consent then we should the 
matter further, but of course that will still be subject to concurrence by 
Cabinet and approval by the President. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now you had a discussion with Minister Chabane 
about this transfer and you have already said that he made it clear that 
a decision had been taken that Mr Maseko should in effect leave GCIS.  
Is - is that how he put it?  I am not saying word for word, but did he put 
it in that way that a decision had been taken.  Is that how he put it? 
MR BALOYI:  That - that is how he put it Chairperson and that is why 
even in my affidavit I indicated that I - I then said - when he said exit 
management.  I said in a situation where the initiator is - is not the DG.  
We will need to - to get the DG concerned, because I - I - the exit for 
him was exit from GCIS, but the issue of transfer came with me.  The 
20 
issue of redetermination came with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see it does not strike me as a normal way of 
speaking if I have made the decision and - and I am asking you for 
advice and I say a decision has been taken instead of saying.  You 
know, because you were his colleague … 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 193 of 218 
 
MR BALOYI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he was asking for advice from you on the 
management of the exit.  Does it strike me as normal - a normal way of 
speaking for me to say a decision has been taken.  Instead of me 
saying.  You know I have taken a decision that I cannot work with 
Mr Maseko anymore.  He needs to leave. 
MR BALOYI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can you help me with how to manage his departure. 
MR BALOYI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you got any comment on - on what I am saying 
10 
in terms of how it came across to you?  Did you have the same feeling 
as I do?  That I would expect you to say to me as your colleague if you 
want advice.  Say I cannot work - continue working with my DG 
anymore.  I have made the decision that he needs to go, but I need 
your advice. 
In other words I will disclose that I am the one who has made 
the decision.  Is - is - have you got anything you are able to say about 
what you thought of this way of putting things to you on his part? 
MR BALOYI:  Chair, I - thank you very much.  I - I consider that in the 
context of a report that speech. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI: 
 
Where 
it 
may 
not 
be 
ordinary 
straightforward 
communication language … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR BALOYI:  But it is not - it is not unheard of in - in reported … 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 194 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  Situations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  That a person may say a decision has been taken. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  Even referring to that decision having been taken by that 
person.  That was my understanding Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm.  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  It - it may - it may differ with a general norm in terms of 
… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  Understanding communications … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  But in a reported form. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  I - I took it like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  That is why in my statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  I said I understood what it means, but of course I 
20 
understood that he cannot take a decision like that even if it is him 
without consulting his Principal, because the - the responsibility … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  To the - to transfer … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 195 of 218 
 
MR BALOYI:  Or the authority … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  First with the - the President. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  So - so him working in that establishment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  It was then - you would say the Presidency has taken a 
decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  And - and the Presidency as an establishment … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  Has a got a Minister in the President … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  Or Ministers in the President. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  Then - and then and then the President. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  So that is my understanding … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  And - and I did not - I did - it did not come to me. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BALOYI:  My - my only interest Chairperson was who initiated that 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  And it was clear that it was not initiated by Maseko … 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 196 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  And - and having not been initiated by - by Maseko that 
is when then it - it came to me that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:  We need to manage it in a particular way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So - so your - your understanding was that in 
saying a decision has been taken he was not necessarily excluding 
himself … 
MR BALOYI:  Exactly Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From the decision? 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   
MR BALOYI:  Exactly Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But your understanding was that what he meant was 
that the President had been consulted because your understanding was 
that such a decision can’t be finalised without the President, that was 
your understanding? 
MR BALOYI:   That was my understanding Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mmm. 
MR BALOYI:   That was my understanding because I mean even when, 
in the point madam referred to earlier on, referral of document for 
20 
appointment purposes, even when Ministers will short-list and come 
with three possible candidates, before referring that to the Minister of 
Public Service and Administration they will have to touch base with the 
Authority that is the President to then say – then it means any of these 
candidates are employable and then they come to me, you’d then would 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 197 of 218 
 
deal with the rest, the necessary checks in terms of the requirements.  
So the move taken is always taken in consultation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Chair if may, because I think this is quite an 
important part of Mr Baloyi’s evidence, I took very careful note Mr 
Baloyi when the Chairperson asked you earlier to take your mind back 
and actually try and tell us what was said in the conversation between 
you and Minister Chabane.  As I wrote it down, you said that Minister 
Chabane had said to you, 
 
“I have been informed there is a decision that Mr Maseko 
10 
 
must leave”, 
 
Do you remember recounting that earlier? 
MR BALOYI:   I think that Minister Chabane said I had been informed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes when the Chair asked you, take yourself 
back to that conversation and you were answering the Chair’s question 
when you gave what Mr Chabane said as I wrote it down at the time you 
said Mr Chabane said, 
 
“I’ve been informed that there is a decision that Mr Maseko 
 
must leave”, 
MR BALOYI:   No, no, no that really – that is what I said, what I said is 
20 
that I was informed by the Minister that a decision has been taken, not 
that the Minister was informed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I understand thank you for the clarification.  
Mr Baloyi if we may then go to …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe just to finalise an aspect, so going back to 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 198 of 218 
 
initiating, once you knew that Mr Maseko had not initiated the transfer 
or his move departure from GCIS, on your understanding was there only 
one other person who could initiate that, namely Minister Chabane or 
could it have been initiated by anybody else, leaving you aside because 
you said that in certain circumstances you could as well but I think you 
are not including yourself here? 
MR BALOYI:   Yes Chairperson exactly like I said, the Minister could 
have initiated that or the DG could have initiated that, that’s exactly – 
if you say could there be any other person, the answer is yes the 
Minister could initiate the transfer or the exit if we put it that way. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja because initially it was just the exit. 
MR BALOYI:   It was just an exit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   An idea of a transfer came…[intervenes]. 
MR BALOYI:   The transfer came with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair.  Mr Baloyi I’d like now to 
move to Mr Manyi very briefly both his dismissal and his transfer.  The 
evidence before the Commission of Mr Manyi and some of the 
documents we’ve been able to source indicates that Mr Manyi engaged 
you very shortly after his position was terminated by former Minister 
20 
Mdladlana, does that accord with your recollection? 
MR BALOYI:   In the documents I received on Wednesday there is 
reference to written exchange of communications between me and him, 
after Minister Oliphant requested my intervention, so the answer is yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you there was also, amongst the 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 199 of 218 
 
documents sent to you, what appears to be every alternate page of a 
type of memorandum that you may have written at the time.  I’d like to 
take you to it so you can assist us with it, it’s in Exhibit NN5 and it’s at 
page 208. 
MR BALOYI:   I’m there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Mr Baloyi this is a document that 
appears to comprise, at least here, three pages it runs from 208 to 210 
do you see that? 
MR BALOYI:   Yes I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   It does seem to indicate at page 210 that you 
10 
had some involvement in this document, do you recall this document? 
MR BALOYI:   Yes although it has my name and it is not signed but the 
content sounds familiar to me. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Okay as I understand the content, in 
paragraph 1.1 on page 208 it records a request for intervention that 
had been received.  Can you tell us what you recollect about that 
request for intervention? 
MR BALOYI:   I was refreshed to this issue when I received this 
document on Wednesday and clearly approached in that fashion would 
be in writing and clearly these are some of the documents that, had I 
20 
received them earlier, I would have researched more in terms of what is 
it that’s in there but having come on Wednesday, honestly speaking it’s 
a – I didn’t do a lot in terms of establishing what is going on there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   As you sit here today do you have any memory 
of receiving a request from the office of the President of the Republic 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 200 of 218 
 
of South Africa to intervene in the matter involving Mr Manyi’s 
dismissal? 
MR BALOYI:   I’m not challenging what is contained in the document, 
the issues I’m raising is that if received in time, I would have done 
further research to establish this matter. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And what would that research have involved? 
MR BALOYI:   You know when I deal with these issues I establish – 
well these things happened a long time ago it involved thinking about 
it, it involved trying to engage with some of the people I was working 
with just to try to have that recollection and it also involves something 
10 
that I’ve indicated, it also involved, like I said, I was not doing these 
things at a personal level that’s why I wrote to principals of my 
employment at the time to assist me to get to this thing because surely 
if there was a request to intervene and it’s in writing it should be there 
in the records and to expect me to run around look for these documents 
where will I find it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed, Chair this is the appropriate point – I 
don’t suggest we go there but you asked earlier about the affidavit from 
the Director General of DPSA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh yes, yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Because this is amongst the documents that 
we obtained from DPSA.  Mr Baloyi just to satisfy you in relation to any 
further investigations which you may wish to make, what this document 
as contained here is the only version of it that we have managed to 
obtain from DPSA, they provided us with a full file of everything they 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 201 of 218 
 
had relating to Mr Manyi’s dismissal that’s set out in an affidavit that 
appears at page 162 and so certainly the Commission’s efforts 
suggests that there are no further documents but I understand your 
evidence to be you don’t dispute that you may have received such a 
request. 
MR BALOYI:   Exactly, but I may not go into details whether it came 
telephonically or it came in writing. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Understood, you indicate in – over the page in 
that memo at page 209 that you’d looked into the question of Mr 
Manyi’s dismissal and that you had made some recommendations to 
10 
Minister Oliphant, you’ll see that at 4.5.  Mr Baloyi were you present for 
the evidence of Ms Oliphant, today? 
MR BALOYI:   Come again? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Were you present when Ms Oliphant was 
testifying? 
MR BALOYI:   Yes I was present yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Then you would have seen that I took her to a 
letter that appears to have been written by you to her on the 29 t h of 
November 2010, do you recall sending that letter to her? 
MR BALOYI:   Ja I thought that letter was – I also received in on 
20 
Wednesday, that’s my signature no doubt about it, it is my letter. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you and you gave her four pieces of 
advice if you’ll recall in that letter, you’ll find it at page 217. 
MR BALOYI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   We went through it earlier I won’t take a lot of 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 202 of 218 
 
time with it but I do want to just get your comment on Ms Oliphant’s 
evidence.  You’ll see at page 217 you advised her of four things. 
MR BALOYI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   You advised her under 3A to withdraw the 
former Minister’s letter which terminated the DG’s services, you 
advised her to extend the DG’s probation for another four months, C) to 
place him on special leave to allow space to find a suitable solution 
and D) during this two-week period to decide whether or not to pursue 
the misconduct charges against the DG, do you see that? 
MR BALOYI:   Yes I see that. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Can you confirm that’s the advice you gave at 
the time? 
MR BALOYI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Now Ms Oliphant’s evidence is that she didn’t 
ever actually consider whether to pursue the misconduct charges, did 
you hear her give that testimony? 
MR BALOYI:   I heart that and of course it’s on the same NN5 page 
211, a handwritten note of a discussion between the two of us. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Well help us with that is 211 – Chair if you’ll 
go to Annexure – sorry Exhibit NN5 page 211 is that a note you took? 
20 
MR BALOYI:   No, no, no this was written by officials in the department 
reporting about a meeting we had and informing about the decision, it 
was my advice was exactly as indicated there and it was an advice a 
decision was to be taken by the Minister. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes and – so are you, when you look at page – 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 203 of 218 
 
the note that appears at 211, is that a note of a meeting you held with 
Minister Oliphant? 
MR BALOYI:   The contents reflected there, according to my 
recollection is the content of our discussion. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Right because what is reflected there at the 
handwritten note 1.2 is that disciplinary action against Mr Manyi will 
not be pursued, do you see that? 
MR BALOYI:   I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Is that your recollection of what Ms Oliphant 
communicated to you? 
10 
MR BALOYI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Because Ms Oliphant’s evidence today before 
the Commission was that she didn’t make a decision on the charges 
and whether to pursue them because she’d never seen them, she didn’t 
know what they were? 
MR BALOYI:   Well I heard that madam, I heard her say that but you’ll 
recall that the charges were dropped at the hearing, I’m sure there’s 
one document that talks to that, when one official said, no lets not 
continue with the hearing because in any case the probation period is 
coming to an end.  So – but then the advice I got, I think there’s 
20 
another document I think comes from DPSA that the advice that we got 
from the legal team, which I agreed with is that, that decision does not 
necessarily – does not necessarily say the charges were withdrawn, 
hence my letter. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed, so your understanding was that a 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 204 of 218 
 
decision still had to be taken whether to pursue those charges, is that 
right? 
MR BALOYI:   In the interest of the Ministry. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed and your evidence is that it was 
communicated to you by Ms Oliphant that she was not going to pursue 
charges, is that correct? 
MR BALOYI:   That’s correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   If she hadn’t communicated that to you would 
you have been concerned about the transfer of Mr Many on the 2 n d of 
February when that question was still left open? 
10 
MR BALOYI:   The – in running a professional Public Service if you 
have allegations towards somebody you run the allegation to the end 
it’s not – an allegation is not enough to suggest that a person is guilty 
of what you suggest, you have to put a person through a process. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed. 
MR BALOYI:   In this case you have a situation where, in this case 
somebody indicate both to the left and both – and to the right, firstly to 
say that we have cases of misconduct proffered against you and then 
some say then no but then we are taking a decision no longer to 
proceed because the probation period has come to an end, it’s really 
20 
problematic. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed if I can them move fairly swiftly to Mr 
Manyi’s transfer.  You dealt with it fairly briefly in your statement I fully 
understand your difficulty with remembering back so many years and 
not having all that many documents available to you but Mr Baloyi what 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 205 of 218 
 
you have learnt today in the course of the questions is what is 
contained in Dr Lebese’s affidavit that there was no Cabinet 
memorandum in relation to either of these transfers, there was no 
decision taken by Cabinet on the 2 n d of February and there was no 
discussion by Cabinet at that meeting. If those are the facts, Mr Baloyi 
would you accept that the transfer of Mr Manyi also did not follow 
regular process? 
MR BALOYI:   The shock that I initiated I will express serious shock 
will apply to both cases because the procedure is the same, there is no 
procedure for one person which does not apply to the other person. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed, and then Mr Baloyi I’d like your 
comment on the following.  Do you accept that State Capture can occur 
within a society by removing people from positions who aren’t willing to 
do the work of the captures, is that something you’ve given 
consideration to? 
MR BALOYI:   It’s a hypothetical case. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   It is and I’m not asking – I will ask in due 
course whether you think that occurred here, based on what you know 
today, but I’m saying hypothetically what is your understanding of State 
Capture? 
20 
MR BALOYI:   Well my understanding of State Capture is a situation 
where the organs of State – we’re talking of organs of State as to the 
rule of the separation of powers coming to the Judiciary, the Executive, 
the Legislature and also the structures of Government.  Don’t avoid 
taking certain decisions or take certain decisions clearly informed by 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 206 of 218 
 
the intention to [indistinct], I mean that’s the general definition I can 
give. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And it’s Mr Maseko’s evidence before this 
Commission that he was removed from the position of GCIS because he 
was unwilling to direct certain spend within GCIS to the New Age 
newspaper of which the owners were the Gupta’s and I think the 
evidence today, and I’d like your comment on this, has established that 
if the facts deposed to by Mr Lebese are correct, both the transfer of 
Mr Maseko to DPSA and the transfer of Mr Manyi into GCIS were 
irregular, do you accept that? 
10 
MR BALOYI:   Well I can’t second-guess the decision of Executive 
Authorities, never in my involvement was the issue of the Gupta’s or 
any other thing raised with me when I interacted with all those.  So I 
can’t, then say the move by Minister Chabane the move by the 
President was informed by anything.  Mine was to assist the process as 
far as procedure is concerned and even it will be established that the 
documents that we don’t have now, even if it would be established that 
they are not there, it will not be, for me because of anything that has to 
do with State Capture.  There has been never any person who 
mentioned my name as having been suspected of involvement in either 
20 
benefitting or promoting this triple challenges of State Capture, 
corruption and fraud as a manifestation of corruption.  So I was dealing 
with this as a process of transferring officials at the instance or at the 
request of the Ministers I provided support to. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Chair just one follow-up question if I may 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 207 of 218 
 
before our questions are concluded. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Mr Baloyi, do you accept, given what your 
understanding of State Capture is though, that irregular removals of 
persons and irregular transfers of persons may be a way in which it is 
facilitated? 
MR BALOYI:   But firstly we need to prove that there has been irregular 
transfers, it’s not in general terms so the issues – and we have to 
prove, I mean or to establish beyond reasonable doubt that this is 
irregular transfers they’re not errors in administration, so I think 
10 
dealing with applying hypothetical questions on particular issues may 
not be very helpful. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Mr Baloyi I wanted to give you an opportunity 
to make comment on that because we will make submissions in due 
course about how to put all of these events together.  For the record no 
part of the Commission’s processes requires things to be established 
beyond a reasonable a doubt. 
MR BALOYI:   Come again? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   We don’t have to establish things beyond a 
reasonable doubt in this Commission we need to probe and it is my 
20 
comment to you for your comment that in the course of today we have 
established that the transfers of Mr Manyi and Mr Maseko were 
irregular, do you have a comment on that? 
MR BALOYI:   I have requested that we will look at certain documents 
that may lead us to come to even inform a decision on a balance of 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 208 of 218 
 
probabilities because the issue is – I raised those things, I’ve 
expressed my surprise on what appeared to have been and I’ve 
submitted that we’ll look at these things and had I received this 
document earlier I would have definitely within my means tried to 
establish what’s going on.  So to then say based on what we have 
conclusively we can then say we have sufficient grounds to decide on 
the balance of probabilities that these things are – well I can’t say that 
the Commission should not reach that stage but the Commission should 
understand that it’s written that states I haven’t raised a request. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you, those are our questions Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Those are your questions okay thank you.  Mr Baloyi 
I don’t remember that you gave a version with regard to Mr Maseko’s 
evidence that he called you after his transfer had been announced to 
Cabinet, he called you, I don’t know whether he said the same day or 
the following day but I think he said that was before he went to start or 
assume his duties at DPSA.  Do you remember receiving a call from 
him where he was telling you that he was your new DG at all? 
MR BALOYI:   Chair I don’t remember that and in my earlier evidence I 
indicated that to the extent of my recollection I initiated the transfer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you – so you have no recollection of the call, you 
20 
are not saying it did not happen but you say you have no recollection of 
receiving a call from him where he said that he told you that he was 
your new DG? 
MR BALOYI:   I have no recollection of that Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and you would say in terms of what you recall 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 209 of 218 
 
it’s not in line with your recollection of how things had happened, is 
that what you would say? 
MR BALOYI:   Yes that is what I said, when I indicated that I initiated 
when I got the message from his principal I advised on what needed to 
be done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes I just can’t remember whether he said he made 
the call on the afternoon – in the afternoon of the day of the Cabinet 
meeting because if he made the call after the 3 r d you probably wouldn’t 
have been surprised because you had signed the Presidential minute by 
that time therefore you would definitely know that he was – he had 
10 
been transferred to your department, is that right? 
MR BALOYI:   It’s right Chairperson because for me it’s – prior to me 
signing the Presidential minute would be a consideration by Cabinet of 
that move, something that I then said, I thought in the records of 
government we do have such information, something that is being 
reported to me, such information was not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and he’s package that he got when he left DPSA, 
my recollection is that there was some portion of that – of the package 
which might have been considered to be more than what he would 
ordinarily be entitled to but that when he gave evidence in November 
20 
the second time he appeared here, he seemed to suggest that there 
was a portion that was included in his package on the basis that it was 
being recognised that he – the manner in which he had been 
transferred from GCIS there was something not good about it.  I’m 
putting it in my own words, or some unfairness so as a way of giving 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 210 of 218 
 
recognition to that there was some amount there.  I may not be putting 
as accurately as he himself put it, but you recall anything along the 
lines that in that package he got, there was something that was meant 
to convey the message to him that we know that in the way in which 
you left JCIS might not have been the best way or might not have been 
fair and therefor we are adding something on your package that you 
taking home.   
MR BALOYI:   Yes, in fact, when he exited DPSA, it was initiated by 
him.  It was not initiated by the Executive Authorite. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR BALOYI:   And in a situation like that, the exit management is done 
that this person is resigning.  Now the pay out who is resigning and the 
pay out to a person who is contract is re-determined is not the same.  
So, I have indicated that I, I took the decision to then say, look I did 
not initiate his departure.  The fact that his departing was, it was six or 
seven months after coming into the DPSA, I took a decision to then say 
for him not to do worse off, let us consider that whatever motivates his 
departure could be part of the package of where he is coming from.  
And I agreed that we will work on the determination and that is what he 
actually welcome to say that is a fair way, a fair way of, I mean exit 
20 
mechanism from Public Service.  So, it is in the manner, the quantum is 
informed by the manner of exit.  You resign, you get a less payment.  
Because it is your decision to do that.  But if you have your contract 
pre-determined, it is not your decision to do that, then there is a 
formula that is actually used to take care of that.  So I took that 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 211 of 218 
 
decision to then say, really if we remove the package of where it is 
coming from, there is really nothing that explains why he had to leave.  
If he then says I had to leave like that, I will then say to him okay it is 
a resignation we will pay you at this level.  So that is what explains the 
difference.  It is in the exit mechanism Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But from what you are saying as I understand you, 
you are saying that there was something, but it was based on the fact 
that he was departing from DPSA, not from JCIS. 
MR BALOYI:   Hmmm. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As a result of a redetermination of his contract.  So 
10 
first are you saying that the package that he got when he left DPSA had 
nothing to do with how he left JCIS, or was there that consideration as 
well? 
MR BALOYI:   The, by inference to manage a fair exit on his part, I 
took that decision to then say, look I have not taken a decision to then 
say you need to go, you are taking a decision that you are going.  I 
think lwt us work on this, to then say it is part of the package of your 
disappointment, where you left before the end of the contract.  So, we 
calculated it.  And use a redetermination route, and not a resignation 
route.  Just to make it, to address his exit, Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So are you therefor saying that in part, how his 
package, how his package was formed was also influenced by how he 
had left JCIS in part. 
MR BALOYI:   Ja chairperson I am saying the, my decision was that 
here is the Director General I am leaving, and he is leaving.  He is 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 212 of 218 
 
resigning.  He is definitely going on a lessor package, and it happens, 
it would not have been like this, it would not have landed with me, it 
would not have landed with the DPSA if it was not manner of exit from 
his previous position.  So I took a decision to then say, let us work on 
this, that we treat it not as a resignation but we will treat it as 
redetermination.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So that decision on your part was influenced by, in 
part how he left JCIS. 
MR BALOYI:   Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is right. 
10 
MR BALOYI:   Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the fact that he was now leaving DPSA as well, 
but he had said he was resigning and you conceded a number of factors 
including how he had left JCIS, and said let us do this as a 
redetermination so that he would not get a lessor amount.  Is that 
right? 
MR BALOYI:   That is right, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now he has said, as I understand his evidence, 
he has also said after he came to DPSA, his relationship with you really 
did not take off.  Those are my words.  Did not take off, and he says he 
20 
was not even introduced to staff.  I do not know whether he puts it as 
he was not introduced at all, or he was not introduced properly to staff, 
and some staff members would say that they have just heard from the 
media about his, that he was now the new Director General, and he 
says what drove him to decide to leave, to talk to you and say, you 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 213 of 218 
 
know he would like to leave, was that, he felt unwelcome.  And he says 
you as Minister were having meetings with members of his team, and 
decisions were being made without him being part of those decisions 
and yet he was the accounting officer and he says he thinks this was 
happening because of the manner in which he came to the Department 
namely as he puts because he was imposed on you.  On the day of a 
Cabinet meeting which you did not attend and because of how he came 
to the Department you never warmed up to him.  The relationship 
between the two of you never warmed up and ultimately, he decided 
look he should go.  Now you put a version that says, actually you are 
10 
the one who came with the idea that he should be transferred to your 
department. 
MR BALOYI:   Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now let me ask the question.  What do you say about 
his concern, or his evidence that in effect the relationship between the 
two of your never took off.  What do you say about his evidence you 
would meet with members of his team and decisions would be taken in 
meetings where he was not included and yet he was the accounting 
officer.  Did that happen, did that not happen? 
MR BALOYI:   Mr Chairperson I would not have initiated that he be be 
20 
transferred to DPSA if I did not like him.  I would not have talked with 
him and then say if he is worried in his hesitation, if he is worried that 
maybe at some stage he may have to leave or the contract may, I mean 
the period maybe short, I would not have said Director General I am 
even prepared to extent the contract.  I would not have said that 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 214 of 218 
 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because he says you never said any of those things. 
MR BALOYI:   Yes at ...[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:   At least prior to him coming to DPSA.   
MR BALOYI:   I agree Chairperson.  I have seen that, and that 
surprised me.  He is saying that, and I am saying this.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I interrupted you.  Please feel free to continue to 
make your point. 
MR BALOYI:   Yes I was saying we did not have done those things, I 
would not have even then said when he was insisting to leave, I would 
10 
not, because in my discretion Chair, I indicated in the beginning that 
when I was talking to him, he indicated that he might not be long in the 
public service.  And then when he decided like that, it was just, I would 
of own decision to then say but fine, he cannot leave worse off in a 
situation like that.  I took that decision.  There was no stage 
Chairperson where I sidelined him in the Department.  I do not know of 
such.  And to my re-collection I never like deliberately took a decision.  
I treated him like any other Director General.  By the time I was 
working with him, there were other Director General’s.  I think four to 
five of the other sections of the DPSA.  And my treatment to all of them 
20 
were the same.  So, I never did that.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you saying you never had meetings with 
members of his team where important decisions were taken without 
him, for which he would be required to account as an accounting 
officer. 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 215 of 218 
 
MR BALOYI:   I cannot remember that, and I cannot imagine that such 
could happen.  I am not that bad a person who can do that Chairperson.  
I would not have done that.  So that is why I was so surprised when I 
saw what he indicated in the submission.  So honestly speaking 
Chairperson, the relation between me, and him were a normal 
relationship.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well let me make this point.  My understanding of his 
evidence is not that the says you had anything personal against him.  
That is not my understanding of his evidence.  My understanding of his 
evidence is that he says you may have done things the way you did 
10 
them, and your relationship between the two of you might not have 
taken off simply because of how he was imposed on you.  So we go 
back to that version about whether he came to DPSA because you 
wanted him to come to DPSA, you came with the idea that he must be 
transferred to your department, or whether he was imposed in 
circumstances where a decision was taken hastily that your department 
is the one to which he should go, because the ENCA had got wind of 
his move from JCIS. 
MR BALOYI:   Chair, I initiated Mr Maseko’s transfer to the department.  
He was imposed on me.  ...[Indistinct] would be imposing, would be a 
20 
person which I talk to, and that is when I agreed on the approach to do 
all those things.  He was not imposed on me.  So, and I initiated that, 
those things would happen.  So Chair I am stating that the Commission 
should consider that my version, as far as I am concerned is my version 
reflect what happened at the time.  I have indicated that in the crux of 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 216 of 218 
 
your past, you might find that when I objected to the use of a strong 
word of being confused and stuff like that, but with your clarification 
that in a positive light that may mean that.  It actually affect both of us.  
And it might polluting our judgment.  Including his.  That is why he is 
saying what he is saying and I am saying what I am saying.  Think at it 
as way of, a proving what I am saying, that will be something that will 
come out clear.  That is why even in the letter of Minister Chabane, he 
would not have said, I concur if somebody has not traced it.  So, that is 
the whole situation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Just the last question.  So on your version what 
10 
is it that made Mr Maseko to stay so short a period at DPSA if 
otherwise the relationship between the two of you was normal, was 
fine.  Because he was there for a very short time.  I think from February 
to July of the same year if I am not mistaken.  Am I right about the 
short period? 
MR BALOYI:   You are right Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hmmm. 
MR BALOYI:   And I have indicated in my statement that that was an 
issue and I have sketched out ...[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR BALOYI:   A possible, possibilities or scenarios about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Yes. 
MR BALOYI:   In my, in my statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR BALOYI:   Trying to articulate myself on, on the surprise of his 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 217 of 218 
 
early exit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hmm. 
MR BALOYI:   Included in what I said was that when I discussed with 
him about that he, about the transfer to the department, he hinted on 
his decision to not stay long. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR BALOYI:   So when it came out that he then says he is leaving 
...[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe it is part of what he said. 
MR BALOYI:   Okay.  And I could not stand on his way ...[intervenes].  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR BALOYI:   And, and if was to be proven it would actually be 
established that I said, if that if he is not interested in being a Director 
General, line function thing, we could even work together.  You would 
be an advisor.  This are Chairperson that I have said.  And I could not 
do all this things, if there was anything.  But the issue is, he was not 
deposed on DPSA.  I initiated it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hmmm.  Thank you.  Anything arising. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  Mr Baloyi thank you very much.  it has 
20 
been a long day.  But we have come to the end.  If we do need you 
come back, we will ask you to come back.  I would say that in so far as 
you believe some further investigation may be required to try and see 
whether there further documents that may be obtained from the 
Department of Public Service and Administration or from the Cabinet 
03 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 195 
 
Page 218 of 218 
 
Secretary, please feel free with your legal advisors to do the necessary.  
The legal team will reflect on your, on your request that the commission 
should consider doing something further.  They will reflect and they will 
let me know after they have reflected.  But from your side, do not wait 
for the Commission if you believe if there is something that you can do 
to try and get the information, so that should the commission that what 
it has done is more than enough.  If you find something, certainly come 
and share it with the Commission.  But they will reflect, and I think they 
probably would need give you an indication of where they stand on the 
issue.  Is that all right? 
10 
MR BALOYI:   Thank is fine thank you.  Thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much you are excused.  Ms Hofmeyr.  
CHAIRPERSON:      You have been standing there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No that is fine, I am getting used to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much and we are going to adjourn.  I 
think tomorrow we are starting at nine o’ clock with the evidence of Mr 
Chabi.  Okay we are going to adjourn for the day.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 4 DECEMBER 2019
