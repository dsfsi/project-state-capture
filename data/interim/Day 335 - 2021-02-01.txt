PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 01 FEBRUARY 2021 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Freund, good morning 
everybody. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you able to hear me quite clearly? 
ADV 
FREUND 
SC: 
 
I 
have 
reasonable 
picture 
and 
reasonable sound; not perfect but quite reasonable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Okay hopefully it will improve 
as we go along.  I just want to announce that this week the 
evidence leader Mr Alec Freund SC who is going to be 
10 
leading evidence relating to Parliamentary oversight is not 
physically here in the venue.  We have not done this before 
it has been witnesses who have been away from the 
venues sometimes and appear via video link but the 
situation in which we are forces us to explore various ways 
and I have allowed that he appears virtually and we hope 
that this situation where both the evidence leader and the 
witness are not physically before me is going to be smooth 
but there may be some technical glitches but we hope that 
they will not be too much.  Thank you Mr Freund with that 
20 
introduction I now give you the floor. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Thank you very much Chair.  Chair with 
your leave I propose to start with a fairly brief introductory 
address just to indicate where I anticipate this evidence 
will be taking us.   
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 4 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry … 
ADV FREUND SC:  And as you have just indicated the 
topics for the present…. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry – I am sorry Mr Freund I do 
not know whether there is some unusual delay when I 
speak before you hear; if there is the technicians should 
try and do what needs to be done to improve that.  For 
certain reasons I suggest that we swear in your first 
witness and then you do your brief opening address.  Is 
that fine? 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:  Chair I am struggling to hear you.  I 
have relatively poor audio and relatively poor visuals from 
the venue of the hearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that so. 
ADV FREUND SC:  I have a much clearer connection with 
the witnesses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that so.  Maybe – well maybe in that 
event I should allow you to do your brief opening address 
because for that you – you will just be the only one 
speaking because I can hear you quite well I think.  Then 
20 
thereafter and before – thereafter we might just swear in 
the witness and then take an adjournment to allow the 
technicians to attend to the problem.  So I think let us start 
with your opening address instead of the other way around. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Yes.  Thank you Chair and Chair I 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 5 of 236 
 
would request that if at any particular time you really are 
not hearing me you would indicate that.  But I will assume 
that as we proceed you can hear what I am saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Okay.  I propose to start with a brief 
reference to the Terms of Reference of the Commission 
because the Terms of Reference mandate the commission 
not 
only 
to 
investigate 
allegations 
of 
state 
capture, 
corruption and fraud in the public sector including organs 
of state but the Terms of Reference also require the 
10 
commission to submit recommendations to the President. 
 
So if in due course it should be found by the 
commission that there was any form of state capture or 
that there was any significant level of corruption in the 
public sector or organs of state then it will be necessary in 
order for the commission to make recommendations which 
may be of value to consider certain related issues. 
 
And 
those 
are 
firstly 
whether 
our 
National 
Institutions designed to address or to protect the country 
or to prevent such conduct failed to do what they should 
20 
have done to prevent or to address those sorts of 
problems. 
 
And secondly if so how and why that came about? 
 
And thirdly whether anything can be recommended 
which if adopted may contribute to avoiding or to reducing 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 6 of 236 
 
similar failure in the future. 
 
Now Parliament is one such National Institution.  
The Constitution imposes on Parliament not only a right but 
also a duty; a constitutional duty to exercise oversight over 
the executive and a constitutional duty to hold the 
executive accountable. 
 
Now there are various provisions in the constitution 
relevant to that.  I am just going to mention two of them. 
 
One is Section 42(3) of the Constitution which says 
that the National Assembly must and I quote “scrutinise 
10 
and oversee executive action.”  And as the hearings on 
Parliamentary oversight proceed one is always going to 
have to have at the back of ones’ mind what does that 
mean a duty to scrutinise and oversee? 
 
But more so and more directly in point of Section 
55(2) of the Constitution which provides as follows: 
“The National Assembly must provide for 
mechanisms to ensure that all executive 
organs of state in the national sphere of 
government are accountable to it.” 
20 
 
That is the language used.  Accountable to the 
National Assembly.   
And  
“b. To maintain oversight.” 
 
So we need to think through what is the oversight 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 7 of 236 
 
that the Constitution has in mind.  And it is oversight of: 
“1. The 
exercise 
of 
National 
Executive 
Authority including the implementation of 
legislation and 
2.  Any organ of state.” 
 
And Chair you will be aware that the commission 
has been focussing not only on departments of government 
but on major state owned enterprises which are organs of 
state. 
 
Now 
the 
focus 
of 
the 
evidence 
before 
the 
10 
commission this far in the main has been on the executive, 
on leaders of state owned companies and on persons who 
were engaged in business dealings with the state and with 
SOE’s. 
 
And 
the 
core 
question 
that 
has 
been 
under 
consideration in the evidence heard thus far is whether 
those persons; persons within the executive; within the 
SOE’s; within the private sector and elsewhere dealing with 
them whether those persons have participate in – have 
participated in or colluded with state capture or corruption. 
20 
 
If it should be found by the commission that this did 
occur then it will be necessary to consider whether 
Parliament did what it could properly have been ex – could 
have properly have been expected 00:09:45 in the exercise 
of the oversight responsibilities. 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 8 of 236 
 
 
And the focus of the present set of hearings will be 
on that question.  That in broad terms is the question. 
 
More particularly the focus will be on the following: 
 
Firstly did the National Assembly properly and 
adequately and responsibly exercise both its right and 
perform its duty to firstly maintain oversight over the 
executive – I have quoted the Constitution Provision. 
 
And secondly to hold the executive accountable. 
 
Now I understand that given the Terms of Reference 
of this commission we ask those questions only in relation 
10 
to allegations made from time to time of either state 
caption or state capture or corruption or fraud in the public 
sector. 
 
So the first question, did the National Assembly 
properly exercise its oversight responsibilities? 
 
Secondly if and to the extent that it might be found 
that Parliament did not do so – did not do what it should 
have done then the following two further questions arise. 
 
Firstly why and how did that come about?  What 
explains that problem or that failure if it should be found 
20 
that there was such a failure?   
 
And secondly and possibly most importantly – most 
importantly 
ultimately 
what 
if 
anything 
should 
the 
commission recommend which if adopted may contribute to 
avoiding or to reducing the extent of similar problems in 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 9 of 236 
 
the future? 
 
Now the commission has received voluminous – and 
voluminous submissions.  These include 
Members of 
Parliament.  These include political parties.  These include 
non-government organisations and they include academic 
experts. 
 
Chair 
given 
the 
limited 
time 
available 
to 
the 
commission to complete its work and given that the written 
material can in any event be considered by the commission 
it will not be possible to present all of this material orally 
10 
in the present hearings. 
 
Nor will it be possible to present all that is 
contained in the affidavit or all that is contained in the 
submissions 
of 
those 
who 
have 
been 
selected 
and 
requested to testify orally.   
 
But 
a 
selection 
has 
been 
made 
of 
what 
are 
considered to be the most informative or useful material 
received and that is to be explored in the present oral 
hearings. 
 
Now initially it was contemplated that approximately 
20 
19 persons would be called to testify albeit in some cases 
quite 
briefly. 
 
But 
there 
have 
been 
some 
tragic 
developments which I wish to deal with right at the outset. 
 
Firstly the former Auditor General Mr Kimi Makwetu 
cooperated extremely closely with the commission on the 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 10 of 236 
 
issue of Parliamentary oversight. And I had anticipated he 
would be the very first witness to testify.  An extensive 
affidavit by him was at an advanced stage of preparation; 
prepared 
I 
may 
say 
with 
enormous 
assistance 
from 
personnel within the office of the Auditor General of South 
Africa.  But as you will know Chair Mr Makwetu tragically 
passed away in November last year and he did so before 
he could sign and formerly depose to the final draft of his 
affidavit. 
 
There is no-one else at this late stage in a position 
10 
to give the same evidence but we do have the benefit of 
the unsigned final draft affidavit.  And that draft affidavit 
has been included in the bundles, the written material to 
which 
I 
should 
refer 
shortly 
together 
with 
multiple 
supporting annexures which bear out in almost every 
instance the content of the affidavit and also accompanied 
by two confirmatory affidavits from persons within the 
office of the Auditor General who were intimately involved I 
the preparation of the unsigned affidavit and I will be 
submitting to you Chair in due course that the unsigned 
20 
affidavit  can be regarded as admissible evidence having 
regard in particular to Section 3 of the Law of Evidence 
Amendment Act. 
 
Although I will be submitting to you Chair that 
regard must be had with certain sections precisely because 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 11 of 236 
 
it will be only in the format of an unsigned draft affidavit. 
 
I might mention that the first witness to be called 
will be asked to comment on certain aspects raised in Mr 
Makwetu’s draft affidavit and certain other witnesses to 
follow will also be asked questions arising from it. 
 
So it will serve as a point of reference for the 
evidence of certain other witnesses. 
 
Secondly Mr Jackson Mthembu who had served as 
the Chief Whip of the Majority Party in Parliament from 
March 2016 until March 2019 and of course since then is a 
10 
Minister submitted an affidavit to the commission.  In this 
instance a signed properly deposed to affidavit.  And he 
would I feel confident have made a very major contribution 
to the 00:16:06 on the question of Parliamentary oversight.  
Because he was the Chief Whip at the centre of the 
Parliamentary process in the years that are going to be of 
particular interest and of particular importance to the 
questions that we are going to be dealing with.   
 
But as you know Chair he recently and tragically 
passed away.  So his evidence is in the bundle; reference 
20 
will be made to it but we will be sorely prejudiced by the 
inability of the late Mr Jackson Mthembu to testify. 
 
Thirdly there is at least one further witness who had 
submitted an affidavit.  He had been expected to testify; 
who is currently not in good health and whose health may 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 12 of 236 
 
or may not enable that witness to testify in due course.  
But if so it will not be this week.   
 
So where does that leave us for the present 
purposes?  As you know Chair we have set aside a period 
of five days – Monday to Friday of this week and we will try 
to get through as much as we can and I am anticipating 
that we should probably be able to hear the oral evidence 
of about ten witnesses and even possibly more. 
 
But it is anticipated that we may in all probability 
need to find if we possibly can another two a day 
10 
witnesses somewhere in the very tight schedule of the 
remainder of the oral hearings of the commission. 
 
The evidence that we will hear will fall broadly into 
two categories.  First what we might call pure fact 
evidence.  There would be evidence in the main from 
members of Parliament or former members of Parliament 
about what degree of oversight did and did not take place 
in certain relevant Portfolio Committees and of course 
oversight in respect of allegations of state capture and in 
respect of allegations of corruption. 
20 
 
And the primary focus in this regard will be firstly 
on the Standing Committee of Public Accounts known to 
all.as SCOPA and then secondly on certain selected 
Portfolio 
Committees 
and 
those 
are 
the 
Portfolio 
Committees on Public Enterprises which of course shed 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 13 of 236 
 
oversight in respect of many of the entities almost there 
has been a great deal of attention in the hearings of this 
commission. 
 
My 
– 
also 
on 
the 
public 
– 
on 
the 
Portfolio 
Committee on Transport but only in relation to PRASA.  
PRASA has been selected just to demonstrate a certain 
tendency and a certain type of problem and also the – the 
Portfolio Committee on Correctional Services and there 
again only in relation to BOSASA. 
 
This commission has already heard quite a lot of 
10 
evidence not only about allegations of corruption involving 
BOSASA and the Department of Correctional Services but 
also in respect of the issue of Parliamentary oversight in 
relation to that and there will be certain further evidence 
on that theme. 
 
And there will also be some but more limited 
evidence 
about 
the 
Portfolio 
Committees 
on 
Mineral 
Resources and on Home Affairs for reasons that will 
become clear to you in due course. 
 
We will start with the evidence of the former Chair 
20 
of SCOPA Mr Themba Godi.  Now according to the affidavit 
that he has submitted he will testify to the effect that in the 
years during which he chaired SCOPA there was a 
widespread breakdown in financial control and a continuing 
ever increasing rise in irregular, fruitless and wasteful 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 14 of 236 
 
expenditure. 
 
And he will say that in his view SCOPA performed 
its oversight responsibilities properly.  Made appropriate 
recommendations as regards required remedial action to be 
taken by the executive and that SCOPA’s reports were 
adopted by the National Assembly. 
 
But he will say the irregular, the fruitless and 
wasteful expenditure continued to rise.  In other words that 
the oversight process did not result in any discernable 
improvement in fact on the contrary the situation got 
10 
progressively worse. 
 
So his evidence will raise a question firstly as to 
the extent of Parliament’s oversight powers.  What really 
are the limits of what Parliament is entitled to do; what can 
it be expected to do? 
 
And secondly his evidence and a lot of the other 
evidence will raise the question of what if anything can be 
done to improve the effectiveness of oversight?   
 
And this of course is against the context of 
committees and MP’s who are genuinely trying hard to do 
20 
their best to exercise proper oversight and to – and to 
require proper accountability. 
 
We will also then hear evidence from a number of 
MP’s who were active on the Portfolios Committees dealing 
as 
I 
said 
with 
Public 
Enterprises, 
Transport 
and 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 15 of 236 
 
Correctional Services. 
 
Some 
of 
that 
evidence 
will 
be 
evidence 
of 
appropriate oversight exercise on occasion.  But other of 
that evidence will suggest that steps that should have been 
taken by Portfolio Committees were either not taken at all 
or if they were taken they were taken only belated one 
might say culpably belatedly and well after such oversight 
activities ought to have commenced. 
 
There will also be evidence from a representative of 
a NGO which has taken particular interest in Parliamentary 
10 
oversight in respect of allegations of corruption and state 
capture and that evidence will traverse broadly across the 
various committees that I have referred to. 
 
Now the evidence was factual evidence on what 
oversight activities did and did not take place will require 
attention to be given as we go along to the following three 
sub-questions. 
 
Firstly what allegations and what evidence were in 
the public domain at particular times?  And that would 
include material published in the press; material made 
20 
officially available to Parliament by means of reports – 
annual reports; reports from the Auditor General and such 
like. 
 
And that of course is relevant to – to forming a 
judgment about the appropriateness of how members of 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 16 of 236 
 
Parliament and how committees of Parliament responded.  
We have to assess not with the benefit of hindsight but 
fairly 
taking 
into 
account 
what 
those 
members 
of 
Parliament and Committees should have known or should 
have suspected or had reasonable grounds to suspect or 
had reasonable grounds to investigate at particular times 
so I am drawing attention to the importance of time as a 
consideration as we assess the questions that will be 
addressed. 
 
Secondly having had some sense of what was in the 
10 
public domain and what was – what was known to members 
of Parliament or what should have been known to members 
of Parliament the question will be whether Parliamentary 
structures were or were not remiss in failing to inquire into 
issues that that they should have inquired into whether 
timeously or at all? 
 
And then thirdly to the extent if they knew they did 
not do what should have been expected what might explain 
that?  How do we understand that?  What are the causes of 
this problem? 
20 
 
So those fact witnesses in the main members of 
Parliament or former members of Parliament will deal with 
those issues and they will also be given an opportunity to 
deal in passing as they testify with the question if they 
wish to comment on it on what recommendations they 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 17 of 236 
 
suggest the commission should make? 
 
I want to make clear that an attempt has been made 
to allow conflicting voices to be heard before you in these 
hearings on the issues that I have raised. 
 
If a Portfolio Committee has been criticised by one 
or more witnesses an attempt has been made to enable the 
Chair of that committee to – be have an opportunity to 
testify in response. 
 
But it has not been possible to achieve this in every 
case.  One of the Chairs who would have testified is 
10 
currently medically indisposed.  When I say Chairs – 
former 
Chairs 
very 
often 
we 
are 
looking 
backwards 
somewhat.   
 
Another Chair Mr Smith, Mr Vincent Smith has taken 
the view that he has already contributed to the work of the 
commission sufficiently and we propose in response to that 
to leave it that. 
 
That is the first category of evidence.  What 
happened?  What did not happen? 
 
The second category of evidence and largely it will 
20 
deal – be dealt with in the same sequence in other words 
we will only reach the second category after we have 
largely completed the first category will be evidence and 
submissions from a number of academics; from a number 
of NGO’s; from MP’s; from some political parties about 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 18 of 236 
 
firstly what explains apparent failures of Parliamentary 
oversight? 
 
And secondly what suggestions do these persons 
have 
the 
academics; 
parties 
and 
so 
forth 
as 
to 
recommendations that they suggest could be made by the 
commission? 
 
Now we may or may not reach that phase of the 
evidence in the present – the five days presently set aside 
for this work stream and as I have said those same 
questions will be dealt with in passing by the other 
10 
witnesses in turn who will be – but as I say this mainly be 
focus – we will mainly hear this second phase of the 
evidence after we have completed the first. 
 
It is anticipated that the very final witness who very 
clearly will not be heard in this five day session will be a 
senior representative of the African National Congress who 
will give that party’s overall views on the Parliamentary 
oversight issue and its views on what could be done to 
make Parliamentary oversight more effective. 
 
And I think it is necessary that I should place on 
20 
record Chair that all political parties represented in 
Parliament were invited in fact were twice invited if they so 
wished to place evidence before the commission or to 
make submissions to the commission about the issued to 
which I have referred. 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 19 of 236 
 
 
Some of them have taken up that opportunity others 
have not.   
 
Now 
finally 
Chair 
the 
Parliamentary 
oversight 
material is contained in Exhibit ZZ of the files of the 
commission.  Exhibit ZZ comprises the entire Parliamentary 
oversight bundle.  At present the bundle comprises five 
volumes of affidavits and written submissions.  There is 
also a further bundle labelled Legal Framework and 
References.  The Legal Framework part of that final bundle 
contains both the 8 t h and the 9 t h editions of the Rules of 
10 
the National Assembly and the reason for that is that some 
of the events that you will hear evidence about took place 
whilst the 8 t h Edition was still in place and some once the 
9 t h Edition had come into effect.   
 
The differences are not very material for present 
purposes but that reference material is available to all 
witnesses and to yourself as we go along. 
 
There is also in the Reference File certain other 
reference material which I need not deal with now but 
which we can use and I will refer to as we get there.  And I 
20 
might add Chair that there is a further bundle that is in the 
process of being created and that in all probability will not 
be referred to you this week. 
 
That is all I wish to say by way of an introductory 
address. 
 
My 
proposal, 
assuming 
as 
you 
think 
it 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 20 of 236 
 
appropriate and convenient to do so, is that I now call the 
first witness in this session, Mr Nelson Themba Gobi.  
Chair, I recall that you suggested that perhaps we might 
take a short break to attend to the question whether 
anything can be done about the quality of the transmission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you Mr Freund for your opening 
address.  Yes, I think what we should do is, call your first 
witness, Mr Godi and let him get sworn in.  And then we will 
take the adjournment after that.   
ADV FREUND SC:   As you please. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Mr Godi, it may be while I come on 
screen and take off your mute. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR GODI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you.  Mr Godi, can you hear 
me? 
MR GODI:   Ja, I can hear you better now. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you.  So I will leave it to the 
Commission’s officials to swear you in. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Godi. 
MR GODI:   Good morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can you hear me? 
MR GODI:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Can you hear me well? 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 21 of 236 
 
MR GODI:   Not so well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not so well?  Okay what we ...[intervenes]  
MR GODI:   [Indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What we are going to do is have the oath 
or affirmation administered to you and after that has been 
done we will take an adjournment so that the technicians can 
attend to what needs to be done to make sure everybody can 
hear me well.  You understand that? 
MR GODI:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Registrar, please administer the 
10 
oath to Mr Godi or affirmation.  He will tell you which one he 
prefers.  Come and stand...  Oh, you do not have the... You 
need that for the...  Oh, that is the mobile one.  Then come 
and stand where he can see you as well.   
REGISTRAR:   Please state your full names for the record. 
WITNESS:   Nelson Themba Godi. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you have any objection in taking the 
prescribed oath? 
WITNESS:   No. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you consider the oath binding on your 
20 
conscience? 
WITNESS:   Yes. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you solemnly swear that the evidence you 
will give, will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing else 
but the truth?  If so, please raise your right hand and say, so 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 22 of 236 
 
help me God. 
WITNESS:   So help me God. 
NELSON THEMBA GODI:  (d.s.s) 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you Mr Godi.  We are going to take 
an adjournment now and I do not know how long it is going 
to be.  It depends on the technicians but I am given an 
indication that it might be ten minutes.  Technicians, it is 
technically possible for me to see both the witness and the 
evidence leader in different screens?

CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  If it is technically possible, 
technologically possible, I will prefer to see both as the 
evidence leader asks questions and the witness answers 
questions, rather than having a situation where the leader, 
the evidence leader will ask a question and then he will 
disappear and the witness will come up.  If possible.   
 
But if that is going to take quite some time to do, 
then we can continue in the meantime and then at some 
stage then we can change.  But if it is not technologically 
possible it is fine.  We will make do with what we have.  We 
20 
are going to have the ten minutes’ adjournment.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Freund, I understand that some 
improvement has been made but it does not solve the 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 23 of 236 
 
problem completely, is that correct? 
ADV FREUND SC:   It is correct, Chair, but I must say I did 
manage to hear what you just said so I think the 
improvement for us to proceed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine, let us proceed 
then. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Chair, the evidence 
of Mr Godi is EXHIBIT ZZ2, to be found in bundle 1 at page 
101 and following. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so just for the record we will be 
10 
using bundle 1 certainly during Mr Godi’s evidence.  I do 
not know whether that is the bundle we will use for the rest 
of the day but if there is a change you will announce. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, I must just indicate to you, Chair, 
in advance that halfway through or two thirds of the way 
through the evidence of Mr Godi I will be referring him to 
the affidavit of Mr Kimi Makwetu, the late Mr Makwetu and 
that will be in bundle 4, but I will announce that when I 
reach that point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine. 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you.  Mr Godi, is it correct that 
you deposed to an affidavit for the Commission of which 
you should have a hard copy available to you and is it 
correct that your signature appears at page 120 at the end 
of that affidavit? 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 24 of 236 
 
MR GODI:   That is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And have you had an opportunity in 
preparation for giving your evidence today to read through 
that affidavit and are you comfortable that it is correct as 
far as you are aware? 
MR GODI:   That is correct, I am satisfied that the affidavit 
does not need any adjustment or corrections, it is fine as it 
is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before we proceed …[intervenes] 
ADV FREUND SC:   Mr Godi, can I refer you now 
10 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Freund?  I am sorry, Mr 
Freund.   
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Godi, I must thank you for availing 
yourself to come and assist the Commission by giving 
evidence.  I just – I normally say that at the beginning so I 
thought I would say that to Mr Godi. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Godi, I would 
like to start off just by giving a little bit of your personal 
20 
background so that we understand on what basis you are in 
a position to give the evidence that you do.  Could you turn 
please to paragraph 4 of your affidavit? 
MR GODI:   Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Page 104.  And is it correct, as we see 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 25 of 236 
 
there, that you came to parliament as an MP in February 
2004. 
MR GODI:   That is correct, Chair, and this is thanks to the 
former President of the PAC, Bishop Stanley Mogoba, who 
wanted to give me a two months preview before the 2004 
elections in April so that I can acclimatise myself at 
parliament. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Right and at that time you were a – 
you were the then Deputy President of the Pan African 
Congress, is that correct? 
10 
MR GODI:   Ja, that is very correct and may I add that I am 
appearing before you here as a proud and grateful product 
of the PAC. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes.  Now you did, however, as I 
understand it, as you say in paragraph 4.6 in September 
2007, leave the PAC and become the founding President of 
the African People’s Convention, is that correct? 
MR GODI:   It is very correct, one of the most traumatic 
moments for me politically. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now  - and you remained a member of 
20 
parliament all the way through until May of 2019, is that 
correct? 
MR GODI:   That is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now from a fairly early stage of your 
period of service as a member of parliament, is it correct 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 26 of 236 
 
that you served as Chairperson of the Standing Committee 
on Public Accounts, otherwise known as SCOPA? 
MR GODI:   Ja, that is correct, I think as my affidavit 
indicates, I became Chairperson in November 2005 and I 
do think, Chair, that it might be important just to give a 
little background, that since 1994, the tradition has been  
that Public Accounts Committee is chaired by somebody 
who is not from the majority party.  So I came in as part of 
that tradition, taking over from someone who was from the 
New National Party and the IFP before and all that stuff. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:   And you remained as Chair of SCOPA 
from November 2005 until May 2019, is that correct? 
MR GODI:   That is correct, stating (indistinct – recording 
distorted) ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, so effectively over more than the 
fourth and fifth parliaments. 
MR GODI:   Correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Right.  Now I would like to focus next 
on the functions of SCOPA and you deal with that in 
paragraph 6.1 of your affidavit where you refer to Rule 245 
20 
of the Rules of the National Assembly, as they currently 
stand, the ninth edition, is that correct? 
MR GODI:   Ja, that is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   There was a similar provision that 
preceded that. 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 27 of 236 
 
MR GODI:   Correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   So …[intervenes] 
MR GODI:   Except that in this edition, 6.1.1(iv) it is 
something that we initiated, added to the rules which was 
not there at the time when I became Chairperson in 2005. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright, I take your point but now let us 
just start at the beginning, let us just understand the core 
and basic functions of SCOPA.  The rule says, as we read 
in your affidavit, the following: 
“The Standing Committee on Public Accounts  
10 
(a) 
Must consider  
(i) 
The 
financial 
statements 
of 
all 
executive 
organs 
of 
state 
and 
constitutional 
institutions 
or 
other 
public bodies when those statements 
are submitted to parliament, 
(ii) 
any audit reports issued on those 
statements, and 
(iii) 
any 
reports 
issued 
by 
the 
auditor 
general on the affairs of any executive 
20 
organ 
of 
state, 
constitutional 
institution of other public body.” 
That, if I understand you correctly, has been the case 
throughout your period with SCOPA. 
MR GODI:   Correct. 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 28 of 236 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   Right, what you are drawing attention 
to is that in your period and when the ninth edition of the 
rules took effect, (iv) was added which also requires 
SCOPA to consider any reports reviewing expenditure of 
public 
funds 
by 
any 
executive 
organ 
of 
state 
and 
constitutional institution or other public body.  That was in 
due course added to your official mandate. 
MR GODI:   Correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   I then want to draw attention to sub 
rule 1C: 
10 
“The Standing Committee on Public Accounts 
(c) 
May initiate any investigation in its area of 
competence.” 
That has always been part of the SCOPA mandate, is that 
correct? 
MR GODI:   Correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And then to paraphrase (d) you also 
have to perform the same source of functions as other 
portfolio committees, you have tasks and duties concerning 
parliamentary 
financial 
oversight 
and 
supervision 
of 
20 
executive organs of state.  I think that rule speaks for 
itself, am I right? 
MR GODI:   Except that insofar it affects – it concerns 
parliament, this was not amended but parliament has taken 
away that responsibility from SCOPA and established a 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 29 of 236 
 
body that is supposed to look at - review the finances of 
parliament.  We only did it once. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes.  
MR GODI:   But – ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright, so you are drawing attention to 
the very specific issue of parliament’s own financing. 
MR GODI:   Ja, sure. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Which, you are correct, that is not 
really the subject matter of concern to the particular 
inquiry or involving the Commission. 
10 
MR GODI:   Sure. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And then sub rule 2 says this: 
“The Speaker must refer the financial statements 
and reports mentioned in paragraphs A1 to 4 to the 
committee, i.e. to SCOPA, when they are submitted 
to parliament irrespective of whether they are also 
referred to another committee.” 
So your committee got all of these reports, the financial 
reports including the reports from the auditor general, is 
that correct? 
20 
MR GODI:   That is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you.  Now what I would like to 
do against that background is to summarise at the outset 
some of your core views and contentions as they are set 
out at an early stage in your affidavit and I would like to 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 30 of 236 
 
refer you firstly, please, to paragraph 5.3 of your affidavit.   
 
Now perhaps rather than me reading it into the 
record, could I invite you to read it into the record because 
this is something that you stress in your affidavit you want 
to emphasise at the outset. 
MR GODI:   That is paragraph 5.3. 
ADV FREUND SC:   That is correct. 
MR GODI:    
“What I feel I should emphasise at the outset is that 
in my view the extent to which parliament is able to 
10 
exercise its active oversight over the executive is 
and has always been fundamentally a political 
question determined by political forces and proper 
application 
over 
principle, 
over 
separation 
of 
powers.  Parliament and its committees can solicit 
information 
an 
explanation 
and 
can 
make 
recommendations but the extent to which such 
recommendations are the status quo(?), depends in 
practice on the integrity and political sensitivity of 
members of the executive.” 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright, if I hear you clearly, we will in 
due course come back to that issue when we have 
considered some of the more substantive material that you 
have put to the Commission.  
I would also like you please to read into the record 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 31 of 236 
 
paragraph 5.4 because that is another point you say at the 
outside you wish to emphasise. 
MR GODI:   May I read it? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Please. 
MR GODI:   Right, 5.4: 
“Another 
point 
I 
wish 
to 
emphasise 
about 
parliamentary oversight is that when one political 
party is dominant, the extent to which oversight will 
be effective depends on the internal dynamics 
within that party.  Oversight by committees of 
10 
parliament 
should 
ideally 
be 
nonpartisan 
and 
sometimes that is achieved but not infrequently 
partisan political battles including internal factional 
battles occur within committees.” 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you.  I think in fairness to you 
we should indicate that there is a footnote to that where 
you say in footnote 1 that you think SCOPA largely 
managed to achieve the ideal of being nonpartisan, is that 
correct? 
MR GODI:   That is very correct and I am sure it is touched 
20 
upon somewhere and I think it is an important factor to 
emphasise because that is what sets SCOPA apart from the 
other committees, the extent to which we could, as a team, 
irrespective of whether one came from the DA, the IFP, the 
EFF, the ANC, we all operated as a unit, we treated each 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 32 of 236 
 
other as comrades, only serving the public good.  It is that 
which actually sets us apart from all the other committees. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you.  I want to refer you now to 
paragraph 6.2 and paragraph 6.2, if I can paraphrase it in 
my own words…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Freund? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just want to ask Mr Godi a question 
about his comment that he has just made.  Mr Godi, the 
point you have made that SCOPA largely operated as a 
10 
committee and as a team irrespective of the different 
political parties from which its members came and you 
have 
said 
that 
that 
set 
SCOPA 
apart 
from 
other 
committees.  What do you think was responsible for that, 
namely for the committee or SCOPA to operate as a team 
irrespective of which political parties its members came 
from and doing so for the public good, which it seems 
implied in your evidence, was not the case with other 
parliamentary committees. 
MR GODI:   Chair, when I became Chairperson of SCOPA I 
20 
found a committee that was driven by divisions, coming 
from the arms deal where they committed it  and I set out 
deliberately and cautiously to inculcate that spirit and 
approach and unfortunate that members were respondents 
because we said look, if we are going to grandstand and 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 33 of 236 
 
fight amongst ourselves, it is the thieves who are going to 
benefit, it is public money that is going to be looted  and 
we somehow managed it.   
I must say it was not easy, it was continuous work 
to manage the different personalities.  It would from time to 
time emerge that members of a particular party would come 
with a particular perspective but by and large we managed 
to find our rhythm.  I think in the fourth parliament, that is 
where we laid the foundation.  In the fifth parliament I think 
– I think that was our best year where we had actually 
10 
cemented that collegial relationship where whether that 
person is from the DA or the EFF or IFP, we worked as a 
team and the political parties somehow gave members of 
SCOPA some part of leeway on to build. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I guess that was …[intervenes] 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you, may I proceed? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess that what you are saying is you, 
as the Chairperson, made it your mission to try and 
achieve that spirit in the team and that commitment in the 
team. 
20 
MR GODI:   Chair, very, very much so, it was a cautious 
and deliberate effort.  In the fifth parliament I was well 
fortunate to have a committee whip like comrade Nyami 
Booi..  We spent a lot of lunchtime together as way of 
building between myself and him, a working relationship 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 34 of 236 
 
that then assisted in cementing work amongst ourselves.  
I had a lot of one-on-one with members of the DA, 
with the member of the IFP, with the member from the EFF 
to really work on this collegiality because that was the only 
way we could do the kind of work that we did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you, Mr Freund, you can 
proceed. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Godi, arising 
from that I just want to draw attention to paragraph 4.4 of 
your affidavit in which you state that during your tenure in 
10 
the 
National 
Assembly 
you 
served 
on 
the 
portfolio 
committees on Social Development, Labour, Education, 
Health and Trade and Industry.  In other words, you did 
have experience on other portfolio committees, is that 
correct? 
MR GODI:   Correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And is it your evidence that the lack of 
partisanship in SCOPA was quite different from your 
experience in the other committees, to which I have just 
referred or to other committees in general? 
20 
MR GODI:   Absolutely, absolutely. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you.  Now I would like to take 
you – I just want to refer you and this is still really 
introducing your views, which we are going to come to 
substantiate in more detail later, but in paragraph 6.2 I 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 35 of 236 
 
think it is fair to say that the essence of your view is that 
you believe that in both the fourth and fifth parliaments 
SCOPA did discharge its assigned functions.  That is your 
view, is it? 
MR GODI:   Correct, correct, we certainly did and I think 
the records are there to prove that we were the one 
committee that really took its job seriously. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And I think it will be fair to say on a 
reading of your affidavit that you believe that your 
committee did all that could be reasonably be expected of 
10 
it.  That is your view, is it? 
MR GODI:   Ja, I just want to add that the last sentence in 
the paragraph talks to the media coverage that we got 
which was reflective of the fact that we were actually doing 
our work and I must say that we must thank the media, the 
journalists in Cape Town, media houses, the radio stations 
because we made a conscious decision.  
If you look at one of our strategic objectives it was 
to make sure that the public knows and understand the 
work of SCOPA and we could only use the media, that is 
20 
why in SCOPA we refused to have closed hearings.   
Whenever we had a hearing, whatever sensitivities 
officials say in there, we insisted it must be open so that 
the media could be there and could then take the message 
from the committee to the public. 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 36 of 236 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   Right, thank you.  Now given that 
background that you say that you believe that SCOPA did 
discharge 
its 
obligations, 
that 
makes 
all 
the 
more 
significant what you say in paragraph 6.3.  You say in 
paragraph 6.3 the following: 
“During the same period...” 
The period during which you say SCOPA was diligently 
discharging its obligations.  Firstly, there was in your view 
a widespread breakdown in financial control, as reflected 
in the clear and emphatic reports from the auditor general 
10 
and the reports of SCOPA.  So despite you doing what you 
say was your job at the same time there was a widespread 
breakdown in financial control, is that correct? 
MR GODI:   I think that is an important contradiction to be 
kept in mind as we move along because we did our work 
very, very well but the outcomes of that work was reflected 
in a negative direction from the reports of the auditor 
general year in and year out. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And we will come back to that.  The 
second point you emphasise about the same period, it is 
20 
subparagraph 2 of 6.3, is that you say: 
“During the same period the executive did not 
display a genuine political will to resolve this.” 
Which is to say to resolve the widespread breakdown in 
financial control.  That is part of your view, is that correct? 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 37 of 236 
 
MR GODI:   Chair, if I may, just to say what I meant here is 
that when you know what the problems are, because the 
auditor general reports to you year in and year out, when 
you sometimes make decisions on what you think needs to 
be done to correct the situation and then do not follow 
through, do not implement those decisions, then for me it 
is that there is a lack of political will. 
 
And, if I could, there are three very important 
cases, which if they were done, maybe we would not be 
sitting here and, if we did, it would be under completely 
10 
different circumstances or conditions.   
Firstly, 2014 the executive took a decision that all 
supply 
chain 
management 
personnel 
throughout 
government, throughout state must be vetted so that the 
more than R500 billion procurement budget, we should be 
assured that it is in the hands of people whose financial 
integrity has been tested.  But that was not implemented 
and when we called the State Security Agency they said 
well, we do not have regulations, the regulations that we 
have make it optional and so when they tried to vet the 
20 
employees at SABC, at SAPS, at Transnet, at SAA, they all 
refused and the whole thing stopped.   
 
So you are saying if vetting had been done on your 
SMS(?) personnel, maybe we could identified and weeded 
out dubious characters. 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 38 of 236 
 
 
The second case relates to what was called an anti-
corruption task team established in 2010 which was an 
inter-ministerial task team chaired by former Minister Jeff 
Radebe, 
which 
was 
supposed 
through 
the 
DGs 
to 
spearhead government’s fight against corruption. 
 
Now seeing the rise in levels of corruption, we 
called 
that 
team 
and 
what 
we 
found 
was 
a 
very 
disorganised and dysfunctional structure which if it was 
focused, should have been the government’s spearhead  in 
fighting corruption.  What we had on the cases that had 
10 
been resolved where – I think there out of 42 cases, about 
40 were all resolved through [indistinct] 25.05 again, a 
person who has misused or caused the loss of millions of 
rands, 50 million, 60, 100 million, got five years suspended 
sentence and a fine of R20 000 or R30 000 and that can 
hardly be a course of action that cost the corrupt to pause 
and, you know, stand back. 
 
And lastly, if I may, it relates to a decision by 
government 
to 
modernise 
its 
systems, 
modernise 
its 
systems 
and 
be 
sure 
that 
there 
is 
one 
system 
in 
20 
government for financial management and human resource 
management 
and 
this 
was 
the 
integrated 
financial 
management system.  But you see, Chair, the system was 
conceptualised around 2005/2006, but it had no business 
case  and until today the business case was only done in 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 39 of 236 
 
what was it, 2020 for a project that started that long and in 
between 
there 
have 
been 
so 
much 
mismanagement, 
starting and starting the process, there has been a forensic 
investigation that cost about R4.7 million and no action has 
been taken against officials who misused the system. 
 
So if government had managed that system well, 
probably we would not be sitting here and, if we did, it 
would be under very different conditions.  So, for me, that 
is what I call the lack of political will, that either do nothing 
or you take correct decisions but then you do not 
10 
implement it properly. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Right, I am going to come back to that 
issue but I am still trying, in advance, to summarise some 
of your key views. 
MR GODI:   Sure. 
ADV FREUND SC:   The third point you make in paragraph 
6.3 about another feature during the same period that you 
say SCOPA was doing its work properly was you say the 
following.   
“Parliament failed to track and monitor compliance 
20 
by the executive of corrective action proposed in 
parliament’s own adopted reports.” 
That is another feature that you emphasise in your 
affidavit, is that correct? 
MR GODI:   Very much so, Chair.  I think if this did not 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 40 of 236 
 
happen, we, the parliamentary track, would not be here.  
Probably the Speaker ’s office would be the only one 
coming here and saying look, this is what we did to track 
these things but it did not happen. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And I will be coming back to that in 
some detail.  And then fourthly you say, during the same 
period: 
“Parliament failed to adopt any mechanism directed 
at compelling or encouraging ministers to ensure 
that 
such 
proposed 
corrective 
action 
was 
10 
implemented.” 
That is the fourth main theme in your affidavit, is that 
correct? 
MR GODI:   Correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright and again we will come back to 
that.  Now what I would like to turn to now but only in 
summary and overview is what is addressed in paragraphs 
6.5 through to 6.18 of your affidavit and just to focus very 
briefly and very generally on the way in which SCOPA went 
about its job.  I think you have already emphasised – just 
20 
bear with me – let us start at paragraph 6.5.  It is correct, 
is it not, that every year SCOPA is required to consider 
something of the order of 200 to 250 audit reports. 
MR GODI:   Correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   In other words, you have a vast scope 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 41 of 236 
 
of material to deal with which emerges from the terms of 
reference of your committee that we have already looked 
at. 
MR GODI:   Correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   What you do is you examine and then 
prioritise and then select where to focus on in particular, is 
that correct? 
MR GODI:   Well, as you indicated in the preceding 
paragraph is you have 200 reports of 220 reports, with the 
amount of time available for us, as a committee, you 
10 
certainly cannot have hearings on everything so we had to 
prioritise and it was not against work on how we prioritise, 
there was a system, there was a process. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Right.   Now before we look at that 
system the point you make in paragraph 6.7 is that all this 
documentation that routinely came to your committee 
revealed, would you say, and I quote: 
“A 
disturbingly 
high 
number 
of 
cases 
of 
unauthorised 
expenditure, 
irregular 
expenditure, 
fruitless and wasteful expenditure in other material 
20 
non-compliance.” 
Disturbingly high you say. 
MR GODI:   But look Chair our approach in SCOPA was 
that we want accountability for every cent of public money, 
but when you have unauthorised expenditure, irregular 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 42 of 236 
 
expenditure, 
fruitless 
and 
wasteful 
expenditure 
being 
counted in bills surely for anyone who seeks to serve the 
public good, that should be worry some.  
ADV FREUND SC:   And so would you explain in paragraph 
6.8, is that your committee identified certain focus areas of 
particular concern, and I'm referring now to the fifth 
parliament 2014 to 2019.  And right up at the top of those 
is compliance with supply chain management is prescripts.  
Is that correct?  
MR GODI:   That is very correct because there above that 
10 
we spoke to in the preceding paragraph, are a product of 
non-compliance 
from 
non-compliance, 
everything 
else 
goes.  
ADV FREUND SC:   And you say in paragraph 6.8, you also 
say: 
“Prioritised 
internal 
controls, 
you 
prioritised 
unauthorised, 
irregular, 
fruitless 
and 
wasteful 
expenditure.” 
And you prioritise you make the point in 6.8.4: 
“Consequence management against officials who do 
20 
not comply with legislation.” 
Could we just pause there for a moment and if you could 
just 
summarise 
your 
whole 
view 
on 
the 
problem 
of 
consequence management as you experienced it, in the 
period during which you chaired SCOPA. 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 43 of 236 
 
MR GODI:   Chair if you - if one looks at our resolutions, 
you hardly find a resolution where we are not calling for 
action to be taken against officials who have not complied 
with legislation.  Because how then do you get things right, 
if there are no consequences?   
I am talking here about the accounting officer in the 
first instance but also the executive authority, that is the 
Ministers because they get all these reports and if you find 
that there is persistent non-compliance, surely it should be 
interested in what action is taken.   
10 
And as has been the bane of the public sector that 
the people who do not comply, and action is not taken 
against them, or who resigned from this department and 
then they just go to the next department as if nothing has 
happened, or move to a municipality or to provincial 
departments and that I believe that sense of impunity, is 
what emboldened the looters to continue as if they have a 
democratic right to be corrupt.   
ADV FREUND SC:   Now, we are going to come back to 
that issue over and over again, it seems to me.  If I can 
20 
just continue with the theme of just trying to give some 
understanding of how your committee went about its work.  
In paragraph 6.9 you say: 
“That the committee focused in hearings, primarily 
on entities that were proportioned the largest 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 44 of 236 
 
budgets, and on reports that disclosed the most 
serious level of financial mismanagement.” 
Is that correct? 
MR GODI:   Yes it is right, that said that our prioritisation 
had to you know, be based on something and we felt that 
where you have the largest budgets and where you have 
the high levels of financial mismanagement, that should be 
of interest and may I say if you link that up with the line 
above 6.8.8 deviations and expansions.  
I must say that this is - we discovered this to be 
10 
another 
form 
or 
another 
area 
of 
non-compliance 
to 
circumvent 
going 
through 
the 
tendering 
process 
departments will always do deviations that is deviating 
from normal processes, or expansions.  That is if you get a 
tender for R20million and they say no, because you are 
doing a good job can we add another job for R5million just 
like that and this has become the favourite routes through 
which departments avoid compliance and Chair I bet you, if 
you were to say, let us look into additions and expansions, 
you would see a frighteningly high amounts that are 
20 
involved.  
And this process is given a veneer of legality by 
National Treasury because it is the one that must obtain it 
but our own experience and search has been that the 
processes at National Treasury were not fool proof and we 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 45 of 236 
 
actually and we actually want to believe Transnet and say 
to National Treasury and we just opposite of all the 
requests that is being approved, project approved any of 
them because it just do not make sense why they had to be 
done.  
So I am just saying that it is an area which is not 
really sufficient like regular expenditure but it is one area 
of high, very high and disturbing instances of non-
compliance and we had requested National Treasury to 
report to us on a quarterly basis on deviations and 
10 
expansions and the billions involved per quarter were quite 
staggering. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you.  Now, I just want to refer 
you briefly to paragraph 6.10.  I am not going to take you 
to the annexure but the annexure that is referred there, 
Annexure TG1 is a document that lists voluminous hearings 
held, 
voluminous 
resolutions 
adopted 
and 
voluminous 
oversight reports and that is just in respect to the period 
2015 to 2018.  Is that correct?  I am just trying to draw 
attention to the volume of the work and the volume 
20 
…[intervene] 
MR GODI:   Yes, it is very correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And then you deal in your affidavit with 
we have already touched on this on the question of 
creating a collegial spirit, so I will not go back to that.  I 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 46 of 236 
 
would like to focus on paragraph 6.15.   
Now, there, you explained that before your tenure 
as Chair of SCOPA, it had not been the committee's 
practice to require Ministers to attend SCOPA hearings to 
account to SCOPA but that you took a different view. 
Perhaps if you could just summarise very briefly the 
view you took and how that then played itself out?  
MR GODI:   Well, our view was that when departments or 
entities come the Ministers under whom they fall should 
also come because the issues and the challenges that are 
10 
there should be of interest to them and in cases of 
assistance Ministers who themselves actually explained to 
us, what is it that they are doing to address the challenges 
that we are discussing.   
And in a number of occasions Chair, we found that 
a Minister has actually been misled by his officials and 
Ministers would say but when we discussing the very 
enthusiastic, 
the 
very 
relevant 
but 
to 
SCOPA 
your 
stammering and stuttering because they were telling the 
Minister what they thought he would like to hear, but 
20 
before us it was not the case.  Oh yes there we said 
Ministers we said they should attend, yes.  
ADV FREUND SC:   Right, thank you.  Now I would like to 
take you to paragraph 6.19 in following of the affidavit. We 
have already referred to this issue in summary, but I now 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 47 of 236 
 
want to refer to it a little more detail.  It is the section of 
your 
affidavit 
under 
the 
heading 
the 
persistence 
of 
financial mismanagement, despite SCOPA’s efforts.  
And as a convenient reference point, you have 
attached to your affidavit, what we call the SCOPA legacy 
report for the fifth parliament.   
Now there we will be referred to other legacy 
reports in these hearings but to very briefly and crudely 
summarise, is it correct that at the end of each five-year 
term of parliament, each committee including SCOPA would 
10 
do a report on the five-year period, what it had learned, 
what it prioritised and what it recommended should be 
prioritised by the next incoming committee.  Is that a fair 
summary?  
MR GODI:   That is a correct summary, yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright.  Now, I am not going to take 
you to the report itself but I would like to take you to the 
extract from the report that is quoted in paragraph 6.20 
because this is, as I understand it, a report issued by 
SCOPA 
under 
your 
Chairmanship 
as 
it 
were 
at 
the 
20 
termination of your period as Chair of SCOPA.  In other 
words, fairly recently, just before the last elections, and if I 
may say so it sounds somewhat like a cry from the heart.  
It sounds to me like this is you trying to summarise and 
that is long before this Commission was interested in this 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 48 of 236 
 
topic, your views on this issue.  
So I would ask you, please, to take us through what 
we 
read 
in 
paragraph 
6.20 
because 
this 
seems 
to 
summarise what you reported in your legacy report, which 
summarises your experience. 
MR GODI:   Ja, well Chair the 6.20 the quote from the 
Chairperson’s 
quote 
that 
is 
my 
statements 
as 
the 
Chairperson, which looks back and say, what were the 
problems.  
As you can see there the first thing that I talk to is 
10 
the fact that the exponential increase in irregular fruitless 
and wasteful expenditure was not a reflection on the 
effectiveness of the committee, effectiveness in terms of 
doing our work as assigned by the rules of parliament.  
But that is the level of responsiveness to the 
recommendations of parliament from the executive was at 
the heart of it all.  The lack of political and administrative 
will to do what is right for the country to stop the looting of 
public funds and I also in the second paragraph, just 
indicate that we had called out the malfeasance in a 
20 
number of entities and I have picked up those that were 
very frequent, or those that we considered has been right 
there on top, but to no avail.  I am sure you would have 
seen maybe some of the annexures in the literature of 
solutions on the SABC or something like that.  
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 49 of 236 
 
And 
I 
believe 
that 
the 
relationship 
between 
parliament and the executive does need to be looked at as 
a practical necessity, but also a legal necessity.  How is it 
that the judiciary for instance say the sentence this style of 
pertinence and the executive and the executives respond 
by locking you up in prison for that period?  
But parliament says, we recommend that do A, B, C, 
D to comply with the law and there is tardiness or there is 
no recourse if that is not dealt with then oversight would 
actually become a ritual.  I understand that the constitution 
10 
says we must over see it, it must hold to account but I 
asked towards the end, at the bottom.  
What is the enforcement mechanism of holding to 
account, hold them to account here we call them, we tell 
them this is all when they agreed and say go and correct it 
as we will and then we adopt.  What is the enforcement 
mechanism in the absence of responsiveness?  I think that 
is a legal and a political question that needs to be 
answered.  
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you and I just want to highlight 
20 
one part of that passage that you did not refer to it is 
above the sixth line and you say this: 
“The executive branch is not responsive to the 
recommendations from parliament. There is not 
sufficient political and administrative will to do what 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 50 of 236 
 
is right for the country to stop the looting of funds.” 
Is that a view that you formed on the basis of extensive 
personal experience?  
MR GODI:   Well, like I indicated at the beginning, I was 
there for 13 and a half years, and finally we got these 
reports from the Auditor General and they all made for, you 
know, depressing reading.  There was always hearings 
where we highlighted but the persistence was there and 
actually the worsening of the situation was there.  
So there was no other conclusion to come up to 
10 
than to take, well, the political leadership does not seem to 
have a way to address this problem, the administrative 
leadership, that is Boards of entities and the DG’s and the 
entities or executive management.  We are just not doing 
that which is expected in terms of the law. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright, if I can move you on then to 
paragraph 6.12, which follows similar patterns. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Freund, Mr Godi are you 
quite confident that out of all those years, during which 
you served as Chairperson of SCOPA and I think you said 
20 
18 years.  Effectively, the position is that the financial 
statements, 
or 
reports 
relating 
to 
SOE’s 
or 
certain 
important 
SOE’s 
or 
all 
of 
them 
and 
government 
departments, wherever there had been reports that were 
not acceptable the previous year, the following year 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 51 of 236 
 
SCOPA would raise the same issues again and they would 
just not be - the response would not be one that would be 
the 
right 
response 
from 
either 
the 
Ministers 
or 
the 
accounting officer ’s.  
So in other words, are you quite confident that as a 
matter of fact, even if it is not all the entities, but those 
important SOE’s and then maybe certain government 
departments, problems that had emerged in the previous 
year, would be raised in the following year to say, what 
have you done about this?  
10 
And it would be year in, year out and most of the 
time, the problems would not be addressed that SCOPA 
had raised, including problems that were pointed out in the 
AG’s reports about such government departments and 
SOE’s, actually do you say that is likely to be the position? 
MR GODI:   Chair I am saying it very emphatically so 
because we – SCOPA maybe 99% of our times we rely on 
the reports of the Auditor General and those reports were 
submitted to parliament and signed on by the Minister and 
the accounting officers as correct.  
20 
Indeed, like you have put it yes you may find that 
this year Department of Health has improved to find that 
agriculture has gone down but you will have others like 
your Correctional Services colleagues – the only other time 
Correctional Services had an unqualified audit was when 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 52 of 236 
 
we had seven audits[?] and sued them in one financial 
year.  But even that unqualified audit, it was merely the 
fact that they just wanted different things not that it was 
clean, there was still a huge, huge problem.  So yes, we 
have not been moving forward in terms of controls and 
accountability. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I am sure Mr Freund d will deal 
with this later but I want to ask this question now.  With the 
frustrations that I assume SKOPA must have felt over the 
years arising from raising issues with the executive year in 
10 
year out and the issues not being addressed either at all 
for a number of years, or not being addressed adequately.  
Did it every occur to SCOPA that it should consider 
saying to the National Assembly, the accounting officers, 
the DG’s, or chief executive officers of these Boards, and 
the 
Boards 
themselves 
are 
not 
addressing 
serious 
problems involving taxpayer ’s money for a number of years 
and the Ministers concerned do not seem to take any 
action against the chief executive officers Board.  
This should be raised with the President whoever 
20 
the President was to say this is unacceptable.  This is how 
long it has taken. Instead of improving maybe the situation 
is deteriorating.  This is taxpayers and to then see what 
the President whoever the President was, would do and if 
he did not do anything I would like to find out whether you 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 53 of 236 
 
as SCOPA or maybe you yourself, because maybe you did 
not discuss this would not feel that that should form 
grounds for the National Assembly to lose confidence in 
the President if under his administration, such things 
affecting taxpayers money were not addressed and he was 
not doing anything about it or was not prepared to take 
necessary actions. 
MR GODI:   Thank you, Chair.  Well, if one looks at 
SCOPA’s 
resolutions, 
which 
the 
National 
Assembly 
adopted, we always indicated that these are not new 
10 
issues, these are persistent issues.    
In the Speaker ’s office the office that is responsible 
for oversight, it is the House Chair for committees what we 
call the Chair of Chairs.  I have committed ...[indistinct – 
distorted] Obed Mabella and I would in our frequent 
engagements 
highlight 
the 
fact 
that 
we 
have 
these 
challenges and they were also aware because the Auditor 
General also found in parliament.  
So 
the 
problem 
and 
the 
persistence 
of 
the 
problems, were not a hidden factor to the leadership of 
20 
parliament through our reports that we gave and every time 
we made a request for meetings, you need to explain what 
the meeting were about and it is always dictated, this is 
what we want to do, this is how we want it and it will then 
have to go to the Chief Whip for approval.  
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 54 of 236 
 
So the key officers in parliament are very much aware of 
the things that we are taking on.  And I must say that 
towards the end of our tenure, I do remember there was a 
time when our committee with Jan Booi actually met the 
then President, President Zuma and getting a copy of the 
fax we got from the Auditor General, a document from the 
Auditor General he also shared it with the then Deputy 
President, the current President Cyril Ramaphosa.  He 
shared it with the Chief Whip of the ANC the late Jackson 
Mthembu, who I must say never put roadblocks on our 
10 
work, always supported us to say look these are the things 
that we are dealing with.  I think also Minister Dlodlo in her 
capacity as something in the ANC.  
So, yes, but in terms of a formal resolution that 
says this is what we need to do, we did not to that, we 
were also alive to the dynamics that I started with for such 
a motion to succeed…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, yes, continue. 
MR GODI:   Ja, I was saying that for such a multi-stage 
firstly, and within SCOPA it will need the support of the 
20 
ANC, because all colleagues from cooperative committee is 
the majority.  Then from there the cooperative committee 
must agree to, to program it and then in the House, the 
ANC must oppose it.  So sometimes you look at the 
political dynamics and you already understand the limits of 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 55 of 236 
 
what can or cannot be done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I understand, I understand but from 
what you are saying, part of what you are saying is that in 
the end, a lot of things in parliament that may be 
necessary to be done cannot be done or will not be done if 
the majority party does not support those things, so in the 
end, very often you come down to that. 
MR GODI:   Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, thank you, Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, thank you Chair, I will come back 
10 
to that.  I would just prefer just to lay a little bit more of a 
foundation before I come back to it.  And I was at 
paragraph 6.21 of the affidavit and we were looking at the 
legacy report at the end of the fifth parliament and what we 
see in paragraph 6.21 is that the legacies of fortress refer 
to a number of them…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry again, Mr Freund to interrupt 
you.  We did not take the tea break at quarter past 11 
because we had had some, we had wasted, we had lost 
some time.  It is 12 o'clock I think we should take it now 15 
20 
minutes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because it is 12 o'clock at quarter past 
12 we will resume.  We adjourn. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 56 of 236 
 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Godi can you hear 
me clearly? 
MR GODI:  Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Thank you.  Mr Godi I was about to take 
you to paragraph 6.21 and this is just summarising a 
summary.  Your Legacy Report summarises the views you 
held and reported at the end of the 5 t h Parliament and this 
10 
paragraph summarises what you said there.  It talks about a 
disregard of applicable legislation including for example the 
PFMA and the Treasury Regulations by officials and senior 
management. 
 
It 
talks 
about 
a 
lack 
of 
consequence 
management for officials responsible for non-compliance 
with legislation and it talks about SCOPA recommendations 
not being implemented.  Is that a fair summary of what you 
said in your Legacy Report? 
MR GODI:  Ja, no that is very correct Chair. 
ADV FREUND SC:  What I would like you is just to illustrate 
20 
that by reference to some examples.  So if we could go to 
paragraph 6.22 and you will see there there is a reference to 
Annexure TG3.  That annexure Chair is in Bundle 1 starting 
at page 156.  That is the PO1 number on the top left and Mr 
Godi if you could have a look at that – at that annexure and I 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 57 of 236 
 
am going to take you to a particular page in it shortly but just 
so that we can get our bearings if you go to page – Bundle 1 
page 157 you will see what it is that the document is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We… 
ADV FREUND SC:  You will see I presume that it is headed 
Report on the Committee on Public Accounts on its oversight 
visit to the South African Airways Group; SAA and Transnet 
00:02:11 in Johannesburg from 13 to 17 August 2018.  Is this 
a report prepared under your leadership? 
MR GODI:  Correct. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:  Now for the moment I am going to leave 
aside SAA and I am going to look at Transnet and you start 
dealing with Transnet at page 166 on portion 5, is that 
correct? 
MR GODI:  The – yes, yes, yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And in that section I am only going to 
focus on one paragraph in your conclusion.  And your 
conclusion is at page 167.  In fact first look at two 
paragraphs.  The first two paragraphs.   
“The committee further recommends that the 
20 
Executive 
Authority 
submits 
a 
progress 
report on the implementation of all the above 
recommendations to the National Assembly 
within 60 days of adoption of this report by 
the House.” 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 58 of 236 
 
 
And then the paragraph to which I was intending to 
pay particular attention. 
“The committee was generally disappointed 
by 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
the Accounting 
Authority and Management seemed not to 
have addressed the financial management 
weaknesses identified in the Audit Report 
especially as some of these matters had 
been raised in the Audit Report of previous 
years.” 
10 
 
Now did that report reflect what you found in this 
particular oversight exercise? 
MR GODI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And was this untypical – was this 
unusual? 
MR GODI:  Not at all.  That is why I said earlier when the 
Chair asked me a question I said our reports usually would 
actually raise the fact that the problems that we are 
addressing were not new issues but they were persistent 
issues.  So it was – it was not unusual to have this kind of 
20 
sentence or to encounter this kind of situation. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Alright thank you.  And in paragraph 6.23 
and I am not going to take you through the detail of that but 
there you address a similar point in respect of the SABC.  
Oversight visits non-compliance, failure to correct previous 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 59 of 236 
 
non-compliance, further repetition of similar non-compliance.  
Is that a fair summary? 
MR GODI:  That is correct.  Not that we had extensive 
meetings with the SABC including on-site visits to actually 
our oversight visits would now always arise from the 
hearings.  So if there would be a hearing and there are 
particular issues that we are concerned about we then say 
no I have to do an oversight visit to visit your place.  And 
when we are there we would then meet with the different 
sections within say SABC.  We would like say want to meet 
10 
with the internal auditors.  We would want to meet with this 
section or that section without management being there so 
that they can speak freely and all the people that the Auditor 
General would have reported on when you speak to the 
workers they will actually confirm all those things and even 
more. 
ADV FREUND SC:  So to highlight and illustrate the same 
point can I take you to paragraph 6.23.6. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you going back to his affidavit now? 
ADV FREUND SC:  This is in Mr Godi’s affidavit at page 114 
20 
in Bundle 1 and paragraph 6.23.6.  So in paragraph 6.23 you 
deal in some detail which I am not going to lead now with 
various engagements with the SABC but ultimately what you 
do is you furnish a further report that is referred to in 
paragraph 6.23.5 which is SCOPA’s report on SABC’s 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 60 of 236 
 
2018/2109 financial statements and Chair just for your 
reference although I am not going to take you there that is in 
Bundle 1 page 204.  All I want to refer you to is the extract 
that we see in 6.23.6 where Mr Godi you say in your 
affidavit: 
“I pointed out in the introduction which is of 
this report the following:  That in that 
interaction the following stated.  Despite 
several hearings having been held with the 
SABC during the 5t h Parliament and oversight 
10 
visit that the committee undertook in March 
2017 the audit outcomes have not given an 
indication of improvement in the SABC’s 
financial performance.” 
 
So I take it this is just another illustrative example of 
what you have been trying to tell the Chair about? 
MR GODI:  Correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Thank you.  Now I want to move on to 
the portion of your affidavit that starts at page 13 under the 
heading Absence of Effective Mechanisms to ensure the 
20 
real… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry Mr – Sorry Mr Freund you say page 
13? 
ADV FREUND SC:  Sorry it is page 115 in the – in Bundle 1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The black numbers? 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 61 of 236 
 
ADV FREUND SC:  It is – sorry I 00:07:38. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The black numbers. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Sorry page 13. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:  But at page 35 Bundle 1.  And I will 
repeat the heading Absence of Effective Mechanisms to 
ensure real accountability.  So you refer there quite 
understandably 
and 
correctly 
to 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
separation of powers but I do not really want to get engaged 
in a long legal debate with you now.  And you say in 
10 
paragraph 6.26: 
“SCOPA speaks chiefly through its reports 
which are tabled before Parliament.” 
 
And then you say in paragraph 6.29: 
“SCOPA’s reports within the ordinary course 
be adopted by the National Assembly.” 
 
Have I got all that correct? 
MR GODI:  Yes that is correct Chair.  We as a committee – 
we are a committee of Parliament whatever work we do we 
do it on behalf of Parliament so we then need report to 
20 
Parliament and it is Parliament that must then adopt the 
reports.  And I must say that I do not remember any report of 
SCOPA having been rejected by the House.  All the reports 
to the House were always debated.  They were always 
debated.  We requested and we were granted the fact that all 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 62 of 236 
 
of our reports would be – yes we did not have enough time 
because sometimes we – we would submit three, four reports 
at the same time but the time we had will be thirty minutes, 
forty minutes and surely that was not enough but at least 
there were debates on some of the reports that we 
submitted. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And what you also tell the Chair is that 
as a matter of usual experience the SCOPA reports would be 
adopted 
by 
the 
National 
Assembly 
as 
approved 
by 
Parliament? 
10 
MR 
GODI: 
 
Ja 
I 
mean 
look 
there 
was 
always 
this 
understanding that whatever SCOPA brings the House would 
not have issues because the 
assumption is that the 
committee does a very thorough job and no-one would want 
to stand up and say you know we do not think there stance 
against corruption is wrong we must defend this.  So it was 
almost a given that our reporting be adopted but that 
adoption what did it mean and what effect and impact it had 
beyond adoption? 
ADV FREUND SC:  That is the issue I am going to come to if 
20 
you just give me a minute or two.  So I would like to take you 
to your paragraph 6.28.  You say there the following: 
“In the period during which I chaired SCOPA all of our 
reports 
contained 
recommendations 
as 
regards 
required corrective action.  For example our reports 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 63 of 236 
 
would 
request 
certain 
Ministers 
to 
report 
to 
Parliament on specified steps taken to address 
particular issues within a given period.” 
And then you continue in brackets. 
“(some reports requested the Speaker to repeat 
requests made in earlier reports until such time that 
there was compliance).” 
Now I take it that is factually correct, is it? 
MR GODI:  Yes it is. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And what you say in paragraph 6.30 is 
10 
that generally the office of the Speaker would issue requests 
to Ministers in accordance with SCOPA reports, is that 
correct? 
MR GODI:  That is correct Chair and every time the Speaker 
wrote to a Minister I would be copied so I would know that 
the adopted resolution has been communicated to the 
relevant Minister. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Well if I may say so, so far so good.  It 
looks we have like a system that is functioning.  But you 
then continue in paragraph 6.31 as follows: 
20 
“But there was no structured mechanism in 
place to follow up adequately and ultimately 
to hold the executive accountable.  In my 
view and the view of the committee this 
severely hamstrung the exercise of adequate 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 64 of 236 
 
oversight. 
 
Committee 
members 
became 
increasingly 
frustrated 
with 
the 
lack 
of 
responsiveness of the executive.” 
 
Could you maybe just elaborate on that please? 
MR GODI:  Well Chair may I say that in as much as I have 
ever said that whenever the Speaker rules to relevant 
Minister forwarding the House resolutions I was copied.  I 
have never received or I was never copied of any letter of 
follow up from the Speaker’s office on any of those 
resolutions that were passed indicating that the – the 
10 
resolutions that were forwarded to the Ministers and the time 
frames to that are being – are being pursued.  So we would 
go to the House debate the resolutions, adopt them and I will 
be copied the letters from the Speaker to the relevant 
Ministers and that is where it ended. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Alright now you deal with the obvious 
consequence of that with – in paragraph 6.32.  You say 
there: 
“In an effort to remedy this I approached the 
Chair of Chairs Mr Cedric Frolick sometime 
20 
during the postponement.  He gave me an 
assurance that the office of the Speaker 
would configure a so called dashboard which 
would keep track of deadlines and follow up 
and ensure compliance with all the house 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 65 of 236 
 
resolutions.” 
 
Can you confirm that? 
MR GODI:  Well Chair I can confirm that this is factually 
correct that members of SCOPA were quite frustrated with 
this – dealing with the same things almost year in and year 
out.  I must say that I – I had a very good working 
relationship with the Comrade Cedric Frolick and he had an 
open door policy with me that any time I needed any 
assistance I could knock on his door.  And so it was easy for 
me to go and raise this issue about the fact that the 
10 
committee is unhappy and I must say that he appeared 
genuinely convinced that the 00:14:29 was going to be – was 
going to be configured as a matter of time and they will be 
able to track.  The concern was not just about SCOPA 
resolutions but it was just about the business of the House.  
Of course I had gone there for SCOPA but he 00:14:40 that 
not in relation to SCOPA but generally in relation to most of 
the resolutions in the House they are not able to get 
feedback timeously and promptly so {?} but [?] did not 
happen. 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:  That is my next question.  What 
happened if anything?  Did it happen?  Did it come about?  
Is it in place to this day? 
MR GODI:  Well it – it did not happen and it remained a sore 
point to the committee and there was no indication of what 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 66 of 236 
 
transpired.  By the time I left Parliament in May 2019 there 
was no such 00:15:34 who figures many there was still no 
system to track, to monitor the resolutions compliance with 
the resolutions of the House or actually responses to the 
resolutions of the House from the executives. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Now you are talking about an approach 
you made to the Chair of Chairs in the time that you were 
Chair of SCOPA but I would like to refer you to paragraph 
6.37 of your affidavit.  That refers to a document which the 
Chair will be hearing quite a bit about in the course of these 
10 
hearings known as the oversight and accountability model 
adopted by Parliament in 2009.  Are you familiar with that 
document Mr Godi? 
MR GODI:  Correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And Chair just for your – for your benefit 
but I am not going to take you there now that is to be found 
in the Reference Bundle at 1-48 and following.  Now the 
evidence from various witnesses will be that this was the 
product of the consideration by structures of Parliament as 
to how they should – how they should deal with the question 
20 
of oversight and accountability.   
 
And you will see in this 2009 document paragraph 
4.1.4 commences as follows: 
“In developing the oversight model the need 
was identified.  I stress this was published in 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 67 of 236 
 
2009 for support services relating to the 
monitoring and tracking of issues between 
Parliament and the executive and on all other 
related matters within Parliament’s border 
mandate.  An oversight and advisory section 
ought to be created in response to the need 
identified.  It’s main functions will be to 
provide 
advice, 
technical 
support, 
co-
ordination 
and 
tracking 
and 
monitoring 
mechanisms on issues arising from oversight 
10 
and accountability activities of members of 
Parliament and the committees to which they 
belong.” 
 
Now my question to you Mr Godi is to the best of 
your knowledge has any of this ever been implemented? 
MR GODI:  Well Chair it has not been implemented and I – I 
must say my understanding was that between 1994 and 2004 
the focus was on dismantling the apartheid legislative 
architecture and trying to align it with a new constitution.  
Not that we are done with that I think there are still lots of 
20 
00:18:22 bylaws that are still in 00:18:26 but from 2004 it 
was now this focus on oversight and that is why this model 
was developed.  It was an extensive process, debates, 
discussions but like we spoke about the executive earlier on 
[indistinct] because when I went to Comrade Frolick I did not 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 68 of 236 
 
even look at this oversight model.  It merely arose from the 
concerns of members on the lack of tracking mechanisms but 
yes you are correct; here it is, something that should have 
been done not because we have made a request but because 
Parliament had committed itself to doing it and has not done 
it. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Alright thank you.  Now I want to draw 
attention to another recommendation in the OVAC model if I 
can refer you to page – to paragraph 6.40 – 40 of your 
affidavit it is Bundle 1 page 118.  Again it is not necessary to 
10 
go to the document because we have quoted the relevant 
paragraph.  And the paragraph reads as follows: 
“It is recommended that Parliament develop 
rules to 
assist it further in 
sanctioning 
Cabinet Ministers – Cabinet Members for 
non-compliance after all established avenues 
and protocols have been exhausted.  For 
example naming the Cabinet Minister by the 
Speaker of the National Assembly or the 
Chairperson – there is a typographical error 
20 
– or the Chairperson of the Counsel based 
on full explanation.” 
 
And I see you say in your affidavit you support that 
recommendation. 
MR GODI:  Chair the – that synonym of the Speaker maybe 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 69 of 236 
 
members of Parliament it is not a new.  On any occasions 
when members of Parliament they impede Cabinet Ministers 
are deemed to have 00:20:36 in some transgressions there 
are instances where the Speaker would call the member to 
stand up and that member would be given addressing down 
right in the – right in the House.  So the paragraph that we 
just quoted actually extends it specifically to when Ministers 
do not respond to the resolutions of the House and I – I fully 
support it because the previous paragraph that you quoted 
said there should be [?] to follow up but then when you 
10 
follow up and there is no response then what do you do?  So 
this last paragraph actually provides a mechanism, shame 
them, call them out so that they – the House and the public 
would know that here is a delinquent Minister or whatever.  
So it was a mechanism – it is a mechanism that should 
actually have been applied. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Thank you.  Now I want to move on to a 
slightly different issue.  You referred at an earlier stage in 
overview to your view about the importance when we under – 
when we analyse Parliamentary oversight. But we have 
20 
regard to the political realities.  And I would like to take you 
to paragraph 6.35 of your affidavit it is Bundle 1 page 117. 
MR GODI:  6 can you repeat 6? 
ADV FREUND SC:  35 – 35. 
MR GODI:  Oh okay. 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 70 of 236 
 
ADV FREUND SC:  And perhaps if you could just talk to this 
issue and elaborate on your views in relation to the 
implications of – of a Parliament that is dominated by one 
strong party and the relevance of politics to this oversight 
question we are talking about? 
MR GODI:  Well Chair the – what I mean here is that the 
political dynamics within the party that has the majority in 
the House would certainly determine how Parliamentary work 
is done.  Because like I said at the end of the day oversight 
is heavily 00:22:54 upon by politics and I can tell you that I 
10 
have seen in Parliament how members of various political 
parties who come to the House on a particular issue with 
political mandates on that stance to take and the reason and 
facts will not sway them otherwise.  So politics remain a – a 
determinant and this sometimes it is unfortunately and 
especially with the majority party you would see it in the 
work of the Portfolio Committees and I say this with no 
malice 
that 
many 
of 
our 
comrades 
in 
the 
Portfolio 
Committees are very pliable and acted like useful 00:23:42 
of the executive if I can use that word.  In terms of not plain 
20 
oversight but having instances where they will actually 
00:23:52 officials in meetings instead of assisting over the 
side to the point where members of SCOPA, from the ANC, 
from the EFF, from the DA would actually request that I 
should never schedule 00:24:08 hearings with Portfolio 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 71 of 236 
 
Committees because they felt they were a hindrance to 
effective oversight.  So whatever the political dynamics were 
but there were a lot of our – of colleagues in the Portfolio 
Committees who were actually an embarrassment to the 
notion of public presentation and to oversight itself.  So I 
believe that it is – it is the political dynamics that play 
themselves 
out 
either 
as 
an 
enabler 
of 
00:24:47 
or 
embarrassed of it. 
ADV FREUND SC:  I would like to turn to a related issue and 
that is the consequence to individual members of Parliament 
10 
if they do stand up and insist on exercising appropriate 
oversight could you comment on that with reference to 
yourself, to members of your own SCOPA committee and any 
other committees of which you have any knowledge? 
MR GODI:  Well Chair I am not in Parliament because the 
IEC said you know this country is not a vote for me or did 
not see value in me.  That is okay.  But I think political 
parties that 
displaced 
seriousness to the 
question 
of 
oversight and especially the fight against corruption.  And I 
will make two examples.  00:25:48 he had a member there 
20 
Team who is the qualified forensics expert and we used him 
a 
lot 
in 
SCOPA 
when 
we 
dealing 
with 
police, 
with 
correctional services.  He did a lot of work for us to empower 
us as a committee but after these elections the DA did not 
retain him. I understand it is somewhere in the NCOP and 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 72 of 236 
 
they have new members in SCOPA.  You look at the ANC I do 
not know whether it is coincidence but all SCOPA members 
from the ANC were not returned to Parliament.  Now here are 
your 
members 
who 
served 
in 
the 
best 
committee 
in 
Parliament and have shown diligence in fighting corruption 
and in advocating for good governance.  And you feel those 
people are not worthy of being retained and you have new 
members altogether in that committee. So I think that yes the 
talk is there but you must demonstrate that talk.  I do not 
know what the dynamics are within the ANC but I know that 
10 
always we would talk in the corridors that the step that they 
were taking was going to have negative consequences for 
their political careers so to speak.  And for those that I had 
in the 5t h Parliament all of them – all of them not even one 
has gone back to Parliament and tell me that it is mere 
coincidence. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Mr Godi I want to just deal with one last 
aspect in your affidavit before I turn to the – the draft 
affidavit of Mr Makwetu.  At the end of your affidavit you deal 
with the recent statutory amendments to the Public Audit Act 
20 
and I think the committee – the commission has already 
heard evidence that the member legislation gives the Auditor 
General’s office certain additional powers.  If you could 
maybe just comment on your views on that legislation? 
MR GODI:  Well Chair I – just two comments for me.  Firstly 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 73 of 236 
 
this Act gives someone or a body outside the executive or 
the Accounting Officers and Authorities a responsibility to do 
their work.  Essentially the AG must now chase after the 
thieves – after the thieving Ministers and officials because 
they cannot help themselves.  It is impassive.  So they need 
someone outside themselves to do it.  I have personally in 
as much as we supported the Act because at the end of the 
day we needed to have something but in principle I have 
stood and proposed to this Act and I have said so in public 
and I repeat so that it is – there is a shame – it is shameful 
10 
that Ministers and their Accounting Officers and Authorities 
cannot deal with corruption and must now delegate this 
responsibility 
to 
a 
constitutional 
structure 
and 
that 
Parliament connived in that process.  It is a poor reflection 
on us because if our people are now going to rely on a 
constitutional bodies on matters that should be handled by 
elected officials then what is the relevance of Parliament?  
What is the relevance of elected officials?  I – I think that 
this is a very, very wrong legislation to the extent that it 
actually acknowledges that our system is unresponsive and 
20 
therefore we give up being able to deal with the ...[indistinct] 
[00:00:03] of public funds which denies our people the right 
to timeous and quality service. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Mr Godi, I would like to change that 
completely now.  I want to refer to the unsigned draft 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 74 of 236 
 
affidavit of Mr Makweto which is to be found in Bundle 4 on 
page 847 onwards. 
MR GODI:   Can I just have a minute?  Can I just change my 
files? 
ADV FREUND SC:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just before you proceed Mr Freund.  Can I 
ask another question to Mr Godi relating to something in his 
affidavit? 
ADV FREUND SC:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   This phenomenon Mr Godi...  This 
10 
phenomenon you are talking about of all ANC members of 
SCOPA not being retained.  Is that something that happened 
at the end of one particular term of Parliament for five years 
or is something that happened – something similar had 
happened during other terms as far as you know or is it 
something that you do not know? 
MR GODI:   Well, in the previous terms – what happened was 
that -  I think since I came to SCOPA, the only person who 
had 
been 
retained 
in 
the 
committee 
was 
Comrade 
...[indistinct] [00:02:04] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR GODI:   But all other members had not been retained and 
did not come back to Parliament.  It was only Comrade 
...[indistinct] [00:02:19] who joined us during the course of 
the Parliament.  But in the Parliaments – every time we were 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 75 of 236 
 
starting a new – but in the instance, in the sixth Parliament 
there is no one who is even a member of Parliament that you 
could say maybe they could have retained. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m.  Okay thank you.  You may 
proceed Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you Judge.  Mr Godi, back to 
the draft affidavit of Mr Makweto which starts at page 847 
of Bundle 4. 
MR GODI:   Yes, I have access to the bundle and I had time 
to go through it and consider the contents thereof. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright.  Now I would like to ask you 
just a general question.  Having read this long detailed, 
and if I may so depressing affidavit, what is your view in 
general terms about the contents of that affidavit? 
MR GODI:   Well, Chair I fully identify with the contents 
because the things that Mr Makweto had said here are 
issues that are of public knowledge because they are 
extracted from the annual reports or the ...[indistinct] 
[00:03:58] reports of the Auditor-General.   
 
The views that he has expressed on this page, 
20 
overall are views that are consistent with the views that 
would serve from time to time, either in official meetings or 
whenever we met unofficially and formally and discuss 
issues of what was said. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Would it be fair to say that you had a 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 76 of 236 
 
reasonable regular and a reasonable close relationship 
with Mr Makweto?  You were familiar with his views and 
you had regular discussions. 
MR GODI:   Well, look that is correct.  Remember, SCOPA is 
the one committee that uses the report of the Auditor-
General more than any other committee.  But also, beyond 
this and besides our official work, you know, Mr Makweto’s 
late uncle was my leader ...[indistinct] [00:05:03].   
 
So there was that personal touch and we would 
discuss issues much more relaxed than maybe some of his 
10 
predecessors.  So yes we did interacted a lot.  I could 
access him anytime and anytime he wanted to access me 
he would do so and ...[indistinct] [00:05:25]. 
 
Yes, we interacted regularly fairly well.  I must say. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And having read this affidavit, I think 
you have more than once, could you tell the Chair whether 
what you read in this affidavit is consistent with what he 
would be saying in your dealings with him? 
MR GODI:   Ja, that is why I said the views – firstly the 
evidence that he has presented in terms of narrating what 
20 
transpired at Transnet, it is a matter of public record.  His 
interpretation of those facts are from what I have read they 
are really consistent with what I would think should be his 
hearings or his views always use ...[indistinct] [00:06:20] 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, if I can just clarify.  You made 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 77 of 236 
 
mention of Transnet.  I was wondering whether you are 
intending to refer to PRASA. 
MR GODI:   Oh, PRASA.  Sorry, PRASA.  Yes, PRASA.   
ADV FREUND SC:   Now can you please turn to page 871 
in Bundle 4? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  What is that reference 
Mr Freund again? 
ADV FREUND SC:   871, Bundle 4.  PO-04871.  And in 
particular to paragraph 61. 
MR GODI:   One? 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:   61.  Sixty-one. 
MR GODI:   Yes, yes.  I have it.   
ADV FREUND SC:   You have it?  Chair, do you have it? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have got it.  Thank you Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you Chair.  Now Mr Godi, if we 
look at the table in paragraph 61.  It really is summarising 
a lot of what appears on the rest of this affidavit.  And it is 
talking about irregular expenditure within PRASA and the 
developments on an annual basis. 
 
So if we look at the right hand column, you will see 
20 
that what he deals with initially, he deals with five annual 
periods, 
2013/2014, 
2014/2015, 
2015/2016, 
2016/2017, 
2017/2018.  Now we look at the right.  He says on the 
2013/2014 year, the irregular expenditure is 0.01 billion.   
 
In the next annual period it is a little over half a 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 78 of 236 
 
billion.  Over the next annual billion it is more than 15 
billion.  In the next annual period it is more than 20 billion.  
And in the next annual period it is more than 24 billion. 
 
Now what is your comment on those facts? 
MR GODI:   Chair, I think one of the reports in this – one of 
the castings in his general reports was focussed on the 
irregular expenditure.  And what we notice.  Not just for 
PRASA but overall on an annual basis there was an increase 
in irregular expenditure.    
 
And what this tells you is that the compliance – the 
10 
rules and regulations, they were not being followed.  And it 
tells you that there is a progressive deterioration in financial 
controls and operational controls.  And that is at the heart of 
it all because as much as Chair, we say that irregular 
expenditure does not mean that there was corruption. 
 
But what it means is that the rules that have been 
put in place and the process that has been put in place have 
not been followed.  And we always argued that those rules 
are not for deliberation.  They are there to be followed. 
 
And whatever reason is there for not following the 
20 
rules.  And also taking into account that the people who are 
supposed to implement these rules are not just common 
idiots picked up in the street.  These are professionals who 
are actually specialist in financial management. 
 
So 
if 
you 
find 
instances 
where 
there 
is 
no 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 79 of 236 
 
compliance.  Surely, it is a red flag.  It is a warning sign.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But Mr Godi, you might not be able to say 
anything about this but this is really shocking.  I mean, even 
in regard to PRASA.  I have heard a lot of evidence about 
allegations of corruption at PRASA.   
 
But even in regard to PRASA who have a situation 
where in the 2013/2014 financial year irregular expenditure 
is 0.1 billion.  And in the following year it goes up quite 
substantially about half a billion irregular expenditure. 
 
I mean, the following year, financial year 2015/2016 
10 
you have R 15.3 billion irregular expenditure.  How – the 
previous year it was bad enough being half a billion but it 
was not even one billion.   
 
The following financial year it is R 15 billion.  As if 
that is not 
enough.  The following financial year is 
R 20.3 billion.  And of course, 2017/2018 it is R 24,2 billion.   
 
I mean, what kind of thing is that?  I mean, where 
are the people who were supposed to make sure that these 
rules are complied with?   
 
As 
you 
say, 
irregular 
expenditure 
does 
not 
20 
necessarily mean it is corruption but when it is at this level 
and happening the way this table seems to show, there 
would be great suspicion that a substantial part of it is 
corruption as far as I am concerned. 
 
But how it is possible?  Where is the relevant 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 80 of 236 
 
Minister if the CEO is not doing his job, if the board is not 
doing its job?  Where is the President who should be getting 
reports about the state of affairs of SOE’s who should be 
told about this situation at PRASA? 
 
Where are the politicians?  What are they doing?  
And then of course, we go back to Parliament.  Parliament 
gets told about this.  SCOPA does what he can.   
 
The National Assembly becomes aware of this, year 
in and year out but National Assembly can see that the 
people at PRASA are not taking any note of disapproval from 
10 
SCOPA about this level of expenditure every year.  Actually, 
it looks like each time as SCOPA say something they say we 
are going to show SCOPA.  They are not going to deter us. 
 
The following financial year it is worse.  How does 
one explain this?  It is as if there is no government.  It is as 
if there is no leadership.  It is as if government does not 
care about taxpayers’ money that – how taxpayer’s monies 
are used at PRASA.  It is shocking! 
 
And I guess it just confirms what you said earlier on 
that as SCOPA you would raise issues and the issues were 
20 
the same every year and they had not been sorted out and 
you would tell the National Assembly in your reports and 
nothing would happen.  That is what it says, I guess. 
MR GODI:   Chair, if I may.  I am sure we would ...[indistinct] 
[00:14:12] for ...[indistinct] Your Worship [00:14:12] SCOPA 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 81 of 236 
 
because now you are looking at PRASA and we had to look 
at everything because the Auditor-General would then write 
the accumulative total of all the irregular expenditure within 
the National Government and the provinces.   
 
And it was really, really hard indeed.  Those for us 
who wanted to do good for our people.  We knew that this 
waste of monies was supposed to change the lives of people 
out there in the rural areas, out there in the informal 
settlements but who are not able to get services because 
monies are being expended in ways that are contrary to the 
10 
provisions of the laws of legislation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now I want to...  I am sorry Judge. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I am done.  I am just shocked.  I am 
just really shocked.  Yes, you may proceed Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you Judge.  I want, through you 
Mr Godi, just briefly to get a sense of what this affidavit of 
Mr Makweto’s does because it lays a foundation for some 
further questions that I want to ask you. 
 
Can I ask you please to go to paragraph 43?  It is 
20 
at page 863 of Bundle 4.   
MR GODI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said 863? 
MR GODI:   I am there. 
ADV FREUND SC:   863, paragraph 40. 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 82 of 236 
 
MR GODI:   Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now you ...[intervenes]  
MR GODI:   I have it. 
ADV FREUND SC:   ...as somebody who has read this 
affidavit, you will know that this is just a foundation for the 
rest of this affidavit.  What Mr Makweto is showing in his 
affidavit, in his draft affidavit, is basically the procedures 
that he goes – well, his office goes through. 
 
And he says:   
“The 
Auditor-General’s 
office 
engage 
and 
10 
continued 
to 
engage 
with 
the 
following 
oversight structures to assist in exercising 
their own oversight functions.” 
 
And he starts with the board or the Administrator 
during times when PRASA was under administration.  May I 
say that he used PRASA simply to illustrate the more general 
problem. 
 
Secondly the Audit and Risk Committee which is a 
sub-committee of the board which is currently not place but 
it is due to the particular constituencies of PRASA. 
20 
 
Thirdly the Executive Authority and in this case 
would be the Minister of Transport.  And then only fourth and 
fifth the Portfolio Committee on Transport and SCOPA. 
 
And he spends a lot of his affidavit dealing not only 
with the Portfolio Committee and with SCOPA but with the 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 83 of 236 
 
anterior levels of oversight with which he engages.  Can you 
confirm that? 
MR GODI:   I want to confirm but it is correct and I think the 
– that process was intensified under – was set under 
Mr Makweto’s predecessor, Terence Nubane(?) [00:17:28] 
to say:  Look, as auditors, it does not just look at the 
numbers and write reports.  We are South Africans, we are 
patriots, we reduce to contribute to our country.  That is 
taking it a step further. 
 
So see Chair by the time PRASA comes to SCOPA 
10 
they are bought.  Hence they engaged by the Auditor-
General on the problems and what needs to be done.   
 
The Audit and Risk Committee within PRASA would 
have been engaged.  The Minister would have been 
engaged.  So by the time we appear before Parliament, they 
were not dealing with new issues.  We are dealing with 
issues that have been in. 
 
But in most cases, they are not Chair.  If you look at 
the recordings of our hearings, you will find officials who 
sometimes look as if they have just woken up from a sleep or 
20 
they do not understand or have an idea about the other 
reports which is their product.  And what we did with PRASA 
Chair is once the Auditor-General’s office does it with every 
department and every entity.   
 
And I know it is not added here but I do know that 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 84 of 236 
 
the Auditor-General who actually addressed Cabinet at the 
end of the audit process to say:  Look, this is what we have.  
These are the things that are there.   
 
But they would still address individual ministries, not 
only once but throughout the year, you will seek to engage 
almost on a daily basis.   
 
So when they come to Parliament and say things are 
wrong, it is not as if something has just emerged from behind 
the bushes.  It is something that they have been dealing with 
throughout the year with the Auditor-General. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:   And then ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So as far as you know.  I am sorry 
Mr Freund.  So as far as you know the Auditor-General and 
in particular Mr Makweto used to address Cabinet at certain 
points to point out to them the challenges that his office 
was finding with regard to various departments and SOE’s.  
Is that what you are saying? 
MR GODI:   Chair, what I am saying is that at the end of the 
...[indistinct] [00:20:02], the Auditor-General with the Cabinet 
about the audit outcomes, the overall audit outcomes, the 
20 
picture that emerges or what is emerging from the audit 
process.  Yes, that is what I am saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So I did not hear you.  You said at 
the end of the financial year or what? 
MR GODI:   That is the end of the auditing process. 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 85 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, at the end of the ...[intervenes]  
MR 
GODI: 
 
 
Remember 
Chair, 
the 
financial 
year 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  I am sorry. 
MR GODI:   And ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Go ahead. 
MR GODI:   I am saying at the end of the auditing process 
when the annual reports have been submitted to Parliament 
and he has drafted a general report.  The general report 
summarises his views of the audit cycle.  This audit cycle, 
10 
these are the key things that have emerged.  He will then 
share most overviews with the Cabinet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which means that whoever was a member 
of Cabinet at any particular time when Mr Makweto or the 
Auditor-General would have briefed Cabinet can be expected 
to have had a picture of what the challenges are in regard to 
these types of issues that were of concern to the Auditor-
General. 
 
And if they wanted to know more they would have 
known how to find the reports of the AG to get to know more 
20 
about what was happening.  Would that be correct? 
MR GODI:   Chair, in the first instance.  Each Cabinet 
member would have had this briefing with the AG on his or 
her own portfolio. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 86 of 236 
 
MR GODI:   So when they go to Cabinet, then they have a 
bigger picture to say no portfolio is performing in this 
context, is performing like this.  But the broader context 
within the performance is evaluated is this.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no.  That is important.  That 
what you are saying says two things.  One, in regard to each 
portfolio each minister would have had this interaction with 
the AG or at least the report relating to - the AG’s report 
relating to his or her department. 
 
But apart from knowing about the situation in his or 
10 
her department.  When the briefing is made by the AG to the 
whole – to the Cabinet, they would get to know what the 
position is in other departments and other SOE’s. 
 
And therefore, they would have a good picture of 
what the situation is.  That is what you are saying. 
MR GODI:   Correct.  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that raises the question that if that is 
factually true, the question that would arise is.  To the extent 
that this Commission might find that certain things were 
brought to their attention that they should have done 
20 
something about it and nothing was done about those things.  
There may be no reason why they should not all be held 
liable because then they were told.   
 
You do not have to comment on that but I am just 
thinking aloud that the implications of this, if this is factually 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 87 of 236 
 
true, would raise those questions that they knew what the 
picture was. 
MR GODI:   Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes?  Yes, Mr Godi? 
MR GODI:   Chair, I just want to say at least what is 
confirmed in the draft affidavit of Mr Makweto.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MR GODI:   Is that the Minister in relation to his or her 
portfolio does get the briefing.  Then make sure that the 
Cabinet agreed and its own cycle. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no.  That is fine.  Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, thank you.  Can I just follow you 
up on that and I do not know if you know this or not 
Mr Godi but if you, you could help us.  The Auditor-General 
is governed by legislation which describes the duties of the 
Auditor-General.   
 
And to put it very crudely and briefly.  The Auditor-
General is required to audit a whole slew of public entities, 
entity by entity.  And the Auditor-General’s comments 
become part of the reports that are required by law to be 
20 
submitted to Parliament and are submitted to Parliament.  Do 
you agree with me so far? 
MR GODI:   Ja-no, that is correct.  When you read out the 
rules ...[indistinct] [00:25:59].  It talks about reports of the 
Auditor-General on the financial statements.   
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 88 of 236 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes.  But now I want to take that a 
little step further.  As I understand it but I might be wrong 
and if you are able to correct me I would be grateful.  Now 
I understand it, there is also a statutory duty on the 
Auditor-General to produce a single combined annual report.  
And that too, not only – that too, amongst others, is 
submitted to Parliament.  Is that correct? 
MR GODI:   That is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   So when we talk about whether or not 
a specific matter is raised in Cabinet meetings which I 
10 
certainly have no knowledge one way or the other.  What 
we should know is this.  That government as a whole and 
therefore all Cabinet Ministers have access annually to the 
Auditor-General’s annual report which gives annually an 
overview of the sorts of issues we have been talking about.  
Can you confirm that? 
MR GODI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Freund? 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think we have gone past one o’clock.  
We both did not keep an eye on the watch.  Let us take the 
lunch break.  It is now about thirty minutes past one.  We will 
resume at quarter past two.  We adjourn. 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 89 of 236 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Freund, we may proceed. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Godi, I want to 
just pick up and issue that we touched on and that is the 
question of the various reports that come from the auditor 
general.  Now in the main, if I understand your affidavit 
correctly, your committee would receive as part of the 
departmental report or entity report that comes to you 
10 
annually a portion containing financial statements and 
containing the auditor general’s comments, is that correct? 
MR GODI:   Correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And in addition to that, I have been 
instructed over the lunch break that the auditor general 
produces what is called a general report.  So, for example, 
I have in front of me the cover sheet of the general report 
of the auditor general on audit outcomes for the financial 
year 2003 to 2004 and I understand that a similar general 
report was issues annually.  Does that type of report also 
20 
find its way to you? 
MR GODI:   Yes.  No, that it is correct, I kind of thought we 
were talking to that, you understand, the end of the audit 
cycle the auditor general would then write a general report, 
yes. 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 90 of 236 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   That is all I wanted to clarify and what 
I have been instructed is that that particular report, I may 
have given the impression that it is a compulsory – that it 
is compulsory under legislation.  What I have been led to 
understand is that it does happen as a matter of practice 
every year, it is permitted but not compulsory under 
Section 5(3) of the Public Audit Act but going back to the 
years of Mr Fakie, as auditor general since then every year 
a report of that nature has been generated and you would 
be familiar with those sorts of reports. 
10 
MR GODI:   Correct, correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   So those reports, leave aside anything 
else that might or might not be sent to cabinet, those 
reports give a broad general oversight of what you might 
call the state of public finances and the state of irregular 
expenditure. 
MR GODI:   Absolutely, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   One second, Mr Freund, I have no pen 
here, I think I left my pen somewhere.  Yes, you may 
proceed, Mr Freund. 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you, very much.  What I would 
like to do now, Mr Godi, is to take you back to Mr 
Makwetu’s draft affidavit, paragraphs 8, 9 and 10.  That is 
in bundle 4 at page 851. 
MR GODI:   Ja.  Ja, I have it. 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 91 of 236 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now you will know, Mr Godi, having 
read this affidavit, that this is the very introductory part of 
the affidavit under the heading: 
“Overall 
Observations 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
Management and Oversight of PRASA. 
It is very brief and then following hundred pages or so 
really is directed at substantiating in detail what we read in 
these few paragraphs here and I would like to refer you 
from paragraph 8 onwards what the then auditor general 
said, was the following: 
10 
“The significant instability in PRASA’s leadership 
and oversight structures exacerbated the dilemma.  
So many resolutions had been taken at so many 
levels to address these root causes but there was 
hardly any follow-through on these resolutions.” 
Then he says in the next paragraph: 
“The net effect of the failure to address the root 
causes gave rise to the systemic financial and 
performance management breakdown at PRASA.” 
And then he says this: 
20 
“Impunity settled in at all levels.” 
And then he moves on from dealing with that to the more 
general point of relevance to our part of inquiry: 
“Eventually this weak culture spilled over to those 
structures 
in 
parliament 
tasked 
with 
PRASA’s 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 92 of 236 
 
oversight and made a mockery of any effort to 
exercise 
meaningful 
oversight 
over 
the 
entity.  
Oversight 
bodies, 
who 
had 
all 
been 
in 
place 
throughout the period under review, were properly 
informed about the resources and knew all along 
what 
had 
to 
happen 
to 
arrest 
the 
declining 
performance of the entity.  It was disheartening to 
witness 
the 
ineffectiveness 
of 
parliamentary 
structures to perform the mandate assigned to them 
in terms of Section 55 of the constitution and how 
10 
the mechanisms at their disposal were not used 
appropriately. 
 These 
structures 
oversight 
was 
largely superficial, they papered over the cracks 
despite so much information at their disposal.  The 
Transport Portfolio Committee and SCOPA would 
listen 
carefully 
and 
even 
promised 
action 
but 
nothing came of it.  This superficial compliance-
driven exercise was contrary to the constitutional 
value of transparency.  Although the latter was 
clearly visible, I could not and still cannot judge 
20 
whether it was done deliberately.” 
Now those are some very strong words and let us just take 
them bit by bit. 
 
I think you would agree, would you not, that for 
whatever reason the root causes of the continuing financial 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 93 of 236 
 
decline – and I mean the decline in financial probity, the 
decline 
in 
financial 
control, 
that 
continuing 
decline 
continued, got worse and it got worse because the root 
causes were not addressed.  I think you would agree with 
that, am I right? 
MR GODI:   Ja, no, very true, I think paragraph 8 talks to 
the problem of instability in the leadership of PRASA which 
I am not sure we will go into later but it is a very important 
comment.  Not only for PRASA but throughout the various 
entities and departments and it was one of the most 
10 
frustrating things for us as a committee that you would 
meet with an accounting officer today who would promise 
that I will sort things out and a year and half down the line 
that person is no long there, you have a new person who is 
starting from scratch, you can hardly build a culture of 
compliance 
instituting 
where 
there 
is 
instability 
of 
[indistinct – dropping voice] 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes.  No, instability is clearly a 
problem but of course it is not state capture or corruption 
or not necessarily, in any event.  So I want to move beyond 
20 
that point to the general observation that impunity settled 
in at all levels.  Now that might be overstating it but what 
is your view on impunity as a phenomenon that did or did 
not become entrenched, not only in PRASA but in other 
comparable SOEs and departments? 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 94 of 236 
 
MR GODI:   Impunity or sense of impunity was in a large 
measure 
one 
of 
the 
fundamental 
reasons 
why 
noncompliance persisted and actually worsened because 
those are there to be observed or to be enforced.  In 
instances where they are not observed there should be 
enforcement and in the absence of enforcement then it will 
merely replicate itself.  I must overemphasise the fact that 
the inability to take action, stern action against the wrong, 
merely exacerbated the problem and what Mr Makwetu here 
indicated with PRASA I can safely say is a general problem 
10 
throughout the public service. 
ADV 
FREUND 
SC: 
 
 
And 
then 
what 
Mr 
Makwetu 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Once again, Mr Freund, I am sorry again 
I am interrupting you.  One second?  Okay, you may 
proceed, Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you, Chair.  You will see, Mr 
Godi, 
that 
what 
Mr 
Makwetu 
then 
refers 
to 
is 
the 
ineffectiveness of the parliamentary oversight and I do not 
think that that is any different to the view you have 
20 
expressed that no matter what attention you paid, the net 
result was not effective.  I think you would agree with him 
on that, is that correct? 
MR GODI:   Ja, so I will so agree. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Right.  Now what he then deals with in 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 95 of 236 
 
a lot of detail and I am not going to deal with it in any 
detail at all, is the year by year engagements on PRASA 
but what you will have noted when you read this affidavit is 
that he makes the point that every year the auditor general 
was represented in hearings of the Transport Portfolio 
Committee which would have considered, amongst things, 
PRASA, and he says: 
“SCOPA has to make a decision year on year which 
entities to focus on.” 
He says: 
10 
“Some years SCOPA did call the auditor general to 
a hearing that related to PRASA, some years it did 
not.” 
I think you would agree that that is factually correct, am I 
right? 
MR GODI:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright.  And what I would like you then 
to look at is what he says about SCOPA oversight which he 
deals with from paragraph 254 and following in his affidavit 
and just for the convenience of the Chair, paragraphs that 
20 
are relevant are 254 through to 266 but in the interest of 
time I am not going to deal with all of those, I am going to 
just focus on a schedule(?) of those.  Firstly, paragraph 
254, he makes the following point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, Mr Freund.  It is not usual that 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 96 of 236 
 
we have so many paragraphs in one affidavit, so when you 
said 254 I thought that is 25.4 so I first went there. 
ADV FREUND SC:   No, I am terribly sorry but I am 
referring to page 960 in volume 4. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, I am there.  Thank you. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And it was 254 and following that I was 
referring to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And I am going to start by referring to 
that particular paragraph where Mr Makwetu says that: 
10 
“In 
the 
AGSA’s 
integrated 
annual 
report 
for 
2013/2014 we recognise SCOPA as a structure that 
continued to play a catalytic oversight role.  By 
making 
using 
of 
the AGSA’s 
findings, 
SCOPA 
structured all its hearings around the root causes 
as identified during the briefings by the AGSA.  This 
was strategically a wise approach.” 
I take it you are not going to disagree with his praise of 
your committee in that paragraph. 
MR GODI:   I take this as objective statement, what had 
20 
happened. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now leaving out some paragraphs I 
want to take you then to the paragraph 262 at page 963. 
MR GODI:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   This is something that you have 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 97 of 236 
 
already touched on in your evidence and I think there is a 
slight difference of view between yourself and Mr Makwetu.  
What he says in his affidavit is the following: 
“Despite SCOPA’s efforts to table its reports and 
recommendations in the National Assembly these 
reports never received the attention they deserved, 
reports were simply adopted and never debated in 
the house.  The debate of committee reports in the 
National Assembly is a parliamentary instrument 
that could have been utilised better and could have 
10 
led 
to 
appropriate 
follow-ups 
on 
resolutions 
including calling the relevant minister to account.” 
Now what you testified before the lunch break is that your 
reports were debated but if I understood you correctly, 
were debated but if I understood correctly, were debated 
fairly briefly.  Could you perhaps just elaborate on the 
adequacy of the debates that took place? 
MR GODI:   No, I must reconfirm that that statement is 
actually incorrect, being [indistinct – dropping voice] and 
secondly, the difference in parliamentary resolutions is 
20 
whether the resolution was noted or adopted.  If it is 
adopted, whether debated or not, the procedure is the 
same, it must be processed by the Speaker to the minister 
concerned but if it is noted, it just goes into the records of 
parliament and it is not taken forward.   
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 98 of 236 
 
Now we – remember I said we, in our strategic 
objectives we said we want the public to know and 
understand the work of the committee and one of the ways 
of course was the media but the other one was having 
debates in the house.   
We worked on this because initially we kind of – we 
find that members of parliament will go and do the usual 
thing where they can stand and we had to agree as the 
committee that please, let us not then stand because then 
you are taking the focus away from the issues to the 
10 
policies(?).  Like I said, you have five reports and you 
have – members are given two minutes each or so to come 
and debate.  Clearly that is not enough.  That is not 
enough time but I must say that we were better off than 
other committees because like I said, all our reports were 
debated.  I will be given five minutes to introduce the 
reports then the other members would come in but clearly 
was not enough time. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright, thank you, I just wanted to 
clarify that.  Now if I can take you …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry again, Mr Freund.  So, Mr 
Godi, in that first sentence of paragraph 262 the only part 
you take issue with is that the reports were never debated 
in the house otherwise you have no problem with the rest 
of that sentence and maybe with the whole paragraph. 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 99 of 236 
 
MR GODI:   No, I will leave that paragraph, like I say that 
the next part which speaks to suggest that if a report was 
not debated and was only adopted it is of the level than if 
it was debated.  I said no, whether it was debated or it was 
merely adopted, processing would be the same.  The only 
difference is it is noted.  If it is noted, it is merely for 
parliamentary reports, it is not taken outside parliament.  
So whether debated or not debated, as long as it was 
adopted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR GODI:   It was subjected to the same process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Well, I understand the point you 
make but I wonder whether Mr Makwetu may not have been 
trying to say the content of the reports called for serious 
debates but this is a situation where – well, he says there 
were never debates but you say there were debates but 
they might not have – the time might not have been 
adequate, whether he might not have simply meaning to 
say reports that revealed the kinds of things that these 
reports were revealing to the National Assembly should 
20 
have opened the eyes of member of the National Assembly 
and if they were really serious, if they were really 
concerned about the revelations in the reports there should 
really have been serious debates.  I am just wondering 
whether he might not be meaning to say that it might not 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 100 of 236 
 
be so that the difference between the two of you might be 
very slight.  You are not sure? 
MR GODI:   I think I (indistinct – recording distorted) what 
you have said. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR GODI:   That due to - times were short. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR GODI:   But if you look at the last part of his sentence, 
it seeks to suggest that if reports (indistinct – recording 
distorted) it can then lead to appropriate (indistinct – 
10 
recording distorted) implying that if it was not debated then 
you do not have the mechanisms of follow-ups. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR GODI:   But I do think, like I said, that the issue of the 
need to take serious cognisance of the issues raised, were 
things 
that 
we 
will 
always 
discuss 
and 
things 
that 
(indistinct – recording distorted)  no sense about it.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR GODI:   So it may as well be that maybe the 
construction could have been done better or differently. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR GODI:   But the concerns that you making, no, those 
are concerns that we had from time to time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Okay.  No, that is fine.  Mr 
Freund, continue? 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 101 of 236 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, thank you.  Just following on from 
that, I understand the points you have made, Mr Godi, and 
I do not have an issue with them, but I would like to pose 
the problem a different way.  Do you think that the National 
Assembly, having had sight of not having adopted report 
shows adequate concern to ensure that the problems 
addressed in those reports were resolved? 
MR GODI:   Well, you know when we started, reports would 
go to the house, they would be adopted but then what?  
And I think that is where we are following short and I think 
10 
Mr Makwetu if actually reconfirming that, Chair, as the 
position.  In the absence of follow-ups there is no other 
demonstration that the concerns raised by committees are 
taken seriously and I think that is what we were missing 
and that is what is missing and I think here we are 
basically saying the same thing as Mr Makwetu. 
ADV FREUND SC:   I understand.  Now if I can refer you to 
paragraph 264, which is at page 964, you will see that 
what Mr Makwetu says in the draft affidavit is that: 
“Although SCOPA’s engagements...” 
20 
Well, let me just pause before I ask you this question.  You 
told us earlier that some years you did and some years you 
did not specifically have hearings on PRASA, could you 
perhaps tell the Commission about any intervention made 
by the then Chair of the board, Mr Popo Molefe, on the 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 102 of 236 
 
question 
of 
seeking 
parliamentary 
interventions 
and 
SCOPA interventions? 
MR GODI:   Well, Chair, I can only confirm what Mr Molefe 
said to the Chair when he appeared that he – and I confirm 
that he did, he wrote a letter addressed to the Speaker but 
copied to the Portfolio Committee and SCOPA.  I do not 
know how the other two offices acted but we, as SCOPA, 
we viewed the letter seriously and we actually called the 
PRASA board and management to appear before us.  I am 
sure in Mr Makwetu’s bundle it does appear, it is in one of 
10 
the annexures.  The (indistinct – recording distorted) of the 
two meetings were heard.  We met them, it was 2015 and 
we said no, let us meet in 2016 and indeed in 2016 we 
met.  So we, as SCOPA were responsive to the cries or the 
complaints that we heard, even though they were not 
addressed to us but to the higher office but we felt duty 
bound that we needed to react. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And did you feel that he was rightly 
concerned and about the right issues and he was trying to 
have the right things done to sort them out? 
20 
MR GODI:   Well, I mean, the issues that he had raised 
were issues that were arising from what we knew from the 
reports of the auditor general about controls, financial 
controls, governance and all that.  There could have been 
other issues that fell outside our scope but because we 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 103 of 236 
 
knew from the general reports of the HD that PRASA was 
not in a good state so we were not hesitant therefore to 
call them, yes.  In relation to the issues that were at hand, 
yes, he showed concern and if you look at the minutes of 
our engagement with them you will realise that indeed the 
attitude of the discussions was focused on the very issues 
that Mr Makwetu is raising here in his affidavit. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, thank you.  Can I ask as a point 
of clarification whether you were also familiar at that time 
with the report of the Public Protector issued in 2015, the 
10 
Derailed Report about PRASA and alleged irregularities 
within PRASA? 
MR GODI:   Ja, correct, we were aware of that report 
because it was – we were also aware of the investigation 
that National Treasury was doing, we were also aware that 
there were, you know, criminal cases that were opened 
with the Hawks.  I, in my capacity as Chairperson, did have 
a 
one-on-one 
with 
Mr 
Molefe 
because 
I 
wanted 
to 
understand for myself fully and properly what the concerns 
were, what the issues were, what their frustrations were 
20 
especially with the Hawks in terms of their investigations.  
So yes, we were of the totality of the challenges and 
reports pertaining to PRASA. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And did you form an impression about 
the adequacy or otherwise of the stance being adopted by 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 104 of 236 
 
Mr Popo Molefe to these issues? 24.44 
MR GODI:   Well, the – yes from the reports that he shared 
with 
us, 
yes, 
we 
accepted 
that 
he 
was 
adequately 
concerned.  The only concern I expressed to him was on 
the investigations done by Werksmans because it seems to 
be open-ended and when you look at the expenditure thus 
far incurred, it was too high and we were not yet in a 
situation where we could say this is the end [indistinct] 
25.22 and he then invited me to go to Werksmans’ offices 
and meet in Sandton.  I went to sit and listen to those 
10 
lawyers explain what they are doing, what they are trying 
to do, the scope, but still I insisted that we need to have a 
timeframes, we cannot have open-ended investigations 
especially when they involved costs, money that PRASA 
does not have in (indistinct – recording distorted) 
ADV FREUND SC:   Right, thank you.  Now against that 
background if we can go to the paragraph that I had 
intended to refer you to which was paragraph 264 at page 
964 and the auditor general’s team having sat in on several 
SCOPA engagements with PRASA, the auditor general  
20 
makes the point elsewhere in his affidavit that they were 
essentially there as observers more than as participants in 
those particular hearings but he then goes on to say what 
we see here at paragraph 264: 
“Although the SCOPA’s engagements on PRASA’s 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 105 of 236 
 
performance had not been as regular as those of 
the Portfolio Committee, the sessions had been 
robust.  Members did not shy away from expressing 
their utter dismay with PRASA’s reported results.” 
Would you confirm that what he says is correct? 
MR GODI:   Well, that was the standard operating norm for 
our SCOPA hearings, whether with PRASA or any other.  
Our members were robust and we read, we paid attention 
to detail, much more than the officials themselves. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Right but now let us look at the next 
10 
sentence.  He says: 
“However, 
no 
specific 
resolutions 
or 
recommendations were issued that PRASA could be 
tracked against and this allowed PRASA to continue 
operating within impunity.” 
I wonder if you would like to comment on that. 
MR GODI:   Well, I cannot confirm whether indeed the 
resolution was done or not.  If I had received this draft 
affidavit a month or so I think I could have verified with my 
staff, we have very good recordkeeping systems.  Except 
20 
to say, if you look at the minutes of our 2015 hearing you 
will realise that actually we stopped the hearing at 
midpoint because we realised that we were not making 
progress. 
 
The 
board 
was 
saying 
they 
are 
new, 
management 
was 
new 
and 
so 
we 
could 
not 
get 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 106 of 236 
 
accountability.  That is why we said let us stop this 
hearing, we will meet you in 2016.  So what I would have 
needed to check was whether after the 2016 hearing was 
there a resolution passed.  At this point I cannot confirm or 
dispute what is it. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright, I understand.  And I want to 
refer you finally to – in paragraph 268.  Well, that and a 
couple of further paragraphs.  Paragraph 268 at page 965.  
This 
is 
an 
issue 
that 
was 
touched 
in 
your 
earlier 
discussions between yourself and the Chair where Mr 
10 
Makwetu says: 
“One of the key indicators in this regard would be a 
reflection on the extent to which all role-players 
would have dealt with areas such as irregular 
expenditure.  Irregular expenditure is defined as 
expenditure incurred in contravention of or not in 
accordance with legislation and is normally a good 
warning 
signal 
of 
accountability 
failures 
that 
created 
a 
fertile 
environment 
for 
inappropriate 
management of public resources.” 
20 
Do you agree with those views? 
MR GODI:   Ja, I do. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And then after dealing with some 
statistics 
about 
the 
accumulative 
extent 
of 
irregular 
expenditure, it refers in the fifth last line to a very large 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 107 of 236 
 
number and then he says: 
“This figure is indicative of a lack of action on audit 
findings and risk indicators generally which in turn 
is a disappointing reflection in the impact of the 
work of all role-players in the accountability chain.  
The latter statement includes the impact of the work 
done by parliamentary oversight structures.” 
I think from the tenure of your evidence you would also 
agree with that? 
MR GODI:   Except that it is important to indicate that the 
10 
work Parliament ...[indistinct – distorted] at the end of the 
day the person who must hit the nail on the head, it is the 
Board, it is management.    
 
I 
can 
give 
an 
example 
with 
the 
integrated 
...[indistinct 
– 
distorted] 
management 
system 
at 
...[indistinct] Station.  When we were meeting ...[indistinct] 
we called out the wrong parties of putting an accountant in 
charge of a Systems Development Process when the head 
of State Development is there, but I can tell you, now as 
we’re talking…[indistinct – distorted] they’ve appointed a 
20 
strategic planner in charge of Assistance Development and 
yet 
Assistance 
Developer 
is 
there. 
 
So, 
sometimes 
Parliament can say, do this, this is the right thing to do but 
then officials go and do their own thing and what can you 
say, we have to agree that despite all the good work and 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 108 of 236 
 
the practicing was done the room has not moved. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And then finally, I just want to draw to 
your attention, that another odd issue on which you seem 
to be in complete agreement with Mr Makwetu, is on the 
problem of tracking measurements, tracking implements.  
So, he says in paragraph 270 at page 966, halfway through 
the paragraph, 
“Speakers Office, during the fifth Parliament plan to 
implement a resolutions tracking mechanism.  The 
mechanism was intended to facilitate regular follow-
10 
up on resolutions thereby holding the Executive 
accountable.  This tacking mechanism was not 
implemented, and Parliament missed an opportunity 
to effect consequences and result”. 
 
I think, we know from your evidence already, that’s 
a view you agree with, am I right?  
MR GODI:   Well, I’m actually glad that Mr Makwetu has 
put this …[indistinct 2.05] I said, I spoke to Comrade 
Frolick in the fourth Parliament.  Now Mr Makwetu says, in 
the 
…[indistinct 
2.14] 
there 
was 
a 
repeat 
of 
such 
20 
commitment which was not fulfilled.  So, what you see, 
Chair, when I spoke about the lack of …[indistinct 2.25 – 
audio distorted] is that you have an Executive that is 
unresponsive, 
but 
you 
also 
have 
the 
leadership 
of 
Parliament, through the Speakers Office that is equally – at 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 109 of 236 
 
a theoretical level about issues and not implementing its 
own decisions and resolution.   So, if you have that 
gridlock, from the Executive to Parliament then those of us 
who are busy with …[indistinct 2.52 - distorted] on the 
ground …[indistinct – distorted] members, what chance was 
there for us to bring about the desired changes, almost 
zero? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you Mr Godi, I have no further 
questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Godi, do you have, having spent – I 
10 
don’t know if you said 13 years in Parliament and in 
SCOPA do you do you – yes in SCOPA or some of those 
years in SCOPA, one of the points you have made is that 
there was simply no action to enforce the recommendations 
that SCOPA made and that will be the same with any 
recommendation, 
I 
would 
imagine, 
coming 
from 
any 
Committee and try and address these 
challenges in 
Government Departments and in SOE’s, of course, here we 
are talking, in particular about PRASA.  Do you have any 
views as to what action you think could have been taken 
20 
but was not taken? 
MR GODI:    
No Chair, I think in my submission being 
quoted from the …[indistinct 4.34] contradicting model, I 
don’t think there can be anything besides that model 
because it – I fully remember the spirit during the 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 110 of 236 
 
…[indistinct 4.47]  of that model, there was really this 
belief from commitment and desire to up oversight of 
Parliament, but it was not implemented. My view would be, 
let’s implement that oversight and accountability model and 
then in the course of practice, then we’ll be able to see 
where the deficiencies are but without having touched on 
those critical provisions of that model, I don’t think that it 
will be prudent to look for something else outside that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, of course, some of us have read 
your affidavit, I heard of your testifying but a lot of people 
10 
who are listening to your evidence and who are keen to 
know what action could have been taken, they might not 
have read this. Would you like to lie to articulate what 
action you think could have been taken but wasn’t taken?  I 
mean, obviously, you align yourself with what is in the 
model, so articulating what the model – what action the 
model contemplates could be taken by Parliament, but 
which were not taken – actions that were not taken. 
MR GODI:   Thank you very much, Chair.  The history here, 
Chair, is that, on an annual basis the Auditor General give 
20 
us his support and he and SCOPA will look at the report, 
pick up what is right and what is wrong, call the 
Departments to account before us and at the end, write a 
resolution to the House …[indistinct 6.30] and say, in our 
engagement with Department X these are the problems that 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 111 of 236 
 
we encountered as in these are our recommendations in 
terms of what we think, needs to be done, to correct the 
situation.  Once it is adopted by the House, it is now the 
House speaking, no longer SCOPA.  Now the problem that 
we had, was that once the Speaker has forwarded the 
resolutions, 
that 
was 
the 
end 
of 
it. 
 
 
Many 
such 
Departments would just get those recommendations and 
not do anything.  So, what was missing and what needs to 
be in place, it’s a mechanism and a process to track House 
resolutions and what we did in SCOPA, which I think was 
10 
excellent, was always to put timeframes.  So, you know, if 
a report is adopted today on the 1 s t of February and you 
say, within 60 days, then it means by the end of March you 
want to get a response.  Now, it means the Speaker ’s 
office must have the capacity and the mechanism to check 
on the due dates and be able to follow up with the various 
Departments that the due dates are in place, that was not 
there but now, even it was there, if the Departments don’t 
reason what is it that should happen.  The Speaker should 
be able to, in the House, indicate that Minister so and so is 
20 
frustrating us, Mr so and so is unresponsive as a way that 
will say to Parliament and also to the public, Minister so 
and so is not doing his or her work.  So, especially there 
was a lack of a follow up process or mechanism which 
rendered the hard work, the hard work that we did to 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 112 of 236 
 
…[indistinct 8.22]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, okay, thank you very much Mr Godi 
for coming to assist the Commission we appreciate that 
you took your time to be able to share what your 
experiences 
in 
Parliament 
and 
SCOPA 
with 
the 
Commission, thank you very much.  Should  we need you to 
assist us if there’s verification that we need, we’ll ask you 
again but hopefully we won’t bother you, thank you very 
much, you are now excused. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you Mr Godi. 
10 
MR GODI:   Thank you. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now, I do have, available, Ms Natasha 
Mazzone as soon as you wish to commence your evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think, if she’s ready she can just – you 
can just call her, she can come in, we continue. 
ADV FREUND SC:   I think she may be following 
so…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or if you need me to adjourn for a few 
20 
minutes, shall I adjourn for a few minutes? 
ADV FREUND SC:   I beg your pardon? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you know – do you think we should 
adjourn for a few minutes for her to come in? 
ADV FREUND SC:  I am, entirely in your hands, we can 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 113 of 236 
 
continue immediately, or we can take a short break, if you 
prefer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let’s take a short break, just to 
make sure she comes in and then I’ll be told when 
everything is ready, we adjourn.

MS MAZZONE:  Good afternoon Judge Zondo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you for availing yourself to help the

MS MAZZONE:  I have no objection to taking the prescribed

oath however I am a Buddhist but the oath is binding on my 
conscience. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you affirm that the evidence you will give

CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on one second.  Hang on one

take the oath.  Did I misunderstand you but I see she is 
switching to an affirmation? 
MS MAZZONE:  I would prefer an affirmation Judge Zondo if 
that is possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  An affirmation is available.  An affirmation 
is available.  Okay then we use the affirmation ja.

MS MAZZONE:  I truly affirm. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.  I suspect that I am 
not pronouncing your surname correctly from what I heard 
you when you were giving your name.  I always want to try 
my 
best to 
pronounce 
people’s names 
and 
surnames 
correctly.  I was saying Mazzone but I seem to have heard 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 115 of 236 
 
you say Mazzone or something like that.  Do you want to just 
give me the correct pronunciation? 
MS MAZZONE:  Judge Zondo thank you very much that is 
very kind of you Mazzone is absolutely fine.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay thank you, thank you.  Mr 
Freund you may proceed. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Thank you Judge.  Ms Mazzone your 
affidavit and the record is Exhibit ZZ5 in Bundle 2 starting at 
page 005.  You have a hard copy of that affidavit available I 
understand, is that correct? 
10 
MS MAZZONE:  I do indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Freund let me interrupt.  Mr Freund I 
think. 
ADV FREUND SC: Yes I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think if I am not mistaken we did not 
admit Mr Godi’s affidavit as an Exhibit it may have escaped 
both our minds.  I think this one we will just have to 
remember to do that.  But I think because he confirmed 
everything with his we can do – we can admit Mr Godi’s one 
later on once we are done with Ms Mazzone. 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:  That was a 00:04:00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.   
ADV FREUND SC:  May I then proceed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may proceed. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Thank you.  Ms Mazzone if you look at 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 116 of 236 
 
the end of your affidavit it is at page 1 and 2 page 54 if I 
have it correctly.  There is a signature there; is that your 
signature? 
MS MAZZONE:  That is my signature. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And have you had an opportunity to 
reread this affidavit and are you comfortable to confirm what 
it says is correct? 
MS MAZZONE:  Thank you Advocate Freund I have had an 
opportunity to read it.  Advocate upon my last reading of it 
last night I did pick up two typos which if I may I would like 
10 
to bring to the commission’s attention. The first type is under 
point 19 which is the Democratic Alliance view on improving 
Parliamentary oversight.  Point 19.1 reads: 
“As the Chief Whip of the official opposition 
in 
Parliament 
and 
a 
Deputy 
Federal 
Chairperson – Counsel Chairperson of the 
Democratic Alliance” 
 
There is a word former missing from before Deputy 
Federal Counsel Chair.  I did not stand for re-election so I 
am a former Deputy Chair and the – the other one also just a 
20 
typo please Advocate Freund on the second page of my 
affidavit it says that I was elected in 1988 as the Federal 
Youth Leader.  I would have only been 9 years old so that 
should also read 1998. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I saw that.  I saw that when I read the 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 117 of 236 
 
affidavit I said could not be correct.   
MS MAZZONE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so what – what is the correct year? 
MS MAZZONE:  It is 1998 Judge Zondo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.   
ADV FREUND SC:  Right and with those corrections you are 
now – you confirm the rest? 
MS MAZZONE:  I do. 
ADV FREUND SC:  So I would like to just start with a little of 
your personal background.  I am looking at page 6 in Bundle 
10 
2 at paragraph 4 and you make the point in paragraph 4.4 
that 
you 
were 
elected 
as 
a 
member 
of 
Parliament 
representing the DA in 2009, that is correct is it? 
MS MAZZONE:  That is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And you say in 4.7 that in February 2012 
you 
were 
appointed 
as 
Shadow 
Minister 
of 
Public 
Enterprises, 
you 
became 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Portfolio 
Committee on Public Enterprises, that is correct is it? 
MS MAZZONE:  That is in fact correct and the date strangely 
enough was today the 1 February. 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:  Oh okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Freund… 
ADV FREUND SC:  And then you make clear in paragraph 
4… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Freund I am sorry I do not want to 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 118 of 236 
 
forget this.  What we normally do when there are corrections 
being made that are made in an affidavit is to follow up with 
a supplementary affidavit of the witness. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just making those corrections then it is 
convenient.  So – so if it could be done ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:  As you please Judge.  Ms Mazzone if I 
take back we were at paragraph 4 and you make the point in 
paragraph 4.8 that with effect from early 2017 you were 
informally appointed by the then leader of the DA Mr 
10 
Maimane as Chief Spokesperson for the DA on alleged state 
capture and then on 22 September 2018 this position was 
announced formerly, is that correct? 
MS MAZZONE:  That is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:  In other words you came to assume 
prime spokesman’s status on the – on the issue of alleged 
state capture? 
MS MAZZONE:  That is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:  You were also as we have already 
covered a member of the Portfolio Committee on Public 
20 
Enterprises which perhaps you could just describe very 
briefly the primary entities of any known relevance to the 
commission 
that 
would 
have 
fallen 
within 
the 
– 
the 
responsibility of that Portfolio Committee? 
MS MAZZONE:  Although there are many public entities in 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 119 of 236 
 
our country and many state owned entities the Department of 
Public Enterprises at that particular time looked after the 
entities of Denel, Transnet, Alexkor, Safcol, South African 
Airways, South African Express Airways and Eskom. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And Eskom thank you.  And I think my 
understanding that at a later stage South African Airways 
was 
shifted 
across 
to 
a 
different 
department 
as 
a 
consequence of its financial difficulties. 
MS MAZZONE:  That is right it went under the administration 
of Treasury because of the continual bailouts that were being 
10 
made to the airline. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Now in preparation for your evidence you 
deposed to in affidavit and in preparation for your affidavit 
you furnished to the commission quite a lot of information 
including if I can take you to paragraph 5.1 a so called 
timeline document.   
 
That document is lengthy document literally referring 
to hundreds of incidents and occasions, is that correct? 
MS MAZZONE:  That is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And instead of trying to deal with the 
20 
myriad of detail there what has happened in this affidavit is a 
selective focus on some of what you regard as the more 
important 
and 
more 
relevant 
aspects 
to 
illustrate 
the 
evidence you want to give.  Is that correct? 
MS MAZZONE:  That is correct. 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 120 of 236 
 
ADV FREUND SC:  And that is really the point you make in 
paragraph 5.3 of your affidavit.  In paragraph 5.4 you really 
give a heads up on where are you going with your affidavit 
and with your evidence and I think it might be convenient if I 
just deal with that now so that – so that the Chair and 
anybody who is following these proceedings gets some idea 
where are we going.  You say here: 
“I shall deal initially i.e. 
1. With issues that arose before and led up to 
my unsuccessful attempts in March 0f 2016 
10 
to persuade the PCPE that is the acronym 
we used for the Portfolio Committee on 
Public Enterprises to summon the Gupta’s to 
answer allegations in the public domain.” 
So that is the first primary issue.   
“I will then deal secondly with the events 
leading up a refusal by Parliament on the 8 
September 2016 to support a DA proposal 
that it should establish an Ad-hoc Committee 
to investigate allegations of state capture.” 
20 
That is the second issue. 
“I will thereafter deal – the third issue – with 
the events that eventually led for PCPE in 
June 2017 to commence an inquiry into 
allegations of state capture at Eskom and 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 121 of 236 
 
further.” 
 
So I want to deal with your evidence in those three 
chapters as it were and the first chapter is the events before 
and leading up to an attempt in March 2016 to persuade the 
PCPE to have an inquiry to which the Gupta’s should – you 
would 
have 
wished 
should 
be 
summonsed 
to 
answer 
questions.  And in that regard I would like to jump to the end 
and then we will go back to the beginning.  I would like to 
take you please to paragraph 13.1 of your affidavit that is at 
Bundle 2 page 18. 
10 
MS MAZZONE:  Yes.  I have it before me. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Right.  Now that paragraph 13.1 refers to 
a statement that you issued on the 8 March 2016 and it is 
Annexure NN28 to your affidavit and if you just give me a 
moment to get the right file?  I believe that should be at 
page 185 but I just want to check that.  Yes at page 185 
could you please go to page 185 the Annexure to your 
affidavit which is dated the 8 March 2016?   
MS MAZZONE:  I am on page is it the ZZ5 NWAM 185? 
ADV FREUND SC:  Let me make clear.  I am about the black 
20 
numbering top left of the pages.  So there is a series which 
goes PO and then… 
MS MAZZONE:  Alright. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Which means Volume 2 and then PO 
02185 and when I refer to page numbers I am always going 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 122 of 236 
 
to be referring to that sequence of page numbers. 
MS MAZZONE:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And… 
ADV FREUND SC:  You have that page now? 
MS MAZZONE:  I have that in front of me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Freund.  Also Ms Mazzone 
when he refers to a page he will not repeat PO-02- he will 
just go to the actual page number which is the last 2 or 3 or 
1.  Okay. 
MS MAZZONE:  Thank you Judge I will remember that thank 
10 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And just so that you understand what is 
going on PO is Parliamentary Oversight; the 02 is Volume 2 
so we are in Volume 2 all the time in your evidence and I will 
be referring to pages in Volume 2. 
MS MAZZONE:  Great. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Now do you now have the page to which 
I am referring with a – an article or a press statement in your 
name dated the 8 March 2016? 
20 
MS MAZZONE:  I do indeed. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And is it correct that you issued this as a 
statement which in due course became published? 
MS MAZZONE:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And you did so in your capacity that you 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 123 of 236 
 
have just told the Chair about as Deputy Chair of the DA 
Federal 
Counsel 
and 
as 
Shadow 
Minister 
for 
Public 
Enterprises. 
MS MAZZONE:  That is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:  I am going to just read into the record 
what you say in the first two paragraphs of that document.  
You say: 
“The DA will today write to the Chairperson 
of 
the 
Portfolio 
Committee 
at 
Public 
Enterprises 
requesting 
that 
the 
Gupta 
10 
brothers are summonsed to Parliament in 
terms of Rule 138A of the National Assembly 
rules to answer for what appears to be the 
undue influence they enjoy over President 
Jacob 
Zuma 
which 
they 
seem 
to 
have 
exerted over government and its officials.  
Under this rule Parliament is entitled to:” 
And you then quote. 
“Summon any person to appear before it to 
give evidence on oath or affirmation or to 
20 
produce documents.” 
And then you continue. 
“It follows a slew of business agreements the 
Gupta’s have entered into with the South 
African government.  It is indeed common 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 124 of 236 
 
knowledge that the Gupta brothers are close 
to President Zuma and one of his sons 
Duduzane Zuma he is a shareholder in a 
number of companies owned by the family.” 
And then what you go onto to do and I am not going to read 
this all into the record.  You go on to say that – in the last 
two paragraphs that Parliament has stood on the side lines 
for too long and in the last paragraph you say: 
“Parliament 
needs 
to 
satisfy 
itself 
that 
organs of state and the prescripts that 
10 
govern them are not being pilfered for the 
benefit of an elite few.” 
And on you go. Now what you say there and what we will 
come back to in a few minutes is a series of exchanges that 
then followed in terms of which you attempted to procure the 
– this Portfolio Committee would inquire into the allegations 
of that type and further type that we are going to refer to 
shortly. 
 
What I would like to do now is to try to put ourselves 
back into the position that you were in as of March of 2016.  
20 
In other words to try to reconstruct what was known and 
what was not known?  What allegations had been made; 
what denials had been issued and so forth?  And with that in 
view I would like you now to go back and we are going to 
touch on the fairly lightly in the interest of time.  If we could 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 125 of 236 
 
go back to paragraph 6.1 of this affidavit?  That is at page 9 
of Bundle 2. 
MS MAZZONE:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Now you deal there with the question of 
support by state owned enterprises for the New Age 
Publication and you summarise in the beginning of paragraph 
6.1 
about 
how 
the 
DA 
have 
consistently 
opposed 
in 
Parliament the abuse of SOE funds to subsidise the Gupta’s 
New Age Newspaper and associated events and you deal 
with that in the whole of the rest of paragraph 6.  Now it is 
10 
fair to summarise to say that there was no – that ultimately 
there was clear admission about the extent of this funding 
but there was a dispute as to whether there was anything 
inappropriate about that.  The DA taking the view there was 
something inappropriate about it and the ANC taking the 
view there is nothing inappropriate about it.  Is that a fair 
summary and if not could you qualify it? 
MS MAZZONE:  No that is absolutely a fair summary.  It 
became very obvious to us that the New Age Newspaper was 
receiving special deals based on nothing more than the 
20 
association with the ANC and the obvious close relations 
between the Gupta family and at the time Jacob Zuma and 
the 
DA 
had 
on 
numerous 
occasions 
asked 
questions 
regarding funding of New Age businesses because these 
newspapers often have businesses that result in a huge 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 126 of 236 
 
amount of funding.  And we even asked questions about why 
the New Age Newspaper was the newspaper distributed on 
SA Air – SAA airlines for example and bought en masse of all 
government offices and why that particular newspaper.  So it 
was very public knowledge that the New Age was getting 
precedence over other newspapers. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Alright and moving on then in paragraph 
7 you deal in some length that even that in summary with 
some tension that developed over the role played by Ms 
Dudu Myeni in the affairs of SAA and certain issues that 
10 
were raised in Parliament by you and other members 
accurate? 
MS MAZZONE:  That is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Then if I can take you to paragraph 8 
you deal with the issue of Transnet and you draw attention to 
a couple of newspaper reports and may I say that these are 
extracts which there would be more if one went into your 
detailed timeline presentation.  But here you have taken a 
few examples and let us start at paragraph 8.2 where you 
refer to a document NN12.  NN12 if I am not mistaken you 
20 
should find at page 130 in the black numbering on the left 
hand and the actual body of the newspaper report you will 
find at page 132.   
MS MAZZONE:  That is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:  So what we are looking at now is what 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 127 of 236 
 
has been published in the Mail and Guardian early of July 
2014.  This is quite some time before the motion that you put 
in 2016. 
MS MAZZONE:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And the newspaper asserts that under 
the headline Transnet Tender Bosses R50 billion Double 
Gain it alleges the following: 
“Gupta’s and Duduzane Zuma are hidden 
stakeholders in a strategic locomotive sub-
contracting company brought while the main 
10 
tender process was ongoing.  The man who 
presided over Transnet’s R50 billion tender 
for locomotives has joined forces with the 
Gupta family and President Jacob Zuma’s 
son Duduzane in a move that potentially puts 
them in pole position to benefit from key sub-
contracts. The Chairperson of Transnet board 
tender committee entered into negotiations in 
December to buy a Gauteng Engineering firm 
VR Laser Services that produces steel plate 
20 
components for heavy vehicle bodies.” 
 
And on it goes.  It is a long report and I am not going 
to take you through it.  But it is clearly alleging rightly or 
wrongly an improper set of relationships underlying a very 
major procurement deal at Transnet.  Did that come to your 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 128 of 236 
 
attention? 
MS MAZZONE:  It did come to my attention it did indeed. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And was it a matter of general public 
attention in political circles to the best of your knowledge? 
MS MAZZONE:  To the best of my knowledge it was but 
further to that it was also a matter that was discussed and 
aired during a meeting of the Public Enterprises Committee 
and it was one of the issues that we would air regularly was 
the 
procurement 
processes 
of 
Transnet’s 
railway 
infrastructure and who was involved, who the directors of 
10 
these companies were and the amount of money that were 
being paid and whether or not any conflict of interests were 
being declared. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Alright.  Now there is an area of overlap 
between your testimony and the testimony of the witness 
who is going to come after you and that is one Ms Rantho 
but just for the convenience of the Chair I could give a 
further reference to this same article being referred to.  In 
Ms Rantho’s affidavit at – at page 539 in Bundle 2.  Now I 
know that going back to where we were at page 12 in Bundle 
20 
2 your affidavit. 
MS MAZZONE:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  You highlight in paragraph 8.3 another 
press report.  It is the press report which is Annexure NN13 
and the relevant portion you will find at page 137. 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 129 of 236 
 
MS MAZZONE:  Hm. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And you summarise it I am not sure that 
it is necessary to go to the article itself.  You summarise it 
here in paragraph 8.3 and you say: 
“AmaBhungane Reported in July of 2015 a 
report under the heading Kickback scandals 
engulfs Transnet revealing what a 00:24:27 
paid by Neotel to Homex a letterbox company 
allegedly linked to the Gupta’s so the article 
says in respect of deals worth R2 billion from 
10 
Transnet.” 
And the sting of the – of the allegation is that there are in 
payments being made to a third party allegedly linked to the 
Gupta’s to assist in procuring a major contract from 
Transnet.  So those are two of the examples in the public 
domain by that time.  Am I right? 
MS MAZZONE:  You are absolutely correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Right.  Then we deal in paragraph 9 in a 
lot more detail with issues at Eskom.  And in the interest of 
time I am trying to avoid reading too much of this into the 
20 
record but you deal in paragraph 9.1 with certain concerns 
that have been expressed over the turnover in leadership 
and something about which evidence has already been led 
before this commission.  In – in 9.2 you refer to concerns 
about certain coal contracts by Eskom – awarded by Eskom 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 130 of 236 
 
to Gupta related companies and you refer to certain 
questions you had put in Parliament in relation to that.  
Incidentally there is a theme that runs through your affidavit 
that you are critical about the incompleteness and candour 
of the answers that you got to questions such as this, is that 
correct? 
MS MAZZONE:  It is correct yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And then if we can jump to 9.6 – 
paragraph 9.6 in your affidavit you refer to a further press 
statement that you issued on the 13 t h September 2015 NN20 
10 
and I think you will find the relevant part of that at page 163.  
That should be helpful actually look at just the first part of 
that affidavit – of that article.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Freund what – I am sorry Mr 
Freund what page did you say the article is? 
ADV FREUND SC:  Bundle 2 page 163. 
CHAIRPERSON:  133? 
ADV FREUND SC:  163. 
CHAIRPERSON:  163? 
ADV FREUND SC:  163 yes – 163. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay I have got it. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Thank you.  Now we can all see there Ms 
Mazzone that it under the headline What the Gupta’s up to at 
Eskom.  It is apparently written by you and issued by you 
and the first paragraph is: 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 131 of 236 
 
“Is paper reports today confirm that state 
owned and state controlled power utility 
Eskom bent over backwards to ensure that 
the politically connected Gupta family were 
awarded a gold – a coal deal to the value of 
R4 billion.” 
And you have gone to deal with that at some length.  And 
that relates if I understand it please correct me if I am wrong 
to the Tegeta Exploration company was then under control of 
– or allegedly control of the Gupta family.   
10 
MS MAZZONE:  That – that is correct and it also went on to 
deal 
with 
the 
fact 
that 
then 
Deputy 
President 
Cyril 
Ramaphosa who was leader of government business was 
also in charge of the War Room that was in charge of the 
Energy crisis.  So it was incumbent upon me to request of 
him to provide Parliament with a full explanation of how this 
particular occurrence happened under his watch and whether 
he was in fact informed of the deal while he was in charge of 
the War Room and what role he had played in the – the fact 
that this matter – this money had exchanged hands so what I 
20 
then did and I explain it in my statement is I wrote a letter to 
then Deputy President Ramaphosa asking him for further 
particulars. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Right and if we can just clarify the roles 
then being played by Mr Cyril Ramaphosa.  You have 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 132 of 236 
 
referred to him – he was at the time firstly Deputy President 
of the country, is that correct? 
MS MAZZONE:  That is correct he was the Deputy President 
of the country.  He was… 
ADV FREUND SC:  In that capacity he had been – he had 
been allocated certain responsibilities in what you call the 
War Room on Energy.  So he had some political leadership 
role in relation to that. 
MS MAZZONE:  Yes.  Well maybe to take one step back 
Advocate in terms of the rules of Parliament we appoint a 
10 
leader of government business and it is normally the Deputy 
President but it does not have to be.  The rules make an 
allowance for it to be anyone that Parliament chooses 
however it is practice in the Parliament of South Africa that 
the Deputy President becomes the leader of government 
business.  So Deputy President Ramaphosa was the leader, 
he was also the Head of the War Room dealing with the 
energy crisis and he was the Head of the ANC’s Cadet 
Employment Operation.   
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes.  And I just – you beat me to it.  I 
20 
was 
going 
to 
take 
you 
to 
this 
issue 
of 
Leader 
of 
Government Business.  But could you maybe just very 
briefly 
describe. 
 
When 
you 
talk 
about 
Leader 
of 
Government Business, you mean government business in 
Parliament. 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 133 of 236 
 
MS MAZZONE:   In Parliament. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Okay.  Describe that role entails. 
MS MAZZONE:   Well, that role is actually incredible 
important.  It is a role which makes sure that Parliament 
meets regularly.  It is the role that ensure that certain issues 
are placed on the Parliamentary agenda and are not.  It is 
the role that ensures that Parliament deals with the 
necessary legislation that comes before it.   
 
And if certain legislation is lagging behind, the 
Leader of Government Business steps in makes, you know, 
10 
does an inquiry as to why the legislation is not being heard.   
 
That particular role also ensures that the Cabinet is 
kept up to speed as to who is appointed to suit certain 
boards that deal with state owned entities and legal 
government business.   
 
You have to inform the Cabinet as to what decisions, 
pertinent decisions are being made in the state owned 
entities that will have any effect on Parliament whatsoever. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Right.  Thank you.  Now I want to 
move on to paragraph 9.7 of your affidavit.  Where you 
20 
refer to what you call there yet another evasive reply from 
Minister Brown.  This time about the value of the coal 
supply contract between Eskom and Tegeta.  And you refer 
to Annexure MM-21 which you will find at page 166. 
MS MAZZONE:   Yes. 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 134 of 236 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now you will see if you read that that 
the first paragraph or the question:  How many contract 
does Eskom have with a certain company?  Name, details 
furnished.  It does not say in the question what the 
company is but we see in the reply there is a reference to 
Tegeta exploration and the sources.  Can we assume that 
that was the company that was named in the question? 
MS MAZZONE:   Yes.  If I may by way of an explanation.  
When you ask a kind of this kind of sensitivity, the Questions 
Department withhold the name of the question if it is 
10 
commercially sensitive or if it would in any way infringe upon 
the economic impact that a sale may have, for example.  But 
when the question is answered by the Minister, the name of 
the company is then revealed.   
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you.  And then the second 
question or second part of your question:  What is A – what 
is the a) nature b) value and c) details of each of the 
specified contracts?  And the answer to A and C which you 
get is:  The details of the contract are commercially 
sensitive as per contractual terms.  The contract is for 
20 
supply of coal to Eskom.   
 
Did you regard that as an adequate answer and 
what do you say about the proposition, the commercial 
sensitivity justifies not answering the substance of your 
question? 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 135 of 236 
 
MS MAZZONE:   I do not consider that to be an adequate 
answer to the question.  And I have many a time given, at 
that stage, Minister Brown the opportunity to, if she felt, that 
the commercial sensitivity was of such a nature to allow me 
to sign a declaration that I would not, you know, disclose the 
amounts of money. 
 
But that I would satisfy myself upon seeing the 
amounts of money and the directors of the company the 
money was going to but there was nothing to be worried 
about.   
10 
 
So I offered that particular option to Minister Brown.  
She turned me down and remained steadfast that it was too 
commercially sensitive for members of Parliament to be 
informed of. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright.  Thank you.  You can then go 
to paragraph 9.9 of your affidavit.  It refers to another 
statement issued by you in 23.  And that we find at page 
172.   
 
Again, in the interest of time.  I do not propose to 
read much of this into the record.  But really the heading 
20 
tells the story that in something issued by you.   
 
The heading you have selected is:  ANC hiding 
information on Gupta coal contracts with Eskom.  And then 
you deal with the very issue we just been talking about.  
The issue of the apparent reluctance or unwillingness to 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 136 of 236 
 
produce information that ought to be in the public domain.  
Is that a fair comment? 
MS MAZZONE:   That is a fair comment.  And the reason I 
said that was because I am a firm believer that any money 
that goes into a state owned entity is money that belongs to 
the South African country as a whole.  And we have every 
right to know where every cent of that money is going. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Moving on to Denel.  You deal in 
paragraph or under the heading - Chairman, actually 
paragraph 11 - with another article.  We are dealing with 
10 
VR Laser alleged to be a Gupta linked entity.   
 
And a contract that you say apparently having – 
without having complied with the requirements of Section 
54 of the PFMA.  That is the Public Finance Management 
Act.  And this was another matter in controversy at that 
time.  Is that correct? 
MS MAZZONE:   That is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now I want to move to paragraph 12 
because 
thus 
far 
I 
have 
largely 
been 
focussing 
on 
particular SOE’s.  Now paragraph 12 starts to look at is 
20 
particular allegations raised about the Gupta family and 
their influence. 
 
And you say in paragraph 12.1: 
“The year before 2016, there had been well-
publicised allegations of the Gupta brothers 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 137 of 236 
 
exerted 
improper 
influence 
over 
key 
government 
appointment 
decision 
for 
the 
purpose of advancing their business interest.   
Press reports to this effect were prevalent as 
early as 2011.” 
 
I understand these will be referred to in other 
evidence before the Commission and I can just indicate to 
the Chair the next witness will be dealing with this issue. 
 
You then refer to, in paragraph 12.2 to be highly 
publicised the airbase Gupta wedding incident.  And again 
10 
I think the Commission and the Chair are fully aware about 
that.  There has been enough evidence about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And there would be no need to repeat 
it.  Then if I could pick it up in paragraph 12.4.   
“The issues during 2015 to 2016 referred to 
above relating to Eskom, Transnet, Denel and 
the New Age, amongst others, to believe you 
say by many by the beginning of 2016 that it 
was necessary to the allegation of influence by 
20 
the 
Gupta’s 
over 
government 
and 
SOE 
decisions should be properly investigated.” 
 
And you elaborate further as we go into this 
affidavit.  You talk in 12.5 of what Mr Julius Malema 
apparently told Parliament about a Minister with close 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 138 of 236 
 
relations to the Gupta family and that members of the 
family knew about Cabinet appointments before Ministers.  
This is something raised in Parliament itself if I understand 
you correctly.  Is that right? 
MS MAZZONE:   Correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Then in your 12.6 you refer to 
apparent concern within the ANC itself about the issues, a 
reporting about a meeting involving, amongst others, Mr 
Mantashe, 
President 
Zuma 
and 
Mr AJ 
Gupta. 
 And 
apparently a discussion, according to these reports, about 
10 
their influence over ANC leaders. 
 
Perhaps you could just comment?  If we can just 
stop there because we are now at February 2016.  And try 
to remind us, what was, as it were, the state of the nation 
apropos of allegations and denials about the question of 
undue influence by the Gupta’s by that time. 
MS MAZZONE:   Well, I think it is fair to say that at that 
particular point in South Africa’s history there were many 
social media photographs doing the rounds of the Gupta’s at 
various events held by the ANC.   
20 
 
Probably the most famous one was the big fund 
raiser held by the ANC where the Gupta’s sat at the table 
with Jacob Zuma.  We knew about Gupta dealings that were 
taking place in state owned entities and the fact that 
Ministers were taking instructions from the Gupta’s.   
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 139 of 236 
 
 
We knew a lot of corridor talk that was happening 
where very concerned members of the ANC were discussing 
how much of an influence were having on the ANC in terms 
of their involvement in parliamentary operations, in terms of 
the appointment of heads of state owned entities.   
 
And there was a general split starting to happen 
within the ANC that was becoming very obvious.  And you 
could 
see 
that 
there 
were 
those 
who 
were 
very 
uncomfortable with the situation that they found themselves 
in.  And there were those that every time the name Gupta 
10 
was mentioned, they would heckle and boo and try and 
drown it out.   
 
But there was definitely a split in the process 
happening and there was definitely an exposé happening of 
just how much of an influence the Gupta’s were having over 
Zuma.   
 
The problem, however, was this.  Where do you turn 
when the very person who you would turn to in the normal 
set of circumstance being the President and the leader of 
your organisation is the very person who is being accused 
20 
and who is known to be a friend and an accolade of these 
particular individuals.   
 
And at that stage, we now know that the term 
“connecting the dots”.  We had started connecting the dots 
but we had not yet formed the spider web that we now know.  
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 140 of 236 
 
And it was very difficult to pinpoint exactly who was on what 
side and who was trustworthy and who was not.   
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright.  If I can just stop you there.  I 
want to put to you something that appears in the affidavit 
of a witness yet to come.  This is not from your affidavit 
but I'm trying to set the scene.   
 
And I want to put - I am going to read to you what 
this witness says and then I am going to ask what you 
recall and so maybe you can confirm this.  
 
What this witness says is: 
10 
“By this time, March of 2016, a host of 
allegations have been made public including 
the following.  
It was reported in The Sunday Times on the 
13th off March 2016 and confirmed by his 
public statement of 16 March 2016 that be 
Gupta’s has offered him R 600 million bribe in 
October 2015 if he will take the post of 
Finance Minister and do the bidding which we 
said he had assumed.” 
20 
 
If I can just stop there.  Do you remember that 
being in the public domain as an allegation of this report?  
MS MAZZONE:   I do indeed and it forms part of my 
affidavit as well.  
ADV FREUND SC:   Carrying on.  This witness refers to an 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 141 of 236 
 
allegation: 
“That the new person appointed instead of him 
as 
the 
new 
Finance 
Minister 
in 
early 
December 2015...” 
 
Him being of course Mr Jonas. 
“Mr Des van Rooyen was accompanied to his 
new post on his appointment by Gupta linked 
aids.” 
 
And then she refers to the press report which 
deals with that.  Do you remember that allegation being in 
10 
the public domain?  
MS MAZZONE:   I do indeed.  
ADV FREUND SC:   Then she refers to allegations during a 
radio interview.  That in 2010 according to her, she had 
been offered Barbara Hogan’s job as Minister of Public 
Enterprises by the Gupta’s.  If she cooperated with them in 
assisting Jet Airways to replace SAA on Mumbai route, do 
you remember that as well?  
MS MAZZONE:   I do remember that.  
ADV FREUND SC:   And then Barbara Hogan’s allegation 
20 
also in March of 2016 back they were and she has being 
quoted “definitely sinister forces” operating behind her 
back when she was Minister of Public Enterprises until 
October 2010.  And there is reference to several news 
articles here.  And that she too had faced pressure 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 142 of 236 
 
regarding Jet Airways.  Do you remember that being in the 
public domain?  
MS MAZZONE:   I do indeed.  
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright.  So I attempted to try and seek 
the scene at the time that you now start to procure a 
hearing by the portfolio committee on public enterprises.  
Now remember we started that paragraph 13.1 and we 
looked at your statement.   
 
So if we move from that point I would like to follow 
the content of your paragraph 13 of your affidavit.  Now 
10 
you saying paragraph 13.1 and 13.2 that as indicated in 
the press statement that we have already read of the 
8 t h  of March, you wrote to the chairperson of the PCPE 
Mr Koko and you asked for the Gupta brothers to be 
summonsed to Parliament and what appeared to be undue 
influence that they enjoy of the then President Zuma, the 
government and its officials.  But you say in 13.2 you have 
tried but have unable to actually find that particular letter.  
Is that correct? 
MS MAZZONE:   It is correct, yes. 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:   Not to turn on that because as we will 
see shortly there are further letters that then follow.  And 
you refer in your paragraph 13.3 to some of those 
allegations.   
 
And you refer in your paragraph 13.4 as you have 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 143 of 236 
 
already mentioned to me the press reports on the Jona’s 
meetings with the Gupta’s, the alleged meeting.  And I 
want to now focus on paragraph 13.5.   
 
You say you addressed the letter to Ms Letsatsi 
Duba on the 14 t h of March 2016 and that is MM-30 and that 
we would find I believe at page 192.  If you can go to that 
page, please. 
MS MAZZONE:   I am there. 
ADV FREUND SC:   For the purposes of the record.  It 
might help if you can just read into the record your letter of 
10 
the 14 t h of March 2016 to Ms Letsatsi Duba. 
MS MAZZONE:   With pleasure. 
“The request for a full Parliamentary inquiry into 
the Gupta’s. 
Dear Ms Letsatsi Duba.  I am writing to you to 
request that the Portfolio Committee of Public 
Enterprises 
conducts 
a 
full 
Parliamentary 
inquiry into the capture of state owned entities 
by the Gupta’s. 
In recent weeks a number of allegations of 
20 
undue influence had been raised regarding the 
Gupta’s involvement in a number of state owned 
enterprises. (SOE’s) 
These 
allegations 
necessitate 
an 
urgent 
investigation 
into 
the 
Gupta 
state 
owned 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 144 of 236 
 
entities by the Portfolio Committee. 
The committee must: 
- Immediately summon the Gupta’s to appear 
before and answer these allegations as per my 
previous letter to you in this regard. 
- Call former Ministers of Public Enterprises, 
Barbara Hogan and Mr Gigaba to provide full 
details of their relationship with the Gupta 
Family.  Mr Gigaba, in particular, must account 
for the allegation of preferential treatment of the 
10 
Gupta’s for state contracts during his tenure. 
- Summons the CEO and chairpersons of the 
larger state owned entities to appear before it to 
answer 
questions 
about 
their 
ties 
to 
the 
Gupta’s.   
I would greatly appreciate your prompt response 
in 
this 
regard. 
 
Your 
sincerely 
Natasha 
Mazzone, 
Shadow 
Minister 
of 
Public 
Enterprises.” 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you.  You read there in your 
20 
first bullet to your previous letter.  That is the letter I take 
it, referred to in paragraph 13.1 of your affidavit, the letter 
you are unable to find? 
MS MAZZONE:   That is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now if we look at your paragraph 13.6 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 145 of 236 
 
which takes us to a reference of page 194.  We need not 
go there but the papers show that you again urge the chair 
of the PCPE to see to your request to summon the Gupta’s.  
And according to your affidavit, you have as yet received 
no response.  Is that correct? 
MS MAZZONE:   It is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   You then refer in 13.7 to what 
Mr Jonas publicly confirmed.  And then in 13.8 you refer to 
a statement, another statement that you issued about 
growing evidence.   
10 
 
Now Ms Mazzone, that particular statement was 
not referred to as an annexure to your affidavit and it is 
therefore not in the file with your material.   
 
But is it correct that in preparation for these 
hearings, I asked you to furnish to me and you did furnish 
to me and to the Commission a copy of that particular 
statement.   
MS MAZZONE:   Correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And I do not know if you have this 
Ms Mazzone but the Chair should have and you may have.  
20 
In 
the 
Reference 
Bundle 
it 
refers 
where 
the 
sixth 
unnumbered bundle.  It is part of that sixth bundle and 
there we find the first statement: Urgent inquiry into 
capture of SOE’s by Gupta’s needed 18 March 2016.   
 
It is a statement issued by you as Shadow Minister 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 146 of 236 
 
of Public Enterprises for immediate release  That is the 
document which you are referring a you ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What page number? 
ADV FREUND SC:   The page number is 85 in the 
Reference Bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   18.5? 
ADV FREUND SC:   In the Reference Bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Not in bundle 1 to 5. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:   It is the separate Reference Bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I have to go the Reference Bundle.  
What page in the Reference Bundle? 
ADV FREUND SC:   85, eighty-five. 
CHAIRPERSON:   85.  Okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And then Ms Mazzone, do you have a 
copy of the document? 
MS MAZZONE:   I do have a copy. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright.  So in that document you say 
in the first paragraph: 
20 
“There was growing evidence to suggest that a 
number of state owned entities are being 
captured 
by 
the 
Gupta’s 
with 
the 
family 
alleging 
influencing

only

...[intervenes]  
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 147 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.   
ADV FREUND SC:   ...but also ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Freund.  I thought you said 
page 85 in the Reference Bundle.  Is that correct? 
ADV FREUND SC:   That is correct.  Judge, if I can just 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   On page ...[intervenes] ‘ 
ADV FREUND SC:   ...in this bundle, there is a section 
called legal and a section called reference.  It is not in the 
legal section which is about the rules.  This in the section 
10 
called reference.  Ja.  It may be that it has not been 
inserted in your file.  I have not thought of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, what they should do.  We should not 
have – the numbering, the pagination should be sequential 
by which I mean there should be only one page by – only 
one page 8 in the whole bundle and...   So if you say page 
so and so, I should just be able to rely on the page numbers 
to get to the right page.   
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Without talking about the different 
20 
sections.  But I am not on the reference.  I was at the legal 
framework section.  I am now on the reference section and I 
am at 85, ja.  If they could attend to that, your team and 
make sure that we have sequential numbers from page 1 in 
the bundle up to the last page. 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 148 of 236 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   Certainly Chair.  My understanding 
that should be the case already.  This should follow 184.  I 
am hoping that that is in fact the situation but I will ask 
that it be checked. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, what they have done is what I 
said sometime back it should not be done.  What they have 
done is there, it looks like they have one pagination for one 
section of the bundle namely legal framework that starts 
from – I do not know if it starts from page 1. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or from whatever page and it goes up to I 
think page 4075.  And then they went into the reference 
section and started from page 1 instead of continuing saying 
86 and so on. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes.  No, I understand.  That is indeed 
what happened.  I think the intention was that it was going 
to be in a separate file. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And they thought put it in one bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:   But ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if they keep them in separate files 
they do not have to change the numbering.  It is just that of 
course you might have to – if they do that later – you might 
have to place on record so that the – whoever reads the 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 149 of 236 
 
transcript knows that initially these sections were in one 
bundle but they were ultimately separated.   
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, I understand.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay but I found the page on the 
reference section, page 85. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you Chair.  And Chair, I think I 
have already read the first paragraph.  May I propose to 
read it into the record again.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Then the balance of the document 
10 
refers to a number of allegations that have been made.  In 
fact, allegations to which we have already referred this 
afternoon in the immediate preceding two or three weeks.   
 
And the prayer statement, once again, for the 
Gupta’s to be summoned and for certain Ministers to be 
summoned to answer questions as to the correctness or 
otherwise of the allegations about which we have been 
referring.  Is that correct? 
MS MAZZONE:   That is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And you spell some of that out.  I am 
20 
not going to repeat it.  On page 21 of your affidavit, 
paragraphs 13.8.1 through to 13.8.6 you spell out all the 
allegations that you say justify the need for this type of 
inquiry to take place at that time.  Is that correct? 
MS MAZZONE:   That is correct. 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 150 of 236 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   I am going to take you now to 
paragraphs 13.10.  Therein you say that: 
“An investigation was required was obvious 
even to the ANC...” 
 
And you say: 
“On the 20 t h  of March 2016, ANC issued a 
statement, Annexure MM-32 after its ANC 
meeting of the 18 t h to the 20 t h of March...” 
 
And that annexure in MM-32 just for the record is 
at page 197.  I am not going to take you there.  It is an 
10 
article in the Pretoria News but you describe in this 
paragraph 
the 
point 
of 
most 
pertinent 
relevance.  
According to the article it is said that: 
“The ANC’s National Executive Committee had 
frank and robust discussions on the serious 
allegations surrounding the Gupta family and it 
purported influence in the appointment of 
Ministers, their Deputies and other key state 
owned entities and their interests.” 
 
And the article says that he view had been 
20 
expressed presumable by the NEC: 
“But such actions have no place in the ANC’s 
government but that the ANC continues to 
confirm its full confidence in our President...” 
 
And then it purports that: 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 151 of 236 
 
“The ANC had mandated the officials of the 
NWC 
(presumable 
the 
National 
Working 
Committee) to gather all pertinent information 
about the allegations to enable the ANC to 
take appropriate action in respect of the 
matter. 
 
That is something that came to your attention at 
the time I presume to the press. 
MS MAZZONE:   That is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now just to dispose to that particular 
10 
issue.  You deal in the very next paragraph at 13.11 out of 
date sequence of what became of that investigation.  It 
was announced publicly on the 31 s t of May 2016 by the 
ANC that it had abandoned the exercise.   So it was no 
longer pursuing the inquiry process or the investigation 
process referred to in the preceding article.   
 
Now in paragraph 13.12 you deal with yet another 
letter to Ms Letsatsi Duba. 
MS MAZZONE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And that is the letter at – that is the 
20 
letter Annexure MM-33 and that is at page 199 in the 
bundle.  And really what you do there – it is perhaps not 
necessary to turn to it – but you refer to previous 
correspondence, you refer to the arguments you previously 
made, you make the same argument and you say:  Please 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 152 of 236 
 
can I have a response?   Is that correct? 
MS MAZZONE:   That is correct.  That is quite correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And I take it you have as then as at 
that time not received a response? 
MS MAZZONE:   No response. 
ADV FREUND SC:   In 13 of your affidavit you referred to 
other articles or another article making further allegations.  
And in 13.14 another article making further allegations.  All 
to do with the Gupta family and alleged influence.  And you 
refer in paragraph 15 to a further press statement that you 
10 
issued on the 24 t h of March, Annexure MM-35 which you 
will find at page 208.  This one perhaps...  Sorry. 
MS MAZZONE:   It is there on 209. 
ADV FREUND SC:   209?  Yes.  If I can just get my ducks 
here in a row if I may.  Yes, that is 36.  Alright.  And what 
you are doing yet again is really following the same course 
of conduct we have already seen.  The letters and the 
statements trying to push for this inquiry on the basis we 
have already discussed.  Is that correct? 
MS MAZZONE:   Absolutely.  But I go a stick further 
20 
Advocate.  And I wonder if it would not pertinent for me to 
perhaps read this particular statement.  I realise we are very 
cognisant of time.  But this statement was really the 
beginning of the ball rolling and perhaps I could read this 
into the evidence so that people do not ...[intervenes]  
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 153 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you may read it. 
MS MAZZONE:   A brief extract.  And what I find the 
important part is if one goes down to the middle of that 
particular page which is page 209.  I say: 
“Reports today revealed that the following high-
ranking ANC figures are embroiled in the business 
network expanding across major state owned entities, 
Transnet, 
PRASA 
and 
Telkom. 
 
ANC 
deputy 
Secretary 
General, 
Jesse 
Duarte, 
Minister 
of 
Mineral 
Resources, 
Mosebenzi 
Zwane, 
former 
10 
Finance Minister Des van Rooyen.  Also underlying 
these relationships are the CEOs and CFOs of state 
owned entities allegedly controlled by the Guptas to 
ANC leadership, the fullest can be found here.  
Based on these damning allegations we call upon 
the committee to immediately summons the Guptas 
and to answer these allegations as per my letter.” 
Then I ask again for the calling of Minister Hogan and 
Minister Gigaba and I then ask also to summons Minister 
Zwane, Ministers van Rooyen as well as Ms Jessie Duarte 
20 
to answer the allegations.  I then say: 
“This 
past 
week 
we 
have 
witnessed 
crisis 
management involving a private ANC MEC meeting 
as a result of the governing party being caught red-
handed without any more lies to hide.  ANC youth 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 154 of 236 
 
leader, Bathabile Dlamini spoke of skeletons in the 
ANC…” 
And I must say that is an error on my part, it would be ANC 
Women’s League leader. 
“…and it was time for them to be exposed.  The 
ANC must take a stern stand against Guptas and 
President Zuma to ensure on the corruption on the 
highest level is eradicated.  The long the country 
waits for answers the greater the chance of our 
economy being engulfed by the Guptas and others 
10 
who are using their proximity to the ANC for 
personal gain.” 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you very much.  Now I would 
like to turn to paragraph 13.16 of your affidavit which 
refers to an article NM36 which is to be found at page 212.  
You might have a look at that?  Now perhaps you could 
sketch the background to what led to this article appear in 
the press because it is the first time in which the name of 
Mr Jackson Mthembu is going to be raised in the evidence 
before this Commission on these issues. 
20 
MS MAZZONE:   Right, so to give the Commission a bit of 
background, every Wednesday during a normal sitting of 
parliament, you know, when a session is open, there is a 
meeting that takes place that is known as the Chief Whips 
Forum and it is customary for the chief whip and the deputy 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 155 of 236 
 
chief whip of every party represented in parliament to 
attend that particular meeting.  The chairpersons of 
portfolio committees attend that meeting, the ANC chief 
whip and the deputy chief whip attend the meeting and 
then certain staff members attend the meeting.   
 
Now this is a meeting that is closed to the public so 
it is a closed door meeting and the aim of the meeting is 
for the Chief Whips to find consensus on certain items. 
 
So, for example, we will look at the way in which we 
schedule debates and whose debates will be up next, we 
10 
discuss personal issues such as MP’s homes at the parks 
that they live in and we discuss the general upkeep of 
parliament.  So it really is – it is not a decision-making 
committee at all but it is a meeting where the chief whips – 
what we like to do is we do what we call finding one 
another. 
 
At the time – and when you ask for an ad hoc 
committee, your first port of call would be to ask at the 
Chief Whips Forum because not only does the chief whip 
sit at that Chief Whips Forum but the chair of chairs also 
20 
sits at that particular forum and the chair …[intervenes] 
ADV FREUND SC:   Can I interrupt you there, Ms Mazzone, 
sorry to do this to you because you refer, when you want 
an 
ad 
hoc 
committee, 
I 
think 
that 
needs 
a 
little 
explanation.  So the rules of parliament provide for a

number of portfolio committees but they also provide for 
the possibility can choose to appoint an ad hoc committee.  
We will see in due course, for example, that such a 
committee was appointed in respect of the SABC and when 
you were referring a moment ago to if you want the 
appointment of an ad hoc committee, were you referring to 
an ad hoc committee of that type? 
MS MAZZONE:   Yes of that type or you can ask for an 
investigatory 
committee. 
 
There 
are 
many 
kinds 
of 
committees that parliament can ask for but of course it is 
10 
very unlikely for an ad hoc committee or an investigatory 
committee – so, in other words, an – so for example, the 
Eskom Commission was not an ad hoc committee, it was a 
Commission of Inquiry as established by parliament.   
So it is a lot easier if you have consensus of the 
chief whips and the consensus of the chair of chairs before 
you go into parliament and simply ask for this particular 
committee be because there is a very good chance that it 
would be thrown out otherwise if you catch people off 
guard.  So you would seek to find consensus amongst 
20 
other chief whips in the establishment of such committee 
and then bring it to parliament for formalisation and that is 
one of the roles that Chief Whips Forum plays. 
I, at the time, I was a whip of the DA in parliament 
but I was not the chief whip or the deputy chief whip, so I 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 157 of 236 
 
did not attend the Chief Whips Forum.  However, I had in 
my mind that there was this absolute necessity for a ad 
hoc committee or a Commission of Inquiry to be establish 
for the Guptas and more especially in our case to start off 
by looking at Eskom and then going one by one through the 
state owned entities and I had asked the then chief whip of 
the DA, Mr John Steenhuisen, to please raise it at the 
Chief Whips Forum and to get a feeling for whether or not 
we would be able to establish a Commission of Inquiry or 
an ad hoc committee and what the general feeling was of 
10 
the fellow chief whips. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And then what the report then refers to 
– if I can take you to page 212.  The article – or the article 
is headed:   
“ANC, DA’s claims goes to court for Gupta probe 
delusional.” 
And the first two paragraphs read as follows: 
“The 
African 
National 
Congress 
on 
Thursday 
rejected reports that it had agreed to support a 
parliamentary probe into the alleged Gupta family 
20 
influence over the government.” 
And then in quotes: 
“The Democratic Alliance chief Whips ridiculous 
claims…” 
That would be a reference to Mr John Steenhuisen, if I 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 158 of 236 
 
understand you correctly. 
MS MAZZONE:   That is correct.. 
ADV FREUND SC:    
“…the ridiculous claims in the media that the ANC 
chief whip Jackson Mthembu had agreed to the DA’s 
opportunistic proposals to parliament to institute an 
investigation into the alleged state capture by the 
Gupta family are imaginary and baseless, said the 
DA in the statement attributed to the office of the 
party’s chief whip.” 
10 
That of course is the office then of Mr Jackson Mthembu, is 
that correct? 
MS MAZZONE:   That is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And then if we go later into that 
particular article we find in the third last paragraph of the 
substance of the report on page 213: 
“The 
ANC 
said 
that 
only 
“delusional 
misapprehension” 
would 
interpret 
this 
pure 
assertion on parliamentary debates…” 
And I should make clear that earlier in the article Mr 
20 
Mthembu is quoted as saying any party is entitled to ask 
for something in a debate. 
“…this pure assertion on parliamentary debates to 
mean that the ANC chief whip supports the DA 
proposal for parliamentary investigation into the 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 159 of 236 
 
alleged state influence by the Gupta family.” 
Now there will be evidence later and I doubt that anybody 
will contract it.  There will be evidence later that Mr 
Jackson Mthembu became very supportive of at least the 
TCTE’s Eskom Inquiry, is that correct? 
MS MAZZONE:   That is absolutely correct, he was 
absolutely supportive of all our endeavours. 
ADV FREUND SC:   But what appears to be the case, from 
what I read here, is that as of March 2016 he was not 
supportive of that, would that also be correct? 
10 
MS MAZZONE:   I think that there was perhaps a heated 
debate that happened in the Chief Whips Forum and now 
being the chief whip of the DA myself, I had sat through 
enough of these meetings to know just how heated they 
become.  They become very rowdy, they are not calm and 
collected meetings.  Also I suppose because they are done 
behind closed doors, one lets one’s guard down a little bit 
and I think that there was perhaps a misunderstanding 
about what was agreed to and what was not and I can only 
imagine that Mr Mthembu took exception to the fact that Mr 
20 
Steenhuisen had very happily announced that there was an 
agreement, that there would be an inquiry and I think that 
Mr Mthembu perhaps intended the advice that he had given 
for a debate – that he understood that to have been taken 
as an misunderstanding as an inquiry.  But you are quite 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 160 of 236 
 
right that Mr Jackson Mthembu was very supportive later 
on and I can only imagine that it was some form of great 
misunderstanding that happened from a rather robust 
meeting. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright, thank you.  Now I want to take 
you now to your affidavit, paragraph 13.19. 
MS MAZZONE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   The first annexure NM37 which I 
believe we will find at page 218.  Well, letter is 219.  I 
think it will helpful if you turn to that please.  Just before I 
10 
take you further on this, if I can just observe to the Chair 
that I am conscious that we are now well past the normal 
four o’clock adjournment time and I am happy to go as late 
as the Chair finds convenient.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   So I just look to Chair, as to how long 
you want to go. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no, no, that is fine, actually I 
did not look at the time.  At four o’clock we normally talk 
about the way forward. I can still sit longer and I am quite 
20 
happy to do that.  What is your estimate of how long we 
are still with Ms Mazzone?  Of course if we finish with her 
and we can still go on, we can take the next witness but I 
just want an idea. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Chair, we still have a substantial road 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 161 of 236 
 
to travel with Ms Mazzone, so …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, an hour? 
ADV FREUND SC:   I do not believe that we will get to 
another witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV FREUND SC:   In terms of how long, it is a guess but 
certainly no less than an hour. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no, that is fine, that is fine.  
Ms Mazzone, are you available for us to continue with your 
evidence for another hour?  Maybe one and a half hours, 
10 
maybe two hours? 
MS MAZZONE:   Judge Zondo, I am completely at your 
disposal and how long you require me, I am happy to be at 
the Commission’s disposal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, thank you.  Okay, I suggest we 
take a short adjournment and then continue.  We are at 
twenty 
one 
minutes 
past 
four, 
let 
us 
take 
a 
short 
adjournment and resume at twenty five to five.  We 
adjourn. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you, Judge. 
20 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Ms Mazzone, I 
would like to take you to paragraph 13.19 of your affidavit 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 162 of 236 
 
at page 25. 
MS MAZZONE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   In that paragraph you refer to the 
response you finally receive from Ms Letsatsi-Dube. 
MS MAZZONE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And that response we find in the 
bundle 2 at page 209. 
MS MAZZONE:   Yes.  Yes, I have it in front of me. 
ADV FREUND SC:   I am just waiting for the Chair to have 
an opportunity. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I have got it. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said page 209 of …[intervenes] 
ADV FREUND SC:   219. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh 219. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Two hundred and nineteen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.   Okay, that is the letter dated 
6 April 2016. 
ADV FREUND SC:   That is correct, thank you.  Ms 
Mazzone, the letter will speak for itself but to summarise 
20 
it, she is saying to you that on legal advice the Portfolio 
Committee on Public Enterprises has no legal authority to 
conduct the inquiry that you have asked that committee to 
conduct, is that correct? 
MS MAZZONE:   That is correct. 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 163 of 236 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   And what she is arguing or saying that 
she has been advised is that rule 138 requires a house 
resolution to initiate an investigation.  In other words, a 
motion from the National Assembly I presume she is 
suggesting.  Now your subsequent correspondence shows 
that you took issue with that, you disagree with that and I 
think it would be helpful that we look at the actual rules 
themselves briefly and this would be the first time that they 
will be referred to in this hearing, so I would like to – I 
would like you please to go to the bundle which is called 
10 
Legal. 
MS MAZZONE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Bundle which is called? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Legal, it is the bit that preceded 
reference, that is the bit where earlier you said the 
numbering was not sequential afterwards. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, alright.  That is the reference 
bundle.  Okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:    It is the reference …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The legal framework and reference 
20 
bundle. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And you will see, Chair, certainly in my 
copy, I do not know in your copy, in my copy they are very 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 164 of 236 
 
clearly separated between legal framework and reference 
and the legal framework comes first and it is that part that 
I am talking about and Chair, just for your convenience, the 
legal framework, if I can just take you, Chair, to the index 
page, is that it contains the 8 t h edition and the 9 t h edition 
of the rules of the National Assembly.  There is nothing 
else in the legal framework bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And just for us to get our bearings, I 
would ask Ms Mazzone and Chair that you just go to page 
10 
172 of that bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just for the record I think we must say, 
Mr Freund, that whereas in the other bundles we follow 
black numbers.  In this one there are no black numbers, it 
is just the red – only the red numbers, the page numbers. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Only the... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And of course what I am referring to, 
Chair, for the record, is PO-Legal-172.  Do you have the 
page Ms Mazzone? 
20 
MS MAZZONE:   I do. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And you will see that that is the rules 
of the National Assembly 9 t h edition and the only point I 
want to draw attention to at the moment is the date, the 26 
May 2016.  In other words, these were rules that were 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 165 of 236 
 
subsequently 
adopted. 
 You 
were 
engaging 
with 
Ms 
Letsatsi-Dube in March of 2016.  So these rules had not 
yet come into force and the preceding set of rules were in 
force, am I right? 
MS MAZZONE:   That is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now the preceding set of rules are the 
rules of the National Assembly that start at page 1 of this 
same bundle and I want to draw your attention firstly to 
rule 138, which is at page 73 of that bundle. 
MS MAZZONE:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say 138 or 133? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Sorry, page 73, rule 138. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  I have got it, thank you. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you.  Now this is the rule that 
lays 
down 
the 
general 
powers 
of 
the 
committee 
of 
parliament 
and 
the 
portfolio 
committee 
on 
Public 
Enterprises 
was, 
as 
I 
understand, 
a 
committee 
of 
parliament, is that correct? 
MS MAZZONE:   That is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   What rule 138, as it then stood, said 
20 
was the following: 
“For the purposes of performing its functions a 
committee 
may, 
subject 
to 
the 
constitution 
legislation and the other provisions of these rules 
and resolutions of the assembly 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 166 of 236 
 
(a) 
Summon any person to appear before it, 
(b) 
give evidence on oath or affirmation or to 
produce documents, 
(c) 
conduct public hearings.” 
So at face value on the rule you can conduct a public 
hearing and you can summon any person to testify under 
oath.  Are you with me? 
MS MAZZONE:   I am. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now if I can refer you to the same 
bundle, page 98. 
10 
MS MAZZONE:   Yes? 
ADV FREUND SC:    Rule 201.  These are the – this is part 
of part 9 which deal with portfolio committees in general 
which are a particular kind of committee whereas the other 
rules we were looking at were general for all committees.  
It says a Portfolio Committee under the heading Functions: 
“A portfolio committee...” 
I will leave out (a) which is presently irrelevant and I look 
at (b): 
“Must maintain oversight of, exercise within its 
20 
portfolio of national executive authority including 
the implementation of legislation and also any 
executive 
organ 
of 
state 
falling 
within 
in 
its 
portfolio.” 
Now those were the rules, as they then stood.  You deal in 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 167 of 236 
 
your affidavit with what are the equivalent rule numbers in 
the new rules and they are very much the same but those 
are the rules as they stood at the time of your engagement 
with Ms Letsatsi-Dube on the requests you have made, is 
that correct?  
MS MAZZONE:   That is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   So against that background I want to 
deal just very briefly with your paragraph 13.20 because 
you respond to her in correspondence – we do not need to 
go to the actual letter you sent – but you made very clear 
10 
that your view was that rules 138 and 201 read with 
Section 56 of the Constitution which says in terms that a 
committee – that parliament must summon – empower the 
committee to summon members of the Gupta family to give 
evidence without any requirement of a resolution of the 
National Assembly and to elaborate it further.  So you were 
in dispute with her as to whether there was a good legal 
reason not to have such an inquiry. 
MS MAZZONE:   That is correct and if I may, Advocate 
Freund, one of the reasons that I went into such a hard 
20 
dispute 
was 
because 
the 
rules 
committee 
had 
a 
subcommittee that was sitting at the time that all of this 
was happening and we were redrafting certain sections of 
the rules and I was the DA representative on that rules 
committee and I had dealt specifically very closely with 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 168 of 236 
 
this particular angle of the rules and I knew that in the 
subsequent rules, the edition 9, the rules were changed 
very – hardly at all in terms of this particular section.  So I 
do and I did at that stage consider myself to be an expert 
on the rules in parliament. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now, be that as it may, your affidavit 
indicates that you got nowhere. 
MS MAZZONE:   No. 
ADV FREUND SC:   This issue became ventilated not just 
between yourself and the chair of the committee but inside 
10 
the committee itself, the Portfolio Committee on Public 
Enterprises you deal with that in paragraphs 13.22 through 
to 13.25 and in short I am going to summarise and ask you 
to confirm whether I have got it right or not.  In short, the 
ANC majority did not favour that there should be an inquiry 
of the type that you sought and therefore, it did not 
happen. 
MS MAZZONE:   Correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And you say in paragraph 13.25: 
“I was not surprised by the lack of support for my 
20 
proposal, the members of the majority party act in 
the PCPE in accordance with party decisions and 
instructions and in my view had no appetite at the 
time to pursue the inquiry I had proposed nor to 
summon the Guptas to answer questions.  After the 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 169 of 236 
 
meeting with Denel..” 
Which is referred to elsewhere in your affidavit. 
“...almost a year later there was no support from 
the majority party members of the PCPE for the 
inquiry I had proposed.” 
So as at March 2016, still as at May 2017 until we come to 
later events, we could not persuade the PCPE as an entity 
in which the majority representatives were members of 
parliament for the African National Congress to pursue the 
inquiry that you had wanted the Portfolio Committee on 
10 
Public Enterprises to pursue.  Would that be a fair 
summary? 
MS MAZZONE:   That is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Let us move on to …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Mazzone – I am sorry, Mr Freund, I 
understand that you say that when this issue that started 
between yourself and the chair of the committee was that 
in the committee did not receive majority support, did not 
receive support from the majority party in the committee 
and you say you understood this attitude on their part 
20 
because they did not have the appetite for pursing these 
issues but what I would like to say, if you are able to, is 
what reasons did they give for not supporting this proposal 
that you put forward?  That is now the ANC members of the 
committee. 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 170 of 236 
 
MS MAZZONE:   Thank you, Judge.  The excuses they 
gave were a myriad of excuses ranging from the fact that 
we could go and do oversight at the necessary institutions, 
that they would ensure that the auditor general would come 
and give to our committee the outcomes of the audited 
financial statements, that we had at our disposal the 
process of questions and motions in the house which we 
could 
use 
and 
that 
there 
were 
other 
processes 
in 
parliament including the questions and answer sessions 
that we would have in parliament that we could utilise 
10 
instead of going into an inquiry.   
They also used the excuse that the parliamentary 
terms were going to be shortened somewhat because we 
were soon going to be heading into an election, that we 
had had an election in 2014 that had shortened periods of 
parliament 
which, 
in 
my 
opinion, 
was 
moot 
for 
our 
committee as we do not ever deal with any type of 
legislation. 
And I think that the big problem is this, the ANC has 
study groups so they do not just have a study group for 
20 
example for the Department of Public Enterprises, they will 
have a study group for the economics cluster as well as 
then for the Department of - you know, the portfolio 
committee of Public Enterprises and if a decision is made 
that it is not politically viable or politically expedient for 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 171 of 236 
 
such an inquiry to happen then their majority is used to 
shut down any possibility of an inquiry from happening and 
at that stage I think that there was a great deal of strife 
going on within the ANC and it was thought that it would 
just be better to, to coin the phrase, to let sleeping dogs 
lie and to try and keep the opposition happy by making 
sure that Eskom and Transnet and whoever else would 
come and do presentations to our portfolio which, quite 
frankly, had become a complete waste of time. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Could I just ask you to elaborate on 
10 
what you mean by a study group because that is not 
obvious to people who are not familiar with the workings of 
parliament. 
MS MAZZONE:   So the Democratic Alliance has it as well, 
we just call – we term it work streams and what we do is 
we keep one another abreast of what is happening.  So, for 
example, I am chief whip and I have working alongside me 
13 other whips and I separate the whips into groups and 
those groups deal with the economics cluster, of which I 
had three, they have the social cluster, they have the 
20 
environmental cluster and what we do is we look at 
information  that is happening in parliament and possible 
legislation that is coming up in parliament and anything 
that we should be aware of and the ANC also have exactly 
the same kind of formula except they call it work study 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 172 of 236 
 
groups, that they have, they do not call them work streams 
and they also have parliamentary research staff that join 
their specific study groups and those researchers then also 
sit on our committee and they produce the study material 
and the information per committee meeting that we have to 
give to everyone on the portfolio committee. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Do you have any knowledge or insight 
into whether issues that come before portfolio committees 
and 
particularly 
the 
Portfolio 
Committee 
on 
Public 
Enterprise are first debated within the ANC’s study group 
10 
and whether decisions taken in the study group have any 
effect on the decisions of the portfolio committee itself? 
MS MAZZONE:   They absolutely are, they are fully 
ventilated in the study group.  All problems, all foreseeable 
eventualities, any letters that may have been written by the 
opposition would have been fully ventilated in an ANC 
study group.  Legal advice would have been taken during 
that particular study group perhaps from the state law 
adviser that we would have to ask parliament itself but it 
would have been fully ventilated in an ANC study group 
20 
before it then came to the portfolio committee and it 
happened then, it happens now, it always does and always 
will happen before a portfolio committee meeting. 
ADV FREUND SC:   So now …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now you – I am sorry, Mr Freund.  Ms 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 173 of 236 
 
Mazzone, Mr Freund earlier summarised your evidence and 
said it appeared that what you were saying is that from 
about March 2016 to sometime in 2017, I am not sure if it 
is March also in 2017, but quite some time, you were 
saying that the committee was not – or the majority of the 
committee was not supporting your proposal for a public 
inquiry.  
My question is whether, apart from the meeting of 
the committee that you have just told me about where the 
majority of the majority party in the committee did not 
10 
support the proposal, whether there were other occasions 
between March 2016 and sometime in 2017 that you are 
talking about when you revived this proposal in the 
committee and each time it did not – it was not supported 
by the majority party? 
MS MAZZONE:   Absolutely, Judge, I used to mention this 
committee on a regular basis and in fact sometimes I would 
suggest going so far as to perhaps attaching certain assets 
of some of the state owned entities when things were really 
getting bad.   
20 
 
I also proposed motions in the house which is 
something that we can do.  We can either give a notice of 
motion or propose a motion without notice in the house 
which I did asking for a committee to be established to 
discuss and to investigate state capture and I asked my 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 174 of 236 
 
chief whip to raise it in the Chief Whips’ Forum in the hope 
that he would be able to get enough of the chief whips 
together to persuade the ANC to have either an inquiry or 
an ad hoc committee.  So there were many times where I 
requested that either an inquiry or an ad hoc committee 
was established to investigate what was now obvious state 
capture within the state owned entities. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, it would help if your situation 
permitted you to identify other occasions or meetings of 
the Portfolio Committee other than the meeting that you 
10 
have told me about where you raise this issue again and 
again and you are able to say what the response was but it 
seems that the response is quite clear from your evidence 
but if you are able to do that, it would be helpful but if you 
are unable, that is fine. 
MS MAZZONE:   Judge, I am absolutely able to.  What I 
would then need you to do is to refer to the timeline which 
I handed in. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MAZZONE:   So, Advocate, I am not sure about your 
20 
numbering, 
I 
have 
printed 
my 
timeline 
completely 
separately so I am not sure if Justice Zondo has a copy of 
that timeline. 
ADV FREUND SC:   [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
MS MAZZONE:   There is not. 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 175 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sure I have got the timeline but I 
think – so if what I am looking for is in the timeline then 
you do not have to prepare anything, I can look at it but if 
it is not – it is information that we do not have then I would 
be happy to get a supplementary affidavit from you just 
saying here are other occasions when I raised this issue, it 
is a meeting of such and such a date and if there are 
minutes then you refer to the minutes but if there are no 
minutes but you know that you did raise the issue and what 
the date was or the occasion was, that would be helpful. 
10 
MS MAZZONE:   Justice, excuse me for having left your 
screen for a second, I just want to quickly refer so that you 
have a clear indication of what I mean.  So I just had to – 
because I have got a table in front of me here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MAZZONE:   And I am just – sorry, Justice, if you just 
give me one second I can find the date.  On the 11 April, 
Judge Zondo, I wrote to the then Minister of Public 
Enterprises to request the details of the Eskom penalty 
settlement with the Gupta-owned Tegeta resources.  I also 
20 
– and I am sorry to take you back… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MAZZONE:   On the 13 February I made a submission 
in terms of the prior to gain access to the full and original 
unredacted Denton report.   
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 176 of 236 
 
On the 15 February 2017 I called for the full text of 
another 
Deloitte 
report, 
this 
time 
on 
Eskom’s 
2008 
procurement of the energy coal valued at R10 billion to be 
made publicly immediately. 
 
I 
then 
on 
the 
16 
February 
requested 
the 
Chairperson 
of 
the 
Portfolio 
Committee 
on 
Public 
Enterprises, Ms Letsatsi-Dube to summon the full original 
unredacted report as released by the Financial Mail to the 
committee for further inquiry.  I then …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is – is that February 2017 or 
10 
2016? 
MS MAZZONE:   2017. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Okay. 
 
By 
that 
time 
the 
Public 
Protector ’s report State of Capture was out, is it not? 
MS MAZZONE:   By that time it was in the public domain, 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MS MAZZONE:   I also, Judge, on the 18 April I requested 
the Public Protector Advocate Mkhwebane to probe the R30 
million pension payout to Brian Molefe.  I submitted the 
20 
application - prior application to gain access to the 
employment contract of Brian Molefe. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Sorry, if I could maybe just interrupt 
briefly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 177 of 236 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   I do mean to lead you chronologically 
some developments, maybe it would be helpful to come 
back to this question after we have dealt with those 
because 
there 
are 
other 
[inaudible 
– 
speaking 
simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, that – yes, that is fine and I was 
particularly interested on the proposal for an inquiry but if 
that document is a document that has been submitted and 
it has the information, the sequence and what was done 
particularly in relation to the proposal for an inquiry, then it 
10 
is fine. 
MS MAZZONE:   Judge, just so that I do not confuse you in 
any way, what I did is once I realised that the initial inquiry 
was being blocked I attempted to do smaller inquiries. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MAZZONE:   As I went along. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MAZZONE:   In the hope that those smaller inquiries 
would result in the committee having to have a large 
inquiry. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MS MAZZONE:   That is why I did the [indistinct] 25.18 of 
certain documents, the [indistinct] 25.19 of applications, I 
wrote to certain ministers for information.  All of those 
were mini-inquiries. 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 178 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MAZZONE:   That I hoped that when the result of those 
would come to me it would give the committee no option 
but to adhere to my request for a full investigation because 
that evidence even of itself was so damning. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, thank you, thank you, thank 
you.  Okay, Mr Freund, you may continue. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Now in order to 
keep chronological sequence, I am going to go slightly out 
of sequence in the affidavit.  I would like to take you to 
10 
paragraphs 15.4 and 15.5 of your affidavit, page 31. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And that deals with the Public 
Enterprises budget vote, which I presume takes place in 
the main chamber of the National Assembly, a plenary 
session. 
MS MAZZONE:   It takes place in a plenary, it either 
happens in the National Assembly chamber or it happens in 
the assembly chamber just above the National Assembly 
chamber or it happens in the Old Assembly chamber.  So 
20 
we sometimes break up but Public Enterprises due to the 
importance of the nature it normally has a large public 
audience so it normally does happen in the National 
Assembly chamber. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Sorry, I was not so much concerned of 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 179 of 236 
 
where it happens physically, it is that it is not a meeting of 
the subcommittee.  
MS MAZZONE:   No, certainly not, it is a plenary of the 
house. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Right.  And in this paragraph you refer 
– we have the Hansard quotes – you refer to what you said 
in that debate and let us start with that.  If I could take you 
to page 374 in bundle 2. 
MS MAZZONE:   374.   
ADV FREUND SC:   Black numbers on the top left. 
10 
MS MAZZONE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now am I correct that this is your 
intervention on the 18 May 2016 as appears in Hansard on 
the Public Enterprises vote? 
MS MAZZONE:   Forgive me, I went to 474, I am just going 
to 374.  Yes, mine starts at the bottom, the declaration of 
vote. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, the foot of 374 and I am not going 
to read all of it, but it is very short, it is 374 and 375 and 
the first two lines of 376. 
20 
MS MAZZONE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now you are now speaking before the 
National Assembly not before the committee and you say – 
and you are then the spokesperson for the principal 
opposition party. 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 180 of 236 
 
MS MAZZONE:   That is right.  
ADV FREUND SC:   On the very top of the budget vote. 
MS MAZZONE:   That is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And reads: 
“Honorary 
Deputy 
Speaker, 
there 
is 
mounting 
evidence to suggest that a number of state owned 
entities, SOEs, have been captured by the Gupta 
family allegedly influencing not only ministerial 
appointments but also the appointments of SOEs 
themselves.” 
10 
And then I am going to skip out a couple of paragraphs and 
then you say the following: 
“It is imperative to uncover the full extent to which 
the Gupta family has interest over state owned 
entities.  This is with the view only to make sure 
that the very nature and credibility of our state 
owned entity is brought back.” 
And then you say this: 
“Parliament…” 
And you are talking to parliament. 
20 
“Parliament is duty bound to hold government 
accountable as well and to ensure that the cabal of 
the ANC cronies with links to President Zuma and 
the Gupta family do not seize our economy.” 
And very shortly after that your time comes to an end and 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 181 of 236 
 
you say you will not support the budget vote.  So you are 
raising in the house the shorts of allegations that you have 
been raising this afternoon with the Commission. 
MS MAZZONE:   Correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And I want to just focus on the 
response to that for the ANC which we find at page 377.  
You will see towards the bottom of 377 there’s a reference 
to Ms D Z Rantho, who will be the next witness to testify 
and after introducing, making a couple of introductory 
remarks really the substance of her response is what we 
10 
find at page 378, and read it as you may you are not going 
to find any references to the Guptas, you are not going to 
find any references to your assertion that Parliament 
should investigate.  What you will find is that there has 
been a turnaround of Eskom, Transnet, S A Express, 
Denel, SAFCOR and Alexkor under Minister Brown which is 
bearing fruits, we can mention numerous successes and 
then in the last paragraph: 
“I just want to say that we are aware of the other 
SOE’s that have small problems and we are working 
20 
on that.  On the Denel issue Denel is always 
associated with the Guptas but the people who are 
associated 
with 
the 
Guptas 
the 
other 
white 
companies that have shares within Denel because it 
belongs to them, that is why they are quiet and then 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 182 of 236 
 
her time is over.” 
So what it seems to me just on a reading is that certainly 
at that time she was not supportive of the proposal that 
you were then making? 
MS MAZZONE:   Certainly not. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Okay, now if we jump ahead at a later 
stage would it be fair to say that you and she worked very 
closely and she was very supportive of the PCPE inquiring 
into problem of the State identities?  
MS MAZZONE:   We worked exceptionally closely and I 
10 
hand on heart say she became one of the bravest women I 
ever, ever worked with. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you, we will come back to that, 
but I am just trying to get things in the correct timeline.  So 
you have told me here about your unsuccessful attempts to 
persuade the PCPE to conduct an inquiry to summon the 
Guptas and others. 
MS MAZZONE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   We have now looked at what happened 
in the budget, right.  I now want to take you back to 14.3 of 
20 
your affidavit, because we are now passing another story. 
MS MAZZONE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And Judge ...[indistinct – distorted] 
that in the opening portion I said there is going to be three 
chapters, the first chapter the unsuccessful attempt to 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 183 of 236 
 
establish a PCPE inquiry, second chapter an unsuccessful 
attempt to establish an ad hoc committee and then third 
chapter was going to be the PCPE inquiry but it follows, so 
we are really now just finished the first chapter.  We are 
going to start the second chapter but the second chapter is 
exceedingly brief, it will take us not five minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now what happens here is that you 
refer in these paragraphs to how you had tried other 
mechanisms to try and get an inquiry of this type to happen 
10 
and eventually you and the DA resorted to a different 
strategy and we see that in paragraph 14.5.  You say: 
“The DA thereafter had decided to attempt to 
persuade the National Assembly to establish an ad 
hoc committee under Rule 253(1)(a) of the then 
very recently adopted 9 t h Edition of the Rules of the 
National Assembly, those rules took effect on the 
26 t h of May.” 
And then you quote in paragraph 19.6 and this is apparent 
from your annexure as well: 
20 
“The resolution that was put by a fellow member of 
the DA, Mr Menya[?], and the resolution put was 
that the house: 
1. Notes the allegations of State Capture by certain 
individuals and their alleged undue influence 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 184 of 236 
 
over the government; 
2. Establishes an ad hoc committee in terms of Rule 
353[1][a], the Committee through 
a.  investigate the alleged capture of State 
resources and undue influence over the 
government; 
b.  recommend 
measures 
in 
line 
with 
the 
assembly’s oversight constitutional mandate 
to prevent such incidents from occurring; 
c.  consist of 11 members as follows; ANC 6, 
10 
DA 4, EFF 1 and other parties 1.” 
So you are proposing an ad hoc committee with the 
majority representation which is proportional to their 
representation in the assembly generally, the ANC will 
have a majority, to investigate alleged State Capture, 
undue influence and so forth, but you tell the Commission 
at paragraph 14.7 that although that motion had wide 
support from the opposition parties it was defeated by 169 
to 103 all members present voting against the motion.  I 
take it that is correct, is it? 
20 
MS MAZZONE:   All ANC members present. 
ADV FREUND SC:   All ANC members present voting 
against the motion.  So the ANC stood firmly against not 
only your first attempt, but also your second attempt to 
persuade a structure of Parliament to investigate these 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 185 of 236 
 
allegations.  Is that a fair comment? 
MS MAZZONE:   That is a fair comment and we also at the 
time of the vote called for a division so when you call for a 
division in Parliament it takes a little bit of time but each 
person’s vote is recorded so next to your name it will 
record whether you voted yeah or nay. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes thank you, and we do have that, 
we certainly have the beginning of that in the record, at 
page 379, we have available the rest but we didn’t annex  
it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Freund I don’t know whether, and it is 
quite important that Ms Mazzone says all ANC members 
present voted against the motion because in terms of 
timeframe we are talking here in September 2016. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Apart from other things three years 
earlier there was the Waterkloof landing of the Gupta 
aircraft which really caused a huge outcry throughout the 
country, that that is something that everybody knew had 
happened and anyone who might not before that had seen 
20 
red flags would be expected to have seen red flags.  We 
have a situation where in March 2016, September may be 
what – six months after March, yes, six months earlier, 
namely March Mr Jonas had come out publicly and said 
what had happened in the meeting that he had with the – 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 186 of 236 
 
with one of the Gupta brothers as well as Mr Duduzane 
Zuma and Mr Fana Hlongwane and I think if I recall 
correctly Ms Vytjie Mentoor had also come out soon after 
Mr Jonas with her allegations and I suspect that by now 
also if I am not mistaken Mr Fikile Mbalula’s allegations of 
having been told by Mr Ajay Gupta that he was going to be 
appointed as Minister before Mr Zuma told him officially 
would have been known, would have been in the public 
domain and this September 2016 is about a month or a few 
weeks before the Public Protector issues her State of 
10 
Capture report, so there had been a lot of articles and 
matters and allegations that have been aired in the public 
domain, but if Ms Mazzone’s evidence is correct all 
members of the ANC despite all of that, that was in the 
public domain vote against this proposal. 
 
So in terms of timeframe and what was known 
publically it is quite important, but let me ask Ms Mazzone 
in terms of what the ANC said in opposition to this motion 
why they said they did not support the motion of an inquiry, 
what did they say as far as you remember, just the gist of 
20 
the arguments they put forward? 
MS MAZZONE:   Judge when you propose a motion of this 
nature the opposition party or any other party in Parliament 
doesn’t have an opportunity to really talk to the motion or 
to talk down to it.  If anyone from the ANC did talk down to 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 187 of 236 
 
it I am afraid I don’t recall it.  What I do recall, because it 
shocked me to my very core, was the massive jubilation 
and the burst out in song that the ANC had upon the 
announcement of the result of the division having been 
called in the house, so when they realised that they had 
defeated the motion they began to dance and sing ANC 
veteran songs and ANC rally songs in the house and they 
very jubilant – you know there was great jubilation that 
they had beat this particular motion in the house, but 
nothing in the house that I can remember was said you 
10 
know because you stand up and you announce your 
intention to propose the motion and then the vote is taken 
so if anything was said Judge I am afraid I don’t remember, 
but I do remember the great jubilation when the motion was 
defeated. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I assumed that before the voting took 
place there would have been a debate, but are you saying 
that there was no debate? 
MS MAZZONE:   Judge I think that there could have been 
and I think that Advocate Freund has the minutes of that 
20 
particular meeting, so if he could quickly jog my memory. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:   If I can perhaps interject at this stage 
Judge, just to refer the witness to the document you are 
asking for. 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 188 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes 
ADV FREUND SC:   In the bundle at page 327 through to 
page 361. 
MS MAZZONE:   Advocate 361?   
ADV FREUND SC:   327 finishing 361. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes I see that, there is a draft 
resolution. 
MS MAZZONE:   Ah, there we go. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh so whatever was said in Parliament 
before and after the vote I would find here, is that correct? 
10 
MS MAZZONE:   Yes that is this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay no that is fine.  I am sure there is 
a footage of the jubilation, Mr Freund I would like to see 
that footage, I would like to see who was so jubilant at the 
defeat of this motion. 
ADV FREUND SC:   I will certainly do my best. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, if you can find it, we will show it 
here in public. 
MS MAZZONE:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You may proceed. 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you.  You will see just for the 
record that the debate precedes the actual draft resolution, 
when the draft resolution is put at page 357 and it is 
immediately after the draft resolution is put that after a 
couple of minor quibbles about matters of formality one 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 189 of 236 
 
sees at page 360 the record of the division of the House, 
and one sees at 360 to 361 precisely who voted aye, the 
103 who voted aye, which is in support of the motion and 
the 169 names are the people who voted no, so Chair I 
think you there have your answer as to who were the 
people who voted not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I am sorry, I was listening to you 
more than looking at the page, what is the page you were 
looking at? 
ADV FREUND SC:   The critical page is page 360. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, oh I was at the right page, on 
Bundle 2? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Of Bundle 2 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:   You will see from the left – you will 
see a whole of names there, on the left you will see the 
ayes, and there are 103 names printed there and on the 
right you will see the no’s, and you will see there’s 169 
names printed there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No I think I must be – my page 260 and I 
20 
am looking at the black numbers, are you ...[intervenes]  
ADV FREUND SC:   360. 
CHAIRPERSON:   360? 
ADV FREUND SC:   We are at three hundred and sixty. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I was at 260.   Okay, okay.  Oh the 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 190 of 236 
 
voting was not secret? 
MS MAZZONE:   No it was an open division. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay so I nevertheless would like to 
see the footage of the jubilation. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes indeed, and Chair just while you 
are where you are, if you go back just two or three pages, 
back to 357 that is what you actually find the text of the 
motion that was put. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Yes I have got it here. 
ADV FREUND SC:  But you will be aware that that is being 
10 
quoted from in paragraph 24.6. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Chair I have unlimited energy and I 
think Ms Mazzone has unlimited energy ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am still fine I think. 
ADV FREUND SC:   What I propose is that we still have 
some way to go. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How much do we have to go in terms of 
time? 
ADV FREUND SC:   I would think an hour. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, let’s continue and try and see if we 
can’t finish, let’s continue. 
ADV FREUND SC:   I will do my best. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now Ms Mazzone I just want to refer 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 191 of 236 
 
briefly to something you touched on already, it is the 
question of evasive answers to questions in Parliament, 
because of course the capacity to ask questions both 
written and for oral answer in the House is one of the 
important instruments of oversight and accountability.  We 
have referred already in paragraph 9.7 of your affidavit to 
the Tegeta contract details that you asked for and were 
refused on grounds of confidentiality.   I now want to take 
you to paragraph 15.7 of your affidavit.   
MS MAZZONE:   Yes. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:   There you deal with the question you 
put to Minister Lynne Brown on the 20 t h of May 2016 about 
whether she or her Deputy Minister had met with the 
Guptas or their associates or attended any meetings at the 
Guptas Saxonwold estate and the answer she gave, or let 
me call it a deliberate non-answer is that, and I quote: 
“The duties of Ministers and Deputy Ministers are 
outlined in the Ministerial handbook.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing] 
ADV FREUND SC:   Any comment on that? 
20 
MS MAZZONE:   Yes, this is the type of answer that the 
opposition 
has 
become 
accustomed 
to, 
there 
is 
no 
regulation and certainly not accountability to Ministers who 
do not answer questions correctly in the House.  We had a 
powers and privileges committee and an ethics committee, 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 192 of 236 
 
I can tell you that the Ethics Committee hasn’t sat for over 
a year, the same can go for the Powers and Privileges 
Committee, so this type of answer unfortunately is regular 
and it is to be expected because there is no accountability 
for the way Ministers answer questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But a Minister is obliged the questions 
that members of Parliament put to them, isn’t it? 
MS MAZZONE:   Judge you are quite correct, that is the 
case, and when we complain about the answers we are told 
that we must resubmit them and that if we don’t like the 
10 
answers that is not the House’s fault. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But this is not like you don’t like the 
answers, this is not an answer to the question.   You 
should be able to go back and say whether go back to the 
Minister or somebody to whom a complaint must be made, 
whether it is the President or the Deputy President, leader 
of Government, business or whatever, and say I put a 
question to the Minister, he has not answered the question, 
because this is not an answer to the question that was put.  
Are you not able to do that or have you reached a point 
20 
where you think it is not going to help, it means they don’t 
want to answer and no matter whatever you do is not going 
to help? 
MS MAZZONE:   Judge Zondo unfortunately we have 
reached the stage, and we have had for some time, that if 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 193 of 236 
 
a Minister does not want to answer a question they simply 
don’t.  When we resubmit a question the questions office 
will then tell us that that question has already been asked 
within a certain period of time and that the response was 
given.  We can refer the response to the Rules Committee, 
but the Rules Committee equally such as the Ethics 
Committee and the Powers and Privileges Committee also 
doesn’t sit, so there is no actual structure that sits and 
holds a minister to account. 
 
So one would hope that the leader of government 
10 
business or certainly the head of the Executive would hold 
the Ministers to account, but that certainly does not 
happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But of course the leader of Government 
business to the extent that he or she may do something 
about it will only be able to do something if it is brought to 
their attention that here is a minister who is not showing 
respect for Parliament.   Do MP’s so to speak report this to 
the Leader of Government Business. 
MS MAZZONE:   We most certainly do and there have been 
20 
many occasions, especially oral questions to Parliament 
which Judge if you have ever watched an oral session in 
Parliament it becomes very robust and sometimes very 
unruly, and we often refer Ministers who don’t arrive or 
who simply stand up and say yes or no and sit down, we do 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 194 of 236 
 
refer those particular Ministers to the leader of government 
business or to the Chair of Chairs, we also do so in the 
Chief ...[indistinct] if there is a continuous pattern that we 
see development, however I have yet to see a Minister 
have any consequence to refusing to answer a question, 
and I have been in Parliament since 2009. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But as far as you know one of the people 
who complains about a Minister not answering questions or 
not answering – not answering questions even if they are 
evasive, one of the people to whom complaints can be 
10 
made or to whom a report can be made about such a 
minister is the leader of government business? 
MS MAZZONE:   Yes, it would be the leader of government 
business, it could also be the ...[indistinct – distorted] of 
Parliament and either one of them could then bring the 
matter up in a Cabinet meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, alright, thank you.  Yes Mr 
Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, just following that same theme, if 
I can refer you to paragraph 16 of your affidavit, I want to 
20 
deal with this very briefly because I think the facts here 
are all a matter of record and public knowledge, but you 
asked a question of Minister Brown about monies paid to 
Trillian Capital Partners, we see that in paragraph 16.1 and 
it eventually became a matter of common cause that the 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335

answer given had not been correct, the matter was referred 
to the Public Protector and the Public Protector found that 
Minister Brown had inadvertently misled Parliament in the 
reply she gave to you on that occasion, is that correct? 
MS MAZZONE:   That is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Then if we can follow the same thing 
in paragraph 17 to 40 of your affidavit.    
MS MAZZONE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   You say there on the 24 t h of April 2017 
I 
submitted 
a 
Parliamentary 
question 
about 
the 
10 
procurement 
process, 
pursuant 
to 
which 
Eskom 
had 
awarded a R7billion contract for the supply of coal by 
Tegeta to Komati Power Station.   My question received no 
reply at all and then you say this is by no means 
uncommon and you refer to the rule that requires that a 
written question is supposed to be responded to, was 
required by the rules to be responded to within ten days, 
and you say that at your request your staff investigated as 
it were what  happened to a whole number of questions 
and it says at the foot page 40 that as of 11 September 
20 
2020 the VA National Caucus had submitted close to 1500 
questions for the 2020 calendar year, of which 345 were 
still answered, 263 having passed the ten day period set 
out in rule 145[5] and then you draw attention to a 
particular 
provision 
of 
the 
rules, 
Rule 
146[3] 
which 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 196 of 236 
 
requires the Speaker to endorse unanswered questions as 
such and to inform the leader of government business, 
parliament or – to inform the leader of government 
business and then you say Parliament and/or the leader of 
government business routinely fails to take steps to 
enforce accountability by Ministers in this regard. 
 
Do you stand by all of that? 
MS MAZZONE:   I do. 
ADV FREUND SC:   So for example the question that you 
asked in 17.14 did you ever receive an answer? 
10 
MS MAZZONE:   No. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Right I want to move on to a different 
issue, this is really the events leading up to the PCPE’s 
Eskom inquiry and you start to deal with that from 
paragraph 17.18 of your affidavit and following, and I am 
going to in the interest of time just try to very briefly 
summarise what it is all about.    You refer to what became 
– what you referred to as the Molefe fiasco, this is Mr 
Brian Molefe who had been as I recall Chief Executive I 
think of Eskom in what you call the disastrous state of 
20 
Eskom and you point out that on the 17 t h of May 2017 the 
Acting Chairperson of the PCPE, Ms Rantho, agreed to a 
request from the DA that Minister Brown and Eskom be 
called to the committee to account for this.  
 
Now as I read the material, the written material at 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 197 of 236 
 
my disposal, this seems to be a turnaround moment, that 
Ms Rantho is now acting as the Chair, the former Chair no 
longer serving as Chair, if I am not mistaken perhaps 
having been promoted, and Ms Rantho as an Acting Chair 
starts to exercise his authority as Acting Chair somewhat 
differently to your previous experience, would that be a fair 
summary? 
MS MAZZONE:   That is a very fair summary. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And so you have at this meeting in 
May a discussion about the problems, you have another 
10 
meeting on the 22 n d of May and then on the 23 r d of May 
and I am now on paragraph 18.1 there is an urgent meeting 
convened of your committee, held at the Townhouse Hotel 
and I just want to pause and understand where we were 
politically by then, because we note in paragraph 18.2 that 
Mr Pravin Gordhan is by that stage a member of  your 
portfolio committee, is that right? 
MS MAZZONE:   That is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   I think if I am not mistaken this must 
have been very early if not his first participation in this 
20 
committee, would that be approximately right? 
MS MAZZONE:   That is correct.  What had happened was 
Mr Gordhan and his Deputy had been relieved of their 
duties as Finance Ministers, the one, the Deputy, had 
resigned to my recollection, Honourable Gordhan had 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 198 of 236 
 
decided to stay on as a member of Parliament and had 
been placed as a member of the Public Enterprises 
Portfolio Committee.  Where we were politically to answer 
your earlier question was that we were now moving into the 
period of the ANC Congress and a build up to the ANC 
Congress and the clear division lines had been drawn 
within the ANC separating those who were now clearly on 
the Zuma camp and those who were now clearly on the 
Ramaphosa camp and battle lines so to speak had been 
drawn, one could see it in reactions to heckling and to 
10 
speeches made in Parliament and one could also see the 
reaction of members who now – who had one time were 
scared to speak out and were following a certain who were 
now giving a freedom to take another line and to pursue a 
different way of – of dealing with issues. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And when you were referring to the 
political context I presume what you had in mind was the 
anticipated ANC National Congress in December of 2017 at 
Nasrec at which they would amongst other things elect a new 
President of the African National Congress? 
20 
MS MAZZONE:  That – that is correct it is the elective 
conference of the ANC that took place in December of 2017. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Is that (no sound) – now what you then 
disclose in this affidavit and I know factual controversy about 
this is that end of May 2017 clearly a crucial turnaround 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 199 of 236 
 
moment – way I see you are freezing on my screen – can 
you help me? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Freund it looks like there is something 
that has gone wrong with Mr Mazzone’s screen.  I do not 
know whether you got frozen. 
MS MAZZONE:  I am here I could hear you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh you could hear everything? 
MS MAZZONE:  Yes I am sorry about that I could hear you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay no that is fine.  Then you – you 
can – I do not know if Mr Freund you had finished your 
10 
question or I interrupted you before you could finish. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Well I – let me just repeat it just to avoid 
any misunderstandings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:  That what I am putting to you for your 
comment is that this meeting of the Portfolio Committee of 
Public Enterprises on the 23 May was a fundamental turning 
point in the – in the question of your committee’s attempts to 
put allegations … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on again Mr Freund I think that is 
20 
going to be problematic on the transcript.  As you were 
speaking you know some words did not come through and I 
think it is because of technical problems so I am thinking 
that they will not transcribe your full question properly 
whereas it is important.  Somebody is talking to – it should 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 200 of 236 
 
be fine now?  Okay.  I will ask you to repeat it – your 
question. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Chair I will – I will of course repeat it but 
I would request respectfully that if we have a further problem 
of the 00:02:55 you just alert me and then I will – I will know 
what is not being heard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  What I am putting to you Ms Mazzone is 
this.  That it seems that the meeting of the May 2017 was a 
fundamentally important turning point in relation to the 
10 
question of that committee’s willingness to enquire into, to 
probe into and to try to relation to state capture allegations.  
Do you agree with that? 
MS MAZZONE:  Yes absolutely.  It was a fundamental 
turning point in more ways than one.  When I arrived just to 
explain the – the structure of the Townhouse Hotel the – 
where you have the meetings you have to go downstairs and 
then you are in a sort of basement level.  When I got to the 
basement level I was there with the leader of the opposition 
– the Chief Whip of the opposition rather Honourable 
20 
Steenhuizen who had joined me for that particular meeting 
because there was going to perhaps be a question raised 
about the sub judice rule and he was at the time and 
probably still is the expert on sub judice.  When we arrived 
the ANC section of the committee welcomed me,  they – 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 201 of 236 
 
there was a definite warmth that had not been there before.  
They told me that they would back me in all the questions 
that I was going to ask and they informed me that 
Honourable Pravin Gordhan was also going to be there 
because he had such in-depth knowledge about the finances 
and how things had worked so there was a sort of sigh of 
relief that we had an ex-Minister of Finance joining us who 
knew about the finances and how they – the finances would 
have been paid over.  During the course of the meeting it 
was very obvious that we had gone from a committee divided 
10 
to a committee completely united in being on the side of 
South Africans and what was correct for South Africa at the 
particular time and that was the fundamental shift where we 
went from a normal Portfolio Committee meeting – committee 
to being team South Africa in taking the issue forward as a 
united team. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second Mr Freund.  Although the 
question… 
ADV FREUND SC:  And this claim… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on – one second Mr Freund.  
20 
Although when you repeated the questions there were some 
problems but I – I get the impression that when Ms Mazzone 
responded everything was fine and I think the way she 
responded captures in a way what your question was about 
the fundamental shift or turning point.  So I think I am being 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 202 of 236 
 
told that now it seems that it is fine.  So let us continue. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Yes thank you very much.  Now as it 
happens this is only a few days it seems to me for referred 
to in paragraph 18.7 of your affidavit.  When there is a trove 
of leaked emails that became available the so called Gupta 
Leaks and I want to now understand the impact that made as 
the – as we go along.  Now the – you issued a statement I 
am not going to take you to it now; you refer to it in 
paragraph 18.7 where you responded to that.  And you 
describe in your affidavit how you sought the consent and 
10 
assistance of the so called Chair of Chairs – the House 
Chairperson of Committees Mr Cedric Frolick for the inquiry 
that the PCPE intended to embark upon and that he was 
agreeable at least in prin... – first in principle and in due 
course by providing resource assistance for that inquiry, is 
that correct? 
MS MAZZONE:  That is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Now what I want to next refer you to and 
it is another very important turning point in the history that 
we are trying to place before the commission is the set of 
20 
letters that Mr Frolick issued on or about the 15 t h June 2017 
and you refer to that in paragraph 18.9 of your affidavit.  And 
you refer there to Annexure NM62 and that annexure I would 
ask the Chair to turn to and I am just going to check my page 
references but I want to start at page 490 – page 490.   
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 203 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I have got it. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Do you have it Ms Mazzone? 
MS MAZZONE:  I am almost there.  I have two pages stuck 
together.  Yes I have it. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Now that is a letter I am going to read 
into the record from Mr Frolick to Ms Rantho the acting 
Chairperson 
of 
the 
Portfolio 
Committee 
on 
Public 
Enterprises. 
“Dear Ms Rantho allegations of state capture 
in organs of state.” 
10 
And then Mr Frolick says the following: 
“I am sure that you are aware of numerous 
allegations 
of 
state 
capture 
that 
have 
appeared in the media in recent weeks.  
Some of these allegations involve members 
of the Executive and officials in a variety of 
state owned enterprises such as Denel, 
Eskom, South African Airways and Transnet.  
I would like to request that your committee 
investigate 
the 
allegations 
within 
the 
20 
parameters of the rules and report any 
findings where applicable to the National 
Assembly as a matter of urgency.” 
And I am going to be referring very shortly to a set of similar 
letters to other Chairs of other committees.  But what I would 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 204 of 236 
 
like to ask you about is what if anything had happened that 
you may have been involved with in relation to the so called 
Gupta Leaks and the material in the Gupta Leaks and the 
making of that material available to the House? 
MS MAZZONE:  Well members of Parliament are often given 
documents; we are sent information, documents are left at 
certain places for us and I had been given a in those days it 
was still on a CD Rom I had been given a CD Rom of a 
collection of the Gupta Leaked emails which were in the 
public domain already which had been released mostly by 
10 
the – by the media in which you could of course get.  You 
know it was public if you went onto certain media houses 
web pages.  I then sat down with a grouping of the DA staff 
and what we did is we did computer searches on particular 
names.  So we would do a computer search on Brown and 
then we would do a search for everything that came up 
linking Minister Brown to state capture and so we did it 
Minister by Minister.  What we then did is we printed a set of 
each one of the Gupta Leaked emails that involved certain 
Ministers in Parliament.  We put them into a big brown 
20 
manila envelopes.  We labelled them accordingly with the 
name of the Minister and when I had completed this task 
which was quite mammoth task it took us a good few days 
and nights to complete I went into the House and as soon as 
the Speaker had called the House to order I stood up on a 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 205 of 236 
 
point of privilege and I informed the Speaker that in my 
hands I had a set of Gupta leaked emails and that I had 
separated these Gupta leaked emails into packets according 
to which Minister had been implicated or alleged to have 
been implicated in any of the Gupta leaked emails and that I 
was handing up the full and complete set of emails to the 
Speaker for her then to disseminate to each one of the 
Ministers and I explained that I had labelled each of the 
envelopes accordingly.  Of course there is televised footage 
of that as well as a rather famous photo of me standing up 
10 
with a huge pile of these brown envelopes as I handed them 
up to the House. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Now can I take you to paragraph 18.17 of 
your affidavit?  
MS MAZZONE:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And there you really summarise what you 
have just told the Chair.  But in the second sentence you 
say: 
“These emails appeared at face value to 
implicate five Ministers in facets of state 
20 
capture.” 
And you have described how you separated material from the 
so called Gupta leaks as it were relevant to Minister by 
Minister.  Could you please identify the Ministers to the best 
of your recollection in relation to whom you prepared this 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 206 of 236 
 
material? 
MS MAZZONE:  Yes.  I am just going to – it is easy for me to 
remember when I write down the names.  Advocate I off the 
top of my head really remember the name of four and I do 
not want to in any way perjure myself so I will give you the 
names of the four that I remember.   It was Minister Brown, 
Minister Van Rooyen, Minister Zwane and Minister Gigaba 
and I cannot recollect the name of the fifth. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Alright and just for the record if you 
could indicate what their Ministries were at that time? 
10 
MS MAZZONE:  Minister Brown was the then Minister of 
Public Enterprises. Van Rooyen was the Minister of COPTA 
and then he had become the Finance Minister.  Minister 
Zwane was Mineral Resources and Minister Gigaba at the 
time had taken over as Finance Minister but was previously 
the Shadow – the Minister of Public Enterprises. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And then did he not have some 
relationship with Home Affairs? 
MS MAZZONE:  Yes and Home Affairs – but Home Affairs 
was later. 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:  Home Affairs was later? 
MS MAZZONE:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Thank you.  Now what you say is that 
you produced these big packs of Gupta leak material 
organised by Ministry and Minister and those were presented 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 207 of 236 
 
to Parliament and – but I see that what you say in paragraph 
18.17 is that that actually took place on the 22n d of June 
2017.  So it seems to be a few days or a week or so after the 
letter we just looked at dated the 15t h June.  Can you – do 
you – are you with me? 
MS MAZZONE:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  But nonetheless if we read the very 
content of the letter of the 15 t h of June it seems Mr Frolick 
will no doubt testify in due course and confirm whether this 
is correct or not but it seems that he probably had in mind 
10 
the slew of articles that emerged out of the so called Gupta 
Leaks when he wrote this letter to Ms Rantho requesting an 
investigation by her committee.   
MS MAZZONE:  Absolutely a lot of the Gupta Leaked emails 
had already been made public.  So many of the documents 
were in the public domain but the facts of the matter is you 
want a Minister definitively to have read something and to 
assume that they have read something.  You have a duty to 
hand it up to them in the House and that is what I did.  I 
executed my – my diligence in the House by handing up the 
20 
document to them. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Right now what I want to do is I want to 
go back to this set of letters of the 15t h June.  We have 
already looked at the terms of the letter to Ms Rantho then 
the acting Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Public 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 208 of 236 
 
Enterprises.  If you go back one page to page 489 you will 
find a very similar letter also of the same date to Ms 
Mashele Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee of Home 
Affairs at the time and it is very much – very similar except 
that the detail of the first paragraph is different.  Some of 
these allegations informed the – involved the former Minister 
of Home Affairs in the granting of citizenship to non-South 
Africans that is the particular issue that Mr Frolick has asked 
the Chairperson of the Home Affairs Portfolio Committee to 
have investigated.  And similarly if you go back a further 
10 
page to page 488 also on the 15t h of June you find a virtually 
identical letter except again that the second sentence of the 
first paragraph is changed appropriately.  This is written to 
Ms Magadzi the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on 
Transport and she is asked – or she is informed that some of 
these allegations involve members of the board of the 
Passenger 
Rail 
Agency 
of 
South 
Africa 
PRASA 
and 
somebody please investigate that in your committee.  So we 
have three but only three letters dated the 15t h of June to 
these three particular Chairs of Portfolio Committees. 
20 
MS MAZZONE:  Huh-uh. 
ADV FREUND SC:  But what I also want to refer you to and 
to refer the Chair to is the letter that appears at page 486 
which is – oh sorry that is also to Ms Magadzi sorry I am 
referring you to the wrong letter.  Mineral Resources let me 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 209 of 236 
 
just get – if I can take you to page 480 – 485.  This is a little 
bit later.  This is the 23rd August and it refers to earlier 
correspondence and I do not have at the moment possession 
of any letter dated the 15t h of June to Ms Luzipo Chairperson 
Portfolio Committee of Mineral Resources but my strong 
suspicion is that there was also a similar letter of the 15 t h of 
June to her and what this letter shows is that in any event it 
is quite clear that a similar request had been made of her in 
relation to the serious allegations in the public domain about 
state capture and the alleged role of certain members of the 
10 
executive and the letter is referring to the legal basis upon 
which this was indeed permissible.  So what we seem to 
know from the documents at face value is that two things 
happened at around about the same time.   
 
Firstly in later made your committee did 00:20:30 and 
now decided that they were in favour of investigating these 
or what we would call very loosely Gupta related state 
capture allegations.  
 
And secondly Mr Frolick the Chair of Chairs is 
expressly inviting the Chairs of four committees to pursue 
20 
within their respective mandates investigations of a similar 
type and to report back to the House as a matter of some 
urgency. 
 
I see you nod I take it you were aware at the time 
that this was going on? 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 210 of 236 
 
MS MAZZONE:  I was Advocate Freund I also had a meeting 
with Mr Cedric Frolick.  Our committee asked for a multi- 
party delegation to go and meet Mr Frolick in his office.  It 
was made up of myself, Ms Daphne Rantho and Mr 
Naransing from the IFP and we asked – we were sent to Mr 
Frolick’s office to ask him for assistance with our inquiry in 
terms of getting us an evidence leader and making sure that 
we had everything at our disposal.  He kindly arranged all of 
that.  It is minuted in a meeting when we report to our 
committee that we had in fact executed that task that was 
10 
given to us and Mr Frolick did everything that we requested 
of him. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Right.  And to – to deal with that fairly 
briefly amongst – what had happened already and served to 
some extent as a model for what you were trying to achieve 
was the SABC’s ad-hoc inquiry into the Board of the SABC 
which I think ran from November 2016 if I am not mistaken 
until around about March or so 2017.  You have a 
recollection of that? 
MS MAZZONE:  Yes I do. 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:  And that had been served by an evidence 
leader one Advocate Vanaro if I understand correctly, is that 
correct? 
MS MAZZONE:  That is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And if one reads the documents that are 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 211 of 236 
 
already before the commission in the affidavits one can see 
that your committee requested Mr Frolick to approve that Mr 
Vanaro should be released and made available to assist your 
committee in you committee’s proposed inquiry.  Is that 
correct? 
MS MAZZONE:  That is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Was – he was made available, he did 
assist your committee and he advised your committee, is all 
of that correct? 
MS MAZZONE:  That is all correct. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:  And in fact if we read your affidavit we 
see that Mr Vanaro suggested and your committee agreed 
that – that the scope of its investigation should be 
broadened.  And I just want to just stand for a – pause for a 
moment and look at that issue.  If one reads the papers what 
one sees is that the issue that triggered the turnaround 
decision in late May meeting at the hotel that you referred to 
it was prompted initially very much by the saga pertained to 
Mr Brian Molefe which had caused very considerable public 
outrage.  Am I correct it was the first catalyst? 
20 
MS MAZZONE:  You are correct yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And there was a sense within the 
committee – well if we are going to look at Mr Molefe we 
should look more broadly at Eskom and so pretty quickly 
there was support for broadening from Molefe in particular to 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 212 of 236 
 
Eskom in general.  Is that correct? 
MS MAZZONE:  That is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And then what happens as things move 
along is a decision that actually we must go beyond Eskom.  
We must look at Transnet and we must look at Denel in 
particular in addition to Eskom. 
MS MAZZONE:  That is – that is – in fact there was a very 
public falling out between Denel and Treasury in the called 
the Assembly Chamber during a Portfolio Committee meeting 
on 
Public 
Enterprises 
where 
the 
Public 
Enterprises 
10 
Committee actually threw the board of Denel of Parliament 
due to their contempt in which they held the committee and 
we realised therein and what the problems at Denel were a 
lot bigger than we had originally anticipated. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Yes and so in principle the decision was 
taken to proceed not only to inquire into these allegations in 
relation to Mr Molefe and Eskom but Eskom generally, 
Transnet generally, Denel generally and that was what you 
had intended to do? 
MS MAZZONE:  That is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  As this was… 
ADV FREUND SC:  What then happened… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Freund.  As this was going 
on the Public Protector’s Report on the state of capture had 
been out in the public domain for quite a number of months, 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 213 of 236 
 
is that correct? 
MS MAZZONE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay alright thank you.  Please 
continue Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:  But – but we try to get the timeline there.  
That had happened as I understand it by November of 2016.  
The turnaround that you have described took place in late 
May and early June of 2017. In other words there is still a 
long period from the date of the issuing of the Public 
Protector state of capture report and the decision by at least 
10 
portions of the ANC to support the type of inquiries and 
investigations to which you are referring, would you agree? 
MS MAZZONE:  I would agree and I would go so far as to 
say there were even many members of the ANC who wanted 
that particular report appealed and there was a large 
pushback saying that the Public Protector had not given 
members an – the correct opportunity to state their claim.  
So there was continuously a fight about that particular 
document of the Public Protector’s. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Yes and related to that document of 
20 
course was the – was the requirement by the Public 
Protector 
that 
a 
Commission 
of 
Inquiry 
– 
a 
judicial 
Commission of Inquiry should be appointed to further 
investigate the very issues that were the subject matter of 
the state of capture report. 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 214 of 236 
 
MS MAZZONE:  That is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And there was a great deal of toing and 
froing and disputes and litigation and the like about whether 
that was going to happen and if so on what terms and when 
and so forth and that had been material that would be very 
familiar to this commission. 
MS MAZZONE:  I am sure. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Now in your affidavit at paragraph 18.10 
you make an assertion.  You say that: 
“By the time that Mr Frolick sent these letters; 
10 
these are the 15t h of June letters requesting the 
investigation of the allegations referred to two 
distinct ANC fractions had become apparent in 
Parliament one supportive and one opposed to 
President Zuma.  These factions emerged against 
the context of  
1. The fact that the allegations of state capture 
or corruption had substance was becoming 
ever more apparent and 
2. The fact that the ANC would in December 
20 
2017 be electing a new president.  The 
faction 
supportive 
of 
President 
Zuma 
showed no enthusiasm for inquiring into 
allegations of state capture or corruption 
whilst the other faction had come by this – 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 215 of 236 
 
had by this time come to support this.” 
And then you continue. 
“The tension between these two factions in 
Parliament 
was 
obvious 
to 
seasoned 
members of Parliament.  For example when 
members of one faction spoke there would 
sometimes be heckled by members of the 
other faction or subjected to other forms of 
visible or audible criticism.” 
Could you just perhaps elaborate a little on why you think 
10 
you can you say that – that really the explanation for the 
turnaround is factional divisions and deep these factional 
divisions were? 
MS 
MAZZONE: 
 
Well 
already 
it 
had 
become 
public 
knowledge with many of the ANC members publicly declaring 
for whom their support was going – going towards.  Now this 
is not uncommon in political parties.  My own political party 
recently went through an electoral conference and many 
senior members as well as many junior members quickly 
make known who they are supporting and they publicly 
20 
endorse that particular person.   
 
So we know that endorsements had started coming 
through for either Jacob Zuma then President or for the 
leader of government business Cyril Ramaphosa. 
 
Also what one must bear in mind is that in Parliament 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 216 of 236 
 
a lot of the heckling is missed by the public because our 
microphones are deeply sensitive.  So the microphone at the 
podium is set to a much higher frequency than the rest of the 
chamber.   
 
So when you are giving a speech in Parliament and it 
is done so that the hand slide can record it and so that 
obviously the public can hear it you do not hear the heckles 
that are made or sometimes you can dependent on how far 
away they are but the heckles do not sound as loud as they 
do when you are in the house. 
10 
 
But the Democratic Alliance obviously ...[indistinct – 
word cut off] the ANC in Parliament and we could see 
groupings of people together who were no longer sitting in 
their seats that they were allocated to.  They had moved to 
sit in clusters.  And when a member who was either pro-
Zuma or pro-Ramaphosa would speak, a cluster would often 
heckle.  Sometimes turn their back many a time walk out and 
not listen to the Speaker and the divisions were just highly 
visible.   
 
And as I say, I have been in Parliament since 2009 
20 
and one does become accustomed to who is close to who 
and I mean, we spent a lot of time in The House and you get 
a general feel for what is going on in The House.  And it was 
very evident in The House who was in favour for example of 
a commissioner of inquiry being started and who was against 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 217 of 236 
 
such a commission of inquiry. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you.  Then you say in your 
affidavit in paragraphs 18.12 and 18.13 that it seems to 
you that Mr Frolick eventually threw in his lot with the 
group who opposed President Zuma.   
 
And you say Mr Jackson Mthembu, the then chief 
whip, 
also 
joined 
this 
grouping. 
 
And 
you 
say 
as 
demonstrated by the fact that he from time to time 
expressed his support to members of the PCPE regard to 
this inquiry and did what he could to ensure that they have 
10 
access to the necessary resources.   
 
Now let us just go back to Mr Frolick.  Apropos Mr 
Frolick, is there anything more than just conjecture on your 
part about his factional position? 
MS MAZZONE:   Well, he was absolutely determined to get 
our committee up and going as fast as possible.  When we 
required a legal opinion from a senior advocate when 
Ms Lynne Brown had questioned the validity of us having an 
inquiry.   
 
There was absolutely no question about getting that 
20 
particular legal opinion.  So everything in Mr Frolick’s power 
was done to ensure that we had a venue and that we have 
everything at our disposal.   
 
So I suppose that one could say that it is conjecture 
but it is also a matter of having lived through the experience 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 218 of 236 
 
and seen someone’s first-hand reaction.  And then with the 
chief whip, what I mean by ...[indistinct] [00:02:23]  
ADV FREUND SC:   Before you go on.  Let us just start 
with that.  The that was sought was sought because there 
was a foreign attack by, amongst other as I understand it, 
Minister Lynne Brown to the right of the committee to do 
this at all.  And so the committees sought legal advice and 
an opinion was obtained in due course from the very 
eminent council, Mr Wayne Trinco SC.  Is that correct? 
MS MAZZONE:   That is correct.   
10 
ADV FREUND SC:   And his advice in short is that you 
were entitled to do what you were doing. 
MS MAZZONE:   Absolutely correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Let us move onto what you have to say 
about Mr Jackson Mthembu.  I think you were about to tell 
his that you found him to be very supportive of the work of 
this Portfolio Committee. 
MS MAZZONE:   Well, Mr Jackson Mthembu by his very 
nature was a very friendly and very kind person but even 
more so during this particular inquiry.  A lot of the inquiry 
20 
was done in the old assembly chamber and just off the old 
assembly chamber is the office of the ANC chief whip.   
 
So often in the morning, we would have – we would 
arrive a little bit early.  We would discuss as a committee 
who would be asking the first set of questions.  In other 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 219 of 236 
 
words, we would sort of caucus as a committee.  We had 
the morning coffee and settle in.   
 
And often Mr Jackson Mthembu used to pop in, 
check on us, make sure we are all okay, ask us if we need 
anything, if the evidence leader had everything that he 
needed and make sure that we were all okay.   
 
We had a few instances where a few movements 
had tried to come into Parliament and disrupt our meetings.  
And Mr Mthembu made sure that the security around our 
venue was heightened and that we felt completely safe 
10 
while we were executing our oversight duty.   
ADV FREUND SC:   We can now turn to paragraph 18.21 of 
your affidavit. 
MS MAZZONE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Where you pay tribute to the ANC on 
your Portfolio Committee and you say that on several 
occasions they emphasised to you and to other opposition 
members that they saw themselves as what was referred to 
as a Kamikaze mission likely to be destructive of their 
careers.  Perhaps you could just elaborate on that. 
20 
MS MAZZONE:   Yes.  It became a very strange time in all of 
our lives and it is very hard to explain unless you have lived 
through something like it.  At times it felt like we were living 
a James Bond movie.   
 
And the members knew very clearly that one way or 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 220 of 236 
 
another they were going to be in a great deal of trouble for 
having supported and for having robustly questioned many 
people who had a great deal of influence over the ANC and 
more especially over ANC coffers as they came in.   
 
And as it happened, only one member of the 
Portfolio Committee that was a current member returned to 
Parliament.  Minister Gordhan was of course made a Minister 
again but not one of the other members came back to 
Parliament in the end as a member of Parliament.  They 
were ranked very low on the list.   
10 
 
And yes at times when I expressed to them that I 
thought that what they are doing was very brave.  Because 
as an opposition it is my job to hold the executive to account 
but it is very difficult when you are holding your own 
Ministers and your own potential cadets that have been 
deployed on behalf of your party to account on this.  It is a 
very difficult thing to do.   
 
And I often say to them that they were being 
incredible brave in their actions.  And one of the members 
said to me that that they were well-aware that this is a 
20 
Kamikaze mission but that they had to for the sake of their 
future mental health and also for the sake of – in one case – 
their religious believes had to put South Africa first.  And 
they could no longer be privy to the corruption that they 
knew was happening.   
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 221 of 236 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   And since we have eluded earlier to 
the fact that at a certain time Ms Rantho did not publicly 
expressed support for your point of view.  Could you 
perhaps just talk about the role that she played on this 
particular inquiry in this process? 
MS MAZZONE:   Ms Rantho came in as the acting 
chairperson of the committee.  She showed a bravery of the 
kind not often seen in business nor in politics.  Ms Rantho 
had children that at one time were threatened.   
 
And we all experienced some kind of oddness that 
10 
had happened which we went public about which is not part 
of this committee.  It was dealt with at the time by 
Parliament.   
 
But Ms Rantho stood incredible firm, incredible 
strong and she maintained a level of decorum throughout the 
inquiry which was fair in the line the timing of questioning. 
 
And she certainly ensure that the committee acted 
as a team South Africa and otherwise what would happen is 
that the ANC would been a disproportioned amount of time to 
ask their questions to other members of the committee 
20 
because that is how Parliament works. 
 
Ms Rantho decided not to go that particular route 
and gave everyone equal opportunity to speak.  And I think 
showed an immense amount of bravery at a time where harm 
could come to her and her family. 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 222 of 236 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   And it seems implicit in your evidence 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Freund, one second.  Registrar.  Thank 
you Mr Freund.  You may proceed. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you Chair.  It seems implicit in 
what you said already that a great deal can turn on the 
character and disposal of the chair of the Portfolio 
Committee.  Could you just elaborate a little further on the 
importance of a chair. 
MS MAZZONE:   Absolutely.  A chairperson of a committee 
10 
can make or break whether that committee is able to execute 
their duty as put down in the rules of Parliament, and more 
importantly as envisaged in the oath of office that a member 
of Parliament takes.   
 
I have seen many a committee chairperson who has 
actually stopped me from doing my oversight duty and has 
stopped me from being able to execute my oath of office. 
 
Ms Rantho was the exact opposite.  She was an 
enabler who has to hold the executive account rather than 
someone who stood in our way.  
20 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you.  Now I just want to 
conclude by giving you a brief opportunity to talk to the 
final observations you make in your affidavit.  These are 
really general Cummings and proposals which you may 
about things you think should be considered as potential 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 223 of 236 
 
recommendations of the Commission which you have 
adopted might assist in improving things.  If you would just 
like to talk briefly to the points you have made here. 
MS MAZZONE:   Thank you.  Thank you very much Indeed 
Advocate.  I consider myself to be a senior member of 
Parliament and I also consider myself to be a senior member 
of my party and as such I think that I have the experience to 
speak on issues on how we can improve oversights in 
Parliament. 
 
I specifically referred to the oath of office or the 
10 
affirmation that every member of Parliament takes upon 
being sworn in which is done in front of the Chief Justice 
because we sway our allegiance our oath of office to uphold 
the constitution.  
 
And one particular, if I may, I would like to read out 
from our oath of office is that: 
“I will be faithful to the Republic of South Africa 
and 
will 
obey, 
respect 
and 
uphold 
the 
constitution and other laws of the Republic. 
I solemnly promise to perform my function of the 
20 
National Assembly in the case of the oath, so 
help me God who otherwise I hereby affirm.” 
 
Now to me that oath that you solemnly promise to 
perform your duty is what we need to focus on.  now you can 
solemnly promised to perform your duty but they can be a 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 224 of 236 
 
brick wall that you are constantly running into and that 
seems to be where we are and where we have been for a 
long time as members of Parliament  
 
The current rules of Parliament even though they 
are reviewed make it virtually impossible for us two for full 
hour oath of office. 
 
Now I sit on the Rules Committee and that remains 
the biggest problem.  The ANC's absolute majority in our 
Parliament gives them the absolute opportunity to block 
whatever they don't want to go through. 
10 
 
And I believe that we do not legislate for the party 
that governs at the moment.  I believe that we need to 
legislate for any government that will in future come into 
power.  
 
So I say this not because I wish I need to stop the 
ANC majority.  I would like to see any party that gains 
majority in Parliament not being able and to stop a member 
from upholding the oath of office.  
 
So the overwhelming majority enjoyed by the African 
National Congress allows them to outvote, disallowed or stop 
20 
any actions that are contrary to the ideology, intentions or 
political aspirations. 
 
This majority is thus utilised to serve the members 
of the office and that accountability by members of the 
executive and diploid ANC cadets. 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 225 of 236 
 
 
Now accountability does not in my opinion or in my 
parties opinion exist because there are no opposition 
committees of committees with the exception of SCOPA 
which is the Standing Committee of Public Accounts which is 
usually chaired by a compliant not an ANC member. 
ADV FREUND SC:   If I can just interrupt.  I think you miss 
read.  I think it says no opposition chairs committee.  Is 
that correct?  
MS MAZZONE:   Yes, there are no opposition chairs of 
committees.  Excuse me.  One needs to understood and 
10 
accept 
that's 
the 
majority 
party 
governs 
the 
country.  
opposition parties must also be allowed the scope and room 
to exercise oversight within governments and to hold the 
executive to account. 
 
It 
is 
reprehensible 
that 
the 
very 
individuals 
discussed and investigated by this committee of inquiry are 
currently serving as Ministers, chairs committee's and 
ordinary members of Parliament.  
 
Advocate 
Freund 
and 
Judge 
Zondo 
with 
your 
indulgence allow me to repeat that sentence.  
20 
 
It 
is 
reprehensible 
that 
the 
very 
individuals 
discussed and investigated by this Commission of inquiry 
serve as Ministers, chairs of committee's and ordinary 
members of Parliament.  
 
It 
is 
our 
submission 
that 
there 
should 
be 
a 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 226 of 236 
 
committee 
made 
up 
of 
one 
member 
of 
each 
party 
represented in Parliament that decides an establishment and 
composition of ad hoc committees, the scheduling of debates 
and the taking of motions.  
 
The rules of the ethics and the powers in the 
committee needs to be urgently relooked.  The majority 
enjoyed by the governing party cannot be used to evade 
accountability 
of 
members 
that 
appear 
before 
these 
committees.  
 
There  should also be criminal repercussions for 
10 
those who are found guilty of an infringement by either one 
of these committees.  These committees must be open to the 
public and to the media to ensure transparency in the 
Parliamentary process. 
 
The programming of the Parliamentary term needs 
to be fundamentally changed.  We are still looking at a sort 
of six months, six months which dates back to the old style 
system the Parliament would sit six months in Cape Town 
and six months in Pretoria.  
 
The amount of time that MP's do not spend in The 
20 
House during the basic work of legislating and holding the 
executive to account is unacceptable.  
 
The leader of government business and the leader 
of opposition should be consulted in the programme in 
process.   
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 227 of 236 
 
 
We 
submit 
that 
the 
Speaker 
of 
the 
National 
Assembly and the Deputy Speaker should not belong to any 
political party, no hold any office of any political party and 
thus must be completely politically independent.  
 
The presiding officers of Parliament should be 
apportioned as in accordance with the representation of 
parties in Parliament. 
 
Advocate Freund, in conclusion.  It cannot be that 
we sit at the Commission like the Zondo Commission that 
looks at the state capture and honestly say to one another 
10 
that the entire Cabinet did not know that state capturing was 
happening. 
 
it is a physical and factual impossibility.  We cannot 
say under earth and say to Judge Zondo as chairperson of 
this committee that the very person who was the head of 
government business, the leader of government business 
and also the head cadet appointment programme of the ANC 
did not know that state capture was happening.  It is 
impossible that the Speaker of Parliament did not know that 
state capture was happening. 
20 
 
One must look at the divisions that exist in our 
country and one must realise that it is to the interests of 
some to divide us and not to unite us.  
 
It would be very naive of us to come here and think 
that we can scapegoat one ex-president and maybe 5, 6, 7, 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 228 of 236 
 
10 of the Ministers and CEO of various companies.  those 
Ministers were appointed by the ANC cadet employment 
programme and their CEOs enjoyed a turnstile ball approach 
to the appointments in all state owned entities.  
 
And there is no way that people in the executive of 
the ANC could even not have known that state capture was 
happening.  Thank you very much.  
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you Ms Mazzone.  I have no 
further questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you Ms Mazzone.  Just one or two 
10 
questions.  It is clear that one of the problems with regard to 
members of Parliament performing their oversight functions 
the way they should in some cases is that there are parties 
can instruct them effectively not to do their oversight 
functions or perform their oversight functions properly. 
 
I think you gave evidence Ms Mazzone about the 
study groups which you said the majority party in Parliament 
has where positions are taken as to what stance the 
members of the majority party in a particular committee 
should take on certain issues which ends up affecting the 
20 
performance of their oversight functions. 
 
What do you think is the solution to that problem 
Ms Mazzone? 
MS MAZZONE:   Judge Zondo, I think address that problem 
is that although we are a multi-party Parliament, we are a 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 229 of 236 
 
multi-party Parliament that enjoys an overwhelming majority 
who takes the decisions on behalf of that multi-party.   
 
So what we need is we need to see a levelling out of 
the playing field when it comes to certain decision making 
functions.  Otherwise we may as well just be a dictatorship 
or a you know a two-party show. 
 
Because theoretically if one looked strictly at the 
way time is allocated, someone who has one seat in 
Parliament for example would get 15-seconds during the 
debate to make their contribution.   
10 
 
So 
it 
is 
my 
opinion 
and 
the 
opinion 
of 
the 
Democratic Alliance that there are some committees that 
needs to be established where the leader of the opposition 
together with the leader of Government Business make 
decisions for example on the Programme of Parliament and 
the Scheduling of Debates and Motions that happen in 
Parliament. 
 
And it is also my submission as well as the DA’s that 
we have a committee made up of one person from each party 
represented 
in 
Parliament 
that 
form 
a 
Committee 
of 
20 
Parliament that make sure that oversight is executed in 
terms for example of where a Minister refuses to answer 
questions and what kind of repercussions that particular 
Minister will have. 
 
Because 
at 
the 
moment 
regardless 
of 
what 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 230 of 236 
 
committee 
that 
particular 
Minister 
is 
referred 
to, 
the 
overwhelming majority of the ANC will always protect that 
Minister.   
 
So what we need to see is levelling of the playing 
fields in terms of the numbers that we have in our 
Parliament. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I understand that there is a view that 
leaders of political parties, the party bosses, in number of 
parties represented in Parliament might not like the idea that 
members of Parliament must be able to perform their 
10 
oversight functions the way they see fit or that members of 
Parliament must be free not to comply with any instructions 
from their parties that says for example if there is a vote of 
no confidence, members of the party must vote this way. 
 
There seems to be that view that party bosses, not 
just the majority party, but other parties as well where they 
govern even if it a municipality or a province that they do not 
like the idea that members can vote as they see fit or 
according to their conscience. 
 
They seem to like the idea that, at least in regard to 
20 
certain matters or maybe the majority of matters or all 
matters... 
[Background noise interruption - cell phone interruption] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that your phone Ms Mazzone? 
MS MAZZONE:   [No audible reply]  
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 231 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not know whose phone that is.  Okay 
that should not happen again.  Ms Mazzone, the point I was 
making is that there seems to be the view that party bosses 
across many if not all political parties including those who 
are represented in Parliament like the idea that they can 
instruct members of Parliament who are members of their 
party how to vote. 
 
They do not like the idea that they should not be 
able to instruct members of their party or in Parliament on 
how to vote.  What do you know about this if anything? 
10 
MS MAZZONE:   Justice Zondo, I know more probably than 
most people would about holding the party line. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MAZZONE:   Because my job as Chief Whip is to make 
sure that my members hold the party line.  And often in a 
snap debate or a snap motion that will come to the floor you 
will see me stand up and I will walk around and I will inform 
my party members how to vote.  That is what a Chief Whip 
does. 
 
But how we get around this particular mine that I 
20 
think we find ourselves in is that we must not be naïve to the 
ideology that parties have.  All political parties have an 
ideology.  That is why you join them because you believe in 
what they stand for.  So there are certain fundamentals that 
a political party will always vote for or against based on the 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 232 of 236 
 
ideology of the party.   
 
There are certain circumstances where I believe that 
a secret ballot is necessary.  For example I think that the 
election of the President and the election of the Speaker are 
examples of where there should be a secret ballot as well as 
the impeachment and removal of either a speaker or a 
president should be in a secret ballot form. 
 
I also think that the South African public have a lot 
more right to find out exactly how members of Parliament 
who may have voted into office are voting. 
10 
 
So I do not believe in a simple yea or nay system.  I 
think we should have a system in Parliament that logs every 
single vote that you as a member of Parliament make 
because I should never be ashamed of voting yes or no for 
an issue and I should be completely and fully accountable to 
my constituency as to how I voted. 
 
Now I know there has been a lot of talk about 
allowing you know changing, fundamentally changing the 
system of government the way we elect governance in South 
Africa and that is something that we are going to be looking 
20 
at and certainly the Van Zyl Slabbert Report is going to be 
looked at too. 
 
But perhaps what is necessary is for the South 
African public got to realise that we hold our positions 
because they had given us their mandate to hold their 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 233 of 236 
 
positions. 
 
And Judge Zondo, I think that perhaps that if you 
knew exactly who voted for what and when, you would have 
more power as an individual South African citizen who votes 
to hold me accountable than you do at the moment. 
 
And I think it would also make many members of 
Parliament think twice before they vote in a certain way if 
they knew that the general public would know next to their 
name it said yes or no. 
 
And in a case such as we had now where we had an 
10 
entire inquiry into state capture.  I think we have to hold 
those who voted against an initial ad-hoc committee who 
voted against that ad-hoc committee, I think we have an 
obligation to hold them to account. 
 
And I think we have an obligation to hold many MP’s 
who have voted for certain issues to account.  And I 
understand that it is not something that is easy to solve and 
it certainly will not happen overnight but I think as our 
democracy matures so must our attitude to the way we are 
hold accountable, mature. 
20 
 
And I take comfort in looking at governments around 
the world where without a second guess if they are found to 
have 
done 
something 
wrong 
they 
resign 
their 
office 
immediately.   
 
And it is my hope that the dignity and the quorum of 
01 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 335 
 
Page 234 of 236 
 
our Parliament matures at a much faster rate to ensure that 
we have ministers and members resigning should they be 
found to have infringed the rules in any way.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much.  Mr Freund, I take it 
there is nothing arising out of that? 
ADV FREUND SC:   No, thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Thank you very much Ms Mazzone 
for coming to assist the Commission.  We appreciate that 
very much.  And if we need you to come back and help with 
anything, we will ask you to come back but we will try and 
10 
not ask you to come back unless there is really a serious 
need. 
MS MAZZONE:   Justice Zondo, whatever you need from me 
I am at your service and I thank you very much for your time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much.  Okay we are going 
to adjourn the proceedings for the day.  Mr Freund, we are 
supposed to talk about what time we start tomorrow.  We 
start at ten or would you suggest half-past nine? 
ADV FREUND SC:   I am entirely free either way.   
CHAIRPERSON:   We did not get to one witness that you 
20 
had planned for today.  Is that right? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Well, yes.  But then I was always 
concerned that we would not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And her evidence will be considerable

quicker than the evidence that we have heard today. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Chair, I mean, certainly 09:30 would 
be fine with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   As you wish. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. And the ...[intervenes]  
ADV FREUND SC:   I understand we are going to be losing

CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, we will not be able to sit on 
Wednesday and tomorrow we will have to adjourn a little 
earlier than usual but we could start earlier than ten.  But in 
terms of your witnesses.  I think the one witness you suspect 
might take about two hours? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Judge, I have difficulty in answering 
your questions right now.  I need to think about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.  That is fine. 
ADV FREUND SC:   But if we want to adjourn.  My 
suggestion is we adjourn early we should start early and 
20 
whatever time you think is a convenient starting time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, let us start at half-past nine 
tomorrow, tomorrow morning.  Okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Good. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And your witnesses for tomorrow, do you

want to announce them for the benefit of the public? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Give me a moment.  I do not have this 
list immediately to hand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   But I am certainly hoping to start with 
Ms Rantho. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Reference has been made. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Ja-no, 
that 
is 
fine. 
 
The 
others

ADV FREUND SC:   I can clarity with the secretariat the 
names of the others who I anticipate ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you could announce them in the 
morning when we start who the others will be.  Okay alright.  
We are going to adjourn now and tomorrow we start at half-
past nine.  We adjourn.
