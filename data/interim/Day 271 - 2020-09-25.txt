PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 25 SEPTEMBER 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Pretorius, good 
morning everybody. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let us start. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Ja we ask to call Mr Mosebenzi 
Zwane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  He is present. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Will 
you 
administer 
the 
oath 
or 
10 
affirmation? 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MR ZWANE:  Mosebenzi Joseph Zwane. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections to taking the 
prescribed affirmation? 
MR ZWANE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you solemnly affirm that the evidence 
you will give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing 
else but the truth; if so please raise your right hand and 
say, I truly affirm. 
20 
MR ZWANE:  I truly affirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.    Mr Zwane I know 
that you had requested through your attorneys that you be 
allowed by the commission to come to the commission and 
deal with all the issues that may relate to you but the 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 4 of 198 
 
request could not be granted because of simply the way 
the commission operates.   
The commission would have liked that everyone 
comes before it once and deal with all issues but it is not 
practical most of the time because in regard to people like 
you your name is mentioned in different work-streams of 
the commission and there are different teams working in 
different work-streams.   
So I just want you to know that I am aware you 
made that request and that it was considered but there are 
10 
challenges.   
But you would have seen also that there are many 
other people who have come before the commission more 
than once to deal with issues I am sure.  Thank you.  Mr 
Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Zwane you 
have before a bundle; Bundle FS12 do you have that 
bundle?  If you would go to page 459 of that bundle 
please.   
MR ZWANE:  459? 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes please.  Right.  That appears to 
be a sworn statement of yourself, correct?  That document 
goes through to page 508 where there is a signature. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you explained to the black – to him 
the black numbers and the red numbers. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 5 of 198 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes we have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Just to remind you Mr Zwane the 
black numbers in the top left hand corner.   
MR ZWANE:  500 and? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  8.  There is a signature there; 
whose signature is that? 
MR ZWANE:  Chair this is the signature belonging to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I am sorry Mr Pretorius what is the 
page you referred him to? 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  508.  I trust it is the same page in 
your bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes well I am asking because I see his 
statement at 459 on my – on my bundle.  So let me go to 
508.  Yes okay alright. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That is your signature on page 508? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The sworn statement from page 459 
and continuing to page 508 is that your sworn statement? 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  As far as you are concerned the 
contents of that statement are they true and correct? 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  There is one more document which 
is part of the same exhibit.  Chair and before admitting the 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 6 of 198 
 
exhibit perhaps we should go there?  If you go to page 
615.  Do you have it? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That document is a document 
headed Reply to questions from E Lambrechts dated 10 
June.  What happened was the investigators asked certain 
questions of you and you replied to these questions in this 
document.  There is a signature at page 165 of that 
document – sorry page 622 of that document.  The last 
page in the bundle.   
10 
MR ZWANE:  That is my signature. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That is your signature.  And the 
answers were they not in a sworn statement to the 
questions contained in this document; are they true and 
correct? 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Those documents Chair form part of 
Exhibit UU9 may they be admitted please? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well there is first the statement or 
affidavit 
starting 
at 
page 
459. 
 
That 
affidavit 
is 
a 
20 
standalone 
affidavit 
but 
has 
certain 
annexures 
[not 
audible]. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do the annexures include the response – 
the replies to the questions that you have just dealt with at 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 7 of 198 
 
the end or does that document stand alone? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  No Chair that is why I referred to it 
separately.  The affidavit pre-dates the reply to the 
questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So that would mean that the 
affidavit and its annexures would be an exhibit on its own 
and then that reply would be separate exhibit on its own. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes together with the questions so 
perhaps that should be Exhibit UU10. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I think we should – we should identify 
10 
the document that contains the questions as well because 
then it would also be a document on its own.  I think it 
seems to start at page 609 is that right? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let us start with the – the affidavit 
or statement starting at page 459.  You propose that that 
should be admitted – should be marked Exhibit UU8? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  UU9 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  UU9.  Mr Mosebenzi Joseph Zwane’s 
affidavit starting at page 459 is admitted and together with 
20 
its annexures will be marked Exhibit UU9.  And then I think 
the next one would be the document with the – with – 
which posed certain questions to him that is – is it at 609?  
Yes.  The document which appears or starts at page 609 is 
admitted and will be marked Exhibit UU? 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 8 of 198 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  10. 
CHAIRPERSON:  10. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That is the document that goes 
through to page 622. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The questions and answers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And then … 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I was suggesting Chair that the 
questions and answers be admitted together – part of the 
same Exhibit. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not think so because they are not 
written by the same person.  I think the… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well that is fine Chair then 609 to 
page 614 will be Exhibit UU10. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And then the – and then Mr Zwane’s 
reply to those questions starting at page 615. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will be admitted and marked Exhibit 
UU11? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  11. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  11.  Ja okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Chair I have just been told by those 
that are responsible for this task that there is already an 
Exhibit UU10. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we will – may need to make it … 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 9 of 198 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  9A and 9B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So we will change then the document 
starting at page 609 which were the questions that were 
sent to Mr Zwane’s attorneys.  We will amend that it will be 
marked Exhibit UU9A.  And the document containing Mr 
Zwane’s response to that starting at page 615 will marked 
Exhibit UU9B. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  You may proceed Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Zwane your 
10 
affidavit which has just been admitted and the answers to 
the question deal with a number of topics as we now know.  
The purpose of the questions today however is to deal only 
with the housing project that occurred during 2010 and 
2011 in the Free State and at that time you were MEC for 
the department which went through various name changes 
but we have referred to it as the Department of Human 
Settlements.  Is that correct? 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We know that the facts underlying 
20 
the housing project through that period have been the 
subject matter of a number of investigations and many of 
those 
facts 
correct 
or 
incorrect 
in 
fact 
are 
public 
knowledge, we know that.  Correct? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes Chair. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 10 of 198 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  However, there are two issues that 
we would like to concentrate on and have concentrated on 
largely at least in this week of evidence and that is the 
context within which the advance payment project took 
place and that is the housing contracts or lack thereof in 
the 
first 
place 
and 
the 
second 
is 
the 
question 
of 
accountability.  And it is really those that – those issues 
that we will be largely covering.  There was during 2010 
and 2011 a Public Procurement Process that was embarked 
upon by the department and that involved a tender for the 
10 
construction of houses in the Free State Province, correct? 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The funding for that project – that 
housing project would have come from the National Fiscus, 
correct? 
MR ZWANE:  Correct Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And the funding was controlled – 
granted in the first place and controlled in the second 
place by the Provisions of the Division of Revenue Act we 
have referred to it as DORA.  Correct? 
20 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Other prescripts as well but 
that one in addition.  It was necessary as I understand it to 
go out on a new tender process for the construction of 
houses because a decision had been made by the Premier 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 11 of 198 
 
and the Cabinet that the houses should be larger than 
originally planned.  Is that correct? 
MR ZWANE:  Well Chair I think the two are separated.  
Normally each year the Department of Human Settlement 
as it was called by then would actually build houses.  The 
issue of bigger and better houses was a separate issue 
added to a normal process that would be followed when 
building houses in terms of the data base.  I was informed 
when I was there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright well let us just deal with the 
10 
facts briefly and by way of introduction to the questions 
that we would like to put to you Mr Zwane.  There was in 
fact a Public Procurement Process that took place in the 
first half of the 2010/2011 financial year. 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What happened is that at the time 
the bids – the various bids that were presented by various 
contractors were presented and adjudicated the tender 
period – the tender validity period had expired.  Correct? 
MR ZWANE:  As I was told Chair. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And a decision was then made to 
abandon that process.  Were you told that as well? 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can keep your microphone on Mr 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 12 of 198 
 
Zwane. 
MR ZWANE:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We know that the tender closed on 
the 16 April 2020 all that is part of the evidence and the 
really public record.  That the bid adjudication committee 
considered the bids and the evidence has been that a 
number of bids were disqualified.  Let me just put the 
numbers to you for the record.   
According to the information that we have and the 
evidence that we have received 361 bids were received.  
10 
105 were disqualified for basic bid compliance reasons.  
147 were disqualified because they did not meet the 
minimum functionality threshold.  109 bids of the 361 
including 81 from established contractors and 28 from 
emerging 
contractors 
were 
recommended 
to 
the 
bid 
adjudication committee to be adjudicated on price.   
Right and that was the results of the bid evaluation 
committee’s work.  They categorised the bids and sent 
them on to the bid adjudication committee which then met 
on the 28 July 2010.   
20 
Now you may not recall the figures but that is the 
evidence.  Are you happy to accept that? 
MR ZWANE:  Well I do not know that evidence Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
MR ZWANE:  It was not brought to my attention. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 13 of 198 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well that is in fact the evidence.  
The bid adjudication committee then met on the 28 July 
2010 and at that meeting it was noted that the tender 
validity period had lapsed.  That committee resolved that 
the tender should be cancelled and a data base of service 
providers and I presume a new data base of service 
providers should be established.  Correct? 
MR ZWANE:  As I was told Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  As you were told.  Now the first 
question which arises is I presume that throughout this 
10 
process you were receiving reports in your capacity as 
MEC for Human Settlements as to this process, were you? 
MR ZWANE:  No Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You were not? 
MR ZWANE:  I was not. I was expecting a final report on 
the final outcome because that would determine the date of 
us starting the building of houses. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  By 28 July 2010 it must 
have been of some concern to you that no houses had yet 
been built under the allocation that had been granted for 
20 
that year? 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Were you told that the Public 
Tender Process had been abandoned and that a data base 
would be created? 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 14 of 198 
 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And did you agree to that process? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes I did – I did agree to the process. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Now why was the tender 
process simply abandoned and not corrected? 
MR ZWANE:  I may not know the details Chair but when I 
asked what is going to be the difference I was told that the 
data base has been used by previous MEC’s before me to 
construct houses so there will be no issue at all about the 
data base. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well this is a new contract.  It is to 
build different houses.  The contract required a process to 
be embarked upon. 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct Chair but you will remember 
earlier on I indicated that the two processes were not 
categorised under the same kind of understanding.  The 
process of the tender of building houses was as a normal 
tender which will be entered into year by year.  And the 
process of building – building bigger houses was not going 
to be part of the specification that were done in terms of 
20 
calling for a tender of building houses.  As far as I can 
remember. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes but we know do we not Mr 
Zwane that this new data base comprised of the parties 
who had bid in the new tender process in 2010.  So these 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 15 of 198 
 
were new entrants onto the scene and they were being 
allowed onto the scene without any formal tender process 
having being embarked upon in respect of their admission 
at least. 
MR ZWANE:  Let me say after the tender was abandoned 
and the data base was followed there were requirements 
that were made by EXCO which is the executive of Free 
State that our data base should include categories that 
were not there before some of them.   
It should include young people that would of course 
10 
come in with less experience or no experience at all.  It 
should include the disabled which were not there earlier 
on.  It should also pick on women which were there but in a 
smaller number.   
Of course the experienced that were there all these 
years and it should also consider the geographical spread 
of the Province because the Province is divided into five 
regions if I recall well.   
And those were the issues that the data base has – 
had to consider and surly considering those issues indeed 
20 
there would be new entrants in the data base Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright let us go back a step.  The 
first group of contractors that formed this new data base 
that 
was 
established 
in 
2010 
would 
have 
been 
the 
contractors who bid during the lawful tender process, 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 16 of 198 
 
correct? 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That included those who were 
disqualified during the course of that process.  Correct? 
MR ZWANE:  I did not go to those details Chair.  All what I 
requested from the Accounting Officer and the officials is 
that as they compiled the data base they should look into 
these categories and of course they would go back and 
look at the tender that was abandoned.  Not only that the 
data base had also experienced contractors I want to 
10 
believe that may not have been in this tender process. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well that is the evidence.  Are you 
saying you were unaware of the inclusion of disqualified 
bidders on the data base? 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So this happened despite the fact 
that you appeared to have controlled the process this 
happened without your knowledge? 
MR ZWANE:  I did not control the process Chair.  The 
process was required to be approved by me but the details 
20 
in terms of how the data base was compiled I gave the 
feedback from EXCO and allowed the officials to do that 
and bring the product to me. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well did you ask them how this data 
base was eventually composed? 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 17 of 198 
 
MR ZWANE:  I cannot exactly recall that Chair but what I 
recall is that when the data base – when the final list from 
the data base was presented to me I had to go through it 
and checking what I have requested them to try and comply 
with because that was the decision by the EXCO. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright so the EXCO that is chaired 
by the Premier? 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The EXCO said that a new data 
base must be composed or compiled.  It must comply with 
10 
certain requirements and that instruction was passed onto 
you I understand.  Is that correct? 
MR ZWANE:  The EXCO said that the – the data base that 
we 
are 
going 
to 
be 
developing 
should 
take 
into 
consideration the categories as I have said them which 
may actually in – in a nutshell be called the previously 
disadvantaged. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Alright.  You were given an 
instruction by the Provincial EXCO which is a committee of 
the 
Provincial 
Cabinet 
chaired 
by 
the 
Premier 
Mr 
20 
Magashule, correct? 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You were told to compile a new data 
base 
that 
complied 
with 
certain 
requirements 
communicated to you, is that correct? 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 18 of 198 
 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You then gave those instructions to 
officials to compose this data base of bidders in their 
discretion. 
MR ZWANE:  The officials which were there Chair have 
been long in that department.  It is them that would 
actually take me through the processes as they did when 
the –when the tender failed. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
MR ZWANE:  And I could not dictate to them in terms of 
10 
the nitty gritty’s because from where I was seated that was 
an administrative issue. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The point I am making, is that these 
nitty-gritties were quite important.  These were the decisions 
that decided or resulted in people being admitted to the 
database.  A discretion of an official, not an open tender 
process.  Correct? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And did they report to you as to how 
they exercised their discretion? 
20 
MR ZWANE:   No, they did not. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did no one say to you but you 
cannot do it this way? 
MR ZWANE:   No. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You cannot give contracts for the 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 19 of 198 
 
expenditure of state funds for the construction of houses 
without going through a proper procurement process.  Did no 
one say that to you?   
MR ZWANE:   It is them that suggested Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Who?  The officials? 
MR ZWANE:   The officials.  That throughout the years the 
database 
has 
been 
used 
in 
the 
department 
by 
my 
predecessors and as a newcomer I agreed with that process 
for as long as it was going to help us move forward, building 
houses. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes but here Mr Zwane, this is a new 
database.   
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It has been created after a tender 
process has been abandoned, correct? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It has been populated at the 
discretion of officials although guidelines have been given to 
you by cabinet.  Correct? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No formal tender process, therefore, 
would proceed the granting of a contractor any particular 
contractor on the database, correct? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That is unlawful.  Were you never 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 20 of 198 
 
aware of that? 
MR ZWANE:   No, I was not aware of it.  As I have said 
earlier on, I was told that this has been the process that has 
been followed.  I even asked, based on what, is it a PFMA 
process?  They told me it is a process under Housing Act. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Who told you that? 
MR ZWANE:   The officials. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Which officials?  Can you name 
them? 
MR ZWANE:   The HOD at that particular time was 
10 
...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Is Mokoena? 
MR ZWANE:   Mpho Mokoena.  The CFO was Ms Seipati 
Dlamini.  Those were the anchor in terms of the department.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So you say Mr Mokoena and Ms 
Dlamini told you that it was perfectly in order to just create a 
database at the discretion of officials without going through 
a formal tender process before construction contracts were 
awarded?  And you believed them? 
MR ZWANE:   They said to me, the database, as I was 
20 
interrogating, 
should 
be 
advertised 
through 
different 
processes but the database has been used all these years 
before I arrived.  So I believed that because I was not there 
Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes but you are talking about a 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 21 of 198 
 
database that preceded your arrival as MEC, correct? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In 2010/2011.  We are talking about 
a new database.   
MR ZWANE:   In my understanding Chair, as I was informed, 
the database of the previous years would have followed what 
the officials followed when they were developing a database 
of 2010. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  Well, we are not looking at that 
for the moment because we know that in the 2010/2011 new 
10 
database, new contractors were admitted.  Correct? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   There is no evidence of any formal 
tender process, public procurement process and I stress 
public procurement process, having been followed.  Now you 
say that you were assured by officials that this was lawful.  
Did you check that? 
MR ZWANE:   No, I did not check it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me ask this question.  Before the 
tender process that was abandoned, was there, to your 
20 
knowledge, a database of contractors that the department 
was keeping? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and ...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   I was told. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 22 of 198 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is how you were told? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then there was a tender, an open 
tender process, that was embarked upon with special 
reference to the 2010/2011 allocation? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that process was then... that process, 
before it was abandoned, had included a determination by 
the 
relevant 
committee 
of 
who 
met 
the 
minimum 
requirements among those who put in bids and who could... 
10 
who could see that.  Is that right? 
MR ZWANE:   That is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So there were those who were disqualified 
because they did not meet the minimum requirements and 
there were those were judged as eligible in meeting those 
requirements.  Is that right? 
MR ZWANE:   That is right, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And then the... then that process 
was abandoned because, as I understand it from other 
witnesses who have come before you, the tender period had 
20 
expired.  Is that right? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now the discussion about a 
database, as I understand it, it may be a new database, 
seems to have happened after the open tender process has 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 23 of 198 
 
been abandoned.  Is that right? 
MR ZWANE:   That is right, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In terms of what you were told or in terms 
of your understanding, the contractors who would be on the 
database that was contemplated when the... when you gave 
instructions to the officials after being instructed by the 
executive council, who was it going to include?   
 
Was it going to include those who may have been on the 
database before the open tender process happened and 
those who had put in bids in response to the open tender 
10 
process.  What was your understanding who would be 
included in the database that was being contemplated? 
MR ZWANE:   Well, as I said earlier on Chair, the detail that 
the Chair is talking about in terms of the numbers, who 
qualified, who did not qualify was not brought to me.   
 
The information that is presented to me... I would have 
said to the officials:  Go, develop a database of those who 
qualify.  Bring it to me.   
 
Let us go through it together and just check whether the 
criteria that the Exco has requested us to align our ourselves 
20 
with has been met.  And then approve the database and start 
the building of the houses. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
But 
obviously 
you 
had 
a 
certain 
understanding 
when Exco 
effectively 
gave 
you certain 
instruction about this... about the compilation of a database.  
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 24 of 198 
 
Was your understanding that this was going to be a newly 
created database? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair.  That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay.  And was your understanding... 
what was your understanding as to who would qualify to be 
in this database that Exco asked you to ask the official to put 
together? 
MR ZWANE:   The process of tendering, as this process was 
starting, was a process that I welcomed as an MEC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR ZWANE:   The process was not abandoned because of 
me.  It was abandoned because of these reasons that 
officials have put here.  It was not controlled by me(?).   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR ZWANE:   I then went back and asked:  Are you going to 
re-advertise the tender?  Then I was told that no there is a 
database that has been used by previous MEC’s that were 
here before you and it is pretty legal.   
 
Then I requested the officials to go through and develop 
that database and bring the final product so that we check 
20 
the criteria that Exco has set for us and approve the list.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Was your understanding that in creating 
that database, the officials were limited to the contractors 
who were already on the database of the department?  Was 
your understanding that they were not limited to those 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 25 of 198 
 
contractors?  They could actually go out of that database 
and 
bring 
in 
who... 
bring 
into 
the 
database 
other 
contractors? 
MR ZWANE:   My expectation Chair was that where they 
meet up with hiccups that will require them to go outside the 
law ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The system database. 
MR ZWANE:   Ja.  They would come back and report so that 
we find a solution to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR ZWANE:   But if they bring a database, as I have 
requested, and I check that the database is according to the 
criteria that we have set, I approve that database. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay.  So would it be correct therefore 
to say maybe subject to whatever requirements, the officials 
were not limited in any way in terms of who they could put on 
the list on the database? 
MR ZWANE:   I may not know that detail Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Because in their presentation, they have been 
20 
dealing with this database. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   They knew how to go about dealing with this 
database ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 26 of 198 
 
MR ZWANE:   ...in a manner that is within the prescripts of 
the law. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   So I expected officials to go and follow that 
procedure and bring the final product to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But in the end, whatever list you were 
given, you accepted that in could be... it could include 
contractors who had not been in the database of the 
department before.   
 
In other words, when new entrance into the database.  
10 
Of course, you expected that you wanted to see contractors 
that were run or owned by women, people will disabilities 
and young people included in that list as well. 
MR ZWANE:   Those people who will meet the criteria as 
said by Exco ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   ...in my thinking ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   ...and my understanding ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR ZWANE:   ...were part of the people who had tendered. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   And when the tender was abandoned, it means 
those people who were part of this scope because I have not 
even seen the database before which was in existence. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 27 of 198 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR ZWANE:   So when I said they should go back and when 
they brought the final product to me, I thought they were 
able to find everybody they need in terms of the criteria 
within the prescripts of the law. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  I thought that last part, you were 
going to say within the group of contractors who were either 
already on the database or who had put in bids, but that is 
not what you mean because I think you did say they could 
get somebody who... other people who were inside who had 
10 
not put in bids and who were not on the database already.  Is 
that right? 
MR ZWANE:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You had no problem if somebody, if they 
brought a contractor or contractors who had not put in bids 
and who had been on the database of the department, as 
long as they enhanced the issues that you had... that Exco 
had been concerned about, namely women, people with 
disabilities and young people. 
MR ZWANE:   I would definitely have asked them what 
20 
criteria they follow ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   They followed, ja. 
MR ZWANE:   ...in getting these people outside. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR ZWANE:   I would have definitely raised that question. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 28 of 198 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It seems then that during 2010, in 
fact, in April 2010, a lawful public procurement process was 
embarked upon by the department in order to identify 
contractors who will build low-cost housing in the Free State 
Province.  That we have established.  Correct? 
MR ZWANE:   According to my knowledge Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   As they... as that was reported to me. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes alright.  We have several 
10 
witnesses who said that it is a matter of public record.  That 
process was abandoned for whatever reason.  That is also a 
matter 
of 
public 
record 
now. 
 
You 
know 
about 
its 
abandonment, correct? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The resolution of that situation is 
one aspect that we will deal with.  The other aspect is I 
understand that cabinet or the Exco of the provincial cabinet 
made a decision that a new database should be created, 
comprising 
of 
people 
from 
various 
categories. 
 
That 
20 
instruction was then given to you.  Correct? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And on receipt of that instruction you 
instructed your officials to populate the database but they 
did so in their discretion under your instruction, correct? 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 29 of 198 
 
MR ZWANE:   No, that is not correct Chair.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   How would they identify it? 
MR ZWANE:   On receipt ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And who identified it? 
MR ZWANE:   On receipt of the instruction by Exco, I went 
back to my officials.  I related this... the instruction.  A 
tender process was opened and later abandoned because of 
the reasons that have been given here to date, the reasons 
not caused by me.   
 
Then after the process I requested a report in terms of a 
10 
way forward.  That is when this issue of a database was 
raised to me by the officials.  I did not ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   By? 
MR ZWANE:   By the officials, the HOD.  I did not ask a 
database from nowhere.  The issue was brought to me.  It 
was given to me as an information that the department has 
been following all these years a database in building houses.  
And I then requested them to develop that database, taking 
into consideration a criteria that Exco has requested us to 
follow. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So who would go out and identify 
contractors to put them on the database by applying the 
criteria given to you by Exco? 
MR ZWANE:   That function is a function that is assigned to 
the accounting officer, held by his or her senior officials 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 30 of 198 
 
Chair.  That is why I committed(?) it and settled it with him. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So in the discretion of the HOD, on 
your evidence, and in the discretion of officials who reported 
to the HOD, contractors would be identified and put on the 
database? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And you were informed that that was 
entirely legal? 
MR ZWANE:   That is what I was told. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was your understanding of the 
10 
implications or the facts of a contractor being put on the 
database, for example, in terms of being given a contract or 
a job? 
MR ZWANE:   I did ask that question Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR ZWANE:   You will remember I responded to that 
question earlier on that when I asked that question, I was 
even told that what was being followed is the act that is 
called the Housing Act and this...  
 
The development of new database have been a process 
20 
that was undertaken before I arrived.   
 
And having that information, I could not detect that 
particular time anything illegal about this process because I 
am told by the person who has been there about... who has 
spent 15-years with this process and nobody has challenged 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 31 of 198 
 
this process before. 
 
And he says, this is the process that we have been 
following.  Then I gave them permission to follow that 
process and develop a database as they would normally do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that Mr Mokoena who was HOD who 
told you that? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So he is the person who said, we can use 
a database as opposed to an open-tender process to award 
contracts? 
10 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you said that there was something 
that was... could be done under the Housing Act? 
MR ZWANE:   He said that it is something that they have 
been doing ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR 
ZWANE: 
 
 
...all 
these 
years 
with 
the 
previous 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   MEC’s. 
MR ZWANE:   ...MEC’s before me. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I thought you also said, he said doing 
things that way was what was provided for in the Housing 
Act. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 32 of 198 
 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair.  That is what I said. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That what you said. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Okay.  But in going back to my 
question.  I understand what you have just said and it is 
important.  Was your understanding that once a person or a 
contractor had been placed on the database in this manner 
that was suggested by Mr Mokoena, there would... they 
could then be given jobs by the department without any 
further 
process 
or 
public 
process? 
 
Or 
was 
your 
10 
understanding that there could or there would still be some 
open competitive process? 
MR ZWANE:   My understanding is that they would develop 
this database.  After the database is developed, then the 
people will be brought forward.  Those who have not... no 
capacity, the department will devise means to be able to 
capacitate them in the process of developing, the moving 
forward but work would start. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So your understanding was that, once they 
were on the database, then subject to the department 
helping some who needed to be capacitated and so on, 
subject to that, they would be given work? 
MR ZWANE:   That was the understanding which was given 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 33 of 198 
 
to me Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that was given by Mr Mokoena? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Under your watch Mr Zwane, 
R 1.4 billion was allocated for the construction of low-cost 
housing.  Correct? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I would imagine that wherever the 
execution of particular tasks lay that as MEC you would be 
10 
accountable for the lawful of the expenditure of that money.  
Let alone the efficient and successful expenditure of that 
money, correct? 
MR ZWANE:   My duty, according to the law Chair, was to 
receive reports in terms of the expenditure of that money.  
The 
accounting 
officer 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
management of the finances of the department in an 
effective and efficient manner. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And lawful. 
MR ZWANE:   And any unauthorised expenditure, he had all 
20 
the right to actually stop or allow it.  If he allows it... In fact, 
the law says, when there is any instruction given even by the 
authority that has financial implications, that instruction 
should be given in writing.   
 
And the accounting officer, if he or she does not agree 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 34 of 198 
 
with that decision, must in writing advise the authority that 
that decision can actually have the unauthorised issues.   
 
If the executive persuade or instruct further that this 
decision, unlawful decision should be done, that should be 
reported by the accounting officer to National Treasury, 
Provincial Treasury if we are in the province and the office of 
the Auditor General to ensure that he covers himself.   
 
Those, according to law, are the powers given to the 
accounting officer.  So if I get a report from the accounting 
officer that says that we are still on tract on this matter, I 
10 
interrogate the report in terms of my knowledge and if I am 
satisfied and he is happy about the report, then we continue.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  Well, two questions arise.  
The first is, that this has been put to Mr Mokoena that he 
was the accounting officer and he was, to use the term, 
accountable in terms of the Public Finance Management Act 
for what happened under his watch.  Correct? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Is there any explanation as to why 
he 
was 
not 
held 
accountable 
for 
what 
happened 
in 
20 
2010/2011? 
MR ZWANE:   Well, Chair I must indicate that until I left the 
department in 2011, this matter of the illegality of the 
database had not been brought to the fore by anyone.  The 
instructions which would have brought this thing to my 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 35 of 198 
 
attention was Treasury and the audit report and...  
 
So at no stage I had ignored it as far as I can remember.  
A report that points to that direction that this issue has to be 
attended to and then I ignore.  No.  I do not recall myself 
ignoring such a report Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Have it been drawn to your attention 
that anything in the course of the execution of public 
procurement during 2010/2011 was unlawful, what would you 
have done? 
MR ZWANE:   I would have acted ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   How? 
MR ZWANE:   ...on the report based on the seriousness of 
what has happened which is illegal.  The people who were 
advising me, the accounting officer is head of the pack, 
would have accounted for whatever irregularity. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay but what would you have done 
as MEC had you been told during the course of 2010/2011 
that what was being done within the department was illegal?  
What would you have done? 
MR ZWANE:   We would have stopped it. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You would have stopped it? 
MR ZWANE:   Ja, I would have stopped it immediately Chair.  
My interest was not that much in the names of the people 
appearing on the database.  My interest, as I related it to the 
officials, was that there should be service delivery on the 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 36 of 198 
 
ground as we had promised people.   
 
Remember, according to the PFMA, my role is to take 
the needs of the majority of the people and serve.  Turn that 
needs, those needs into a policy, determine the outcomes 
and hand it over to the accounting officer for implementation 
and the determination of the outputs.  I would have done 
exactly that Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, as I understand, you describing 
the role of an MEC, it is a matter of formulating policy and 
then handing it to the officials for the execution of that 
10 
policy.  Very broadly speaking, that is how you described it.  
Do I understand that correctly? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Just to summarise so we 
can move forward.  Mr Zwane, we have two things occurring 
in the procurement process in the Free State in 2010/2011.  
First, we have a public procurement process which is 
abandoned and the creation of a new database, correct? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Second, we have a decision from 
20 
Exco saying that various categories of persons must be 
identified and placed onto a database, correct? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That latter instruction from Exco 
went via to you to the officials in your department.  Am I 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 37 of 198 
 
correct? 
MR ZWANE:   To just set the record straight.  Exco is 
attended by both the MEC and the executive but in terms of 
the responsibility of the implementation of the Exco decision, 
the MEC will have to carry that responsibility to go back to 
Exco. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Zwane.  You might have to 
clarify something.  You have just made a statement that Exco 
is attended by both the MEC and the executive.  Now Exco 
stands for Executive Council.  Those are the MEC’s of the 
10 
provinces and the premier.  Is that right?  That is an Exco? 
MR ZWANE:   That is... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Am I right? 
MR ZWANE:   You are right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So to say Exco is attended by both 
the MECs and the executive, are you referring to the 
HODs? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MR ZWANE:   HODs in the Free State …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, of the different departments. 
MR ZWANE:   Of the department – different departments 
would normally form part of the Exco meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Part of the Exco, yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 38 of 198 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that all the time or only when there 
are certain issues that they need to deal with. 
MR ZWANE:   In the Exco Free State most of the time 
unless the Premier specify that in this Exco we will need 
only the MEC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   But most of the times we both attend. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But just to make sure that we are all on 
the same page when we make – when we use these terms.  
When we talk about Exco, strictly speaking, that is the 
10 
Premier and the MECs only but anyone else who attends 
an Exco meeting attends …[intervenes] 
MR ZWANE:   By invitation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   By invitation.  But otherwise, when you 
say Exco, you are not including HODs, you are talking 
about the Provincial Executive Council but other people 
may be invited and others might have a standing invitation 
to attend unless excluded, is that right? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so when we say Exco we are 
20 
referring to the Premier and his MECs but other people 
may attend on invitation. 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR ZWANE:   The point I was making is that in the Free 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 39 of 198 
 
State …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, most of the time the HODs would 
attend. 
MR ZWANE:   The HODs were part of the standing 
invitation to the Exco. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, okay.  No, that is fine. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The Exco meeting to which you 
have referred, Mr Zwane, more or less when did that take 
place? 
MR ZWANE:   When I may not recall exactly, Chair, but it 
10 
was earlier in the year because in the State of the 
Provincial Address, if I recall well, the Premier of the Free 
State Province announced that the province will be building 
bigger and better houses and immediately after that State 
of the Province Address departments will then pick up what 
they need to do.  Go back and devise means to implement.  
So normally the State of the Province Address is around 
February.  So around February/March, I should think. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And there would be minutes of that 
meeting presumably? 
20 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So that raises a further question, if 
in February/March Exco is saying go and populate a 
database of contractors to build houses in 2010/2011, how 
did it come about that in April a public procurement 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 40 of 198 
 
process was taking place?  It seems that there were two 
parallel processes.  Rather strange. 
MR ZWANE:   Well, Chair, that question I think will be best 
suited to be answered by the accounting officer because 
normally once we as politicians have made a decision, he 
has to implement.  But I must indicate to this Commission 
that after the State of the Province Address, different 
departments must then follow suit in making budget 
statement policy.   
That is a process that is followed by each and every 
10 
department 
and 
after 
that 
process, 
the 
public 
announcement, like in the State of the Province Address by 
departments, 
then 
HODs 
have 
to 
start 
implementing 
according 
to 
the 
budget 
statement 
policy 
of 
the 
department.  In my own thinking is that it could have been 
possible that the time which was wasted was between the 
State of the Province and the budget policy statement of 
the department because I cannot recall exactly when was 
our 
budget 
statement, 
the 
policy, 
the 
date 
of 
that 
statement. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    Well, fortunately we are dealing 
for the moment at least with the Human Settlements 
Department and we are dealing with the procurement 
process.  Do I understand it correctly that prior to April 
2010 there was an instruction given by Exco to the Human 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 41 of 198 
 
Settlements 
Department 
who 
populated 
database 
in 
accordance with certain criteria which were named?  Do I 
understand your evidence correctly? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And at the same time in April 2010 
a 
public 
procurement 
process, 
tender 
process, 
was 
embarked upon to identify contractors for the construction 
of low cost housing in the Free State Province, correct? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you understand that there were 
10 
two parallel processes happening? 
MR ZWANE:   Namely? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   A database is being created which 
is populated under the instruction of Exco at the discretion 
of officials and the HOD on the one hand who could be 
given work.  And on the other hand, a public procurement 
process is taken place where tenderers would be evaluated 
according to certain criteria and then would be given work 
on the basis of that evaluation. 
MR ZWANE:   That is not correct. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, then …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, he is asking for you understanding, 
what was your understanding of it. 
MR ZWANE:   My understanding on this matter, as I have 
said earlier on, is that the first process that went to a point 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 42 of 198 
 
where it was abandoned …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Open tender process? 
MR ZWANE:   It is an open tender process.  It was not a 
parallel process.  It went ahead until it was abandoned.  
When this process was abandoned, I requested for a way 
forward, as I had said earlier on, that is when the issue of 
the database was raised. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, that is something I really would 
like clarification on because earlier on I was under the 
impression 
that 
the 
meeting 
where 
Exco 
gave 
the 
10 
instruction you have talked about was – or took place after 
the open tender process had been abandoned.   
So I thought okay, so it means that Exco was 
updated as to what was happening that the tender process 
was abandoned and then was told that here is a way in 
which it is sought to address the issue and then they make 
their own suggestions.   
But you have, in answer to Mr Pretorius’ questions, 
you have said that meeting actually happened much earlier 
in the year so that does appear on the face of it to suggest 
20 
two 
parallel 
processes 
but 
that 
might 
be 
a 
I 
misunderstanding.  So his question really is how – what did 
it mean to be put on the database when there is an open 
tender 
process 
where 
people 
are 
being 
invited 
– 
contractors are being invited to tender.  That is where I 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 43 of 198 
 
think the question is.  
MR ZWANE:   Let me try and explain it in terms of how I 
understand it, Chair.  The Exco, as the decision chain, did 
not prescribe to the department what way to follow.  What 
Exco requested is that the final product – you may call it a 
list because I think what may be an issue here is this word 
database. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   The final product – let us for the purpose of 
the …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   The final list. 
MR ZWANE:   Ja, let us say it is a final list.  The final list 
must include the criteria that Exco has given. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Has specified. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes.  And Exco does not say to us for the 
final list you must go the route of open tender or database.  
This is what Exco wants, we move, there is an open tender 
that has been abandoned and then an issue of the 
database is raised and that issue is being followed and 
that issue produces a list that Exco has requested. 
20 
 
So 
with 
Exco 
we 
were 
not 
discussing 
the 
mechanism of how to move forward in the production of the 
final list, we were supposed to follow what is within the law 
and once we have done that, Exco – the list will be taken 
to Exco for a check whether the criteria has been followed 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 44 of 198 
 
and we start the process of delivering houses. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So was Exco’s concern that ultimately 
the list that – the list of contractors who would be awarded 
contracts would take account of the requirements that they 
specify.  How that list came about was left to the officials, 
is that right? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why would – if there is an open tender 
process without a database, contractors who wished to put 
in bids would be able to put in bids and that would include 
10 
contractors that were run by women or owned by women – 
contract – and people with disabilities and young people.  
So, in other words, without talking about a database, you 
would still – the open tender process could still produce a 
list that would satisfy the requirements that Exco had in 
mind, is that not so? 
MR ZWANE:   That is so, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So why did Exco not leave the 
whole issue of the final list that has got to them to the 
open tender process that I assume they knew would be 
20 
followed? 
MR ZWANE:   Exco did not stop the open tender, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no, I accept that it did not, at 
least for now. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 45 of 198 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am just asking the question.  They 
must 
have 
known 
that 
in 
order 
for 
the 
Provincial 
Department of Human Settlements to build houses with the 
funding that came from the National Department, this 
conditional allocation, they must have known that an open 
tender public process would be initiated.  Am I right in 
thinking along those lines? 
MR ZWANE:   Well, not entirely, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not entirely. 
MR ZWANE:   Taking into account that we were told – and 
10 
this is what I related also to Exco. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   That there has been a process that was 
followed by this department throughout all these years. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To use the database without an open 
tender? 
MR ZWANE:   To use the database, ja.  Ja, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, so – because I must have I 
misunderstood, earlier on I thought you were told that after 
the abandonment of the open tender process when you 
20 
were asking for the way forward, but from what you say you 
were told actually even before the open tender process 
was initiated, is that right? 
MR ZWANE:   Told by…? 
CHAIRPERSON:   The officials. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 46 of 198 
 
MR ZWANE:   I am saying I was new in Exco, there were 
MECs who have been there before myself.  They knew 
these processes, that is why I am saying not entirely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What you have just – what you have told 
me is that in terms of what Exco knew, you said it was not 
– I was not entirely correct to think that Exco would have 
known that he building of houses would be preceded by an 
open tender process and then you said because they also 
10 
knew and you told them that you had been informed that in 
the past the database had been used instead of an open 
tender process.  That is my understanding of what you 
said, am I right? 
MR ZWANE:   I told them after I was told by the official 
after 
the 
tender 
– 
open 
tender 
process 
had 
been 
abandoned. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, you only told Exco about 
what the – about the use of the database in the place of an 
open tender after the tender process had been abandoned. 
20 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Prior to the open tender process 
happening, being initiated, were you aware of that position 
irrespective of your source of information, namely that 
before you – the department did – or would sometimes use 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 47 of 198 
 
the database in the place of an open tender process to 
award contracts? 
MR ZWANE:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not know that? 
MR ZWANE:   No, I did not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Do you know whether Exco knew 
that at the time they gave the instructions about the 
database? 
MR ZWANE:    On this I presume that on the strength that 
some of my colleagues have been there. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   And I was told that these processes have 
been taking place. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   All these years. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   I presume that some of my colleagues in the 
Exco knew. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  So going back to what Exco 
contemplated would happen, because you were part of 
Exco, when it gave instructions about the creation of a 
database, I was suggesting to you that Exco would have 
known that before the department would award contracts 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 48 of 198 
 
for the building of houses there would be an open tender 
process.  Is my thinking of what they knew correct? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is correct. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now the question that arises, is if they 
knew that there was going to be an open tender process 
where everyone would be invited to put in bids if they 
could build houses, why did they not leave the question of 
the list to be determined through that process rather than 
10 
say then the department must create a database that would 
take care of the requirements that they specified.  Why was 
that necessary? 
MR ZWANE:   Chair, I thought I tried to explain this before, 
that …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you may have tried and I did not 
understand.  Please try again. 
MR ZWANE:   Ja, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   Let me give it a try again, Chair.  Exco was 
20 
interested in the final product, that is the list.  I may have 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you said that, ja. 
MR ZWANE:   …this database before.  They were only 
interested in the final product, which is the final list and 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 49 of 198 
 
that the process of obtaining the final list was a process of 
the department.   
That is why the department followed an open tender 
until it was abandoned.  And when this process was 
abandoned, I asked for a way forward not from Exco but 
from my official.  That is when the issue of a database was 
raised.  And after some explanation we agreed that a 
database should be followed.   
I reported at that moment to Exco because I had to 
report progress in terms of when are we building houses.  I 
10 
reported that there has been this issue and here are the 
reasons and this is the way forward as suggested and Exco 
agreed with that way forward. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That way forwarded being …[intervenes] 
MR ZWANE:   Database. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Using the database in the place of an 
open tender process? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, that has been abandoned. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That had been abandoned, yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the meeting of Exco that happened 
prior to the initiation of the public tender process, is there 
a meeting at which – that is prior to the initiation of the 
open tender process, is there a meeting at which Exco 
talked about a database for the department because 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 50 of 198 
 
initially, what you have just told me, is in accordance with 
my initial understanding of what you were saying. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But then there was a time when you 
were answering certain of Mr Pretorius’ questions and I 
understood you to be saying Exco actually gave that 
instruction not long after the State of the Province 
Address. 
MR ZWANE:   That was in connection with the statement of 
bigger and better houses, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR ZWANE:   That statement was made in the State of the 
Province Address.  In the State of the Province Address 
the details of open tender database are not part of that 
State of the Province Address.  It was the size of the 
houses, the – in look of the houses because …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The size and the quality. 
MR ZWANE:   Ja, size and quality aspects like ceiling and 
bath inside.  Those were the issues that were announced in 
around February/March, as I have said to Mr Pretorius.  
20 
Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But my question is whether there was a 
meeting of Exco that took place after the State of the 
Province Address but before the initiation of the open 
tender process at which Exco gave an instruction that the 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 51 of 198 
 
department should put together a database or was there no 
such meeting where such a thing was said? 
MR ZWANE:   No, I cannot recall that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so the only time when you talked 
to – when you have testified about Exco giving instructions 
that the department should compile a database, that is 
after the open tender process had been abandoned. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Thank you.  Mr Pretorius, 
I see that we are at nearly twenty five past.  Do you want 
10 
to ask questions before we take the adjournment? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Take the short adjournment, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Let us take 
the tea 
adjournment, we will resume at twenty to twelve.  We 
adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us continue. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you Chair.  It will help us 
move forward Mr Zwane if we got the sequence of events 
20 
right.   You spoke about an EXCO meeting towards the 
beginning of the year before April 2010, do you recall that? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I understood your evidence earlier 
to be that it was at that meeting that EXCO said establish 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 52 of 198 
 
a database and make sure that certain categories of 
contractor appear on that database.  It seems that I 
understood you wrong, or you were wrong, either, correct? 
MR ZWANE:   But I have since tried to clarify that 
...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So let us clarify that. 
MR ZWANE:   It was the usage of database maybe in a 
confusing way.  I should have said it was in that meeting 
where EXCO said other final list not a database, final list 
should include the categories I have mentioned your young 
10 
people, woman, disabled and the experienced.     
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And that would have been said 
prior to April 2010 to all the HOD’s.  Correct? 
MR ZWANE:   In the presence of all the HOD’s, yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Was it said in reference to housing 
alone or all contracting across the province?  
MR ZWANE:   I cannot just recall the other agenda items 
Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No what I am saying is the interest 
that EXCO had in making sure that the province contracted 
20 
with people for example with disabilities.  Did that apply to 
human settlements or did it apply across the board to all 
provincial departments? 
MR ZWANE:   It applied across the board, Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  We know that after that 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 53 of 198 
 
your department determined to go out on public tender in 
order to populate a category or categories of contractor for 
the award of housing contract.  Correct?    
MR ZWANE:   That is correct Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We know that that tender process 
collapsed.  
MR ZWANE:   That is correct Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The question is why was it not 
reinstated or corrected?  
MR ZWANE:   Well that was supposed to be the furnishing 
10 
of the accounting officer as he was the one who in the first 
place initiated it and as it collapsed, we were not involved 
as politicians in terms of this collapse.  As I have said 
earlier on I requested to know the way forward after the 
abandonment of the open tender that is when this issue of 
the database was raised.     
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Does the housing code give the 
MEC any responsibilities in respect of procurement that 
you know of?  
MR ZWANE:   I have not seen it myself Chair but from what 
20 
I have been told and what has been happening at least in 
the Free State Province that is correct.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright we will come to the detail 
and we must first establish in relation to your answer to an 
earlier question that it is the Housing Act or the housing 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 54 of 198 
 
code that permits the appointment of contractors via a 
database we will check that and come back to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you proceed Mr Pretorius I am 
not sure that I understood what you were saying is correct 
in your last answer to Mr Pretorius.  He asked a certain 
question and you said you had not seen – about the code 
and you said you had not seen it for yourself but you had 
been told according to what you had been told that is 
correct.  So what is correct?   
MR ZWANE:   It is Chair correct that according to the 
10 
Housing Act the MEC was responsible for the service 
providers that will ultimately construct houses. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Responsible for them meant responsible 
for selecting them or responsible to do what about them? 
As you understood the position.  
MR ZWANE:   As I was told and I then became to 
understand that the final approval of that list will lay with 
the MEC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright.  Mr Pretorius at least 
now I understand what you and Mr Zwane was saying was 
20 
correct.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So far we have early in the year an 
instruction by EXCO to all departments to make sure that 
provincial contracts awarded by the Free State government 
should include people in various categories including 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 55 of 198 
 
matters related to youth, disability and alike.  Correct? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let me just make sure I understand 
I think this part keeps on getting confusing a bit.  Now you 
remember earlier on I asked you the question whether 
there was ever anything of EXCO prior to the initiation of 
the public open tender process in which EXCO said there 
must be a database that met the requirements that you 
have been talking about.  I understood you to be saying 
you could not remember that there was an EXCO meeting 
10 
at which that was said.  Is my understanding of your 
evidence correct?    
MR ZWANE:   That is correct Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so whenever you talk about EXCO 
instructing the department to compile a database or list 
that met the requirements in terms of woman, people with 
disabilities, young people and so on.  You are talking about 
a meeting that happened after the open tender process had 
been abandoned.  
MR ZWANE:   The statement by EXCO in terms of the 
20 
criteria not the database. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR ZWANE:   Has been repeated statement in EXCO 
meetings.  The product of the final list of the department 
that was constructed out of a database.  EXCO was told 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 56 of 198 
 
about it only after the abandonment of the open tender 
process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  So you are saying that prior 
to the initiation of the open tender process EXCO had 
spoken in general terms and said in effect all government 
departments must make sure that their database or their 
list of service providers should meet the requirements that 
we have talked about.    
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair but that issue was like a 
manifesto if I have to times. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, they kept on talking about it this, 
ja.  
MR ZWANE:   This is what we aspired to achieve. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR ZWANE:   As a province. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR ZWANE:   Different departments as you engage into 
activities that will give people work please make sure that 
our aspiration is met, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair I appreciate your assistance 
in this matter but if I could just get a chance to get the 
sequence right.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am going to let you get a chance, I am 
also trying to make sure I follow Mr Pretorius.  
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 57 of 198 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   As I understand your evidence now 
and I am not going to deal with what evidence you have 
given earlier this morning Mr Zwane precisely now.  As I 
understand your evidence prior to April 2010 the EXCO 
gave an instruction to all departments across the board to 
ensure that contracts were given to people in various 
categories.  Correct?    
MR ZWANE:   That is correct.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That was not anything specific for 
housing.  
10 
MR ZWANE:   No.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Nor was it specific for any 
particular process that was embarked upon.   
MR ZWANE:   Correct Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And in particular it was not a 
reference to a database as I understand you now.   
MR ZWANE:   Correct Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I understood you before but the 
record will show what was said and not said before.  26 of 
April comes along and your department and your HOD 
20 
initiate a public procurement process.  Correct?   
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That process collapses.  Correct? 
MR ZWANE:   Correct.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Out of the collapse of that process 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 58 of 198 
 
it is determined to compose a new database.  Is that so? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   After that did EXCO intervene in 
any manner whatsoever to give any instruction or to 
receive any report and comment.  What did EXCO do after 
that?  
MR ZWANE:   We went to EXCO and reported after I met 
with my officials and having been phoned about it, the 
database.  So I reported according to that the open tender 
has been abandoned and this is the new information that I 
10 
have that is going to be followed and that was accepted by 
EXCO.  
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC:   
Did they 
give any further 
instruction? 
MR ZWANE:   No.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So EXCO knew firstly that a 
database had collapsed and secondly that…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The open tender system had collapsed.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, you are quite right Chair I 
should not be adding to the confusion and EXCO knew that 
20 
an open tender process had collapsed and that a new 
database was to be composed.  
MR ZWANE:   That is correct Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And they knew that because you 
reported that to them? 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 59 of 198 
 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And there should be a minute of 
that meeting as well.  When did that meeting take place?  
MR ZWANE:   I cannot remember when but it was after the 
collapse of the open tender process.  I cannot remember 
quite specifically the…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you able to remember the month 
maybe? 
MR ZWANE:   It was well after April 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well after April.  
10 
MR ZWANE:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Could it be October, September? 
MR ZWANE:   Ja, I think earlier than that.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Earlier than that.  
MR ZWANE:   Ja, earlier than that.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well We know that the decision of 
the bid adjudication committee that decided what should 
happen or what should be proposed to happen after the 
collapse of the tender process that meeting took place on 
the 28 t h of July 2010.   
20 
MR ZWANE:   I think it did.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now that decision is recorded and 
if you wish to look at the minutes I am happy for you to do 
so but the minutes of that meeting read:  
“The 
committee 
recommends 
that 
different 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 60 of 198 
 
databases be consolidated and used as a source of 
service 
providers 
i.e. 
departmental 
database, 
provincial centralised database, quadrem database 
as well as the list of suppliers who tendered for this 
tender.” 
Do you recall that?  Do you want to see the document?    
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you look at FS14 it is the bundle 
behind you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There is a bundle – somebody will assist 
10 
you Mr Zwane.  
MR ZWANE:   FS14? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Page 295.  Do you have that page 
there? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, sir, yes I do Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You see under the heading seven 
new matters.   
MR ZWANE:   290…[intervene] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We are in the black numbers, 
20 
FS14, 295.   
MR ZWANE:   295, under? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   New matters.  
MR ZWANE:   Arising from the minutes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Item seven of the minutes.  
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 61 of 198 
 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair item seven new matters, yes.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  The print is small but we 
can struggle through it.  7.1 there is a little arrow marked 
next to it reads:  
“Evaluation of tender - there is a reference – for the 
construction of BNG houses in the Free State 
through project linked.”    
MR ZWANE:   Yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Reads:  
“The Chairperson indicated to the committee that 
10 
the tender has been evaluated but due to the fact 
that the validity of the tender has expired and they 
cannot adjudicate they have to cancel the tender.  
However, in order to spend the money appropriately 
they 
have 
to 
use 
the 
suppliers 
on 
different 
databases.” 
And then the resolution:  
“Cancellation of tender is recommended due to the 
expiry there of.  The committee recommends that 
different databases be consolidated and used as a 
20 
source 
of 
service 
providers 
i.e. 
departmental 
database, provincial centralised database, quadrem 
database as well as the list of all suppliers who 
tendered for this tender.”   
Several points arise out of that minutes Mr Zwane that I 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 62 of 198 
 
would like to ask you about.  The first is that it is apparent 
from this minute that this committee believed that because 
the validity of the tender had expired they had to cancel 
the tender.  It seems that they were of the view that the 
tender had to be cancelled and could not be rectified in 
any way.  I just want to say to you that on our researches 
that is simply an incorrect statement of the law.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I am not sure Mr Pretorius whether 
the minutes can be or should be read as reflecting that 
they thought they were obliged to cancel.        
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   As opposed to just deciding what they 
thought was the correct way forward.    
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The wording is I suppose one could 
use the word I think in different senses.    
CHAIRPERSON:   No, Mr Pretorius on reflection you may 
be right because it says there they have to cancel. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think you may be right they may regard 
themselves as obliged to cancel in the circumstances.   
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, they go further to say however 
in order to spend the money appropriately they have to use 
suppliers on different databases.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so they may have thought that was 
the only way, they could go forward.  
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 63 of 198 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes and if that was what they 
thought they were incorrect.  Were you are of that, did you 
read these minutes? 
MR ZWANE:   As I have said earlier on Chair that the 
details of what was happening administratively was not 
brought to me.   
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
This 
is 
a 
fundamental 
recommendation Mr Zwane it saying no more open tender 
process we throwing that overboard we are just going to 
point people to a database.  That is a fundamental 
10 
procurement decision it is not a matter of administrative 
details.   
MR ZWANE:   As I understand it Chair and I want to repeat 
what I have said earlier on.  This was a process that would 
give that final product of a final list.  I have said earlier on 
that what I had requested from the HOD Mr Paul Mokoena 
was to follow the processes open a tender bring the final 
list.   
In terms of what happens to the committees there 
different committees that is not normally brought to the 
20 
attention of us as politicians unless there are problems and 
I did allude to the fact that if I am correct after the 
collapse of the tender process when I asked for a way 
forward a database approach was suggested to me.  So I 
did not know about this minutes Chair I must put it on 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 64 of 198 
 
record.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But let us leave aside the minutes what 
you were told is that the open tender process had been 
abandoned…[intervene] 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And when you asked for the way forward 
you were told that that database would be used and on 
your own understanding contractors who would be put on 
the 
database 
would 
be 
given 
contracts 
subject 
to 
assistance from the department with regard to capacitation 
10 
of those who might have needed capacitation.   
Now I think the question that Mr Pretorius raises a 
question I was going to ask you when you were told that 
the open tender process would not be pursued further and 
a process would be followed that was suggested to you, 
that was recommended that would not actually involve an 
open tender process.   
Did you not ask the question but you people 
initiated 
an open tender process because you must have recognised 
20 
that this was a matter that required to go through an open 
tender process.  How can you now say let us leave that 
process and follow a process that is not transparent that is 
not open.  Did you not ask that question?       
MR ZWANE:   Ja, I did allude to the fact that I asked Chair.  
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 65 of 198 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and what was the – and the answer 
you were given was that this practice of using a database 
in the place of an open tender had been used before.  
MR ZWANE:   I even went further to say according to which 
law. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR ZWANE:   And I was given a response that according to 
the Housing Act.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair so I did not have a reason not to 
10 
believe people who were interviewed, appointed, gone to 
school to ensure that the procedures of the PFMA and 
other laws governing in this process of procurement are 
followed.  I took it in good spirit that I am being advised by 
the right people, yes Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But did you ask to see the relevant 
provisions of the Act because it seems to me this ought to 
have sounded very strange to you because when the 
department decided to initiate an open tender process they 
were not doing that because they thought it is a nice thing 
20 
to do, they did that because they were obliged by the law 
to do so.  Now suddenly because certain things did not 
happen, they say we are abandoning that and we will do 
things differently.  It seems to me that as the MEC you – I 
would expect that you would say there is something that I 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 66 of 198 
 
do not understand here.  In the first place why did you not 
use the database process if this matter did not require an 
open tender process.  Now you abandon an open tender 
process, you go into a process that I have never heard of, I 
am hearing from you for the first time.     
MR ZWANE:   They explained that as I have explained 
earlier on Chair in fact when I asked them at each was the 
time wasted if I had known before that there was a 
shorter…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Process.  
10 
MR ZWANE:   Process for us to build houses we could 
have followed that process after hearing that there is a 
process and I want to believe that the issue of money 
taken at a later stage would have been avoided.  But after 
asking this questions and answers being given to me I 
agreed with them and we closed it there and I reported 
back to EXCO that this is the process you are going to 
follow and that there was no concern raised at that level 
also which would have made me to reconsider what the 
officials has told me.  So that is how the process unfolded, 
20 
Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not think it was such an 
important matter that you should see the relevant legal 
provisions about the Housing Act yourself to satisfy 
yourself that what they were recommending was really in 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 67 of 198 
 
accordance with the law.    
MR ZWANE:   Well Chair…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or to seek legal advice.  
MR ZWANE:   The first process of an open tender I did not 
question.  I was told by them and I allowed them to 
proceed.  When they came back explained, gave me 
reasons I also allowed them to proceed.  At that time, it did 
not dawn to me that I could get deep into the issues of 
getting an opinion beyond the people who some of them 
had a background of law.  I did not see it that way so I 
10 
considered and said let us proceed.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Pretorius.    
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   As I understand your evidence Mr 
Zwane you were informed by your officials that a database 
would be established, a new database were established 
and you accepted their decision.    
MR ZWANE:   That is correct Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You did not independently take 
steps to check whether this was a lawful process or not?  
MR ZWANE:   That is correct Chair.  
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You believed however that these 
provisions existed in the Housing Act you say.   
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We will come to those in due 
course but just as a HOD would be accountable expressly 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 68 of 198 
 
in terms of the Public Finance Management Act or what 
happens under his watch with financial implications I 
presume you accept that in so far as you approved the 
establishment of a new database in the place of a 
collapsed tender process you would accept accountability 
for any error in that process that would have resulted in an 
unlawful procurement process following.  If it was unlawful.        
MR ZWANE:   If it was unlawful the accounting officer will 
carry full responsibility of his actions.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And the MEC is not accountable at 
10 
all? 
MR ZWANE:   The MEC’s duty as I have expressed that 
before Chair once I have taken the accounting officer the 
needs of the people and the outcome he implements and 
demands the output.  Section 64 of the PFMA states very 
clearly that if there is any unauthorised expenditure.   
If it happens because of my instruction now as an 
MEC and the HOD did not bring this to my attention in 
writing that the activity or the exercise you are engaging 
yourself in will result in an authorised expenditure, he 
20 
takes full responsibility because it is his duty to manage 
the finances of the department effectively and efficiently 
and where there are illegalities it is his duty to ensure that 
those illegalities does not happen.  Now in the case where 
the HOD comes to me as an authority and say, here is the 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 69 of 198 
 
report; this is how we are going to implement. I may have not 
read further the law but that means that HOD is comfortable 
with the activity taking place.  And if there is any wrong once 
this wrong is reported my duty is to take action as a 
politician.  Because I cannot be running to all the department 
checking laws and so forth.  It is an administrative 
Accounting Officer’s duty to do that.  My work is to play off 
as a true reports.[?]  The reports that are generated by the 
HOD and if those reports at a particular time are not precise 
and correct once that is brought to my attention then I have 
10 
to act to the person who it – who misled me or gave me the 
reports.  That is how I understand it Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  We understand and we have 
dealt with the responsibilities of an Accounting Officer in this 
case 
Mr 
Mokoena 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
Public 
Finance 
Management Act.  So much is clear and has been dealt with.  
My question is a slightly different one. 
MR ZWANE:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Here we are dealing with the 
expenditure – planned expenditure of R1.4 billion.  As MEC if 
20 
during the period you hold that office or that position an 
unlawful procurement process takes place is the MEC not 
accountable at all? 
MR ZWANE:  If – if the MEC knowingly allowed this illegal 
activity to take place then the MEC also will be held 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 70 of 198 
 
accountable by the Premier if that happened in his watch and 
he will [00:02:32]. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well the suggestion that we make 
from this side of the room and it has been put to you too by 
the Chair is that perhaps given the enormity of the budget 
here when you were told that a Public Procurement Process 
had collapsed and a data base was to take its place you 
should have taken steps to check the law either yourself or 
by taking proper legal advice.  That is the proposition that 
we wish to put to you. 
10 
MR ZWANE:  I thought reporting this matter to EXCO as I 
have said where different MEC’s and Heads of Department 
sits was a mechanism to find comfort in the process and that 
process did go through that structure. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You say you heard that other MEC’s 
had 
used 
the 
data 
base 
structure 
therefore 
you 
felt 
comfortable in you doing the same.  Do I understand the 
point correctly? 
MR ZWANE:  No.  I said I presume that other MEC’s knew 
about the data base because they were not new in the 
20 
Provincial Department.  As we were told earlier on that the 
data base was used in the previous years. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR ZWANE:  So they – they should have known I presumed. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes but… 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 71 of 198 
 
MR ZWANE:  That they should have known about this matter 
before I came. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes well I am not sure who you are 
referring to when you talk about other MEC’s but we know 
that your justification for using a data base in this instance 
emanates from the Provisions of the Housing Act you say 
which would not concern MEC’s and other departments 
necessarily. 
MR ZWANE:  Well Chair what I was trying to indicate is that 
this matter would be reported – houses were built in the Free 
10 
State using the data base and my experience is that 
everybody will know what everybody is doing because of the 
reports that will be tabled in the – in the EXCO that was in 
that spirit. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
Right. 
 
We 
know 
that 
the 
recommendation of the bid adjudicating – adjudication 
committee which we have just referred you to Mr Zwane was 
ultimately accepted.  It was signed off by the HOD.  You 
understand – you know that? 
MR ZWANE:  No I do not know that. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright well let us put it to you.  Have 
you still got… 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Page 295 of FS14. 
MR ZWANE:  295.   
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 72 of 198 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If you just turn over the page … 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  295 FS14 is the recommendation.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I am at 295. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Must I go to another page? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Over the page to 297. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The decision of the committee is 
recorded. 
10 
MR ZWANE:  I have 2 – I have 2 295’s here. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well that is unfortunate. 
MR ZWANE:  What is the heading? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Could you go to page 297.   
MR ZWANE:  Is this the one?   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes the 295 was the red 295 we are 
dealing with the black numbers only. 
MR ZWANE:  The black – okay.  Okay. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
FS14 297 
you 
will 
see 
the 
committee’s decision as best I can read it is recorded in 
20 
handwriting there.  You see that? 
MR ZWANE:  I see that but I cannot read it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes well it is cancellation of the 
tender is recommended during – due to the expiry thereof.  
The committee recommends that the following departmental 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 73 of 198 
 
data bases be consolidated and there is some writing that 
follows and to include those who tendered.  But the point I 
want to put to you is that that was recommended as the 
decision by the Chairperson Departmental Bid Adjudication 
and approved by the Accounting Officer on the 30 July 2010.  
You see that? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes I see it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Well we know that matters 
proceeded along the lines of a data base because you say 
you told EXCO that.  The decision all I am putting to you the 
10 
decision was approved.  The recommendation of the bid 
adjudication committee was approved.  Are you happy to 
accept that? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes.  I can see it now Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And at the meeting of EXCO where the use 
of the data base in the place of an open tender process was 
approved not a single person said hang on, should we not 
get legal opinion or legal advice as to whether this is lawful? 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Premier did not do so.  All the other 
MEC’s did not do so and I assume there would have been a 
lot of HOD’s also there.  Nobody ever said hang on. 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Mr Pretorius. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 74 of 198 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It was then decided after the collapse 
and abandonment of the tender process to proceed by way of 
a data base so much we have established, correct? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The justification and legality of that 
decision we will address in due course including what the 
Housing Act says about the MEC’s responsibility.  But that is 
– if that is to hand I can put it to you?  The duties of a MEC 
in terms of Part 3 Provincial Government of the Housing Act 
not the Housing Code appear in Section 7.3 of the Housing 
10 
Act.  Did you know that the Housing Act stipulates what the 
duties of a MEC are in relation to the Provision of Housing? 
MR ZWANE:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Pretorius have we got that 
in one of the bundles, the Housing Act? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes it is in one of the bundles.  I am 
told only the Code we will print it out and we will deal with it 
after the long adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But let me just say this Section 7.3c 
20 
says: 
“That a MEC.” 
 
Well 7.3 says: 
“An MEC must 
a. Administer every National Housing Program 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 75 of 198 
 
and every Provincial Housing Program which 
is consistent with National Housing Policy 
and Section 3.2b and for this purpose may 
in accordance with that program and the 
prescripts of contained in the Code – and 
that is the Housing Code – approve: 
1.  Any projects in respect thereof and 
2. The Financing thereof out of money paid 
into the Provincial Housing Development 
Fund as contemplated in Section 12.2.” 
10 
Section 3b reads: 
“Determine Provincial Housing Development 
Priorities 
in 
accordance 
with 
National 
Housing Policy.” 
Section 3c reads: 
“Apply Procurement Policy in respect of 
Housing 
Development 
determined 
by 
the 
Minister in terms of Section 3.2c and d -  
administer 
the 
assets 
contemplated 
in 
Section 14.” 
20 
 
Now we can get the whole Act we can give you a 
chance to read it during the long adjournment but did you 
know that the MEC had particular responsibilities and would 
be accountable for these items listed in Section 7.  Did you 
know that at all? 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 76 of 198 
 
MR ZWANE:  As I have said I was told so in terms of the 
data base.  I did allude to the fact that the – I had not had a 
chance myself to go through the details of this Act. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes but one would have understood it 
as common sense let alone legal obligation that a MEC 
would make himself or herself aware of the duties that the 
law provides in respect of the matters under his or her 
control. 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct Chair and – but I should 
indicate that I had familiarised myself with the constitution of 
10 
South Africa.  I have – I had also familiarised myself with the 
PFMA that is why I have been quoting it.  It is only when the 
issue of the data base was raised when I was told by the 
Housing Act and you would recall that at some point later on 
the Auditor General recommended that everybody should 
follow PFMA.  So in terms of where I am sitting I had 
gathered sufficient information that will make me be able to 
lead effectively and do what I was supposed to do. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes well the proposition I put to you 
Mr Zwane would apply as a matter of general principle.  But 
20 
in this case of course the report to you that one could use a 
data base in order to provide work to contractors for the 
expenditure of money allocated to housing R1.4 billion was 
justified by the Housing Act.  Perhaps that was the occasion 
to check the Provisions of the Act and see there what your 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 77 of 198 
 
responsibilities were. 
MR ZWANE:  I – it did not come to mind at that particular 
time Chair except to say at a later stage when this issue was 
interrogated at the level of the Auditor General it then 
dawned that we should follow the PFMA which I had 
familiarised myself with.  And I must say Chair that for the 
period I have been in – in the Department of Human 
Settlement the issues we talking about is less than a year 
basically from the point where I was introduced to this 
Housing Act and my departure from that department.  I am 
10 
sure if I had stayed longer, I would endeavour to acclimatise 
myself with different – other Acts and Codes as they are 
found. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes well the functions of the Auditor 
General aside one would have thought that the duty on 
Cabinet officials would be for them to determine their 
responsibilities in terms of the law at the time they took 
office let alone at the time R1.4 billion was about to be 
spent. 
MR ZWANE:  Would I be wrong presuming Chair that I was 
20 
sufficiently covered by the PFMA?  What was my … 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well I do not want to debate the law 
with you.  The PFMA does make the Accounting Officer 
responsible for financial matters under that person’s control.  
There is no doubt about that. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 78 of 198 
 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That accountability can also not be 
avoided through delegation or instructions as you have 
reasonably and fairly pointed out.  But that does not mean to 
say that MEC’s have no responsibilities and have no 
accountability and that is the point I am raising. 
MR ZWANE:  I hear you Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Let us move on then subject to 
coming back to the Act because I think in fairness, we must 
look at the whole Act before calling you to account in terms 
10 
of that Act.  In late October we understand that the National 
Department of Human Settlements raised the issue of under-
spending in terms of the DORA allocation with yourself on 
the one hand and the Provincial Department on the other.  
That I do not understand to be controversial. 
MR ZWANE:  The – on the 14 October the Minister raised an 
issue of low expenditure by three provinces Chair.  And on 
the 18 October, we had the teleconference about this matter.  
And in that meeting we were requested to come up with 
recovery plans as different provinces, that is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you go – have you finished your 
answer? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay before you go further Mr Pretorius I 
just want to go back a little bit.  The abandonment of the 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 79 of 198 
 
open tender process were you told what the reason was why 
it was being abandoned or why it had collapsed? 
MR ZWANE:  If I recall well Chair it was because the tender 
period or the date has – had expired. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
MR ZWANE:  That was one of the reasons I cannot just 
remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ZWANE:  The top of my head other reasons yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Did you – were you told why the 
10 
management had allowed that period to expire without 
finishing what needed to be done in terms of that open 
tender process?  Because you were now finding yourselves 
as a department at a time when you had to think of another 
forward because an open tender process that had been 
initiated was not being pursued.  Did you – did you find out 
why was – why are we in this situation?  Who is responsible 
for this?  Is there somebody who did not do his or her job 
and call for an explanation? 
MR ZWANE:  If I recall well Chair I was told that the amount 
20 
of tenders that had been forthcoming was huge.  So the – 
this period lapses when people were trying to sort that out 
and I could not argue with that further because if I did argue 
with it further in terms of my own understanding it would 
have prejudiced the fair administration of that process. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 80 of 198 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you ask whether the period of the 
tender could have been extended to give the officials more 
time to deal with the huge number of bids? 
MR ZWANE:  I think at – at issue for all of us Chair as I have 
indicated earlier on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ZWANE:  That one of the concerns I raised was that 
after they had raised this new method is that we had waited 
for this time all along thinking that it is the only mechanism 
that will lead us to a proper legal outcome.   
10 
So the issue of me suggesting the way forward at 
that level I would have seen it at that point as interfering 
within administration.  I thought it was correct for me to 
request them to lead me where to now.   
That is why asked them about the way forward that 
we do when these tenders has been abandoned because of 
the reasons you are telling me and should they have wished 
to extend I would not have stood against that wish at that 
particular point.   
I would have raised issues of course that they should 
20 
ensure that we do not spend as much time as we have spent 
before because of service delivery but I would not have 
stopped that process going to that direction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No what I have in mind is – would not 
have been interference on your part.  It would have been you 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 81 of 198 
 
wanting to hold for example the HOD accountable.   
So what I am talking about is did you not ask the 
HOD or the Officials because you saw that there was a huge 
number of bids that you had to sort out you must at some 
stage have realised before the tender period expired that 
you were not going to make it.   
Could you not have extended the period to allow 
yourselves enough time so that we do not – because if you – 
if you could have done that and you had done that, we would 
not find ourselves where we are now.  That is the question I 
10 
am asking you whether you did not ask that question. 
MR ZWANE:  No I did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The extension being prior to the expiry not 
after. 
MR ZWANE:  I did not Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not ask that question? 
MR ZWANE:  No I did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  But on reflection you think you 
should have asked it? 
MR ZWANE:  No. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sitting there? 
MR ZWANE:  Having known that that was legal to get into an 
ongoing tender that has a timeframe and extend that 
timeframe I would have – I would of course asked that 
question. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 82 of 198 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would have asked that question? 
MR ZWANE:  Ja I would have asked that question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ZWANE:  But I did not know the legalities. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ZWANE:  As I kept on asking them about legalities. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
MR ZWANE:  So I was not sure about the legality of that 
question that is why it did not even dawn to me to ask. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
MR ZWANE:  What I was not sure about myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Mr Pretorius I interrupted 
you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  You have told the 
Chair that during October or November 2010 the National 
Department 
of 
Human 
Settlements 
raised 
with 
your 
department the issue of the under-spending of the DORA 
allocation. 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And you have told the Chair that you 
20 
were told by the National Minister I think. 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
That 
you 
should 
prepare 
an 
expenditure recovery plan.  Is that correct? 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 83 of 198 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  How did your department go about 
doing that and what was your role in this process? 
MR ZWANE:  I requested for a meeting with the officials. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Which officials? 
MR ZWANE:  HOD including senior officials and related this 
information to them and requested them to come up with a 
recovery plan because we were supposed to submit that 
recovery plan to the Minister. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Do you know in what set of 
meetings the Expenditure Recovery Plan was devised? 
10 
MR ZWANE:  Can you repeat the question Chair? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Do you know in what set of meetings 
or what forum this plan was devised? 
MR ZWANE:  I … 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well let me put it differently.  What 
group of persons devised this plan? 
MR ZWANE:  The recovery plan I did not get into details.  I 
requested the HOD and his team to develop the recovery 
plan. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright so what happens as I 
20 
understand it is the National Minister speaks to you; says 
you have not spent money in terms of your DORA allocation.  
If you do not want the money taken away you had better 
submit an Expenditure Recovery Plan to me. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes Chair. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 84 of 198 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Was any deadline set – can you 
recall? 
MR ZWANE:  There was a subsequent meeting where this 
recovery plans were to be submitted and that we had to – the 
meeting was called for the 19t h if I am correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Of November? 
MR ZWANE:  Of November for us to talk about this matter 
and look at the recovery plans. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright we will come to the – that 
meeting in due course.  You were – did you attend the 
10 
meeting of the 19t h November? 
MR ZWANE:  No Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What was the reason for that?  Well 
put it this way were you an invitee? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  In the ordinary course you would 
have attended? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Alright so is it your evidence 
that the Expenditure Recovery Plan was developed by 
20 
persons within the department and you took no part in the 
development of that plan.  Do I understand it correctly? 
MR ZWANE:  Before I answer that question, may I ask for a 
personal break Chair? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Sure. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 85 of 198 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Should we – I am sorry should we 
take lunch already or should we – how much time do you 
need? 
MR ZWANE:  Just five minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just five minutes.  Oh maybe we should 
just take five minutes.  We will adjourn for five minutes. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES:    
CHAIRPERSON:   You may proceed Mr Pretorius. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think you had the question that the 
witness was still to answer. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The question ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you remember, Mr Zwane. 
MR ZWANE:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]  Mr Pretorius, do you remember 
the question you had asked? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am equally at a lost Chair.  Let us 
take a step back. [laughing] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing] Would you like to repeat it? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No, I just... I think we need to take a 
step back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What had occurred is that the 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 86 of 198 
 
national minister had spoken to you in relation to the 
perceived under spending, step one.  Step two, he asked you 
to device or to produce an expenditure recovery plan, 
correct? 
MR ZWANE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You then approached your head of 
department, I presume your officials, you said, to device this 
plan.  And I asked you, who actually devised this plan and 
what was your involvement in the devising of the plan. 
MR ZWANE:   The development of the recovery plan was 
10 
developed by the HOD and his senior officials.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you take any part in the 
development of that plan? 
MR ZWANE:   No, I did not Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you see the outcome? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, I saw the outcome. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  If I can just show it to you, 
please? 
MR ZWANE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It exists in various places but it is 
20 
attached to the statement of mister... the founding affidavit 
of Mr Mokhesi.  If you will bear with me for a moment Chair, 
please? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   At Bundle FS14.  If you could there 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 87 of 198 
 
again, please?  I think it is on your right hand side there at 
page 226.   
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Before we get there.  Witnesses this 
week have said that you took part in meetings of the War 
Room at which this plan was developed  Do you have any 
comment? 
MR ZWANE:   The meetings of the War Room were the 
meetings where the officials would deal with the progress, 
highlight any challenges and fix it.  I would go to that 
10 
meeting as and when needed by the meeting but I do not 
recall myself participating in the recovery plan. 
 
Except to say, I went to a meeting where I had to get an 
update as to what are we going to do as we had started late 
in terms of building houses even long(?) before this issue.   
 
Because the War Room was not a result of the recovery 
plan.  It was a structure that was there to ensure that we do 
what we are supposed to do. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  The War Room, as I 
understand what you saying, was there to monitor the 
20 
implementation of the advance payment exercise. 
MR ZWANE:   No, Chair.  But... I am sorry.  I am sorry.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright. 
MR ZWANE:   Or you done? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, just explain? 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 88 of 198 
 
MR ZWANE:   The War Room started earlier than this issue 
of advance payment.  If you allow me Chair maybe to give 
some details?   
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
MR ZWANE:   The issue of advance payments came as a 
result of a meeting that was held with contractors.  I think, if 
I am not mistaken, the meeting was in Welkom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the Welkom meeting, yes. 
MR ZWANE:   And in that meeting, the department had gone 
back to request the contractors to commit themselves in 
10 
ensuring that they work on weekends to try and catch up 
because of the earlier issue we were talking about. 
 
And the contractors in that meeting raised then an issue 
of the builders’ holiday that we are fast approaching, the 
builders’ holiday. 
 
Even if we liked, would at some point, will have to stop 
because there was no material.  That issue was raised there 
and not only the issue of advanced payment.  If I recall, in 
terms of the information I have, there were different 
suggestions there. 
20 
 
One of the suggestions, of course, was that the 
department should bring its part, not only to want contractors 
to commit themselves in terms of working on weekends and 
during the holidays, they should be able to engage the 
suppliers.   
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 89 of 198 
 
 
The suppliers should supply the material that will be 
needed during the time when... during the builders’ holiday.  
That means that was to actually take place during December 
early January kind of arrangement.  
 
Supply the material that is going to be needed.  Upon 
the receipt of the material, the contractor will be given an 
invoice but it will be shown to the department and the 
department will verify whether indeed that material has been 
supplied before asking them to pay.  Then the other one was 
this one of advance payment.   
10 
 
So that meeting of Welkom did not conclude on that 
matter as it was a broad meeting.  When we were in 
Bloemfontein, there was a meeting called where these issues 
were discussed to see if we can be able to commit and find a 
solution, a lasting solution. 
 
In that meeting, somebody raised an issue that the issue 
of advanced payment has been done by Nurcha in one of 
their projects. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Would you spell that entity, please? 
MR ZWANE:   Well, Chair ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is for the transcripts.  
MR ZWANE:   Well ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   N-u-r-c-h-a? 
MR ZWANE:   No, let me not commit myself into spelling. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing] 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 90 of 198 
 
MR ZWANE:   Because of time lapse, I might be seen not 
...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is not calling to you to... 
MR ZWANE:   [laughing] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is simple to assist the transcribed 
...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   No, I would not find the correct spelling. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Is it n-e-r-c-a-k? 
MR ZWANE:   I think so.  I think so.  So then I requested as 
a conclusion of this meeting in Bloemfontein, I requested two 
10 
officials to go and develop a document that I called an 
opinion.  The officials I requested was the HOD and Mmuso 
Tsoametsi. 
 
I should explain at this moment why I did put Mmuso 
Tsoametsi because under normal circumstances I would have 
said HOD. 
 
My recollection is that Mmuso Tsoametsi was in the 
Welkom meeting and despite that, his background is also a 
legal background.  That hence I called the document in my 
affidavit a legal opinion.   
20 
 
So I said:  Go and develop and opinion around this... all 
the suggestions and it should be a legally sound document 
so that we can be able to respond to these challenges that 
are raised by contractors. 
 
And that was the conclusion of the meeting Chair.  I do 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 91 of 198 
 
not if... maybe I should just conclude, if you allow? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
MR ZWANE:   So a document was then developed and 
submitted to the HOD by ...[indistinct] Maxatshwa as you 
would see in the document and the HOD approved that 
document. 
 
I believe it is that document that I have referred it as a 
legal opinion and I have explained why that gave that to 
agreements with the contractors.  So that document, to my 
understanding, is a separate matter to the recovery plan.   
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, my question actually was 
dealing with the recovery plan. 
MR ZWANE:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We will get to the advance 
payments. 
MR ZWANE:   Ja.  That is why I am going backwards. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   I want to explain. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Ten minutes later.  Let us stick to the 
recovery plan. 
20 
MR 
ZWANE: 
 
 
Thank 
you 
very 
much 
Chair. 
 
My 
understanding of the recovery plans, as I explained to the 
HOD at that particular time.  It will deal with the milestones, 
how we are going to recover from the slumber that we are in 
as a province?  Is it practical that we will be able to recover 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 92 of 198 
 
and ensure that the money is utilised for what it was 
intended to. 
 
The money in the Free State was intended to benefit the 
poor, the disadvantaged, the homeless, people of respect(?).  
So the recovery plan was to ensure that, if we can, we 
should be able to deal with that issue and each will have 
milestones and it will have expenditure.   
 
And those issues, by enlarge, are issues that will relate 
to administration.  As I have explained that matter, I thought 
I had but not as well understood and it was not a complex 
10 
matter.  It just needed data and people to rearrange 
themselves in terms of how are they going to commit 
themselves. 
 
Because one of the commitments people had to do was 
to try and interfere with their plans of that particular builders’ 
holiday, December holiday.  So I left it to the officials by 
enlarge.  I think I am done Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You have obviously thought very 
carefully, both about the expenditure recovery plan and the 
advanced payment system.  But let me ask this Welkom 
20 
meeting.  When did it take place? 
MR ZWANE:   The contractors were already on site.  I think 
it should have been later October/November. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So in October/November, contractors 
raised certain issues and make certain proposals and it is 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 93 of 198 
 
arising out of that that the advanced payment system, 
according to you, progressed?  
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Correct? 
MR ZWANE:   Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let us go back to the ERP.  When 
did, do you recall, Minister Sexwale speaking to you about 
the preparation and submission of an expenditure recovery 
plan? 
MR ZWANE:   There was a meeting of all the MEC’s together 
10 
with the minister.  And that meeting, to my recollection was, 
on the 18t h of October. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   18t h of October? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Or 18t h of November? 
MR ZWANE:   19t h of November, there was a meeting 
...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   ...where recovery plans ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Was presented? 
20 
MR ZWANE:   ...was supposed to be presented.  It is the 
meeting which I did not attend. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, was there no prior request in 
terms of a written communication or a verbal communication 
from the national minister to you or to your office saying, you 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 94 of 198 
 
are under spending.  Please present an expenditure recovery 
plan. 
MR ZWANE:   Before the 19t h ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Before the 18 October meeting. 
MR ZWANE:   I cannot recall that Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  What happened at the 
meeting of 18 October?  Was this a MINMAC meeting. 
MR ZWANE:   I do not ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Ministers and HOD’s.  Sorry to 
interrupt. 
10 
MR ZWANE:   18t h of October? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   It was a meeting... it was.. ja, it was a 
MINMAC. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right. 
MR ZWANE:   You are right. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What happened at that meeting? 
MR ZWANE:   The minister raised his concern about this 
matter and requested that we should submit recovery plans 
as well as how we are going to move forward.  Otherwise, a 
20 
particular portion, certain portion of the budget allocated to 
the provinces will have to be taken. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Was the meeting in your boardroom 
during October 2010, where you spoke to your officials about 
the expenditure recovery plan?  In other words, did you 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 95 of 198 
 
follow up that meeting with your own instructions to your 
officials? 
MR ZWANE:   On the recovery plans, we did not have 
more(?) meetings on the recovery plans.  I think we had two, 
three meetings on the suggested opinion, as I call it here.  
This is to be determine, which is part of this document Chair.  
Because there were no really issues on the recovery plan if I 
recall.  Unless, you will refresh me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That document you refer to as the opinion, 
you recall that is the one that is dated 25 November? 
10 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The evidence of other witnesses has 
been that you participated in the preparation of the plan.  
You say you did not participate in the preparation of the 
plan. 
MR ZWANE:   I did not recall... maybe I should say, I would 
normally participate where there are issues that I think 
looking at the first meeting, we need to clarify or to observe 
other things.   
20 
 
As I have earlier on said, my bone of contention here is 
not about my participation on this recovery plan.  I could 
have gone in the meeting once or twice.  I cannot recall 
exactly Chair. 
 
What I want to put on record is that there were no big 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 96 of 198 
 
issues in terms of the development of that plan as far as I 
can remember. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now over what period was this plan 
being implemented, designed or being prepared, rather?  As 
I understand it, it would have been during the course of 
October and November 2010.  Would that be a fair summary? 
MR ZWANE:   The recovery plan would have been prepared 
after the 18t h of October.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And into November? 
MR ZWANE:   Into November, yes. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright. 
MR ZWANE:   I just cannot recall when was it completed. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Would that be a convenient time, 
Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  We will take the lunch adjournment 
and we will resume at five past two.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Continue.  Do I still need the recovery 
plan in front of me? 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair, we are going to get 
there in a moment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Just a small digression in the 
meanwhile, Chair.  We have had occasion to look at the 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 97 of 198 
 
housing at …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   At some stage I think we had a sanitizer 
for the witness that would be there.  If it is available it 
should be made available to him.  Yes, continue, Mr 
Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  Mr Zwane, at some 
stage this morning you referred to the provisions of the 
Housing Act as being the source of the power to use a 
database for the allocation of housing contracts.  You 
recall that evidence? 
10 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I have obtained a copy of the Act 
and we have put a copy before you and before the Chair.  
If you go to Section 3 please, under the head National 
Government, Section 3cA obliges the National Minister to 
determine a procurement policy by not later than April 2002 
which is consistent with Section 217 of the Constitution in 
relation to housing development.   
 
So the first point I wanted to put to you that any 
power that the National Minister has to determine a 
20 
procurement policy is constrained by the provisions of 
Section 217 which require open tender processes, open 
procurement processes.  You know Section 217, you 
mentioned it this morning.  Correct? 
MR ZWANE:   Of the Housing Act? 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 98 of 198 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No, Section 217 of the Constitution 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So anything the National Minister 
does in relation to procurement must be consistent with 
Section 217 of the Constitution.  You know that?  Well, you 
do now, correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Pretorius, you were 
reading from Section 3. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Section 3cA.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Thank you.  3cA? 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    Yes, Chair.  Sorry, 3(2)(c)A. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can you see it, Mr Zwane? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, I can see, Chair, except to say my not 
wearing spectacles.   
CHAIRPERSON:   You are…? 
MR ZWANE:   Except to say my not wearing spectacles in 
this case is actually disadvantaging me between the three 
of us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MR ZWANE:   This thing is too small for me.  So you 
20 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you do not mean you normally need 
reading spectacles you just think that we are advantaged? 
MR ZWANE:   You are advantaged, Chair, yes, that is what 
I am thinking, but I will try and follow. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 99 of 198 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At some stage I had asked officials to 
have a lamp next to the witness so that we – the lighting 
could be improved but you say you can read but you read 
with difficulty? 
MR ZWANE:   I can read, Chair.  You must pardon me when 
I am slow. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine, that is fine. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In relation to procurement there is 
nothing in this Act which would permit procurement without 
a compliance with the Constitution and procurement law.  
There are no exceptions in this Act.  Do you accept that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I get what Mr Pretorius is doing, 
Mr Zwane, I think you said you had never seen this Act 
before. 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are seeing it for the first time.  If 
20 
you got it only now as I have got it, you have not obviously 
had time to go through it, therefore you cannot say yes or 
no but what he is saying is he has looked – he has gone 
through it.  That is what he is putting to you and you might 
be able to say look, if you say so, I cannot dispute it 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 100 of 198 
 
because I have not looked at it but I do not know what the 
Act says.  Or you might say no, I know that there are 
exceptions and I just need more time to look at it. 
MR ZWANE:   No, thank you, Chair.  If I may, I think the 
Chair is correct, I did allude that I did not find time to go 
through this piece of legislation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   And I think it will be fruitful for this 
Commission and what I am going to say for to also 
acclimatize myself with this Act otherwise I may say 
10 
something that I really do not mean. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, that fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I think what should happen is after 
today maybe arrangements can be made for you to depose 
to an affidavit to say you have had a look at it and maybe 
you have even sought legal advice, your understanding is 
that yes, there are no exceptions or yes, there are 
exceptions or you make whatever comment.  Mr Pretorius 
will be able to say this is what we would like to hear you 
20 
on.  Is that alright? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am nevertheless going to ask you 
certain questions, some of a factual nature to alert you to 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 101 of 198 
 
the issues that we would like you to have regard to when 
you read the Act.  So if you would look please at Section 
3(2)(c)A …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You might to make a note of the issues, 
have you got a pen and paper? 
MR ZWANE:    Yes, I do, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You can just mark the sections 
3(2)(c)A which, as we read it obliges the Minister to 
determine a procurement policy, that is the National 
10 
Minister.  But that must be consistent with the provisions of 
Section 217 of the Constitution and not exceptional to the 
provisions of 217.  Right? 
 
So if there was any database – and I want to put 
this to you and you can look at the Act in relation to this 
proposition, if there is any use of a database that database 
would have to be established by a fair and transparent 
tender process or procurement process.  You can just think 
about that, do not have to answer now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it is a proposition that when later on 
20 
you read the Act you must think about to say what will be 
your response to that proposition.  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So nothing in this Act permits the 
appointment of a contractor in execution of a housing 
project to be done other than to a proper constitutionally 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 102 of 198 
 
compliant procurement process.  The proposition derived 
from that is that if there is to be a database that database 
will have to be established by such a fair procurement 
process. 
 
The part 3, Section 7 and following deals with the 
duties, obligations and powers of Provincial Government.  
If you could just page on to that please?  And Section 7.3 
deals specifically with the obligations of an MEC.  Do you 
see that? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes.  
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And it says: 
“An MEC must…” 
Does not give you any discretion, says you must. 
(a) 
Administer every national housing programme 
and every provincial housing programme which 
is consistent with National housing policy and, 
(b) 
And for this purpose, may in accordance with 
that programme and the prescripts contained 
in the code approve any projects in respect of 
thereof. 
20 
(ii)  The financing thereof out of money paid into 
the Provincial Housing Development Fund as 
contemplated in Section 12.2.” 
In 
short, 
that 
section, 
7.3 
(a) 
obliges 
the 
MEC 
to 
administer National Housing Programmes and to approve 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 103 of 198 
 
the 
financing 
of 
National 
Housing 
Programmes 
and 
Provincial Housing Programmes.  Do you see that? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Were you aware of that during 
2010 and 2011? 
MR ZWANE:   As I am saying, Chair, I had not read this but 
I was told in terms of what I alluded earlier this morning. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Section 7.3 (c) says that: 
“An MEC must apply procurement policy in respect 
of housing development determined by the Minister 
10 
in terms of Section 3(2)(c).” 
Now are you aware of any procurement policy determined 
by the Minister? 
MR ZWANE:   Procurement policies? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  That is what you must apply 
in terms of this Act, the Act that you relied on to say you 
could just use a database. 
MR ZWANE:   May I…? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes please. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR ZWANE:   Seemingly we are getting into what I thought 
we are not going to get into, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, no, I think what Mr Pretorius is 
doing, he accepts that you have not read the Act and he 
accepts that at that time in 2010 you had not read the Act 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 104 of 198 
 
but as I understand from him he is just asking in terms of 
your knowledge even without having read the Act whether 
you had such an understanding, that is my understanding, 
based on whatever else other than the Act. 
MR ZWANE:   I had alluded earlier on, Chair, that I have 
not read this piece of legislation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   I think from where I am seated it goes 
without saying that as we go deep into Sections this and 
this, I would not be able to fairly and fruitfully assist this 
10 
process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now, Mr Pretorius, I may have I 
misunderstood your question.  Were you asking him 
whether he was aware of a provision in the Act? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No – well, that too, but we have a 
general answer to that.  The answer is no, I was not aware. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I had not read the Act. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But this provision refers to a 
20 
procurement policy of the Minister and I am asking him if 
he was aware of any such procurement policy.  He might 
not have been alerted to the duty to follow it because he 
had not read the Act but he might have known of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I think this question is a little 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 105 of 198 
 
different, Mr Zwane, he has just asked - Mr Pretorius is 
just asking you whether you were aware of such a policy in 
2010. 
MR ZWANE:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You were not aware. 
MR ZWANE:   If I was aware, I would have insisted that it 
should be followed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let us go then to 7.4 (a).  7.4 (a) 
says: 
10 
“The MEC must establish a panel of not more than 
six persons to advise the MEC on any matter 
relating to housing development.” 
4(b) says: 
“A panel shall consist of one or more fit and proper 
persons who have knowledge, qualifications or 
experience in the field of housing development.” 
During 2010 and 2011 did you establish such a panel?  
That is a factual question. 
MR ZWANE:   The fact is that, as I have said, I did know 
20 
that I was supposed to establish such a panel, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So had you read the Act and had 
you applied its provisions you would have had a panel of 
not more than six experts to advise you on any matter 
relating to housing development and presumably that 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 106 of 198 
 
includes procurement. 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And then Section 5, you will recall 
earlier when taking Mr Mokoena to task in terms of the 
provisions of Section 51 of the Public Finance Management 
Act you made it very clear that even though an accounting 
officer may delegate or he may follow and correct orders, 
he is ultimately the accountable person.  Correct? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Those provisions, interestingly, are 
10 
mirrored in Section 7.5 of this Act which reads: 
“The MEC may, subject to any conditions he or she 
may deem appropriate in any instance, delegate any 
power conferred on him or her by the Act or be 
assigned any duty imposed upon him or her by this 
Act...” 
But then it continues. 
“…to any officer or employee in the department 
responsible 
for 
the 
administration 
of 
housing 
matters in the province either in his or her personal 
20 
capacity or by virtue of the rank he or she holds or 
the post he or she occupies provided that the 
delegation of assignment does not prevent the 
person who made the delegation or assignment from 
exercising 
that 
power 
or 
performing 
that 
duty 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 107 of 198 
 
himself or herself.” 
So the power to exercise any duty under this Act, whatever 
it may be, remains with the MEC.  Do you see that? 
MR ZWANE:   I see it, Chair, and from where I am seated I 
think with due respect, this process is not taking shape as 
I understood you to be advising.  What the evidence leader 
is doing is leading me through this document that I have 
not familiarised myself and I must be on record in saying 
yes or not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
MR ZWANE:   And I do not think that is fair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, well, Mr Zwane, with equal 
respect in return, the reason I am putting them to you is so 
that you can focus on them in your response. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you response, after the reading 
the Act. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am just alerting you to certain 
provisions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So he is not asking you for an answer 
now, he just wants you to note what areas, what issues he 
20 
is interested in getting an answer from you on.  That is why 
I was saying to you earlier on you might need a pen and 
paper so that you record the issues that he would like an 
answer on but not that he wants an answer now.  Later one 
when you depose to an affidavit that can be dealt with it.  
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 108 of 198 
 
 
Of course, Mr Pretorius, another way might be that 
something in writing could be sent to his attorneys to say 
these are the areas he must deal with in his affidavit but 
this is another way of dealing with it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  So we can do that in 
addition. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  So I think what will be done, 
Mr Zwane, is that after today Mr Pretorius will send to your 
attorneys all the issues that he would like you to deal with 
in an affidavit after you have read the Act.  Okay? 
10 
MR ZWANE:   I accept, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course what I do what to ask, Mr 
Zwane, is this.  Was it after the general election of 2009 
that you were appointed as MEC for Human Settlements or 
was it during that term, not at the beginning of that term?  
In other words, had you been MEC in this department from 
immediately after the elections in 2009 or did you come in 
in 2010 or late in 2009? 
MR ZWANE:   I came after the elections, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So in April 2010 when the open 
tender public process was initiated you had been in the 
department close to a year or thereabouts because the 
elections in 2009 …[intervenes] 
MR ZWANE:   Less than a year. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 109 of 198 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is more or less, ja, less than a 
year, or just short of a year, maybe two months short of a 
year or so. 
MR ZWANE:   We were appointed around – ja, June, July. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now as at April 2010, do you know 
whether at that stage, around April 2010, you had heard 
that there was an Act of Parliament called the Housing Act 
or do you not remember whether you had heard that such 
10 
an Act existed? 
MR ZWANE:    Maybe I should allude to the fact, Chair, 
that as I was appointed, I had an experience of the 
municipality. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   And the municipality deals by and largely 
with MFMA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   And when I got to the Province, I then 
familiarised myself with the PFMA which to me would have 
20 
been reasonable to say it replaces the MFMA because I am 
now in the Province.  I said earlier on that when I was 
informed by the Housing Act is when I had asked about the 
way forward after the open tender was abandoned. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 110 of 198 
 
MR ZWANE:   And that was around after April in 2010. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That maybe would be June, July, August, 
around about. 
MR ZWANE:  Around that time, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR ZWANE:   No, this can actually be done under the 
Housing Act because I was asking where does this come 
from because I am familiar with the PFMA.  That is when I 
learnt about …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The Housing Act. 
10 
MR ZWANE:   The Housing Act. 
CHAIRPERSON:   For the first time. 
MR ZWANE:   Ja.  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  You see, it is a matter of concern 
to me and I just want to raise with you so that you can 
comment on it, it is a matter of concern to me that there 
would be an Act and it is called the Housing Act that 
applies in the provinces as well that the MEC responsible 
for Human Settlements does not know about for more than 
a year in office.  So it is a matter of concern to me to say 
20 
what brings about such a situation because an MEC - of 
course he might not be a lawyer, but an MEC who comes 
in, same thing with a Minister who comes into a certain 
portfolio, one would expect that they would want to be 
informed of all legislation that is relevant to the their 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 111 of 198 
 
portfolio so that they are familiar with them both for 
purposes – for their own purposes but also for purposes of 
maybe performing oversight over the HOD and so on.  Do 
you have something about that concern that I have? 
MR ZWANE:   Chair, I hear the concern you say.  Normally 
the process is that when you arrive in a particular 
department you are welcomed in that department by the 
head of the department and with time your first induction 
will be to be given tools that you are going to work around.  
Tools like your Constitution, what affects us in this 
10 
department, Section so and so.   
Above the general oversight responsibilities of a 
politician, it will be PFMA in the main.  I remember when I 
was still the municipality, I was introduced to something 
called GRAP, you know?  It is a process that is undertaken 
when you are yourself be welcomed in the department and 
in that process you then take heart to what has been given 
to you because at that point, you may not know the 
Housing Code and the Housing Act and other policies that 
might be there forming part of what you need to know 
20 
unless you are taken into speed on these issues and that 
process did take place, Chair, to me, acclimatise this and 
this and that is …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Led by the HOD by any chance? 
MR ZWANE:   Under normal circumstances there should be 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 112 of 198 
 
a handover report by the person who was there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The previous MEC? 
MR ZWANE:   The previous MEC.  But then the HOD come 
in hand to provide the tools of trade in terms of the law 
and here we worked in terms of this and this and this is 
what happens when we developed these issues. 
 
The difficulty, Chair, at that particular time, you may 
not know as a politician generally that I have to go through 
this one and this one and this one.  So that is how this 
happens and I may also want to say if you take 2009/2010, 
10 
thereabouts, would take at heart that our oversight would 
not 
mean 
you 
are 
delving 
deep 
into 
issues 
of the 
legislation because there are people who will help you from 
time to time in terms of those legislation to ensure that the 
department, the activities, are within, are in line with what 
needs to happen in that department and that is how the 
situation was.  So really just want to say to you I hear your 
concern but I also want to paint this picture that that was 
the situation at that particular time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So would I be right to understand your 
20 
evidence as saying although that process that you are 
talking about did take place when you came to the 
department in 2009, nobody drew your attention to the 
existence of the Housing Act during that process? 
MR ZWANE:   No, Chair, it is correct. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 113 of 198 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Nobody. 
MR ZWANE:   Nobody. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you are sure about that?  And you 
are sure that definitely nobody did that? 
MR ZWANE:   As I say, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Did the HOD or some of the 
officials give you maybe a pack or file that all the existing 
policies of the department that you might have to know 
about including legitimisation?  Maybe PFMA they put in 
but they did not put in the Housing Act.  Did they do 
10 
anything like that? 
MR ZWANE:   I may not recall in terms of the package, 
Chair, but in my recollection, I did get that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In your…? 
MR ZWANE:   In my recollection. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did that yourself? 
MR ZWANE:   No, I did get …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you did get a pack, ja. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright.  But you obviously 
20 
understand why I have this concern because you have to 
kind of perform oversight over the HOD.  You understand 
that? 
MR ZWANE:   I understand that concern, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 114 of 198 
 
MR ZWANE:   I was just saying… 
CHAIRPERSON:   This is how it happened.   
MR ZWANE:   This is how it happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, I understand.  Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Mr Zwane, the Chair has been very 
polite in this regard but as MEC you were tasked with the 
expenditure on low cost housing for poor people, as you 
have emphasised, of an amount of R1.4 billion.  It is a 
massive responsibility. 
MR ZWANE:   That’s correct Chair. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It must have been known to you 
that that expenditure should take place efficiently and 
effectively on the one hand and lawfully on the other, 
correct? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We know now that that was not 
done, we may argue that but that is certainly the evidence 
that we have heard thus far.  Surely it is not too much to 
ask of an MEC who comes into office that that MEC takes 
the responsibility on himself or herself and does not leave 
20 
it to anybody else to make sure that there is an awareness 
of all the laws that apply in this process to spend 
R1.4billion.   
MR ZWANE:   Well as I explained earlier Chair that under 
the PFMA as I explained it the functions that were given to 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 115 of 198 
 
me and this was not one of the functions given to me.  
These were the functions given to the accounting officer 
and as we speak PFMA if I am correct is a piece of 
legislation that was developed in 1999, 1998 there about.  
It was also a piece of legislation that was used.   
Now my impression and my understanding is that 
this 
does not suggest that at this particular time we are putting 
aside what the PFMA is saying and only concentrating on 
what the Housing Act is saying.  I have alluded to this 
10 
Commission earlier on that I based my understanding on 
the PFMA and I have explained just now that due to my 
background of the municipality from the MFMA, graduating 
from the MFMA I had to according to myself with the PFMA 
and I have explained this issue and I also take note of the 
fact that I did not acclimatise myself with this with this 
Housing Act as I have explained that it came to my 
attention when.   
All what I did and I thought to the best of my ability 
is to ensure that PFMA was followed to the latter and so if 
20 
that was not sufficient then I need to hear that from this 
Commission.  All that I am saying is that I did my best 
under the understanding of what PFMA says we must be 
able to do as politicians.  Thank you.       
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, well if the PFMA deals with 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 116 of 198 
 
procurement at all it says that procurement must follow the 
law.  
MR ZWANE:   That is correct Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You were an MEC appointed to 
deal with housing.  
MR ZWANE:   That is correct Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   There was at the time a Housing 
Act.  
MR ZWANE:   That is correct Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You did not read the Act.  Correct?  
10 
MR ZWANE:   I did not read the Housing Act. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Had you read the Act you would 
have been alerted to your duties under the Act number 1, 
correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I am sorry Mr Pretorius before 
coming to reading the Act you did not know that the 
Housing Act existed.    
MR ZWANE:   That is correct Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR ZWANE:   You see the one issue that we debated for 
20 
some time Chair and I have not raised this issue.  What 
would have superseded one another in terms of PFMA and 
the 
Housing 
Act 
when 
we 
are 
dealing 
with 
human 
settlements and houses because at some point there was a 
workshop that was giving a clear explanation of the 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 117 of 198 
 
difference between a house and a human settlement?   
The department has changed it is a new department 
it is here the MEC comes follows PFMA at a later stage he 
is been told that there is this Act that is called the Housing 
Act in the middle of the year when things are already 
happening.  Reasonably I thought it was reasonable 
enough for anybody who will follow what I did at that 
particular time to say I was an MEC that followed the 
prescripts of the law as much as I could understand them 
and it is clear that I could not read this law because at that 
10 
particular time I did not know about it.   
If I had read the law and found some explanations 
in 
terms of what the exercise we are doing today maybe I 
would have come to a different conclusion but at that 
particular time I thought I was doing my job diligently.            
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   All I want to do is establish the 
facts not for me to judge it is for the Chair to judge but let 
us just go back to the facts.  When you were appointed 
MEC and well into you term of office for about a year you 
20 
did not know that there was a Housing Act.    
MR ZWANE:   That is correct.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am not sure that that improves 
the position but we will make submissions in that regard.  
Had you been aware of the Act and had you made yourself 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 118 of 198 
 
aware of the Act and read it you would have been aware of 
the duties rested upon an MEC in terms of housing.  
Correct?    
MR ZWANE:   That is correct.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You would also have had the 
benefit of a committee of experts to assist and advise you.  
Correct? 
MR ZWANE:   I would have been clearer in terms of who is 
here doing what appointed by whom because the reason I 
said maybe it is correct for me to get enough time dealing 
10 
with the same things because there were people who were 
dealing with the legal matters I did not know how they were 
appointed but they were there as officials.   
It might happen that I did not appoint them myself 
but people were there.  Now I was trying to run away from 
a situation where I will answer based on what I know when 
this Act is actually revealing other facts which is I must go 
back and acclimatise myself and give a proper answer I 
submit Chair.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I would have thought the question 
20 
was capable of a straight forward answer.  The Act obliges 
the MEC to appoint a committee of experts.  Correct? 
MR ZWANE:   This one yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You did not do so, had you read 
the Act presumably you would have done so.  Correct?   
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 119 of 198 
 
MR ZWANE:   Yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let us deal with the ERP then if we 
may it appears at Bundle 14…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Pretorius because I think 
you are moving away from the Act.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, I am. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, maybe it might be difficult to find the 
right adjective but it is rather shocking to me Mr Zwane 
that the Free State Province has a situation where the MEC 
for housing does not know for over a year in that office that 
10 
there is a Housing Act in the country that applies to his 
portfolio.   
As to who should be blamed for that that might be 
another question but on its own it is something that is a 
little shocking to me and one would have thought that to 
say the least the HOD would know about that and would 
have made sure that the MEC knew and the legal people 
within the department would have made sure that probably 
the MEC also should have known about that but maybe that 
might be a matter for debate.  So there is that part but 
20 
then this is another part for me going back to when you 
were told for the first time about the Housing Act now this 
is when the open tender process had been abandoned and 
you were asking the officials what is the way forward and 
they said we can use the database and they said that is 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 120 of 198 
 
permissible under the Housing Act.   
Now I would have thought that with your knowledge 
of the PFMA which you have testified to your reaction 
would be now under the PFMA in terms of as the legislation 
that I know to be applicable.  I do not remember that this 
would be permissible if you people now tell me that there 
is another Act that allows this it means you are telling me 
something very important that I did not know about and I 
would like to see the Act I would like to see those 
provisions because I have always understood that the 
10 
PFMA does not allow for this kind of thing.   
But you are telling me forget about the PFMA there 
is another Act that allows this.  I would have thought that 
you would say precisely because you did not know about 
this Act they are telling you something new you would want 
to see that Act and see those provisions to add to your 
knowledge for going forward to say now I know exactly how 
– that there is another Act that I knew nothing about I am 
surprised that I am hearing about it more than 12 months 
after I became MEC I am being told about it for the first 
20 
time.  Before I go further I want to see that what the 
officials are telling me is true because they never told me 
all these months about this Act and now they are telling me 
about a new Act that applies here I want to see that 
actually I want to know from them how come you have 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 121 of 198 
 
never told me about this Act.  That is the kind of reaction 
that I would have expected.  What do you say to that?            
MR ZWANE:   Chair I hear what the Chair is saying I 
always kept that in mind because we normally plan for 
every year for this kind of activity appointment of the 
service providers.  What I did and at that particular time 
which I thought was sufficient and was not questioned 
either at any level was to submit these ideas to the 
collective of the executive that there is this situation that 
the tender has been abandoned and the proposal is that we 
10 
are following a database that will consider different 
processes.   
The EXCO agreed to this so when I went back to 
Implement it was no longer a decision of one person who is 
an MEC in this case me, it was a decision that has been 
endorsed by the collective that will also include the HOD’s 
of all the province.  It did not dawn to me at that particular 
time that there could be something untoward this procedure 
that has actually been adopted by the whole executive 
including these people who think they are there to advise 
20 
us.  So that is my response to the concern the Chair is 
raising.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And of course I think I may have 
mentioned this before it is also strange to me that at this 
EXCO meeting the Premier and about eight other MEC’s I 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 122 of 198 
 
think there are normally ten…[intervene]            
MR ZWANE:   There are ten Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ten MEC’s.  
MR ZWANE:   We were ten all in all, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But nine MEC’s and maybe about ten 
HOD’s and the DG of the province in this meeting not a 
single person says is this, would this be lawful you know.  
But I have put that to you I am just repeating that I have 
got 
that 
concern 
but 
you 
will 
go 
through 
the 
Act…[intervene]  
10 
MR ZWANE:   I will Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you go through the Act you must 
also remember that when I will at the sections that Mr 
Pretorius has referred to something says to me if only you, 
the MEC, had said please give me that Act you are talking 
about and you went through it, you would have picked up 
that it doesn’t seem to say what the officials said to you it 
says, but you haven’t read it, when you read it just bear in 
mind that concern. 
 
Okay Mr Pretorius. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Of course Mr Zwane it was the poll 
of the Provincial Cabinet, including all the MEC’s under the 
guise of Exco that should be held accountable for what 
happened but not a comforting thought.  So I understand 
that what you are saying is that these decisions including 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 123 of 198 
 
the database decision were approved by the whole cabinet, 
all the MEC’s, no one spoke out against it, and that 
somehow makes the situation more understandable, I am 
afraid it makes it far worse. 
MR ZWANE:   Are you expecting my comment Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   He is asking for your comment ja, if you 
have got any, you might not have any. 
MR ZWANE:   Well I do not have a comment at this stage 
Chair thanks. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   May I now move onto the ELP 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Mr Zwane would you look at FS14 
please at page 226, I think it’s the one on your right hand 
side. 
MR ZWANE:  What page?   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The FS14, page 226. 
MR ZWANE:   Okay yes, on ... 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do you recognise this document? 
20 
MR ZWANE:   Yes Chair I do. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You do, okay before going into the 
detail of that document I want to refer to a passage in your 
own affidavit, and I am going to ask you please to go to 
Bundle FS12 at page 493. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 124 of 198 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that FS12? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  FS12 Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what page? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   493. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And 14 I must keep open or I must close 
Mr Pretorius, Bundle FS14? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well we are going back there 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh we’re going back there, okay what 
page? 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  After a few minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page on FS12? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   493 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 93 of your affidavit if I 
may just read it to you and then ask a question or two.  
You say I confirm that during December/January 2010, I 
presume you mean December 2010/January 2011, when I 
was overseeing the construction of these houses I saw 
positive steps taken by contractors in order to comply with 
20 
the Department instructions and I can confirm that even 
though I do not have the exact figures I had opened plus 
minus 
50 
completed 
houses 
and 
there 
were 
many 
structures which were on foundation stages, wall level 
milestone, and roof level milestone which would have been 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 125 of 198 
 
completed had they been further two to three months.  I 
presume that should read had they been further two to 
three months.  Do you recall putting that evidence before 
the Chair in that affidavit? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So it seems to me that during the 
period 
December 
2010/January 
2011 
you 
opened 
approximately 50 completed houses. 
MR ZWANE:   Approximately yes that is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And you say there were many 
10 
structures at foundation stage, wall level milestone and 
roof level milestone which would have been completed in a 
further two to three months? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well the further two to three months is 
that the – is that further two to three months after the end 
of the financial year or further two to three months after 
January 2011, I think that December, January 2010 is 
meant to be December 2010/January 2011 is that correct. 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, that is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so when you say further two or 
three months is that after the financial year or is that after 
January? 
MR ZWANE:   The process was actually stopped Chair, 
around mid-January. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 126 of 198 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   About mid-January? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh so when you say had that been two 
to three further months you mean from mid-January? 
MR ZWANE:   If we had gone ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   If it had been allowed to go on for 
another two to three months after mid-January? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes it would have been, I think we would 
have covered a lot of ground. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   50 houses at R76 000 a house and 
forgive my maths it is approximately R3.6million. 
MR ZWANE:   Well Chair if I may in my own affidavit just to 
take this point further, I may check there is a statement 
that was made to this effect which I want to believe will 
assist this information ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes you can take us to that statement if 
you are able to. 
MR ZWANE:   If you give me a moment I should be 
...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you tell Mr Pretorius what the 
statement says he might be able to find it quicker. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Is it the annexure to this letter to 
National? 
MR ZWANE:  No it is a media statement ...[intervenes]  
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 127 of 198 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say it is a media statement that you 
are looking for? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the one that was in response to 
the National Minister ’s media statement or was it another 
one? 
MR ZWANE:   I think so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There was a time when the National 
Minister issued a media statement about taking away some 
two hundred and sixty something million from the province, 
10 
in response to that the Department issued its own media 
statement, that is the one you are talking about? 
MR ZWANE:   That is the one I am talking about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay Mr Pretorius I think it is in 
whatever bundle it is in it is somewhere towards the end of 
the bundle that media statement.  It might be in the bundle 
that has got Mr Mchachwa’s affidavit. 
MR ZWANE:   It is 596, page 596. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that of FS12? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   526? 
MR ZWANE:   596 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Well at least I think I was right 
about one thing, I said whatever bundle it is in, it is 
towards the end of the bundle.   Yes, I have got it, have 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 128 of 198 
 
you got it Mr Pretorius?   Mr Pretorius have you got it?  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I have it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, what is the point you wanted to 
make Mr Zwane? 
MR ZWANE:   I just want to make a point Chair that this 
document was written by the Department, not by me.  This 
document alludes to the fact that I have in my own affidavit 
that a number of house were concluded, in fact it goes on 
to even give a number of houses that were concluded, 
which are even more because you will remember in my 
10 
statement I had said I cannot remember properly what has 
happened, but if you go through this statement it will tell 
you 
that 
during 
the 
physical 
department 
of 
Human 
Settlement engaged the Minister of National Department in 
this regard we firmly believe – I am sure you see that 
paragraph, during this financial year ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you on page 596 or 597? 
MR ZWANE:   It will be 597 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh yes, ja.  The paragraphs are not 
numbered but you can tell us which one from the top that 
20 
you are reading from.  Well where it says during this 
financial 
year, 
that’s 
the 
third 
paragraph 
from 
the 
...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   Yes that’s the third paragraph. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 129 of 198 
 
MR ZWANE:   Yes.  During the financial year the 
Department has set a national trend by building between 
50 and 60 square metres houses, a total of 10 different 
designs of the RDP houses has been developed with the 
assistance of Truman Engineers.  As part of bold initiative 
of 
Operation 
Hlasela 
the 
Province 
say 
this 
delivery 
...[indistinct] new RDP houses are equipped with – the 
details is there Chair. 
 
The following paragraph reads: 
“Our 
groundbreaking 
housing 
projects 
in 
10 
Marabastad, Kroonstad is a case in point similar, 
bigger and better RDP houses have also been 
built.” 
And then it went on ...[indistinct] those are different areas 
where these houses were built in that financial year.  Then 
the following paragraph it says: 
“On Christmas Day Human Settlement MEC Zwane 
handed over 100 houses in ...[indistinct] in the 
Eastern Free State, in the nearby town of Ficksburg 
another 
100 
houses 
were 
handed 
over 
to 
20 
beneficiaries on Christmas Eve.” 
All that I am trying to say Chair this piece of information 
will corroborate what I am saying and from the Department 
independently.  I have not verified the numbers, the point I 
am making here is that indeed houses were built and we 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 130 of 198 
 
opened houses during Christmas, during those holidays we 
opened houses that is the point I was trying to make. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think for the sake of completeness one 
should go to the next paragraph.  It says: 
“On 
New 
Year ’s 
Day 
MEC 
Zwane 
handed 
an 
additional 250 houses in Vrede, a total of 600 
houses were handed over to beneficiaries in various 
towns during December alone in Buchabero, six 
houses were handed over to elderly beneficiaries as 
these have been prioritised on our beneficiary list.   
10 
In 
Bloemfontein 
20 
elderly 
beneficiaries 
also 
received houses on Christmas Day.” 
It would appear that in terms of what this media statement 
of the department is saying, and you have made the point 
that you did not write the statement yourself, it seems that 
according to this media statement whereas you were 
saying that – or I understood your affidavit to say you – 
during December you handed over about is it 250 houses or 
50 houses I cannot remember? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  50. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  50 it looks like the department is giving 
much bigger figures in terms of how many houses you 
handed over which had been completed during December up 
to New Year – New Years’ Eve.  It talks certainly – it looks 
like more than 4 maybe more than 400 – 300 I am not sure.  
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 131 of 198 
 
Is that your understanding as well that they are giving much 
higher figures than yourself? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes.  In my affidavit Chair before I arrive at the 
figures, I said I confirm that even though I do not – I do not 
have the exact figures this is the rough estimation I am 
giving. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR ZWANE:  Now I am saying in a statement that was not 
from me which I do not have any reason not to believe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR ZWANE:  Houses were built during that time and at a 
much higher rate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ZWANE:  Than what I had said in the statement.  That is 
the point I was illustrating. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  Does it mean that… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So your affidavit… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  Does it mean that 
as you sit there you have no recollection yourself of how 
many houses were completed and you handed over during 
20 
December and January?  In other words, to what extent the 
figures given by the department in this media statement are 
close to the truth.  Is that something you do not know? 
MR ZWANE:  No I am not too sure about that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 132 of 198 
 
MR ZWANE:  I do not have a… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ZWANE:  Proper recollection. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR ZWANE:  Of the exact amount of houses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ZWANE:  That were built during that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ZWANE:  All what I was illustrating is a point that the 
correctness of the affidavit that houses were built during that 
10 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I am afraid again however polite the 
exchange is Mr Zwane your affidavit is clear.  If you go to 
paragraph 93 you say: 
“I had opened plus minus 50 completed 
houses.” 
And you refer to the period December to January 2010.  Now 
can we place any reliance on that statement at all? 
MR ZWANE:  If you read the statement in full – if you read 
20 
that paragraph in full Chair I did elude to the fact that I had 
eluded to the fact that I am not too sure.  I am saying here I 
can confirm that even though I do not have the exact figure 
this is what I am saying.  I had opened plus minus – that is 
on an estimation. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 133 of 198 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes but – but Mr Zwane please. 
MR ZWANE:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Let us just look at what you say. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You do not have the exact figures.   
“I had opened plus minus 50 completed houses.” 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Can we apply any reliance to that 
statement at all? 
MR ZWANE:  I think what it should … 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Must be disregard it? 
MR ZWANE:  What should be noted is that I was not too sure 
in terms of the number of houses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well your… 
MR ZWANE:  That were completed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your estimate – your estimate Mr Zwane 
would be quite horrible if in fact you had opened 400 houses 
but you said you thought you had opened plus minus 50, 
would you not agree? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well I – can I just add to that Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I have just done some arithmetic.  
This letter of the Department talks about 1250 houses being 
opened in that period.  So there is just no possibility of I am 
not too sure plus minus 50 being reconciled on any version 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 134 of 198 
 
with 1250 in this letter.  One of them is wrong.  It is not a 
mistake.  It is not a bad estimate.  It is simply grossly 
incorrect.  What do you say to that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see Mr Zwane on the evidence that 
has been placed before me. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were very concerned or you were very 
keen that the departments build as many houses as possible.  
So concerned were you or so keen were you that you even 
decided not to take a break during the December/January 
10 
Christmas period because you wanted to be there to make 
sure that houses were built.   
And of course this came against the threat I think of 
the National Minister or Department that money would be 
taken away from the department if it did not indicate a clear 
plan that it would be able to spend to improve its spending – 
expenditure considerably.  Now you take – you decide I am 
not going on holiday I want to see this – these houses being 
built.   
So I do not expect that somebody who is so keen to 
20 
make sure that houses are built is not going to know how 
many houses had been completed by the time he was 
stopped in mid-January from continuing with this very 
important job.  I expect that you would know to say we had 
built – we have completed so many houses.   
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 135 of 198 
 
This is the number of houses that had not been 
completed bla, bla, bla.  But now if you have the MEC saying 
by mid-January we had completed I think plus minus 50 and 
you have the department talking about – Mr Pretorius talked 
about 1000 but at least I think not less than 400.  Those are 
two vastly different figures.  How – how is it possible that 
you would not be able to say no, no, no but the department 
has got it wrong.   
There is no way we have completed so many.  Or I 
realise I think I was completely wrong.  I mean we are X 
10 
number of years later at some stage or another you would 
have wanted to know what the truth is you know.  We were 
stopped from building houses in mid-January we were on 
track.  This – this is the number of houses we had 
completed. 
MR ZWANE:  Chair the – the question that was put to me 
when I made my statement was not in terms of the – the 
number of houses which were built.  I of course agree that 
there is a vast difference in terms of the number.   
I agreed.  The statement was not about that.  The 
20 
statement was that was there any progress made during the 
time which you took off and tried to speed up the delivery on 
the ground?  I thought I was being fair to say in my 
statement houses were built.  I am not sure because I had 
not gone back to records.  The statement is done now and 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 136 of 198 
 
this thing was in 2010/2011.   
But I put to the commission that there were houses 
which were – which I opened – I opened.  Meaning that my 
statement as I understand it does not even include the total 
number of houses that were there.  I opened these number 
of plus minus this number of houses during December.  
Because I was working.   
I went and gave – gave the keys to all our people to 
come in.  I did not go to the number that they are saying.  If 
you are going to ask me the next question that did, I verify 
10 
the number I will be honest with you to say no I did not verify 
that number.  All what I was illustrating is that during my 
oversight I did open houses and to my best recollection plus 
minus I went to these number of houses.   
My understanding of that statement Chair is not to 
say these were the total number of houses that were built. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That were completed. 
MR ZWANE:  Were completed during that process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ZWANE:  These are the numbers I went on my oversight 
20 
and interacted with people.  Number – the houses that I have 
seen and I was happy and people were there were happy.  I 
thought I was trying to illustrate that point and if that point 
comes across with all humility negatively my intention was to 
illustrate the commitment that we undertook and my work as 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 137 of 198 
 
a person at that particular time. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Hm. 
MR ZWANE:  I did not think that the – the question was 
saying what was the total amount of all the houses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm.  Yes but I would like to know that 
now.  Do you know how many houses had been completed by 
the time you were stopped from building houses in mid-
January? 
MR ZWANE:  No Chair I do not have – I do not have that 
statistics with me. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Did you ask for that information at 
the time you have forgotten it is now or you did not ask for it 
even at that time from the officials? 
MR ZWANE:  I had asked the information Chair even as late 
as – of this week.  What I got when I called – because I 
knew I anticipated that discretion will come that the file that 
could have correct statistics. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Information. 
MR ZWANE:  Ja they do not see it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They said they could not find the file. 
20 
MR ZWANE:  They could not find the file.  I did ask for that 
file because I wanted – when I saw this media statement, I 
read my affidavit.  I thought I should get the correct figures 
from the department and I did send an email trying to 
reconcile this so that I give a proper answer. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 138 of 198 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well if one backs to paragraph 93 Mr 
Zwane where you mention 50 completed houses plus minus.  
As I understand the intention of that statement was to show 
how much had been achieved by the department under your 
watch during December/January 2010.  We know December 
2010/January 2011 that was the purpose clear from the 
statement here.  You were trying to say – place on record 
what the department had achieved during that period.  And 
you say if I may take the point a bit further: 
10 
“I had opened plus minus 50 completed 
houses and there were many structures 
which were on foundation stages, wall level 
milestone and roof level milestone which 
would have been completed had there been a 
further two to three months.” 
That on the face of it is a clear intention to give the best 
picture of the state of progress during December/January 
2010.  You do not say here there might have been another 
3000 houses close to completion – completed anyway – 
20 
handed over. 
MR ZWANE:  No I could not say that Chair because I did not 
have that information with me. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Oh.  So when was this affidavit 
signed let us just check that?  It was signed in 2019 was it?  
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 139 of 198 
 
When was it signed?  15 September 2019.  That is when you 
made this statement. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I want to suggest to you that your 
statement may be the correct reflect of events because I 
also want to suggest to you that the press release issued by 
the Department is grossly exaggerated.  That by the 
admission of the HOD and Mr Maxatshwa.  What do you say 
to that? 
MR ZWANE:  I have eluded Chair earlier on that this was not 
10 
written by me and so I – I am currently not in a position to 
have an objective judgment of this statement. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well let us say at least that if the 
facts in paragraph 93 are anywhere near the correct position 
that media statement would have been a gross exaggeration.  
Would you at least admit that? 
MR ZWANE:  The – the – the only small challenge I had with 
the media statement Chair if I may allude to it is the timing 
of it because it is a reactionary kind of document which may 
in some instances lack objectives.  But in terms of the 
20 
precision of the statement I cannot vouch to it that is why up 
front I had said the point I was trying to illustrate here when 
I refer you to this statement was not about numbers.  It was 
about the fact that houses were built during that time.  I 
eluded to that statement earlier on Chair. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 140 of 198 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Well lacking objectivity is 
perhaps the politest description of the projections of the 
department in relation to what would have been achieved by 
year end.  But let us look at what the media statement 
actually says on page 596.  It is dated the 26 January 2019 
and it says in paragraph 1:  By the way before we got there 
to what it says did you approve this statement before it was 
issued? 
MR ZWANE:  I – I normally do not approve a statement that 
is not from my office.  The HOD does in terms of the PFMA 
10 
these are the people that are administered by him. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Let us look at paragraph 1.  
Paragraph 1 says in a public media statement in response to 
a decision taken by the National Department. 
“The 
Free 
State 
Department 
of 
Human 
Settlements 
will 
not 
under-spend 
funds 
allocated 
for 
Human 
Settlements 
Development in the current financial year.  
By the end of the financial year in March the 
Department would have spent 100% of all 
20 
conditional 
grant 
funding 
allocated 
for 
Human Settlements Development.  That is an 
amount of approximately R1.4 billion.” 
Now in another form that statement was put to the HOD Mr 
Mokoena at the time and as well as to Mr Maxatshwa who 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 141 of 198 
 
was on the ground in the construction of houses.  You know 
that correct? 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  They have conceded that that – to 
put it at its mildest was a gross exaggeration and could 
never have been achieved. 
MR ZWANE:  Well I am just – I just – opportunity arising 
would have been, why would they have kept quiet when the 
statement was issued?  Because the executive management 
would not allow any media statement that is in the direct 
10 
opposite of what is happening in the department to test he 
should … 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well firstly it is in direct opposite of 
what you said in your statement but secondly, they gave the 
reason to the Chair.  They said it was to avoid forfeiting 
money to the fiscus.  That was the purpose of that 
representation.   
MR ZWANE:  Well let me say Chair that – that was never 
brought to my attention.  Why – our main aim as politicians 
me seated here – my main concern was not money.  I want to 
20 
put it to this commission.   
My main concern was the people who were promised 
houses and money was there for them to own at least and 
have a shelter and those people are going to lose.  And in so 
saying I thought that officials would do their best to achieve 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 142 of 198 
 
what we could achieve and where we cannot achieve come 
back and say to me this is how far we have gone and we 
could not achieve to build the total number of houses we 
were supposed to build because of time frames and so forth.  
I would have accepted that.   
So if they say a statement was issued to try and deal 
with those issues having an opportunity, I do not see how 
this statement would have helped.  Because the reality of the 
matter is that the National Department and the Minister will 
be 
guided 
by 
milestones 
what 
has 
been 
happening 
10 
practically and that will be taken not out of the statement it 
will be taken out of BAS which was the system – financial 
system which was used at that particular time and that 
mention will be made.   
So issuing such a statement and come and say the 
statement was meant to try and mitigate.  From where I am 
seated Chair will be mild because if you wanted to try and 
achieve the only way of doing that was to go to the ground, 
do the best that we can and achieve what we can achieve.  If 
we failed allow the money to go back because we could not 
20 
keep money if we could not perform.  That was as simple as 
that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But throughout this morning and this 
afternoon’s evidence you have deferred to your officials in 
regard to the facts.  In fact in the last half an hour you have 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 143 of 198 
 
made it clear that you did not have all the facts.   
That is why you say you could make a statement as 
you made regarding the 50 houses and it was the people on 
the ground that knew the facts.  They have come to this 
commission this week and they have said these projections 
that they would spend 100% by the end of the year were 
grossly exaggerated.   
And they have said there was no chance that these 
figures would have been met.  And they said the reason for 
the misrepresentation was to ensure the money was not lost.  
10 
They have told the Chair that.  They are the ones that you 
say would know the facts.  You say you did not know the 
facts.  Why would they be lying to the commission?  What 
purpose would it serve for them to do so? 
MR ZWANE:  I am saying Chair if I may?  That I have eluded 
that I was not part of this statement.  I am saying from where 
I am seated if I were them rather than issuing a statement 
that is incorrect that will stay as a record that we need to 
talk about here.   
I would rather preferred a route that will go down and 
20 
do the actual job and when the time comes we surrender 
what we need to surrender if we need to surrender.  Because 
in terms of the recovery plan if I recall well the recovery plan 
was also in line with this statement that now we will be able 
to achieve what we need to achieve.   
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 144 of 198 
 
So I can see now that the statement lacks objectivity, 
I have said that and however I do not accept their reasons in 
that – that was the right way to – to actually do things.  I do 
not accept that reason that is what I was trying to say. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Well if you look at the 
statement the third last paragraph reads: 
“The department is on track to build a total of 
10 500 RDP houses.” 
You see that? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that must have meant it was on track 
to build those – that number of houses by end of the 
financial year. 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Well let us look at FS14 page 
225 please. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the Recovery Plan? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That is FS14. 
MR ZWANE:  Page 225. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Page 223 that is the page that I want 
20 
to refer Mr Zwane to is on page 225.  You recognise that 
document? 
MR ZWANE:  [not speaking into the microphone]. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Did you sign that document? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes Chair. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 145 of 198 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What is this document? 
MR ZWANE:  2010/2011 housing allocations. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right so it was the intention I 
understand it to build the houses in this allocation list during 
the financial year, correct? 
MR ZWANE:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The total of the allocations appears 
on page 225 and it reflects a figure of 20 950.  Do you see 
that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is not easy to see that figure.  I thought 
10 
that it is … 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It is not easy to see it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was 1 350 because it is shaded. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it is 209 either 50 or 60. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Ja.  Our reading is 29 – 20950 but I 
am happy to settle for 2090. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Ja.  Are you able to read that figure 
Mr Zwane? 
MR ZWANE:  With all the difficulties that is presented to me 
20 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay yes what is certainly 20 900 and 
either 50 or 60. 
MR ZWANE:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So when the – and that was the 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 146 of 198 
 
projected allocation for the financial year.  You have said 
that. 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So when the press statement says 
they are on track to build 10 500 houses that is give or take 
200 houses half of the intended allocation.  Correct? 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Anyway we dealt with the media 
statement Mr Zwane at your instance.  If I could take you 
back please to the Expenditure Recovery Plan. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before that Mr Pretorius.  Mr Zwane you 
said this media statement was prepared by the department 
and not you.  I take it that it would have been approved by 
the Head of Department to say the least.  Is that right? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you see it before it was published – 
sent out to the – into the media? 
MR ZWANE:  No I did not Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Head of Department did not let you 
see it before it went out to the media? 
20 
MR ZWANE:  No I do not recall being invited to see this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ZWANE:  Before it went out in the media. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not recall having seen it before it 
went out into the media you or you do recall that it was not 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 147 of 198 
 
given to you before it went out? 
MR ZWANE:  It was not given to me Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was not given to you? 
MR ZWANE:  No it was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I guess you – I guess you would have 
become aware of it once it had been published in the media? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes Chair I would have been. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would have been yes.  Now apart from 
reading whatever the media wrote after receiving it I take it 
that you would have been favoured or you would have asked 
10 
for the actual full copy of the statement?   
In other words you – you would not have been 
content to just read what the newspaper – newspapers say 
the statement said.  You would have said I want to see the 
actual statement or they would have – the officials would 
have given that to you on their own – the actual statement. 
MR ZWANE:  Well Chair it – that is not normal in the course 
of us doing work.  What we normally do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ZWANE:  Which may be in hindsight not complete.  If a 
20 
statement has been given and we have not seen it and it is 
grossly incorrect you call the HOD and raise your issue – 
your dissatisfaction and find a way forward in terms of what 
do you do next.  On the hindsight Chair, because we are 
discussing this matter, this statement was actually given 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 148 of 198 
 
despite the fact that the department had issued a letter in 
2011, January on the 12t h.  I think the letter is attached here 
also.  Should you wish to go to the letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  We can look at it if you think there is 
something important, a point that you ...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   There is something important but let me raise 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   We will go to the later if ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Later. 
10 
MR ZWANE:   ...if you want us to do that.  The BG had 
written to the HOD, indicating ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The Director General of the National 
Department ...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...had written to the HOD of your 
department? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Indicating that on the 12th...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of January 2011? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   A decision had been arrived at to start the 
allocation of February and March, right? 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 149 of 198 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   Now if you look at that and we already 
consoled(?) with the reason that was given earlier on by the 
leader of evidence that when the HOD was here, there is... 
the intention was to try and secure the fund.  A letter...  
 
He was already with a matter from the Director General 
written on the 12t h of January that we are not going to 
allocate you for the month of February and March.   
 
I just want to bring that to the attention that... and there 
was a lot happening at that level which I happened to know 
10 
about at a later stage.   
 
And which I am struggling to reconcile where I am 
seated.  I thought I should bring that also to the fore so that, 
as the Commission sees(?), the Commission should also 
consider what I am saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.  Definitely it will and I know the 
letter you are talking about.  I have read it.  But my question 
was whether after the media statement of the department 
had been issued to the media, either you asked for a full... a 
copy of the full statement to be brought to you or whether 
20 
the department on its own without you even asking, 
furnished you with this statement, full statement. 
MR ZWANE:   I recall when I... what I requested was the... to 
be taken through the progress. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 150 of 198 
 
MR ZWANE:   Because to me what was important was, are 
we achieving what we need to achieve? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR ZWANE:   And I was taken ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please raise your voice.  It has gone done 
now.  Ja, I think it has been a long day.   
MR ZWANE:   And naturally Chair, I have a soft voice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]  Yes okay. 
MR ZWANE:   In hindsight, I should have taken the advice 
that I should come... they got another ...[indistinct]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]  Ja.   
MR ZWANE:   Chair ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   To ...[indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   [laughing]  I requested that they should take 
me through the progress Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is now the HOD and senior officials? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   Because to me, at that particular time, not 
knowing the intention, I thought:  Wow!  It means it was done 
20 
actually performed what was there.   
 
And I should indicate Chair that HOD was not here 
during that December despite the fact that where I(?) had 
indicated the seriousness of this issue that people will lose 
what they were going to benefit.   
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 151 of 198 
 
 
I gave into his request by arrangement.  And so I 
thought he was briefed properly when he comes back.  But 
then I was given figures and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am not preventing you from telling me 
what happened but I just remind you of my question.  
Namely, whether after this media statement had been issued 
to the media.  In way or another, you did have sight of the 
full statement, whether because you requested it or whether 
the officials out of their own gave you a copy of the full 
statement. 
10 
MR ZWANE:   If I recall it, it was hundred percent or there 
about put in the media.  The media did not select... the 
media will no more ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Okay. 
MR ZWANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
So 
you 
saw 
the 
full 
statement 
...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   I saw it from the media, yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  And that would... this 
statement is dated 20 January 2010.  Oh, I am sorry.  They 
must have meant 2011. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, this is 2011 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because it is stated 2010. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 152 of 198 
 
MR ZWANE:   No, the second paragraph is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No,  what I am thinking.  I see, at 
the 
top 
there, 
it 
says 
twenty... 
on 
page 
596 
says 
20 January 2010.  So I am saying, it must be because 
sometimes when it is January, people keep on using the 
previous year when they made this.  This could only have 
been January 2011.  Is that right? 
MR ZWANE:   Paragraph number 2 corrects that mistake 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
MR ZWANE:   I saw that mistake but it is corrected in 
paragraph 2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Which says ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR ZWANE:   ...as of the date 20 January 2011. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright. 
MR ZWANE:   It was previous Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you saw these figures and you say as 
a result of having read this media statement that came from 
20 
the department, you asked officials to take you through the 
process and you wanted to be given a full update given the 
media statement that had been issued.  Is that right? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes.  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay.  The one part which I have 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 153 of 198 
 
some or one of the parts I have some difficulty with, with 
which I want to you get a chance to deal with is that it seems 
you... When the process was stopped in mid-January or soon 
thereafter, you did not know how many houses had been 
completed.   
 
Now that is a little strange to me because I think in your 
affidavit you say that you reported back to the... back to 
Exco after the holidays.   
 
And I would have thought that you would have made 
sure you knew how many houses had been completed so that 
10 
you would report accurately.  Do you want to say anything on 
that? 
MR ZWANE:   I get the point that the Chair is raising. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR ZWANE:   In terms of my understanding Chair.  When I 
went to Exco, it was not at the time when this project did 
stop.  It was at the time when I was going to report the work 
that was done, the progress made during the holidays when I 
had the chance.  I did not went to report that.   
 
I understand the question raised by the Chair to be 
20 
saying, every time when the project was stopped, did you 
know the figures?  I am saying no.  And that is the different 
time from the time when I went to Exco to report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you report to Exco before mid-January 
or after? 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 154 of 198 
 
MR ZWANE:   I had raised the point Chair that the letter by 
Mr Thembani Zulu, the DG, the former DG at that particular 
time.  I was not privy to the letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR ZWANE:   So when I reported, I did not know that a letter 
has already been issued.  If I am ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
That 
is 
now 
the 
letter 
of 
the 
12t h of January? 
MR ZWANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR ZWANE:   It did not get to my attention.  So then I 
reported to Exco.  I was under the understanding that we are 
still continuing and we may reach the target. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But was it before mid-January when you 
reported to Exco? 
MR ZWANE:   I think so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or after? 
MR ZWANE:   No, I think so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR ZWANE:   Because normally we will open the first week 
20 
late or early second week. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of January? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   And then we begin to... during that week, we 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 155 of 198 
 
will meet at Exco. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Where we commit(?) the way forward.  And 
that is when we will be able to... can present. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now, your report to Exco about progress 
made, would it have been in writing or would it have been a 
verbal report? 
MR ZWANE:   It would have been in writing.  You normally 
10 
write a memo Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Or if the Exco was hastily called as normally... 
that is the case in January and you are asked to report, you 
then can have a report with you and report to Exco they will 
accept. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay.  When you... when the 
officials took you through the process at your request after 
20 
they have issued this media statement, the figures that were 
in the media statement, were they vastly different from your 
understanding of the progress that had been made or were 
they not? 
MR ZWANE:   Well, Chair as a person who was on the 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 156 of 198 
 
ground, myself, as I have alluded earlier on, that I did not 
touch base with all the corners of the province because 
building was happening in all the corners of the... Maybe I 
should allude to the fact that these figures were much higher 
than what I would have presented ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   ...as a person.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Obviously, that would have been of 
10 
concern to you?  Namely, that the figures that are being... 
that the department had told the public, were vastly different 
from your understanding of the progress that had been 
made. 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And did you raise these with the officials, 
including the HOD, to say, your figures are vastly different 
from my understanding of the progress that we have made 
and I am the one who was here during the holidays. How 
come?  Show me that your figures are correct and mine are 
20 
not correct because we cannot mislead the public.  Did you 
say that? 
MR ZWANE:   We actually had a meeting because my 
approve(?) was not what the Chair’s relation...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]  Is mine confrontational? 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 157 of 198 
 
MR ZWANE:   Well, Chair the understanding is, if sometimes 
you do that, you... the best way of doing it is to want to get 
evidence.  So I took that route.   
 
That:  Well, okay.  I mean, I did not go to all these 
corners and I may not have a clear picture but I was on the 
ground.  Let us bring the figures and try and reconcile.  It is 
during that meeting where we had some/sharp(?) discussions 
took place.   
 
I think it was around the end or early February of these 
issues.  Now I remember when I was supposed to take... 
10 
draw up a programme to go and see what is on the ground 
myself.   
 
And subsequently, I was then from that department, I 
think around the 8t h/9t h of February.  But otherwise, there 
was a programme that we will go together and verify these 
numbers.   
 
Because I believed that as much as I was interrogating 
the report, what was going to be of importance is to try and 
see what is on the ground.  And I think that roster was done.  
It was going to be the roster that will take me through to 
20 
March.   
 
Because in March, had I stayed, I would be making a 
new policy statement and that policy statement was going to 
be informed about what I have seen on the ground despite 
those that I opened myself.  And unfortunately, I could not 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 158 of 198 
 
proceed Chair.  As I have said, I had to go to another 
department. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, it is rather strange to me that in 
regard to a matter where the national minister had spoken to 
you in regard to a matter about which the national minister 
had 
spoken 
to 
you 
namely 
the 
under-expenditure 
or 
performance of the department in spending the conditional 
allowed allocation.   
 
The department should issue a statement such as this 
giving vastly different figures from what you understood to 
10 
be the position and they do not check with you.  Or they do 
not say, before we issue it, this is what we are going to be 
saying to the public.   
 
And indeed, actually, when you look at the statement 
more than the public, it seems to have been a response to 
the national minister’s statement to say, you say you are 
going to take away money from us.   
 
We are saying, no we are not going release any money 
or we not going to allow that because we are doing very well.  
But you say they issued that without telling you what they 
20 
are going to tell the public beforehand. 
MR ZWANE:   The... if I participated in the compilation of the 
statement Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR ZWANE:   And this is not how we normally communicate 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 159 of 198 
 
amongst ourselves as leaders. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   I am a firm believer of persuasion.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   Eye-to-eye.  Say my view.  And if I am 
defeated, accept the outcome of the meeting.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR ZWANE:   I am not a believer in standing out there and 
making my point.  When you had called me in the meeting... 
the minister had called to ask to a meeting.  Raised this 
10 
point professionally with us.  And the minister has powers at 
the end of the day to implement according to his programme.   
 
If we were to try and convince the minister the best way 
was not to go to the media.  I put it here.  That is why I 
raised it earlier on.   
 
And the best way was to try and persuade the minister 
and that best way would have been informed by the problem 
I had suggested that I have seen this thing.  This is how far 
we have moved.  Give us a chance, we will finish.   
 
I was reluctant myself to immediately, according to the 
20 
report that I have, act against all four.  Because I thought 
having a concrete evidence of what is on the ground, will 
actually put me in a better place to can speak with the 
minister going forward.  But I do get your point Chair.  The 
point you are raising. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 160 of 198 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   This afternoon sometime, you 
mentioned a letter from the National Department of Human 
Settlements dated the 12t h of January.  It is a letter that was 
addressed to eh head of department in the Free State and it 
is dated the 12t h of January.   
 
That was the national department giving notice to the 
provincial department that the further allocations were being 
stopped.  You recall you spoke of that letter? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Was that letter drawn to your 
attention? 
MR ZWANE:   As alluded.  No, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Sorry? 
MR ZWANE:   As I have alluded earlier on that I did not know 
about this letter. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   I only found out later. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Found 
later 
before 
you 
left 
the 
20 
department? 
MR ZWANE:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   After you had left the department? 
MR ZWANE:   After I had left the department. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 161 of 198 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you know that payments had 
been haltered? 
MR ZWANE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Surely, I mean, one would have 
expected and there are many unexpected things that did 
happen.  I will concede that immediately.  But one would 
have 
expected 
that 
having 
received 
notification 
that 
payments are being stopped, you would have been told. 
MR ZWANE:   I have raised the issue of the letter myself 
Chair. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay. 
MR ZWANE:   And I have said, I did... I do not see a point 
why the statement in the first place was issued when this 
letter was there.   
 
Because there... with all respect, the leader of the 
evidence had just said, the officials I am speaking about 
were here, right?   
 
And this is what they said.  And to go back and direct... 
this letter was meant to try and secure the funds not to be 
taken.  Now, I am saying to this Commission.   
20 
 
When I came across this letter that I am being asked 
about, I did not see the wisdom of issuing a media 
statement.   
 
I mean, the letter was there.  The allocation was taken 
already.  As I have alluded, I would have done it differently 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 162 of 198 
 
Chair and... but the fact...  
 
Upon the point you are asking me through you Chair is 
that, did I know about this letter?  I said no I did not know.  
Had I known, I would have reported to Exco and ensured that 
that process is duly stopped.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  Well, Mr Zwane the media 
statement itself explains its purpose and that is to respond 
to a media statement issued by the national department quite 
critical of the provincial department.  That is what it says. 
MR ZWANE:   [No audible reply]  
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But anyway.  I do not want 
to...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   I ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is not your statement. 
MR ZWANE:   I have answered that Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I do not want to go into the motive of 
this statement. 
MR ZWANE:   Ja, I have answered it to say, I would have 
done it differently. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
20 
MR ZWANE:   And I in detail explained my way of doing 
things.  As a leader in that department, I would have done 
things differently.  And that is what I have said. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is your understanding of that media 
statement the same as mine?   
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 163 of 198 
 
 
As I read the statement, it seems to me that the 
department was adopting a rather confrontational approach 
towards the national department or national minister to say, 
you want to take money from us because you say we are not 
performing.  We want to tell you that we are performing and 
we do not agree with what you are saying.   
 
Is your interpretation the same as mine of what the 
statement 
is 
about? 
 
Or 
have 
you 
got 
a 
different 
understanding or interpretation? 
MR ZWANE:   In my own words Chair, I have said I would 
10 
have preferred the statement to be polite.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   This is what I have said. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So... yes. 
MR ZWANE:   The...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 You 
would 
have 
wanted 
it 
to 
be 
conciliatory? 
MR ZWANE:   If your provincial department, there is no way 
you can stand against your own government, your own 
minister who have allocated to you and it is up to you to 
20 
deliver and you have challenges and you resort back... begin 
to be confrontational as the Chair says.   
 
What... how would that help you in the process?  
Because the best way was to try and engage or adhere, 
meaning, that the minister has all the powers to take and 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 164 of 198 
 
then ignore the statement.  The statement would have never 
scared(?) the minister as far as I know the minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If we can go Mr Zwane, finally, to the 
document FS14 page 226. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You said you recognised this 
document as the expenditure recovery plan for 2010/2011 
prepared by the Department of Human Settlements, Free 
State. 
10 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
It 
must 
have 
predated 
November 2010 because we know it was presented to a 
MINMAC meeting in November 2010.   
MR ZWANE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Correct? 
MR ZWANE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   This document originated before 
19 November 2011? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, that is correct. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay. 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Were you made aware of the 
contents of this document?  After all, this document was 
prepared on your instruction, having received that instruction 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 165 of 198 
 
from the national minister. 
MR ZWANE:   This... the statement you are talking about and 
the recovery plan were not developed all at the same time.  
The recovery plan took into consideration the allocation, the 
earlier allocation made by the department.  And this 
allocation was then included to be part of the recovery plan 
in terms of how I understand the sequence of events. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes but was this the plan that 
emerged from the exercise you instructed the officials of the 
department to do? 
10 
MR ZWANE:   I believe so Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Let us go to FS14, page 
234, please. 
MR ZWANE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now there have been various 
statements 
made 
by 
witnesses 
this 
week 
as 
to 
the 
projections listed on page 234 of FS14 and I would just like 
to put them before you.   
 
The projections for cash flow expenditure showed that 
there would have been by November 8500 foundations and 
20 
an 
expenditure 
in 
respect 
of 
those 
foundations 
of 
R 170 million.  Do you see that? 
MR ZWANE:   Are we talking about... where are we now?  I 
am lost here, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Sorry, go to page 234, please. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 166 of 198 
 
MR ZWANE:   Of the black numbers? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   I like going to the red numbers.  I do not know 
why. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   [laughing]   
MR ZWANE:   Yes, I found that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is a luxury today. 
MR ZWANE:   [laughing]  Ja, sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think he wants you to repeat your 
question, Mr Pretorius. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  This cash flow projection in 
this document presumable prepared during November of 
October of 23010, says that by November 2010, 8500 
foundations would have been laid. 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   An expenditure of R 170 million.  
3500 wall plates would have been erected at an expenditure 
of R86 593 500.  Was that achieved?  Was it remotely 
achievable when in January on the most favourable 
projections in the press statement they were only on track 
20 
to complete 21 500 houses by the end of March.  But 
anyway, let me not enter into comparisons at the moment, 
let me just ask you, Mr Zwane, the plain question, was that 
achievable?  Was it achieved? 
MR ZWANE:    Chair, if I may say, looking back at the 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 167 of 198 
 
recovery plan interrogating it thoroughly, it has loopholes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It has? 
MR ZWANE:   Loopholes.  Loopholes like it was ambitious 
document which I would have understood at that particular 
time that people would have had to put their shoulder on 
the blade to ensure that this is achieved and I think it is a 
well-known fact that that was not achieved. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So whatever adjective we use and 
many adjectives have been used this week, loopholes is a 
new one.  Is it fair to say that this is not realistic or 
10 
accurate? 
MR ZWANE:   I think so, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We know at least that the purpose 
of this plan was to respond to the Minister ’s directive that 
such a plan be provided so that they could consider 
whether funds should be withheld or not, correct? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you know whether the figures that 
were put into this plan at page 233, that is the page we are 
looking at, do you know whether before those figures were 
20 
put in there in terms of how many houses would be at 
foundation stage, how many would be wall plate, how many 
completions?  Do you know whether somebody did the 
necessary homework, practical homework whether this 
could be done at a practical level looking at all the issues?  
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 168 of 198 
 
Do we have – have we appointed contractors, are the 
contractors we have appointed – will they be able to do 
this within such and such a time?  Are there processes that 
must be followed?  Will they not cause delays?  Or did 
somebody just sit in the office and put in a wish list to say 
this is what we wish to achieve? 
MR ZWANE:   Well, Chair, I think this process included a 
number of stakeholders and contractors should also have 
been consulted and on the strength of those consultations, 
I believe this document was then developed.  As I have 
10 
said, I have not entirely been in the process of the 
development of this document but as things stands today 
you can see that this was an ambitious document, to say 
the least, but people had committed that with all the 
resources we have in place, this is achievable, as I was 
informed by the HOD and I accepted that explanation, 
Chair because all what this explanation had said to me and 
it meant at that particular time is that anyway, we cannot 
deceive the Minister by being ambitious, the reality is 
going to come when a financial report is given to the 
20 
Minister.  The reality will be there and the Minister will 
make a determination based on that reality. 
 
What I saw this document doing at that particular 
point in time was to push officials and everybody harder to 
try and achieve.  Although I would have preferred a 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 169 of 198 
 
document that would have been specific to the point but I 
must say in this Commission that having attended a 
meeting with contractors and so forth, some of the issues 
they would say they would be able to achieve, they would 
not achieve at the end of the day.  I think I must make that 
point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But when you were given this document 
did you say to the officials, for example, you people are 
saying by December the department will have completed 
building 3 000 houses, tell me how you are going to 
10 
achieve that?  Persuade me that what you have written 
here is convincing.  How are you going to achieve, we – I 
do not know what month you were talking about, let us say 
maybe it was October or maybe September when you were 
given this but we know it was before 19 November or early 
November.   
Did you say explain to me how that is going to be 
achieved because when we say to the Minister or when we 
say to the public by end of December – or when I say to 
Exco by end of December we will have built 3 000 houses, 
20 
if they ask me or if the National Minister asks me how are 
you going to achieve that in circumstances where over six 
months before October of the financial year you had not 
built a single house, from what I have been told by the 
witnesses, 
from 
this 
allocation, 
not 
from 
previous 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 170 of 198 
 
allocations?  Did you ask that question, say tell me how 
you are going to achieve that, let me see whether you are 
talking about something achievable? 
MR ZWANE:   As I have alluded, Chair, the stance I took 
was to say to the officials, is this what you think you can 
achieve?  Can I hold you accountable to this?  And they 
did agree that you can hold us accountable.  If I recall I 
even 
went 
to 
the 
extent 
of 
saying 
there 
will 
be 
repercussions we you do not achieve according to what you 
are presenting to me and we agreed.  Hence most of the 
10 
officials committed themselves and worked during holidays 
and I left it at that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Am I correct then in understanding your 
answer to my question to be that you did not ask the 
question of how they would achieve but you asked for an 
assurance that they would achieve these figures and you 
said 
well, 
if 
they 
are 
not 
achieved 
there 
will 
be 
consequences? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Mr Pretorius? 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We have evidence, Mr Zwane, that 
this 
expenditure 
recovery 
plan 
was 
presented 
to 
a 
technical 
Minmec 
meeting 
on 
the 
28 
October 
2010.  
Technical Minmec we have learnt is a meeting of officials 
that the department and other officials, Director Generals 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 171 of 198 
 
of 
Deputy 
Director 
General 
dealing 
with 
operational 
matters, correct? 
MR ZWANE:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   According to the evidence of Mr 
Maxatshwa, he said that at that meeting the ERP was 
questioned and it was certainly not accepted.  Do you have 
any knowledge of that? 
MR ZWANE:   No, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It was presented again at the 
technical Minmec meeting the following month on the 18 
10 
November 2010.  We have the minutes of that meeting, that 
is in bundle FS12 at 309.    
MR ZWANE:   309? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  If you look at paragraphs 
3.2.2 under the heading Free State Province, the minute 
reads: 
“The plan, as presented, does not demonstrate the 
ability of the province to spend the R1.42 billion 
from now until the end of March 2011.” 
Do you see that? 
20 
MR ZWANE:   Can I be helped Chair? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 3.2.2 on FS12, 309.  If 
you want a red number I will give it to you. 
MR ZWANE:   Oh, FS12. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am just waiting for you to say you 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 172 of 198 
 
have enough for the day, sir. 
MR ZWANE:   I am with you, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You see paragraph 3.2.2 on that 
page?  It says: 
“The plan, as presented, does not demonstrate the 
ability of the province to spend the R1.42 billion 
from now until the end of March 2011.” 
It seems to be the consensus but this was expressed as 
early as November 2010.  Do you see that? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What I wanted to ask you was the 
evidence says that that was reported back to you.  Was it? 
MR ZWANE:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That statement should not surprise you, 
Mr Zwane, should it, namely that the plan, as presented, 
does not demonstrate the ability of the province to spend 
the R1.4 billion from then until March 2011 because the 
plan that we have been talking about did not indicate how 
those figures would be achieved, it just puts the figures 
almost like the targets but did not say now those targets 
20 
would be achieved.  So I am saying in the light of that, this 
statement should not surprise you.  Do you agree? 
MR ZWANE:   I said earlier on when I looked at the plan, 
interrogated it, I found it to be a very ambitious plan. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You found it..? 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 173 of 198 
 
MR ZWANE:   And ambitious plan. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
MR ZWANE:   I did raise that point earlier on, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no, you did. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But what I am saying is, when the 
Minmec or whatever the body was that met here, which 
included the Director General of the National Department, 
when this meeting says the plan, as presented, does not 
demonstrate the ability of the province to spend the R1,4 
10 
billion from then until the end of March 2011.  When the 
plan does not have anything to say how these targets 
would be achieved, one should not expect it to be 
persuasive because the National Department would be 
saying we can see that you are telling us that you are 
going to achieve 3 000 houses by end of December that 
would 
be 
completed 
but 
you 
have 
put 
nothing 
that 
persuades us that you are right in thinking that you will 
achieve that.  You accept that? 
MR ZWANE:   I understand it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You understand that. 
MR ZWANE:   I understand, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MR ZWANE:   That the plan lacked the how. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, the plan lacked the how, ja.  
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 174 of 198 
 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The technical Minmec meeting held 
on the 18 November, you were not an invitee to that 
meeting, I understand. 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We know that that meeting said 
what it did about the plan being unachievable or not 
demonstrating that it was achievable, that was minuted.  
Would you have been recipient of those minutes? 
10 
MR ZWANE:   No, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  It was followed by a 
meeting the next day of Minmec, not technical Minmec but 
Minmec.  Who attends Minmec meetings? 
MR ZWANE:   The Minister attends, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Sorry?  The MEC and the Minister. 
MR ZWANE:   The MEC and the Minister attends. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Ja, so the MECs of the various 
departments around the country plus the National Minister. 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We understand that you did not 
attend that meeting. 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But would you have known – well, 
you must have known that that meeting was going to 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 175 of 198 
 
address important issues for your department including the 
matter of the budget, correct, the funds? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You would have received the 
minutes of that meeting. 
MR ZWANE:   I would have received the report. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And did you receive a report? 
MR ZWANE:   From the officials when coming back. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, who actually did attend on 
behalf of the department. 
10 
MR ZWANE:   On behalf of the HOD because the HOD on 
behalf of the department was supposed to be there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And he was not? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So Mr Maxatshwa attended, is that 
right? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did he report back to you? 
MR ZWANE:   Mr Maxatshwa will actually report to the 
HOD, not to me. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did the HOD then report to you? 
MR ZWANE:   The HOD reported that in my knowledge they 
needed to readjust something in terms of the recovery 
plan, as the report the feedback from the meeting which I 
said go ahead and do. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 176 of 198 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  The evidence that was 
given this week, Mr Zwane, was that the technical Minmec 
rejection of the plan and its observation was confirmed by 
the National Minmec and that minute appears at page 314 
of FS12 and if you would go to page 319 please? 
MR ZWANE:   319. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   By the way, did you attend any 
Minmec meetings during your term? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, I did, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You did? 
10 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, I did. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But this one not. 
MR ZWANE:   Ja, this one I did not, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you look at page 319 you will 
see: 
“Provincial Expenditure Reports on the Integrated 
Housing 
and 
Human 
Settlements 
Development 
Grant and Delivery Trends for the Period Ended 31 
October 2010.  The meeting noted a presentation by 
a Mr Mnyane.” 
20 
Who was he?  Who is he?  Do you know who he was at the 
time? 
MR ZWANE:   Mr Mnyane? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Does not matter.   
MR ZWANE:   I do not recall that name, Chair.

ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In any event, paragraph 3.2 says: 
“Minmec agrees with the following recommendations 
of technical Minmec in relation to the interventions 
around expenditure patterns, shifting of funds from 
nonperforming provinces in the interest of services 
delivery.   Provinces must invest more on planning.” 
And thirdly: 
“Approval processes in the provinces must include 
consideration for bulk infrastructure.” 
Now that is obviously a cryptic minute, information from Mr 
10 
Maxatshwa, who attended a meeting, was firstly that the 
expenditure recovery plan was not accepted.  Secondly, 
that this was ultimately reported to you.  
MR ZWANE:   This was widely covered even on the media, 
I must allude to that fact.  There were processes that 
followed that meeting because if you read the letter that I 
referred to from DG Thabane Zulu dated the 12 January, it 
says: 
“Despite the fact that you have been given seven 
days in January to try and convince us why funds 
20 
should not be taken, we now provoke (sic) the 
following the sections according to the DORA Act 
and we will not allocate anymore to you.” 
That was in January 2011, closing this matter, bringing 
finality to the matter.  I did not understand this meeting to 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 178 of 198 
 
be saying as of the 19 November we should surrender all 
the money.  As I am indicating, that that letter was actually 
saying you may have failed in convincing the department 
within seven days and that is when the final allocation was 
taken and I have alluded to the fact, Chair, that I did not 
know about that letter earlier on and if there would be a 
question that says you continued after that, I think that will 
be understood in that context. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Would you please go to FS12 page 
255?   
10 
MR ZWANE:   455? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that two double five? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Two double five. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of FS12. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That appears to be a letter 
addressed to yourself, Mr Zwane, it is dated, as is 
apparent from page 257, the 9 December 2010 and it is 
signed by the National Minister at the time, Mr Sexwale 
and it seems that Premier Magashule may have been 
20 
copied but we do not know that but that signature of Mr 
Sexwale seems to be the signature attached to the name 
there.  Do you see that? 
MR ZWANE:   I see that letter. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do you recall receiving this letter 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 179 of 198 
 
dated the 9 December 2010? 
MR ZWANE:   Well, I see the letter, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It says: 
“This letter serves to notify you of the intention to 
withhold part of your 2010/2011 allocation due to 
the reported under spending in line with DORA 2010 
stipulations provided by Section 16.1 (c).” 
Again, did you receive this letter? 
MR ZWANE:   I think I received this letter, Chair, I think 
so. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It says, goes on to say – you will 
see a highlighted portion on page 256: 
“As 
you 
may 
know, 
an 
assessment 
of 
your 
department’s 
recovery 
plan 
presented 
to 
the 
technical 
Minmec 
held 
on 
18 
November 
2010 
revealed that the plan does not demonstrate ability 
to spend the entire budget before the end of this 
current financial year.” 
You were told that in the letter, correct? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It does on to say: 
“In view of under expenditure, the Minmec meeting 
held 
on 
19 
November 
2010 
considered 
the 
recommendations by the technical Minmec which 
indicates, amongst others, that funds should be 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 180 of 198 
 
transferred to provinces that have shown the ability 
to spend.” 
That would have been reported to you, apparent from the 
minute. 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The letter goes on to say: 
“Please be informed that an amount of R263 million 
will be withheld from your 2010/2011 allocation…” 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    
10 
“…done with a view to request National Treasury to 
stop and reallocate such funding to other provinces 
that are in need of additional funding and have 
demonstrated a good spending performance.” 
Correct? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It goes on to say: 
“You 
are 
therefore 
advised 
to 
submit 
written 
representation by 15 December 2010 as to why the 
allocation should not be withheld failure of which 
20 
will 
result 
with 
funds 
being 
withheld 
for 
reallocation.” 
And then in handwriting at the bottom of the page: 
“Kindly treat this as urgent.  Sincerely…” 
And then it seems to me that that is the Premier ’s 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 181 of 198 
 
handwriting and his signature at the bottom of the page, is 
that correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said Premier, you mean the 
Minister? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No, I mean Premier, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I may be wrong but …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It may be a note appended by the 
Minister, it may be a note appended by the Premier, it is 
10 
not clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  No, no, no, that is fine 
[inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do you know whose handwriting 
that is? 
MR ZWANE:   No, I cannot recall, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, alright. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But anyway, whoever it was, it was 
someone senior to you. 
MR ZWANE:   It may appear that the letter was sent 
20 
through the office of the Premier and it was then brought 
…[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   To you. 
MR ZWANE:   To you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes but whoever said what was 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 182 of 198 
 
said there, there was an additional comment either from 
the Premier or from the National Minister that you should 
treat it as urgent, correct? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Were any representations made?  
Well, let me ask you this first.  Perhaps it is fairer to say 
did you receive this and when you received it, what did you 
do? 
MR ZWANE:   My officials were inundated with the 
response, as I alluded earlier on, Chair, that even when a 
10 
report came through the HOD, which was made by Mr 
Maxatshwa, I agreed that they should respond as a matter 
of urgency and in this case, the letter of the 12 t h will 
indicate our response to this matter because the letter of 
the 12 t h says we have not convinced the department in 
terms of this matter that we are dealing with, the National 
Department, so they are invoking the necessary sections of 
DORA to take the money to take the money. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is your answer therefore to the question 
that the department did not make a written response within 
20 
the time given in this letter. 
MR ZWANE:   No the department was instructed to make 
written representations. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but what I did ...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   I think they did Chair, I think they did ja, I 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 183 of 198 
 
may not recall the details ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Ja, I may not recall the details thereof. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would you have seen what they sent to 
the National Department as their representations of the 
department or would you not have seen that at the time? 
MR ZWANE:   In this case I take that at issue here was a 
recovery plan that was not convincing.  There are two 
issues that needed to happen, to try and give up that 
recovery plan to include the help-out which has been 
10 
debated in this Commission and then to send it back to the 
National Government and see if they would accept this or 
not, and I – that is the instruction I have written Chair.   I 
should raise this point that it is on record that when – it is 
not me who rejected the recovery plan.  The recovery plan 
was rejected by National raising these pertinent issues, 
where officials were and when that gets reported to me I 
then said let’s do everything in our power to ensure that we 
don’t low on the basis of other presentation to the National 
Department.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So is your answer to my question that 
you did not see the representations that may have been 
made? 
MR ZWANE:   I can’t recall Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You can’t recall whether you saw it or 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 184 of 198 
 
not. 
MR ZWANE:   Ja, no I can’t recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well I am not sure that the matter 
can be fairly left there Mr Zwane, this letter from the 
National 
Minister 
said 
we 
are 
going 
to 
deprive 
the 
department of over R200million unless you convince us 
that you can fairly and reasonably spend the money within 
the time.  We know of no response and it seems to be 
confirmed by the letter at FS14268 of the 12 t h of January 
10 
to which you have referred, which says we haven’t been 
furnished with reasons as to why the allocation should not 
be withheld because the time has now expired. 
 
That is the important of the letter of 12 January, 
now can I suggest to you that our investigations and the 
evidence that we have given does not indicate any further 
expenditure recovery plan, revised expenditure recovery 
plan being submitted to the National Department, and the 
reason for that is simple that it just simply was not 
achievable and that is consistent with all the evidence, 
20 
including yours. 
MR ZWANE:   I may not deny that Chair but what I may 
raise at this point I was looking at when the letter was 
written and I can see that the deadline was the 15 t h of 
December 2010 and this letter was signed on the 5 t h of 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 185 of 198 
 
December, at the office of the Premier, at that particular 
time.  There were processes that had been put in place and 
some of the processes are the processes that we are 
deliberating on today.    
 
In November there were processes that were put 
together, we met with the contractors, they suggested what 
...[indistinct] they even went to work over weekends and 
we were going to work during December. 
 
Now to me at that particular time and then not 
disputing the fact that I can’t have facts with me here, I 
10 
can’t 
recall 
properly, 
to 
me 
there 
were 
tangible 
programmes 
that 
would 
have 
been 
submitted 
to 
the 
Minister and it would have been another story if we are 
seated here and say the Minister rejected the presentation, 
because that is what took place and everybody seems to 
collaborate in terms of their testimony in this Commission, 
that people worked in December, people worked during the 
holidays and I may not recall why was this not presented to 
the Minister as I say I can’t clearly recall the events 
around the matter. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The advance payment system 
which was under way at the time was in fact presented to 
the Minmec meeting and was rejected, they warned against 
its implementation, so the processes under way at the time 
were cabled, were rejected, that’s the first point, you may 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 186 of 198 
 
wish to comment on that. 
MR ZWANE:   If those processes were then rejected Chair 
it will only be correct that our presentation as a province 
was rejected by National.  It is a different story from saying 
recorded as saying there was no representation at all, and 
what I am trying to illustrate is that National has a 
prerogative to accept or reject in terms of the weight and 
that we respect as a province, that is the point I was trying 
to narrate here. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well the timing is important Mr 
10 
Zwane, the advance payment system, and we will come to 
that in due course, was in fact rejected as early as 18 
November by the Technical Minmec and that was reported 
to the Minmec meeting the following day on the 19 t h of 
November.  But what one would have expected on receipt 
of the letter of 9 December 2010 from the National Minister 
warning about the intending stopping of funds, one would 
have expected if there was the remotest possibility of the 
expenditure recovery plan being successful and you being 
aware of that one would have expected all efforts and 
20 
every efforts to be made, however busy one might have 
been at this time in December, to make an urgent 
presentation 
to 
the 
National 
Minister 
saying 
hold 
it 
National Minister, we can do this, here is the proof, and 
that wasn’t done.  Do you have a comment?  
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 187 of 198 
 
MR ZWANE:   I want to believe that this question Chair is 
related to the question that I have answered, that the 
presentations were done and rejected, and I think the point 
that may be raised is that was I aware at that particular 
time and I have alluded to the fact that the rejection 
thereof, of the internal memo which resulted ultimately to 
agreement I was not there, it was rejected around 19 
November, because the question then becomes if it was 
rejected around 19 November this internal memo was only 
finalised on the 15 t h of November.  How possible is it that 
10 
this memo would have been presented in the meeting of 
the 19 t h of November, maybe verbally, I can accede to that 
point but to the best of my knowledge I don’t really recall 
such a report being presented to my table. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It may not have been what as you 
have been ...[indistinct] been referred to as a legal 
opinion, we will come to that, but been presented to the 
meetings in November, in fact it was presented, the 
advance 
payment 
system 
idea 
was 
presented, 
the 
memorandum may or may not have been presented, we 
20 
don’t know, but it was also rejected, it was said this is 
unlawful, you can’t proceed with it, but I will come to that, 
we will come to that piecemeal Mr Zwane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But before your next question going 
back to the issue of representations that may or may not 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 188 of 198 
 
have been made by the department in response to the 
National Minister ’s letter that starts at page 255, are you 
saying that as you sit there you don’t remember whether 
indeed the department made representations as a matter of 
fact, and you don’t remember whether you did see such 
representations but you can’t think why they would not 
have been made, what is the position? 
MR ZWANE:   What I am saying Chair is that I can’t recall 
proper facts, what I recall is that there were activities. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR ZWANE:   That were undertaken by the Province and 
those 
activities 
were 
feeds 
to 
be 
presented 
as 
an 
intervention to the challenges that we had. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But are you saying that the activities to 
which you now refer were meant to be brought to the 
National Department in response to this letter from the 
National Minister or are you simply talking about a different 
point? 
MR ZWANE:  The letter as it comes Chair it says the 
recovery plan has not been accepted in its current form. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MR ZWANE:   That means the recovery plan should be 
altered. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   That was my understanding. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 189 of 198 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mmm. 
MR ZWANE:   And beyond their recovery plan there were 
these activities that we were busy with that would be 
filtered and be able to answer that question that she has 
been raising, the how part, we know heard the how part of 
working on weekends, working on holidays, that is the how 
part, the National Department would have then had an 
opportunity to look at the practicality of the how part, that 
is why I am saying I don’t see a point why would we have 
not responded to the call by National because we were 
10 
indeed doing something along the lines that the National 
Department of Human Settlement wanted us to respond.  I 
can’t just recall whether I saw that representation, that is 
what I am raising. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, but I would have expected that 
for such an important issue where the National Department 
was threatening to take away such a lot of money, 460 
something million, I would have thought that the officials 
once they had prepared the representations would let you 
have sight of them before sending them off, that would be 
20 
your expectation as well? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but you don’t recall that they did 
that? 
MR ZWANE:   I don’t recall because you will remember 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 190 of 198 
 
Chair that we were back and forth in terms of this matter, 
which had started earlier, correspondence, reporting here 
and there, I must say to this Commission we relied to the 
information that is there in the Department in terms of even 
documents, it does not mean that I recall everything that 
was, some of the information I could not get and as a 
result I cannot then say this happened or it did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay Mr Pretorius I see we are at five 
o’clock, shall we talk about how far we will all go. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Can I just finish one point and then 
10 
we can. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Just on this because there is a new 
point to be made after this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that’s fine. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   To take what has been put to you 
by the Chair just one step further, this letter from the 
National Minister, addressed to you, you treat as urgent in 
December, giving an ultimatum, explain or lose the money 
was the culmination of many months of planning and work.  
20 
I would have thought that you would have made a point of 
ensuring that an answer was given, you would have 
instructed your officials to give you something and if you 
didn’t get it you would have raised the roof.  It is an 
important event now, you are going to lose R250million, all 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 191 of 198 
 
your efforts of the year are going to come or be seriously 
prejudiced, you are given an ultimatum, you Mr Zwane is 
given an ultimatum, and I am talking now you in your 
official capacity, not an HOD or anyone else.    You are 
told to respond by a certain time, this is a culmination of 
many, many months of planning and deliberation and 
reports, plans, you would inevitably in that position have 
made sure that there was a response firstly, and you would 
have remembered that. 
MR ZWANE:   Well Chair I can’t see why I would have not 
10 
acted in that manner.  In fact, let me say in this 
Commission I have ignored an instruction to the best of my 
ability especially coming from the office of the Premier.  
What I am trying to narrate here is not whether I failed to 
act or not, I have said in my response I did not pick up any 
document to demonstrate what has happened, and I cannot 
recall now.  Remember Chair with all respect that these are 
the issues that happened in 2010, we are in 2020.  As 
important as they are it is reasonable to say I cannot 
remember all of them. 
20 
 
I did not get any supplementary information that 
would even refresh my memory on this, but surely I should 
take that I did instruct my officials to act. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Mr Zwane if there is any single 
event, the point I was trying to make, that would have been 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 192 of 198 
 
remembered it was this event, and may I suggest that the 
reason why there was no response because there could be 
no response, the best as you have alluded to now was to 
say to the Minister but Minister we are working weekends, 
please don’t take away our money. 
MR ZWANE:   I think Chair from where I am seated that 
would have been sufficient if we did not have any other 
reasons and that would depend on the Minister whether he 
accepts it or not.   I think the point, unless I misunderstand 
here, is not to point out at lack of coercion by the 
10 
Department, it is to reflect on the events and their 
sequence as – did we try to alleviate the situation which 
needed to be alleviated, and I can’t have proper facts to 
put on the table because there are no records as I am 
saying and I would have been glad to have been told by 
this Commission that your response was shallow, I would 
have accepted that, but I don’t have that report to put on 
the table.  That is what I am trying to say Chair, it is not 
here. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Do 
you 
remember 
whether 
you 
20 
responded to this letter from the National Minister because 
the letter was addressed to you. 
MR ZWANE:   I am saying I cannot recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You cannot recall where ...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   Yes, I have said that earlier. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 193 of 198 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Ja, it is quite concerning because 
the question of housing, the building of houses in your 
department during that time one has been made to believe 
through evidence that has been given here was very close 
to your heart.   You had gone to the extent of saying I am 
not 
going 
on 
holiday 
during 
this 
December/January 
because you wanted to oversee the building of as many 
houses as possible before the end of the financial year.   
 
Now 
here 
is 
the 
National 
Minister 
in 
effect 
threatening to derail that plan by taking away about 
10 
R260million.  One would have thought that you would have 
said well I must respond to this letter, there must be 
representations that I make and you would have – even if 
you asked the officials to prepare them you would have 
wanted to see them and you would have responded to the 
Minister and say here are the representations or I know 
that the representations have been sent by the officials but 
maybe for convenience here is a copy for you, we mean 
business when we say we want to perform much better than 
the past few months on this housing project, one would 
20 
have thought that, and I know that it is a number of years 
after that, but somehow one would have thought that as 
you were going through documents and seeing this letter 
you would remember if you had responded to say I might 
not have a copy of the response but I know I responded to 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 194 of 198 
 
this one, but you say you say you can’t remember. 
MR ZWANE:   No, I can’t. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  We are at eight minutes past 
five.  From my side I am still happy to proceed, how is your 
situation Mr Pretorius, I am seated, you are standing the 
whole day. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, Chair that is a relevant factor 
to me only, it is not decisive of the way we go but there are 
other factors that I think are important.  We have been 
dealing with the expenditure recover plan, it was half the 
10 
story, we still have to deal with the advance payment 
system, we have to deal with that from the very beginning, 
October 2010 onwards so it is a substantial amount of work 
to do.   I think Mr Zwane’s position should be taken into 
account, the fact is I think I have had enough but I am 
willing to accept any instruction that you give. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Zwane how is your situation?  
MR ZWANE:   I think I am a ...[indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think Mr Zwane is going to say I want 
Mr Pretorius tired so let him ask me any questions when he 
20 
is tired, I don’t want him fresh. 
MR ZWANE:   No Chair he has taught me to listen to him, I 
argued with him earlier on and I discovered that I was 
wrong in terms of the arrangements.  My belief is that we 
should take into consideration whatever the leader of 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 195 of 198 
 
evidence has presented.  It is about the quality of work 
that we must do and if we would push at a point where we 
just want to finish I believe it may not be fruitful to all of 
us, I think that is the response from me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I guess your response is you are 
available to continue but you think we must take account of 
Mr Pretorius situation? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, your legal representative, I am 
sorry, you are also available but you say we must take into 
10 
account Mr Pretorius’ situation was well, or you say he’s 
strong we should continue.   No, he doesn’t have grey hair. 
 
No Mr Pretorius I understand your situation and 
maybe based on what you say if we were to continue 
maybe we wouldn’t have continued beyond six and I don’t 
know whether we would finish if we continue but I am 
inclined to think ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No we are not going to finish by six 
Chair, not at the rate we have been going.  I mean if there 
was a suit change perhaps, unlikely. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well you might have concerns about the 
rate but I am not complaining in terms of doing justice to 
the issues. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, that is important. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think that is important and I think we 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271 
 
Page 196 of 198 
 
have been dealing with issues quite properly.   If we 
stopped now and we would be able to continue – I think 
early next week there might still be a time, Monday we 
were talking about Mr Tsoametsi, but that was on the 
assumption that we would finish with Mr Zwane and you 
have another witness for Monday is that right? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And Tuesday, but two o’clock 
Tuesday should do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Three o’clock? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Two o’clock, if we are able to 
10 
continue early next week and finish Mr Zwane’s evidence 
early next week, whether Tuesday or Monday, I will be 
happy, I will have no problem that we adjourn now.  Mr 
Zwane would that be – if we look at your continuing at two 
o’clock on Tuesday would that be fine  
MR ZWANE:   Chair I understand the meaning of subpoena. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of? 
MR ZWANE:   Of being subpoenaed I guess I don’t have 
much of a choice, but I think it is fine, if I can just raise 
one point Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MR ZWANE:   If at all possible it would assist this 
Commission for me to also have the information that the 
Commission is having. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh yes, yes, what we ask questions on. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271

MR ZWANE:   Yes, it may seem as if somebody is not 
answering properly, some of the information that is here I 
am seeing it for the first time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no I think they will give the 
information to you if you didn’t get it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well particularly in relation to the 
advance payment system Chair, that’s another reason why 
there should not be that complaint, that Mr Zwane should 
have the opportunity and may I suggest that the evidence 
given by the witnesses this week is available on the 
10 
website or we can make transcripts available if it is not on 
the website, and that is all that Mr Zwane would have to 
have regard to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  So that will be given to you Mr 
Zwane after this and your legal representative will talk to 
Mr Pretorius and his team and arrangements will be made 
so that – you are not going to have a weekend this 
weekend, you are going to be reading. 
MR ZWANE:   It is not for the first time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is not for the first time. 
20 
MR ZWANE:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So we are therefore going to adjourn the 
proceedings on the basis that you will come back at two 
o’clock on Tuesday next week and then we will finish, so if 
we need to go beyond four o’clock we will go beyond four 
25 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 271

o’clock, is that fine? 
MR ZWANE:   That is fine Chair, so I will remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright.  Alright I think then we 
can stop here, thank you very much to everybody for your 
cooperation, we are going to adjourn for the day and on 
Monday we will hear the – will we start with Mr ... at ten Mr 
Pretorius.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Mr Tsoametsi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am terribly sorry, I don’t like people 
mispronouncing my surname and I am sorry that I am 
10 
pronouncing somebody’s surname wrong, yes, will we start 
with him or with your other witness, or do you want to 
decide that later? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Mr Moketsi should not be a long 
time and perhaps we should deal with that and then get 
back into this matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay so on Monday I will hear the 
evidence of Mr Moketsi and then your other witness, ja, 
okay, alright. 
 
We adjourn. 
20 
REGISTRAR:   All rise.
