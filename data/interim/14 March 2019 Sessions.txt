PROCEEDINGS HELD ON 14 MARCH 2019 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Maleka, good morning everybody. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Good morning Chair.  Good morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Chair today we going to briefly present the evidence of 
Doctor Ramontja.  Fortunately we are not going to work with huge bundles of 
documentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  He has submitted a statement which is Exhibit U3.  
Chair you will find it in File 2 which was part and parcel of the bundles that were 
presented when Mr Mabuza started his evidence. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh ja.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I have been assured by your Registrar that it has been 
marked at the back with the name of Doctor Ramontja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it is marked but it is marked on the spine. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and the last statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it has got his name. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The last statement in the doc – in that file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But when you look for the statement itself and you look at the index 
you look for affidavit by Doctor Ramontje in re you see at the top something that says 
affidavit of Snehal Nagar. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And the next one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then a lot of annexures that are marked but nothing tells you 
there one of those is a statement by Doctor Ramontje so I had to look and look and 
look and then ultimately I stumbled upon it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I am sorry.  But Chair you remember when we explained 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 3 of 145 
 
to you right from the beginning that U2 has separate statements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Beginning with the statement of Mr Mabuza. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And thereafter you would go to the statement of Mr 
Nagar and the third one which is U3 it is the statement of Thibedi Ramontja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but I think what should happen is the index should indicate the 
names of statements for example just like all affidavits just like Mr Nagar’s one because 
if all I am looking at is this file, this lever arch file so I see in the spine there is the name 
of Snehal Nagar and Ramontja so it means their statements are in here. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So then I page through and then I see there is an index. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then I want to see on page I will find Doctor Ramontja’s affivadit. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or statement. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I look at the index I see there is the index tells me about Mr Nagar’s 
affidavit and it tells me where to find it and then for the rest it says it is annexures. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I do not get to know that one of the annexures is Doctor 
Ramontja’s one.  I think the index is the one that needs to be amended or corrected. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or unless or otherwise on the spine something must say annexure 
so and so. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 4 of 145 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then I will know and look for that annexure and then find the 
statement. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I did find it.  It did not take too long. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I hoped I did not have to spend a few minutes looking for 
[indistinct]. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Well it seems as if the public lecture has failed there is a 
need for a private lecture. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja maybe. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  For the. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Admiinstration responsible for … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Arranging the documentation.  We have tried. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Regretfully we have failed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I think what – what may have to happen is either maybe apart 
from the member from the legal team maybe the people or the leader of the people who 
20 
do this part of the job needs to be present when maybe I explain exactly how I would 
like things to happen.  But I would have thought that it should be easy but it does not 
prove to be easy. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 5 of 145 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We suggest that a private discussion would help Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Because we tried the best we can publicly to convey. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Those concerns and messages and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  They do not seem to … 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And we failed maybe it is because we are not the 
holders of the purse. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no that is fine.  So maybe arrangements will have to be 
made for that. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. I had indicated that I would deal with Mr Van 
Rooyen’s application for leave to cross-examine. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I think I must dispose of that quickly. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. I believe that the legal representative of  
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Van Rooyen. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Mr Van Rooyen is present. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  No that is fine.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And also for Mr Fuzile. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh they are all present? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  Let me quickly – Mr Van Rooyen brought an 
application for leave to cross-examine Mr Fuzile.  I suggested to all parties that it might 
be a good idea if I deal with the matter in chambers and therefore without oral 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 6 of 145 
 
argument and everybody agreed to the suggestion I have considered the application 
and have reached my conclusion.  The conclusion is that I do grant Mr Van Rooyen 
leave to cross-examine Mr Fuzile and I will indicate at the commencement of the cross-
examination the amount of time that I will allow for that cross-examination.  And I do 
also grant leave so far as it may be necessary for Mr Van Rooyen to give evidence 
himself as well.  And in due course arrangements will be made to fix the date for both 
the cross-examination of Mr Fuzile by Mr Van Rooyen’s counsel as well as for Mr Van 
Rooyen to give evidence.  That is how I dispose of that matter.  We may now proceed 
with today’s matter. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair can I suggest before the oath is administered to 
Doctor Ramontja that you also have at hand and ready the letter which we canvassed 
with Mr Marsden yesterday from Mr Koko to Doctor Ramontja.  It is ES152 Annexure 
MMK20.   
CHAIRPERSON:  In which file? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It is part and parcel of the documents which were 
presented when Mr Marsden testified. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We have brought an extra copy in case you would need 
20 
one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no I have got the two letters as well as the transcript which I do 
not think you will need today. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We do not need that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You just need this – just the two letters? 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 7 of 145 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  One only.  The one which is marked MMK20. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I believe that Mr – Doctor Ramontja is ready for taking 
the oath. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The oath? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Please do the necessary. 
REGISTRAR:   Please place your full names on record? 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Thibedi Ramontja. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you have any objections to taking the prescribed oath? 
10 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  No. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you consider the oath to be binding on your conscience? 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you swear that the evidence you give will be the truth; the whole 
truth and nothing but the truth if so please raise your right hand and say, so help me 
God. 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  So help me God. 
REGISTRAR:   Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Doctor Ramontja good morning and welcome and let me 
start by apologising for delaying your evidence.  We had no control over those 
20 
processes.  Doctor Ramontja before you there will be two sets of documents.  The first 
is the statement which you made at the request of the legal team of the commission.  
Do you have it before you? 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
 ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It has been placed before the Chairperson as Exhibit 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 8 of 145 
 
U3.  I take it that you have had on occasion to look at that statement?  Read it again.  
Do you confirm that that is your statement? 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes it is my statement. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can I establish whether or not you stand by the contents 
of that statement? 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Certainly so I stand by the contents of the statement 
except on paragraph 15 where it says “Eskom’s letter of 6 November” it should be 
Eskom’s letter of 6 December. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So it is fairly clear for anyone who read the statement 
that you intended to refer to December and not November? 
10 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes because in other paragraphs I have referred to 
December. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes especially paragraph 23 on page 5. 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  So subject to that amendment and Chair can I 
suggest that paragraph 15 we strike out November and replace it with December. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Because it is quite clear from the reading of the 
statement in total that he intended to refer to 6 December. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Sadly we have not come across any letter of 6 
November.  What we have come across is the letter of 6 December. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Subject to that qualification do you confirm that the 
contents of that statement are true to the best of your knowledge and belief? 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 9 of 145 
 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Certainly so. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The next set of document is that letter of 6 December 
that you presage in the paragraph that we have just corrected.  It is a statement which 
had not been included in the bundle of documents made available to us, correct? 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We have placed it before you. 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can I establish why you did not include this statement of 
6 December in the bundle that you made available to us? 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  No I just thought you have the letter because the 
10 
investigators just said I must respond to the letter. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Oh I see. 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Doctor Ramontja can I establish fairly quickly your 
background?  Let me start with your qualifications that you are willing to disclose to us 
publicly. 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Okay.  I have a certificate in geology.  I have a BSC 
Honours in geology. I have a MSC in engineering.  I have PHD in mineral economics. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And when did you obtain the doctoral degree? 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  During my time at the Department – during my time 
20 
when I was working at the Council for Geoscience. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And when was it more in less in terms of dates? 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  It was – it was around 2008 around there. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  2018? 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 10 of 145 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  You seem to be a man of excellent qualifications.   
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  No not necessary Chairperson I am a person who 
likes academic environment so I continuously read in fact not to distract you I had even 
registered for an MSC at the University of Free State this year but because of this I 
cancelled. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because of the commission? 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes I cancelled it.  I had registered the last week 
they said was 13 – this week you must attend I said look I am pulling out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh oh.  Doctor Ramontja.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  That is an extraordinary commitment to the work of the 
10 
commission which of course we welcome even at the loss of the University of Free 
State.  But beyond your academic qualifications can I establish your work experience? 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  I started at the bottom of you know the career in 
mining.  I started as a technician working for a company called Southern Sphere Mining 
and Development. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can you speak closer to the mic. 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Working for a company called Southern Sphere 
Mining and Development then I went to the University of the North to go and further my 
studies. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  When did you start working for that company? 
20 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  It was in 1980 around there. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  1980. 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay. 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  And then in 1981 I went to the University of the 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 11 of 145 
 
North. I studied BSC and after my BSC I then did my Honours in Geology. After that I 
then went and worked in private sector and in private sector I went – I worked as an 
exploration geologist. I also worked as a mining geologist going underground all those 
mines in Carltonville I worked on them I know all of them.  I then worked as a research 
geologist for a company called Goldfields it is still operating.  And then after some time I 
joined a friend of mine we worked as consultants in the geohydrology environment that 
is ground water looking for water for rural development.  And I then joined government.  
That was the time when the government was actively recruiting black professionals.  
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  When was it? 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  That was in 1997. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  1997? 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So it was post-independence. 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Certainly so we were amongst the first black 
professional to join government and I worked there as a Director of Mineral Economics 
because mineral economics was my area when I was working on my PHD.  And then I 
in and around 2002 I was then – no in around 2000 I was promoted to Chief Director 
Mineral promotion within the Department of Mineral and Energy.  Okay and that was 
one of my you know exciting times because I was even awarded a prize for being the 
best senior manager in the Department of Mineral and Energy by the then Minister 
20 
[indstinct] 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  And then in 2002 I was appointed the Deputy CEO 
Chief Executive Officer of the Council for Geoscience.  The Council for Geoscience is a 
national research institution which does research in geology across the whole country.  
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 12 of 145 
 
And then in 2003 that is a year after that I was then appointed the Chief Executive 
Officer of the Council for Geoscience.  I served there for 8 years until 2011 when I was 
appointed the Director General of the Department of Mineral Resources.  I did my 
service there. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Who was the Minister at the time? 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  That is Minister Susan Shabangu. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  And I worked under Minister Susan Shabangu I then 
worked under Minister Ramatlhodi and then in 2016, January 2016 I left the service of 
the department.  The then Minister was Minister Zwane.  I really you know enjoyed my 
10 
environment in public service it was one of my greatest times there and it was close to 
– I spent plus minus 19 years working for the public service and I worked under seven 
ministers all in all within the you know family the mining industry.  And then I when the 
time came to leave I realised that I have to leave.  It was sad for me but I had to leave. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You indicate in your statement that you took a decision 
and communicated it to leave as the Director General of Mineral Resources sometime 
in October 2015. 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And at that time the relevant executive authority was 
Minister Zwane? 
20 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  When did he leave pursuant to that decision? 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Well you know when Minister Zwane arrived that was 
after about five weeks or so plus minus around there I remember we were flying I 
cannot recall the exact time but we were flying together to Cape Town.  I was next to 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 13 of 145 
 
him and – on the plane.  I then said to Minister Zwane, Minister Zwane I want to step 
down for health reasons.  Okay and we never concluded our discussion.  The 
discussions were concluded on the 10 December.  To me it was one of my saddest 
days in my life.  I have worked in private sector.  I have worked in the public service.  I 
have worked under many, many, many bosses if I may use that word Chairperson but 
that day it was one of my saddest day.  It teared me, I broke down.  But I know that 
what happened that day it was not caused by the government of South Africa, it was 
not.  It was not.  I knew that I knew.  I knew government.  I knew the Department of 
Mineral Resources.  I know government, I know everything.  You know I know it was 
just some people. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It seems to be a painful moment that you were going 
through at that point in time. 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I wonder whether you find it in your heart to take us into 
your confidence and share with us what was the painful moment that led to your 
decision to leave the Department of Mineral Resources. 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Well when Ministers change you know it is always 
not a very comfortable environment.  I will be lying you know.  You have got to adjust to 
the environment, adjust to how a minister does things okay.  And some time when the 
situation is very difficult even your health gets affected and I just realised look I have 
20 
run the race let me just step down and move on with my life and do other things Okay.  
But the 10 December – let me explain it.  I have already explained this to the 
investigators Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no let me encourage you to explain the circumstances 
surrounding your stepping down. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 14 of 145 
 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because to the extent that they may be relevant to what the 
commission is investigating it is very important that we get told what happened and 
because we must know as much as possible.  We must know the truth and we must 
know all that information because we may have to or we have to at some stage 
confront the question why did those things happen.  And why did they happen at the 
time that they did happen?  We have to confront the questions of what is it that we 
could have done differently?  What is it that somebody else could have done?  Are 
there circumstances that put pressure on people not to do things the way they would 
have like to be done and if want those things not to happen again and not happen to 
10 
anybody and not to happen in our own country, not to happen in government 
departments what must be done and the commission must look at that so that if at all 
possible pain that may have been suffered by certain people, certain individuals, certain 
people who may have been committed to the right things to doing the right thing should 
not happen again or should not happen to others in the future.  So I just want to 
encourage you that if it is something that is relevant to what the commission is looking 
at please talk freely and inform me as much as possible of what may have happened. 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Thank you Chairperson.  I think from day 1 I could 
20 
see that you know we - the rapport between myself and Minister Zwane it was not as I 
expected.  And there were advisors who came in.  These advisors basically they were 
running the show.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can I interrupt you?  I am sorry to do this to you but can 
you give us the details of the advisors? 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 15 of 145 
 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Okay one was Kuben, Mr Kuben Moodley. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How do you spell Kuben? 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  K-u-b-e-n.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair you have across this name during the course of 
Mr Sinton’s evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you remember the context in which you came 
across this name? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I do not remember at all. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It is a person who Mr Sinton said that he introduced 
10 
Regiments to McKinsey. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And he was paid a fee of 5%. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I remember Moodley I did not remember the name, I remember 
the surname. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. Okay, yes, thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Who else? 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Mr Malcolm Mabaso. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And again you have come across this name when Mr 
20 
Fuzile testified. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I remember Mr Mabaso yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  And then later on there was a third advisor Ms Zarina 
Kellerman. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 16 of 145 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say Miss? 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Miss yes.  Zarina – Z-a-r-i-n-a Kellerman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How do you spell the surname? 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  K-e-l-l-e-r-m-a-n-n I can just double check it later 
and give it to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And again I am sorry to interrupt you.  When did you for 
the first time know that these individuals were advisors to Minister Zwane? 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Well on the first day at the swearing in at the Union 
Building I went there to receive the Minister and you know – that is what we do.  We go 
10 
there and the Minister is sworn in and they were already there at the Union Building. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you know them before – were they people that you knew of or 
that you had met before? 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Not – I have never interacted… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have never met them before. 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  It was the first time I saw them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  Yes you may continue. 
20 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  And Chairperson as I say you just see it if – you 
know Minister and the DG they have got to really be close.  They have got to work very 
closely.  But during that time I want to be honest I had to work through advisors.  Can 
you see?  I had to work – got messages from advisors.  And I just felt [indistinct] in the 
way.  There are many things whereby advisors were talking to my staff okay or the staff 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 17 of 145 
 
in the department and you do not know what is happening.  You are basically lost.  You 
operating in the misty environment and every time you try to connect the dots you know 
that is what you are doing it is one of the most frustrating environment because 
advisors are not supposed to run departments. Advisors are not supposed to get in 
there and call officials of the department.  If they had an issue they should go the DG 
and say DG Minister want this and this and this okay.  Then I interact with the minister 
that is how it is supposed to be.  I do not report to the advisors as a DG.  I report to the 
minister and also politically to the Deputy Minister okay. Advisors are there to advise 
the Minister that is all, okay.  Getting into the department issues, admin what is 
happening, no.  It is not supposed to be that way Chairperson.  I have been in the 
10 
department which is responsible for mining for 19 years.  I have worked under seven 
Ministers.  I know how things are done.  I worked under Minister Ramatlhodi.  He had 
an advisor, Mr Morphie.  I know how they interacted.  Mr Morphie would not go and just 
interact and not with my staff.  He did not come to me and say you know DG, how do 
you see this and this and this.  Then he goes to the Minister and we used to talk, 
Minister Ramatlhodi to say you see DG that advisor you are not reporting to that 
advisor.  You report to me.  He used to tell me that and that is how it should be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that was reassuring? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  It was reassuring. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. Yes.  Yes, continue. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of telling us the circumstances around your stepping down. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  So. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 18 of 145 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  If there is still more to tell. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Ja, so that whole environment Chairperson I just realised 
that look, this is the end.  My health will be compromised and let me just leave the 
environment as it is.  There will be other things which I can do in my life and then on 
10 December I was called to the office of the Minister and. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that December 20? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2015, ja. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.

DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  I was called to the office of the Minister.  When I arrived 
there I was led into the office of Mr Mabaso, the advisor, okay and he said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you were called the impression or your understanding was that 
you were being called by the Minister? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  By the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Okay.  So when I arrived I was led into the office of 
Mr Mabaso and I sat there with him.  We chatted, we always chatted with him now and 
20 
again.  Then he said to me the Minister says you must resign.  I said what.  He said you 
must resign.  He wants his resignation within 20 minutes, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is the 10th? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  The 10th. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of December 2015? 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 19 of 145 
 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he had been sworn in when?  He had been back for some time. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  23 September. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, of 2015? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  2015, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Then I said what is this.  Where is the news that the 
Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was a shock to you? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Okay.  Where is the Minister?  The Minister was in his 
office.  About five metres, plus/minus five metres from the office of Mr Mabaso. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  You see the office of the Minister is a big office with sub 
offices. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  So the Minister would have his own there.  A secretary 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  A PA and then the advisors there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  So the Minister was in his office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Maybe five metres. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 20 of 145 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  From where I was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  So here am I and getting fired just like that.  Then I said to 
Mr Mabaso, Mr Mabaso I want to leave then.  I will leave now immediately.  You said 
you want a resignation, the Minister wants a resignation within 20 minutes.  I will give it, 
but I am taking my things.  I am going home today, okay and he said no, no DG.  Can 
you not just wait and so things will fall apart, you know.  Let us make sure that things 
are smooth when you leave.  I then looked at it.  I thought about it.  Once more I said 
let me do it for my country.  Let me stay.  It is not about some people.  It is about my 
10 
country.  It is the department I have worked for, for 19 years and I said okay.  I will go 
and sign that letter.  I went to my office there and put it together.  I have one of my 
colleagues in my office helped me type it together, put it together.  Then we finalised it.  
I signed the letter.  Then I went there.  Within that 20 minutes I made sure that I do it 
within 20 minutes and Chairperson I knew my rights.  I would have said no.  I would 
have gone to CCMA after going to the, I would have taken legal advice, but I just said 
you know what this is good riddance for me.  Let me do it in that 20 minutes of theirs.  
Then from there I said okay I will service notice until 31 January 2016 and I will see 
what I can do, assist them and I did it.  Even after I had left, okay.  Some of the staff 
members would call me and say Dr Ramontja can you assist us with this and this.  I 
20 
would drive to Pretoria with my own petrol, never ask any cent.  I did it, because I was 
doing this thing for the country and I just made peace with the situation and say one 
day, one day things will be fine, okay and I used to go there.  Remember I think in some 
speeches, they saved some speech I could look at it, work on it.  After I had left and 
therefore I sent it back to them.  I said look it is fine, but then I was never bitter.  Even 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 21 of 145 
 
today I am not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And those would have been speeches for the Minister or what? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Ja, I think, I cannot recall properly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  I have got some emails. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  If you want some of the things I looked at they sent to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  The acting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  DG. 
10 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  DG. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  He used to communicate with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you ever speak to Minister Zwane on that day when his advisor 
told you that he wanted your resignation letter within 20 minutes? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Not at all.  After he was given my letter and I was going out.  
As I said it is just in his office.  He was walking.  I saw him there.  He had a phone 
something like that, if I can recall.  I think he just said DG, DG and that is it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  That is it.  Not even saying to me DG I want us to part 
ways. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  That is it. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 22 of 145 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And prior to this day when his advisor said the Minister wanted your 
resignation letter had there been any discussion between the two of you at all about a 
possibility of you stepping down? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes.  As I said I was, we were flying to Cape Town and I 
was seated next to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  I told him that I want to step down. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but do you recall about when that flight was in relation to? 
10 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  I. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The date when you were asked to put in a resignation letter?  Is it a 
month or a week’s time? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  No, it is about a month.  I think it was around October. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  In your statement you said October. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes.  I said in around October there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I cannot exactly recall the date.  Maybe, ja I cannot 
recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but what was his reaction to your statement in the flight when you 
20 
said you think you should step down?  What was his reaction to that? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  He; we never concluded.  He said when.  I said look we 
can talk about it.  We can talk about it ja, but we never concluded.  We just left it as it 
is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 23 of 145 
 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then the next thing was this particular day when Mr Mabaso said 
the Minister. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Wanted your resignation letter? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  And. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  To conclude that part of. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Mine at the department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  And then sometime in January he said to me DG I am 
offering you a job as a CEO of one of the entities, South African Diamond and Precious 
Metal Regulator.  So I declined the offer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  I declined the offer. I said thank you so much Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  But I am fine. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  I am fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  If I could ask was your decision to decline it connected in 
anyway with the fact that you may have thought that the two of you did not have, had 
not been able to achieve a good rapport with each other?  You said earlier on that you. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 24 of 145 
 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Could tell that there was no good rapport between the two of you. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it connected with that or it was simply because you had other 
arrangements/ 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  No, I did not have other arrangements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Nothing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTA:  I did not have any plans. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  I just reflected over it during the holidays. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  I reflected it.  I remember in my, if I can recall my family 
went on holiday.  I did not go holiday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  I just stayed alone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  During the holidays. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  I reflected on it and then I said let me start a new life. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  It will be there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  And I am glad that I started a new life. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 25 of 145 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  I am working as a consultant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  In South Africa and outside South Africa and also. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  I am an Honorary Adjunct Professor. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  At the University of Witwatersrand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  I sit on the Advisory Committee. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Of the School of Mining and Engineering to advise them.  
So there are many things which. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Are happening with my life. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  It took time, but you can see that things are happening. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  There will always be possibilities if you work hard in life. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, thank you Dr Ramontja for that, but there is just one part which I 
would like you to expand on if you are able to.  You did say that the role that 
Minister Zwane’s advisors were playing in the department was not the role that they 
should be playing. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 26 of 145 
 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I would like you to expand on that and tell me more in terms of 
what it is that they were doing at a factual level which really should not have been done 
by advisors should have been left to you or other officials and so on.  I would like you 
to. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Expand on that if you are able to. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes.  I think Chairperson the heart of everything is you 
cannot work via advisors as a DG, you know.  You have to directly talk to the Minister.  
You have to directly talk to the Deputy Minister.  You cannot work through advisors.  It 
10 
just becomes impossible.  It does not work and that is the gist of everything which I 
experienced, you know and maybe that is how he wanted things to be done and maybe 
it is how he wanted that is fine, but it is difficult for me.  It was difficult then for me to 
accept that.  Then I said look I cannot, but three are other things which I heard after, 
you know.  At some point I was told that the advisors would tell the Chief Inspector of 
Mines, okay to go and inspect mines, you know and maybe the Chief Inspector can 
explain that, you know because I was marginalised.  Nobody came to me and tell, but 
he told me that look I was supposed to, I have been asked to go and inspect mines.  I 
said what, what is this.  In fact when you look at those things they are not supposed to 
be done that way.  I cannot even tell the Chief Inspector of Mines go and inspect this 
20 
mine.  It is not right, okay.  The Chief Inspect of Mines has got powers in terms of the 
Mine Health and Safety Act.  He is the one who must decide and they have got their 
own program and once you start to say go to this mine, go to this one.  It is not the work 
of the Minister.  It is not the work of the DG.  It is the work of the Chief Inspector of 
Mines which rules at the DDG level.  So when he told me this I said hey, what can I do.  
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 27 of 145 
 
It was a very, very, you know it is one of those things and there was this project maybe 
we will cover, the Optimum Project okay.  The Optimum Project Chairperson during 
Mr Ramatlhodi’s time okay it was run by officials.  The DDG responsible for it 
Mr Joel Raphela was the one who come to me and tell me what is happening DG and 
you know we understood what was happening okay, but then when Mr Zwane came on 
board they centralised that project inside the office of the Minister.  There is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes.  It was centralised.  I was not aware what was now 
10 
happening. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes.  That was how it was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when you say it was centralised in Minister Zwane’s office what 
do you mean?  Is that where certain decisions were being taken or what exactly do you 
mean? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  I was in the dark.  I was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As DG? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  As DG. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
20 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  I was totally in the dark about what is happening. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Totally, totally and the DG would come to me and almost 
whispering to me, you know we were there you know and I said what is happening, you 
know.  We were there.  There is this thing.  I think we even went to Zurich. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 28 of 145 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  And you know there was, you know the environment was 
just. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  For me I think the style was not the way I expected. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  And I cannot force a Minister to operate in a particular way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  It is up to the Minister to decide how he or she wants to 
run. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Her or his office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said you referred to when they went, even when they went to 
Zurich. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair I would like to explore that topic in detail. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, explore it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So if I can get to it in time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Get to it in time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  If you do not mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright explore it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or you want to lay a foundation first? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, I want to discuss other background issues. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 29 of 145 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, no that is fine. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  If you do not mind I will get to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But let us do this, so you have finished the circumstances 
surrounding your stepping down as far as you are concerned in terms of giving us? 
10 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes, I have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  I have Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  I have. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair thank you.  Do you know Mr Enoch Godongwana? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes, I know him very well.  He was at some point advisor to 
Minister Susan Shabangu when I was the DG. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  So it is someone who you would fairly know well 
and have had some communication with? 
20 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes.  He is a leader within the ANC and I would interact 
with him. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  On many issues especially in terms of mining issues 
because he was responsible for economic issues. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 30 of 145 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  So we would talk and talk about issues. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Mr Fuzile came here and to say something which 
was communicated to him. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  By Mr Enoch Godongwana. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I wonder whether you had followed what his testimony 
before the Chairperson was, because it was a public testimony.  Do you know what 
Mr Fuzile said to the Chairperson about Mr Godongwana? 
10 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  I missed that, but my brother told me and said he, I did not 
hear what he said, but my brother mentioned something like Mr Fuzile phoned 
Mr Godongwana and Mr Godongwana if you want to know more about these issues go 
and consult. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Well let me recap it for you. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So that at least you would be able to comment it as 
closely as possible to the accuracy of his testimony. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair as I recall he said that after Minister van Rooyen 
20 
was appointed, remember after the fateful 9 December 2015 announcement 
Mr Godongwana called him and said to him you are going to get a Gupta Minister and 
that Minister would come with his advisors or her advisors and generally he or she 
would not know those advisors and if it is necessary he, Mr Fuzile, must ask you about 
those things.  What I want to establish, of course we will call Mr Godongwana to come 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 31 of 145 
 
and put his version in due course.  We are making arrangements in that regard. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What I want to understand is did you ever have? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before that Mr Maleka I do not know whether you recollection 
is correct to the extent that you say it was after the appointment.  My recollection was 
that one of the things that was intriguing was that as I understood it Mr Fuzile said he 
had that conversation with Mr Godongwana before the announcement was made. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Oh, yes you could be correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the intriguing thing was how he would have known in advance. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And that is the only issue I want to explore. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you for that reminder.  So what I want to establish 
is did you ever have a discussion with Mr Godongwana about the appointment of so 
called Gupta Ministers and the advisors? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  No, Chairperson I cannot recall.  I cannot recall, ja.  I 
cannot recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe let me put it like this.  As far as I can recall Mr Fuzile 
testified that I think on the day on which the announcement for, the announcement 
20 
about the dismissal of Mr Nene and the appointment of his replacement on the day 
before that announcement was made and if I recall correctly it was made in the evening 
in terms of the evidence and he was on his way I do not know whether he was on his 
way home in the afternoon or somewhere and he received a call from Mr Godongwana 
and in their conversation Mr Godongwana talked, I think they had already been 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 32 of 145 
 
rumours that Mr Nene was going to be fired and Mr Godongwana said that Mr Fuzile 
was going to get a Gupta Minister and that the Gupta Minister would arrive with 
advisors and that that Minister would not even be knowing those advisors and he 
suggested that Mr Fuzile should talk to you.  My impression was that he, 
Mr Godongwana, was saying to Mr Fuzile if you want to know more about what I am 
talking about or about these situations talk to Dr Ramontja.  That was my impression of 
the evidence.  So I think in that context, it is in that context that Mr Maleka is asking 
whether there is anything that you are able to tell us on that order from the basis for 
Mr Godongwana to think that you could assist Mr Fuzile to understand what was about 
to happen in his department. 
10 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Chairperson we never discussed this with Mr Fuzile, no we 
never discussed that. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  No, we understand that, but the point is the pain that 
you are going through in the department at that point in time.  Did you ever discuss it 
with anyone? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  With Mr Godongwana? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Anyone. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  No, my family, I discussed with my family mostly, but my 
staff in my office they knew it.  I think the corridors people would see it, ja.  I did not 
discuss it.  I cannot remember discussing it with anyone, but I discussed it with my 
20 
family.  I said this what is happening and what can I do. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair I would like now to move to the substance of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Dr Ramontja’s evidence.  Dr Ramontja you were called 
by the Commission to explain circumstances leading to the letter that was sent to 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 33 of 145 
 
Eskom under your name.  You annexed that letter as TR1 to your statement.  Chair you 
will find TR1 on page 13 of U3.  Are you there Dr Ramontja? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You will see if you go to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me try and find it.  Is U 3 an annexure in the same file? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  In the same file where you find the statement of 
Dr Ramontja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because behind the statement there is no annexure. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Oh, my word. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this is not a file where you can tell me a paginated page number, 
10 
where to find it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Paginated page number on my documentation is TR13 
and TR14. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well something really needs to be done about these things.  I have 
got TR12.  You said TR14. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  13 and 14. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, something just needs to be done with regards to even the 
pagination, you know.  It is quite convenient if there is a pagination that covers the 
whole lever arch file, because then that makes it easier.  Okay, I have got it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can I ask you to go to page 2 of that letter which is 
20 
TR14?  Do you see that? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You will see that your name appears on that page.  
Correct? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 34 of 145 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And there is a signature above that name/ 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Is that your signature? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Certainly so, Chairperson. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I therefore assume that you signed this letter? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But there was no date to that letter.  There is provision 
for dates, but it had not been completed. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Do I take it that you signed the letter without putting the 
10 
date to indicate when you signed it? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Well when I signed this letter I then thought that I could 
revisit the letter. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We will come to the circumstances. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But all I want to confirm at this stage is that you did not 
put a date. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  To indicate when you signed it. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes, Chairperson. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Correct.  We will get to the circumstances and I am not 
trying to exclude you from explaining the context and circumstances why you did not 
put the date, but can I remind you of this context?  That you signed this letter as a 
result of a letter that was sent to you by Eskom under the hand of Mr Koko.  That is the 
letter that I asked you to look at.  It is not part of your statement.  Is that letter which is 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 35 of 145 
 
marked MMK20? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you will see that page 2 of MMK20 is signed by 
Mr Koko on 6 December 2015.  Correct? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So your letter TR13 and TR14 was an attempt to 
respond to Mr Koko’s letter? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We will get to the context, to the contents of, but let me 
establish matters of context one of which we will deal with a topic the Chairperson 
10 
raised and I said I will like to deal with and that is a trip of Minister Zwane to Zurich.  
The context at that point in time as I understand is that one of Eskom’s coal suppliers, 
Optimum Coal Mine, and I take it that you know that mine.  You know who operates it.  
Correct? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You also indicated in your statement that 
Minister Ramatlhodi tried to intervene in regard to attempts by Optimum Mine at the 
time to reduce their staff.  Did you know at that point in time that Optimum Coal Mine 
was under business rescue? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  At what time? 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  When you received the letter of Mr Koko? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Okay.  Yes I know because it was in the news, the 
Department was involved and the issues of Optimum in fact started to come to the 
Department during Mr Ramatlhodi’s time and I remember at some point I was even in a 
meeting where Minister Ramatlhodi was there there was Dr Ngubane, there was Mr 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 36 of 145 
 
Molefe and my DDG, Mr Raphela, was also there so we were four in that meeting, then 
when also they discussed this issue, so I knew that there were issues. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Yes, and yesterday the Chairperson heard the 
evidence of one of business rescue practitioners, Mr Marsden, had you met him during 
the stage when Optimum Coal Mine was in business rescue? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:   No I never met him, my DDG, Mr Raphela, was the person 
who was busy interacting with all the stakeholders which are involved in this, which was 
natural, it’s his area so he was the person who would be interacting with them.  I don’t 
know if he did meet them one to one, but he used to tell me that they’re holding 
meetings and these things are happening, it’s fine. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     When you received that letter it was after Tegeta had 
made an offer to purchase amongst others Optimum Coal Mine and that offer had been 
accepted by Optimum Coal Mine and it’s line of current companies, including Glencore, 
were you aware of the fact that there had been a sale agreement? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:   No I was not aware. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     When you received that letter Minister Zwane had five 
days earlier had gone to Zurich to meet with Mr Glassenbergh who at the time was the 
head of Glencore, were you aware of the trip? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:   I was aware because the way it works in the Department 
when the Minister goes overseas he gets commission from the President then the 
20 
Minister will then decide who she wants to accompany her or him, and in this case my 
DDG was asked to accompany the Minister so the documentations which I signed to 
this effect which we will come to and we recommend to the Minister for the Minister to 
approve the DDG to go abroad, and also I will be sort of approving the costs which will 
be incurred. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 37 of 145 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Indeed because you are the accounting officer. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:   Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     So the costs relating to that trip to the extent that they 
will be paid by your department you have to authorise them. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:   Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     And I take it that you authorised them and you became 
aware that Minister Zwane was travelling to Zurich? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:   Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     The Chairperson received evidence that at that 
meeting when Mr Zwane met Mr Glassenbergh he was accompanied by someone 
10 
called Mr Salem Essa who – let me first ask you this, do you know Mr Salem Essa. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:   No I don’t know him. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Had you met him before? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:   No, no. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Mr Essa was introduced at that meeting with Mr 
Glassenbergh as the advisor to the Minister.  Do you or don’t you know that Mr Essa at 
some or other point played a role as advisor to the Minister, Minister Zwane? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:   No, as I said there were two advisors, then there was this 
third one also, when I left but she was not fully appointed also. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     You have looked at the documentation relating to that 
20 
trip, you know the costs and we know who is going there, did the documentation ever 
indicated to you what was the purpose of the trip to Zurich? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:   No, that’s why I said it did not specify the issues of 
Glencore, it was like Ministers going abroad, I think if I can recall, this thing happened 
long time ago, that they are going there to meet investors, I am speaking under 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 38 of 145 
 
correction but it didn’t have the details about Optimum what-what no. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     It did not have those details? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:   Yes as far as I can recall I will have to really look at it, but I 
can’t remember having those things in that, there will be a meeting whereby the 
Minister will meet with people of Optimum together with the people of Glencore, I can’t 
remember, I will have to double-check that. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Could you because it is important to understand 
precisely whether you as the DG knew what was the purpose of the trip. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:   Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     The Chairperson received evidence from amongst 
10 
others a witness called Mr Clinton Ephron who indicated that the sale of the Optimum 
Mine was discussed at two meetings in Zurich, the first was the meeting of 1 December 
2015, the second was the 2nd of December 2015, do you know anything about those 
meetings? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:   No, no, no.  Chairperson when it comes to the issue of 
Optimum it was basically run in the office of the Minister and things would come in drips 
and drabs to me you know and that’s how that was the situation.   
CHAIRPERSON:  You said that your department began to be involved in – on issues 
relating to Optimum during Minister Ramatlhodi’s time.  
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  During Minister Ramatlhodi’s time who was dealing with those 
issues, I mean you just told us that if I recall correctly issues relating to Optimum 
became centralised in Minister Zwane’s time during Minister Zwane’s – in Minister 
Zwane’s office during his time.  During Mr Ramatlhodi’s time were they being handled 
by the Department’s officials in the normal course? 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 39 of 145 
 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:   Certainly so Chairperson the DDG Mr Raphela was driving 
them, but you know ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  And was keeping you informed? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:   Oh so much, he will tell me there’s this meeting, they ‘re 
meeting the unions, there’s this thing so it was so transparent that you get comfort and 
that is how you must be because as a DG you can’t be everywhere, you can’t attend all 
these meetings but he used to tell me there’s this and this and also I remember at some 
point there was even a block consortium which approached me, we were in a meeting 
so at the Department and they said look we want to acquire Optimum, can you just 
assist us DG.  We don’t often get involved in those things but I then said look I will see 
10 
what I can do if there are challenges, let – especially if it is a black-owned company 
let’s see if we cannot assist, to address the issues of transformation and I called Mr 
Ephron, Mr Clinton Ephron and I discussed this issue with him, and he said okay fine, it 
seems they don’t have money those people, and then I left it there, the two gentlemen 
who were interested, Mr Sipho Dube, and Mr Peter Demane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:   Yes, so that was – everything was transparent, I knew 
what was happening, it was fine, Minister Ramatlhodi would be informed about issues, 
he would come in when you know there are serious issues which have to be tabled, but 
he would leave everything to us ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, going back to the trip to Zurich so did your DDG go with the 
Minister? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:   Certainly so Chairperson, he ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  The one who was dealing with issues relating to Optimum? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:   Yes and if I may add Chair? 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 40 of 145 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:   And then some time after he came back, I can’t remember 
which day, he came to my office, we were talking about other things and then I said 
look how was your trip there, and then he said yes it was fine and we went to Glencore 
but he was not allowed to enter into a meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Into the meeting? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:   Yes so he was outside, so this is the environment so I just 
left it as it is, I said okay, that’s fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know whether that DDG is still there? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:   No the DDG is no longer there. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, what was his name again? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:   Mr Joel Raphela. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Joel Raphela? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     What I find surprising is that an important project such 
as Optimum Coal Mine was something that you were involved in during the time 
Minister Ramatlhodi was Minister and when Mr Zwane takes over you are not involved 
in that project. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can you explain to us why you as the DG did not 
become involved in that project during the Ministerial position of Mr Zwane? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  It perplexed me Chairperson, I just thought that’s the style, 
I mean Ministers have got powers to decide how they run a department, okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  No, no with respect, it is not the Minister who runs the 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 41 of 145 
 
Department, it is you as the DG who runs the Department. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  I agree Chairperson but then ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  You are telling us what happened when he started. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes, there are certain things you can do as DG 
Chairperson but there are certain things if your Minister wants to do things this way you 
can’t stop that person, so when they decided to centralise it there I just said what can I 
do, there is nothing I could do but it is what happened, I’m just relaying what happened. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I understand.  Chair with your leave I would like to probe 
this question further. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. Do. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I understand the difficult and the oppressive 
circumstances you are working in, okay, I am apprised with them, don’t misunderstand 
me, but it seems to me from what you are telling us that there was a takeover of your 
functions and duties as the DG to run the department, is that a fair reflection of what 
happened during that time? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  I think yes to some extent, not all functions but to some 
extent this one was one of the projects which was basically taken away from me.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Beyond the style of Mr Zwane as a minister to interface 
with you as the head of the DMR can you think of any reason why the Optimum Project 
will be excluded from your line of responsibilities? 
20 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  I don’t know why would this happen but with all this enquiry 
happening we started to say look you know perhaps some people had to be favoured 
you know I don’t have clear evidence but now you to start to put, to join the dots now 
you start to see with this enquiry say okay this is – this looks like perhaps the Gupta 
people were basically being assisted – sorry for using that word – Mr Gupta’s family 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 42 of 145 
 
was trying to be assisted that’s how I view it now. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And I suggest to you that that must have been the 
reason because when I look at the letter of Mr Koko and your response to that letter 
your letter talks to things which Mr Koko did not raise at least expressly in his letter to 
you.   
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We will get to the precise details of how your letter 
raised things which even Mr Koko did not raise. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But do you accept as a general proposition that your 
10 
response was talking about detail which were not in Mr Koko’s letter. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Before we get to those details can I ask you to simply 
explain to us the process of formulating this letter because I sense from your statement 
that you did not prepare that letter. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can you just take us through the basic steps as far as 
you can recall, who started with the draft, how it was presented to you for signature. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before that let’s talk about Mr Koko’s letter to you, you said or 
at least maybe your statements says you don’t remember how it got to you but it got to 
20 
you at a certain stage, is that right? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The letter addressed to you from Mr Koko. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your statement says if I recall correctly that you don’t recall how it 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 43 of 145 
 
got to you but it did get to you, is that right? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Certainly so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes now did you at any stage give it to – or a copy thereof to the 
Minister, Minister Zwane or any of his advisors or any of his staff? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  No, I did not, I did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and before you signed your response to Mr Koko at the time 
that you did were you aware that maybe some – the Minister might be having this letter 
or somebody, or one of his advisors might be having it? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  It was my presumption ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you didn’t know for sure. 
10 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes.  It can happen that a letter comes to me, there’s a 
copy of it going to the DDG or to the Office of the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but ...(intervention)  
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  But I just assume that ... 
CHAIRPERSON:  But wouldn’t  normally the letter show that it’s been copied to 
somebody else? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That’s what normally happens. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay Mr Maleka you can take continue. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Can I ask you to turn to the letter that 
you signed, and again before I get to the contents of it I would ask you to clarify for us 
how this letter was formulated, in other words did you sit behind the computer, dictate it 
or type it or did someone present a draft to you? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  No, it came as a draft to my office. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 44 of 145 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And do you know who formulated that draft? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  I don’t know who formulated the draft.  I just assume that it 
comes from the office of Minister, because they had been working on these issues. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright, so you knew nothing about who formulated the 
draft, did – do you know who gave it to you in draft form, as far as you can recall? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  No, I found it in my in-tray. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  In-tray? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And was there any expectation that you should look at it 
and sign it as a reflection of a response to Mr Koko’s letter. 
10 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes you know when you get into your office you find 
documents, you look at them and you assess the risk associated with that document, 
you sign it or sometimes you say look let me clarify and sometime I used to take work 
home and go through the things over the weekend and some of them I signed, some of 
them I go and get clarity on them, so this is the situation, I saw it, I looked at this letter, I 
looked at this letter of Mr Koko and I knew that there were issues which are happening 
with regards to this project and I just said look let me just see if this cannot help.  I just 
signed it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it normal for you to as DG to receive draft letters from the Office 
of the Minister or any of the previous ministers in circumstances where you had not 
20 
known in advance that somebody would prepare a draft for you. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  It’s not normal and what also comforted me when I looked 
at the letter it also had the name of my DDG as enquiry, then I said okay perhaps you 
know they’ve been working together on this thing, that is what comforted me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it normal for you to receive draft letters, draft responses to 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 45 of 145 
 
letters addressed to you from any of your officials in circumstances where you had not 
discussed the possibility of them doing a draft for you? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  No it’s normal, we can find, maybe there’s a project they 
are waiting on, and they will discuss issues and say let’s prepare this letter for the DG 
to sign. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I’m talking about the circumstances where you had received a 
letter, in other words somebody had addressed a letter to you, somebody from outside 
maybe to be specific, and then you have not discussed with anybody the possibility of 
that person drafting a response for you and then suddenly you get a response, a draft 
response. 
10 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  It’s the – the abnormality, it’s not normal and you know the 
way things are we could see that there’s something not right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I see, I can understand as DG you just said a while ago that 
as DG you can’t be everywhere and you can’t do everything, obviously you have to rely 
to DDG’s, you have to rely on other officials and I can understand that very often maybe 
on a daily basis one or other official is dealing with a matter where they need you to 
make some decision or they need you to do some – write some letter to somebody, and 
therefore they might draft it for you, that I can understand so I am more concerned 
about the situation where you receive a letter from outside the department, that is 
addressed to you, and then you get a draft response from somebody without that 
20 
person having had any discussion with you or you having had any discussion with that 
person about the possibility of them drafting a response for you. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  It’s not normal Chairperson, it’s not normal, it may be it 
could have happened but it’s not something which is normal.  What was normal is what 
you refer to earlier, that was – it’s common. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 46 of 145 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you.  Mr Maleka? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Dr Ramontja you are quite correct, 
when you look at the letter of – the letter that you signed right at the top does indicate 
that enquiries must be directed to Mr J Raphela and his email is given so that’s the 
assurance that gave you that you could look at this letter and deal with it. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Fair enough.  Now I am going to take you through the 
contents of that letter and I am going to do so on the premise that you are quite 
comfortable that someone formulated the draft without talking to you and someone 
formulated a draft on matters that you have not been previously involved about 
10 
Optimum Coal Mine.  Is that a fair premise to proceed from? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Look at paragraph 1, the unnumbered paragraph, Chair 
I am at TR13. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It says receipt of your letter addressed to the 
Department pertaining to the intervention required from the Department refers, correct? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And it was quite clear when you read Mr Koko’s letter 
that he required the Department to intervene broadly in all the coal supply problems 
20 
Eskom had regarding various mines and various power stations. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And then the second unnumbered paragraph reads as 
follows: 
“Having regard to the above we would like to advise as follows: 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 47 of 145 
 
In respect of Hendrina Power Station the Department will prioritise and fast 
track approvals for the transfer of mining right on an urgent basis should this 
be launched.” 
Can I stop there, there is nothing in the letter of Mr Koko to which this letter is a 
response, that raised questions around transfer of money rights, do you accept that, 
that when you read Mr Koko’s letter it does not refer at all to transfer of a mining right, 
correct? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  I agree so, I agree he doesn’t refer to that. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And secondly it doesn’t even request the department to 
intervene on an urgent basis regarding a mining right, correct? 
10 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes, it doesn’t refer to that. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So that that part of the response drafted by someone 
without your engagement it responds to something that had not been asked by Mr 
Koko, correct? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Okay, that’s fine. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, let’s proceed then: 
“We have already requested an urgent meeting with the Competition 
Commission to go and plead the case and explain the urgency with which it 
must be treated as it is indeed a special case given the consequences for 
the country.” 
20 
Again Mr Koko’s letter does not even talk about the Competition Commission, correct? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It doesn’t even talk about an urgent approach to the 
Competition Commission, correct? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 48 of 145 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  There is nothing in that letter referring to the importance 
of National interest relating to an urgent approach to the Commission, correct? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   So in sum from the beginning to the end this second 
paragraph responds to nothing that Mr Koko had requested by way of intervention from 
the Department, correct? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Why then as far as you are aware someone would ask 
you to sign a letter purporting to respond to the urgent intervention by the Department, 
requested by Mr Koko and raise issues which Mr Koko did not seek intervention on, can 
10 
you think of any reason why that would happen? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Well the reason would be that there are people who have 
been discussing this issue of Optima and they then said let’s come with a proposal, let’s 
come with a letter to be sent to Eskom and that is what I would say, there would be 
people who would be looking at all these issues discussing them and they said okay 
let’s respond to this letter in this manner.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  That is a heightened deception by whoever formulated 
this letter. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Certainly so Chairperson when I look now, where I am now, 
I looked at the letter of Mr Koko, the letter of Mr Koko I mean I had no reason to distrust 
20 
a person of Mr Koko’s stature, standing, he was the head of Electricity Generation in 
the country, so when you get a letter like this and the letter paints a very dire situation 
for the country, if you look at that letter it basically- it was a precarious environment for 
the country that is coming, it has got deadlines, that I mean by end of January 2016 it 
will be the end of the end for this country in terms of electricity supply and now you can 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 49 of 145 
 
see that these things are connected.  He painted that there are at least three power 
stations which are at risk of not supplying electricity to the country if urgent issues are 
not addressed, if no interventions are put in place.  Hendrina he say 2000 megawatt is 
at risk, he talked about Arnot power station that come at end of December the contract 
is at risk and when you look at the letter it says the only available coal which will suit 
them is coal from Optimum I think or something like that and then he talks about Komati 
Power Station also at risk, so it painted this dire situation for the country that when I 
saw this thing I say hey you know what can I do, maybe this thing can help and I’m 
saying this Chairperson because I have in the past been involved in addressing issues, 
crises issues, okay.  We have gone out to look at issues of saving jobs and this also 
10 
touched on saving jobs, because Optimum had plus minus 3 700 I think employees 
including contractors who were working there. 
 
It was also a dire situation from my point, not from the electricity situation, 
the electricity situation Mr Koko then talked about it, but from our side was can we save  
jobs, so there were two issues which I looked at when I saw the letter, that’s the issues 
of the job, I said you know if this thing can help let me sign it, okay, because in the past 
we have done unconventional things and conventional things to save jobs.  In 1999 for 
instance if I may expand on that Chairperson there was a gold crises in the country, the 
gold price was at around 290 and now I mean today it’s about 1 300 dollars so jobs 
were lost and I was appointed to be the Secretariat to address this.  We did 
20 
conventional things, Ministers were meeting every Monday you know, we went to the 
mines, things which we often never did.  In 2014 I think – so 2014 – ja 2014 or so there 
were about 14 000 jobs which were going to be lost at Anglo Platinum.  We did a 
conventional thing, I stopped whatever I was doing, I sat with all the stakeholders for 
two weeks, we find alternatives to job losses. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 50 of 145 
 
 
In fact at the end of it when we signed that agreement we had almost saved 
all the jobs, okay, so unconventional things have been done in the past.  So when I saw 
this letter I reflected on what we have done and said as long as things are done within 
the law Chairperson it’s fine, and I want to address the issue maybe right now of the 
relationship between us and Eskom Chairperson.  Okay as a Department of… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Department of Mineral Resources.  Eskom 1 does 
not report to the Department of Mineral Resources that is number 1. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA:  Yes. 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Eskom reports to the Department of Public 
10 
Enterprise okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA:  Indeed. 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  2.  A DG of any department cannot give directives to 
Eskom.  In fact I could have just not signed this letter. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA:  And that is a point Doctor Ramontja. 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA:  That the request for intervention. 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA:  Is sent to your department. 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Ja. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA:  Which you were the head at that point in time. 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA:  And yet it is not sent to the executive authority who is 
responsible for Eskom for intervention because normal Minister to Minister protocol 
relationship … 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 51 of 145 
 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA:  Would have required that any intervention ought to begin 
with that executive authority responsible for Eskom for him to approach your 
department for any possibility of intervention.  Here is Eskom approaching you directly 
for intervention and yet it is not doing the same thing to its Minister. 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you answer that.  Please do not forget that question. 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Maleka intervened while you were telling me something, had you 
finished telling me about the relationship between Eskom and your department? 
10 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I want to give you a chance to finish telling me that if there was still if 
you had not finished. 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  The relationship between the Department of Mineral 
Resources and Eskom is an indirect one. It is indirect in the sense that the Department 
of Mineral Resources regulates the mining industry.  Okay.  Including the coal mining 
industry.  So Eskom gets coal from the mines to generate electricity.  That is the 
relationship which is there okay.  I – also I am surprised now that I hear that Advocate 
20 
Maleka says a letter was not even sent to the Department of Public Enterprises.  It is 
actually bringing certain things to me how I thought maybe they also sent something 
like that asking for assistance.  So that is why I am saying Eskom cannot even get a 
directive from a DG of Department of Mineral Resources.  Even from the Minister of 
Mineral Resources.  The only person who can give a directive to Eskom is the Minister 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 52 of 145 
 
of Public Enterprise in terms of corporate governance issues and the Minister of Energy 
in terms of policy issues.  Okay that is how it is but this issue now would be a corporate 
governance issues any directive that comes from the Minister of Public Enterprise.  
Even then the Minister of Public Enterprise would have to take that information and give 
it to the Chairperson of the board of Eskom.  Who would have to give it to the board 
and discuss it and say this is what is in front of us what do we do?  So after signing this 
letter and maybe I must touch on something else when…Is it fine Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja if it explains more the relationship tell me. 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Okay.  And the letter will just – I do not know how it 
went out of my office that is one thing.  And… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh the one you signed? 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  I did not know how it went out of my office and I 
spoke to my former secretary and I ask her to just to find out and trace because what 
happens in my former office is we used to record incoming mail and outgoing mail. But 
this one she could not find it, it is very strange you know.  And I just – you know I was 
busy with other things and I just heard that it is effaced in Parliament when some 
officials of Eskom were defending their actions using this letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you had – although you had signed the letter. 
20 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You had not intended it to leave your office as yet when it left? 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is why you had not put the date on which you signed it 
because you wanted to revisit it? 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 53 of 145 
 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From what you have said before. 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you did not authorise it being sent away, sent off to the 
addressee? 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  No, no, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was taken from your office under circumstances that you do not 
know? 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you tried to find out afterwards by asking your secretary whether 
10 
there had been any recording as to when it was taken and you could not find anything? 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Very strange because especially letters coming from 
outside where we record that this letter came in on such and such a date, this went out.  
So there is a record which is kept in the DG’s office you know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA:  Mr Ramontja – Doctor Ramontja we will explore later on 
whether this letter had the authority of the board of Eskom or even the Minister of 
Public Enterprises.  I am not going to ask you to comment on this but I am grateful that 
you have tabled the governance process around how Eskom should officially 
communicate with your department.  Now Chair I had raised yesterday with Mr Marsden 
20 
the condition precedents relating to the sale of agreement requiring the approval of the 
Competition Commission requiring the consent of the Minister of Mineral Resources for 
the transfer of the mining right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA:  And also requiring the consent of Eskom to the transaction.  
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 54 of 145 
 
All of those things in terms of the agreement had to be achieved. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA:  By the 31 December – 31 January 2016.  And you would 
recall that that agreement imposing those conditions precedents was signed on the 10 
October – sorry 10 December 2015.  Of course Doctor Ramontja does not know 
anything about this.  But what I find surprising is that even at that point in time when 
this response is sent to Eskom the obligation to implement these conditions of 
precedent – conditions precedents had not yet kicked in so the response is anticipating 
matters in the agreement which had not yet been included.  So it seems if I may 
suggest this to Doctor Ramontja against the context of what I have raised with the 
10 
Chaiperson.  That someone who was writing this response must have had some 
understanding of what was required in terms of this agreement relating to the approval 
of the competition commission, the consent of the Minister and also the consent of 
Eskom.  And that is why that paragraph I have read to you talked to those matters even 
though Mr Koko did not raise them.  Of course you did not know anything about these 
things? 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes I did not. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA:  Okay.  Chair I would like to go to the next part of the letter 
unless you have some questions? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you do so – so there is something quite strange about these 
20 
letters.  The one that was addressed to you by Mr Koko reached you but if I recall 
correctly you said you do not remember who brought it to you, is that right? 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know whether it came to you by – it would have come to you 
through the normal mail – post or –or it would have been delivered by hand or anything, 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 55 of 145 
 
do you know? 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  It looks now that it has been delivered by hand but 
as I said you know we have got a system in the DG’s office when I was still a DG 
whereby all the mails would be recorded as they come in and they go out.  Very few 
mails maybe you know of the corporate services because we on the same floor the DG 
corporate service would come to me and say DG there is this thing then we look at it.  
But generally especially mails from outside they would have been recorded it came 
here.  Mails from the Ministry would be recorded then as it goes out it would have to be 
recorded.  So strange when I asked my former PA to investigate that she said no there 
is nothing, you cannot trace it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the one from Mr Koko was also not recorded? 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And your PA also did not know how it came to – to be on your desk 
or … 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  She cannot recall anything I spoke to her after I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But at that time did you ask her that time or you only asked her 
recently? 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  No recently yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh at that time you did not ask her about how it came? 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  No I did not ask Chairperson yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But the one that you signed in response you did ask her about 
whether anything was recorded about how it left your office? 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes I did ask her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That one you did ask her at that time? 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes.  No not at that time. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 56 of 145 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Only recently? 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Only recently.  As I said Chairperson if my – if I may 
add?  But after that I just you know continued with my work until these things effaced in 
Parliament.  I just said what is this now?  You know.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what – what I – what I am trying to understand from your side is 
if you received – if you receive a letter such as the one you received from Mr Koko and 
you did not know how it came and then the next thing without you having spoken to 
anybody about the contents of that letter and having asked that person to draft a 
possible response for you you find a drafted response on your desk without knowing 
who brought it. You sign it.  You do not put a date when you signed it. You intend to 
10 
revisit it. Before you revisit it it disappears.  All of those things seems strange to me.  I 
am wondering why you should not have been quite concerned and take steps to really 
establish what was happening? 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Chairperson I agree with you and in hindsight I 
should have looked at it differently but as I said you know after I signed it I thought I 
could revisit it but then I got caught up with other things in the office you know.  And 
until… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I can understand being caught up and forgetting. 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That there was a letter that you wanted to revisit that I can 
20 
understand but I am concerned about a situation where at some stage you remember 
that there was this letter which I had signed but I did not date it because I wanted to 
revisit it. But it is no longer there and I do not know who took it.  And I did not intend 
that letter to leave my office as yet because I still wanted to satisfy myself about certain 
things that is why I wanted to revisit it.  It is gone.  You do not know who has taken it 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 57 of 145 
 
and well you do ask your secretary and she gives you an answer that suggests that she 
does not also know who took it.  And then you do not follow up. I mean – when you 
received that draft or the response or the draft you I think you said that you – you 
realised that it was saying enquiries Mr J Rapella.  Now that was your DDG who was 
dealing with matters relating to Optimum as I understand and or Eskom.  So I would 
have expected that he would have been the first person or at least one of the people 
you would approach to say I got a draft response which was left in my office for my 
signature. I read it.  I signed it but I did not date it because I did not want it to go yet. I 
was – still wanted to revisit it.  It has disappeared.  Do you know anything about it 
because you are in charge of Eskom issues or Optimum issues? 
10 
DOCTOR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Ja I think Chairperson in hindsight one could have 
done better.  One could have been vigilant.  But sometime you never expect that people 
can use a government system for their own ulterior motives.  But these things have 
happened.  Perhaps they saw weaknesses somewhere in the system and it looks like 
some people had their own ulterior motives and when you look at the two letters 
Chairperson you can clearly see that there were people you know working on these 
things without the department especially myself knowledge.  So in hindsight perhaps I 
should have revisited this and done it better than I did and I accept that that I could 
have done it better Chairperson.  I did not do it as I should have done.  As I think now I 
would do it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay Mr Maleka I see that we are… 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About 19 minutes past. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us take the short – the tea adjournment and we will resume at 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 58 of 145 
 
twenty-five to.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may proceed Mr Maleka. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Chair I would like to go to the next 
part of the letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  TR13 and I would like to do so quickly, because I 
10 
promised my colleagues who are waiting in the wings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, yes.  I actually forgot about. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That part, okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  They are waiting for your attention Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Alright. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Dr Ramontja you are still at TR13.  The letter that you 
signed.  I would like to deal with the last paragraph of that letter.  Are you there? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It reads as follows: 
20 
“Financial provision due to historical liabilities at OCH level is 
estimated at 1.7 billion.  The amount still has to be confirmed 
through a process which will involve the parties concerned.  We 
would also request Eskom to play an active role in providing 
support for the project to proceed.” 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 59 of 145 
 
Can I stop there?  Firstly the letter of Mr Koko says nothing about financial liabilities of 
OCH.  Correct? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  That letter did not even request Eskom to intervene at 
all.  Sorry, it did not request DMR to intervene at all regarding questions around 
financial liabilities of OCH.  Correct? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes, Chairperson 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The letter of Mr Koko did not even suggest that Eskom 
would have to play an active role in any project.  Correct? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes, Chairperson. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And yet this paragraph talks about a request to Eskom 
to play an active role in some project.  The question is did you understand what project 
this letter was referring to? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Okay.  The project I took it that, you know, the people who 
had been involved in the discussions they are basically discussing on how they could 
rescue Optimum or whatever at that point and I thought that could be the project which 
they are referring to, but it was just the mist in my mind.  I was not sure exactly what 
are they referring to. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  But then I just said look let us see, but obviously there 
20 
were people who came together, discussed, constructed the letter. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  So I said they probably have got other things which they 
are working on. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  No, I understand, but you were here yesterday when 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 60 of 145 
 
Mr Marsden testified? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you heard his evidence? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  He made it quite clear that at that point in time when 
your response was formulated. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Hm. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  OCM did not require any support at all, because its 
parent companies had decided to take it out of business rescue and they had decide to 
make sure that it will comply with its obligations under CSA.  So in hindsight having 
10 
heard Mr Marsden it should be clear to you now that OCM did not require any 
assistance whatsoever. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  No, Chairperson I agree with you.  I mean things are now 
getting revealed. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Oh, yes. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  And then it was a different environment.  It is like there was 
a crisis.  I have never, I mean if you reread the letter of Mr Koko it just paints a crisis of 
crisis for the country, you know.  I do not know why would a person draft a letter like 
that and now this are now clear that there is something not correct in the whole scheme 
of things.  Things are not fine Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well as you heard from my questions before the break I am also 
concerned about the fact that after you became aware that this letter that you had 
signed on the basis of assumptions and you did not know had brought it to your desk 
and you had not asked anybody to draft a response for you and it disappeared from 
your desk under mysterious circumstances.  You did not even as I infer from your 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 61 of 145 
 
evidence you did not phone Mr Koko and say Mr Koko you wrote me a letter and there 
was a response that I had signed to go to you, but I did not intend it to leave my desk 
yet and it had left my desk.  Have you by any chance got it?  Please do not act on it, 
because I had not intended to leave yet.  I still wanted to revisit it or something like that.  
You did not do anything like that? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Not, yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  I did not do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that concerns me, you know. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Okay. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Particularly in circumstances, if it was your own letter in the true 
sense.  You had drafted it, you knew exactly what the whole thing was about and it left, 
but you knew that there was nothing for you to continue to look at that may have been 
fine, but you presumed that certain people had discussed certain things that were 
dealing with Optimum, Eskom and the letter says certain things will be done and it says 
them under your own hand and you do not even know whether those things will be 
done I assume, because you do not know who drafted it and there is no assurance that 
what you say is correct. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  If I may come in Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  I think Chair at that time and as I said you know earlier on 
the communication channels. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  In the department had changed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 62 of 145 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  And you know I do not want to repeat this.  There was like 
a mist, you know, in front [background of noise]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  So when things come you just get discouraged.  You do not 
know what is happening.  You are trying to add the dots.  In a normal environment 
Chairperson, in a normal environment every single person who would be in the Mineral 
Regulation Branch, okay assigned to this task would transparently relate it to 
everybody.  So you will probably have your DDG who will work on something and say 
DG here is a problem, let us solve this.  Here is another. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  But the way things were operated they were totally 
different. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you see my point is exactly that. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That because on your own evidence you have said that the situation 
was not normal. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Issues relating to Optimum had been centralised in the Minister’s 
office. 
20 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were marginalised.  You were excluded from decisions that were 
being taken, you know, and you own DDG whereas before Minister Zwane’s time when 
he spoke to you about issues falling under him he would talk to you and update you 
properly.  On your own evidence you have told me he was now whispering to you about 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 63 of 145 
 
what was happening.  All of these things I am suggesting to you should have put on the 
alert and to have been even more concerned about a letter that you had not authorised 
to be taken out of your office having left without your knowledge in circumstances 
where you had not dated it.  So I am saying those strange and abnormal circumstances 
that you have told me about are the very circumstances that should have made you 
more worried and if you were more worried you ought to have taken steps to say well 
that letter whoever took it must be stopped, because it did not leave my office without, 
with my authorisation and you know who it was addressed to, Mr Koko.  So whoever 
took it must have intended to send it to Mr Koko and there is no reason why you could 
not have phoned Mr Koko and say disregard such and such a letter if it comes to you, 
10 
because I have not, I did not intend it to leave.  You will see it does not have the date 
when I signed it and that is because I was still going to revisit it.  Maybe I will respond 
with another letter or something like that.  So I just want to mention that and to give you 
a chance to say something and I am mentioning it simply because I am quite concerned 
about it. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Chairperson I think as I said earlier I in hindsight when I 
look at it I should have done better.  I should have been more vigilant than I was then, 
but I never thought that there are ulterior motives which are associated with the letter 
and it is said that now with all these things coming to the light you start to see that you 
know people can use the system of Government for their own benefit and I think I 
20 
should have done better. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  You should may proceed Mr Maleka. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair can I ask you to go to page 227 of Mr. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the bundle in front of me? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  No, of Mr Marsden’s file.  If you do not have it let me 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 64 of 145 
 
read it out to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, just read. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It is Clause 12 of the Sale Agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have got it, but you can just read. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and maybe for the benefit of Dr Ramontja.  It 
provides the following: 
“The investments held by Optimum Mine Rehabilitation Trust 
and Koornfontein Rehabilitation Trust shall on 31 January 2016 
comprise cash or cash equivalents with an aggregate value of 
no less than R1.750 billion.” 
10 
Now Dr Ramontja when someone in the letter that you signed talks about the estimated 
liabilities of OCH with regards to the Rehabilitation Trust Funds and pen down the 
estimate at R1.75 billion which amount is more or less the one that is contemplated in 
the in the clause of the Sale Agreement I have just read out to you.  It suggests that 
someone in DMR who was party to the formulation of this letter would have had 
information around the estimate of those liabilities.  Do you accept that? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes, I accept so. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  It can only come from within the department. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Indeed.  Were you aware when you were called upon to 
20 
look at this letter and sign it what were the estimate liabilities or OCH relating to the 
Rehabilitation Trust Funds of both OCM and Koornfontein? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  At that time I was not aware, because I would not be 
involved in the details of each and every mind what is the financial provision. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 65 of 145 
 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  So I was in the way.  Those things, it means someone 
actively went and checked it, because even if you go to a Regional Office now and say 
there is mine X.  Regional Manager tell me what is the financial provision he would not 
know or she would not know. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  She will have to go and look at the documents.  So that 
means there was someone who actively went and looked at those things and look at 
the values and say let us put this in this letter. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Indeed.  Without even responding to Mr Koko’s letter? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. Chair I am going to move to the next part of the 
letter, hopefully the last one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It begins at the end of TR113.  If I may read it out to you 
Dr Ramontja.  The last sentence there Chair says: 
“In return for the new owners honouring the current contract up 
to 2018...” 
Of course Mr Koko’s letter does not talk about new owners.  Correct? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  “…and driving formation.” 
20 
Mr Koko’s letter does not even talk about transformation.  Correct? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  “We would like to propose that consideration 
be made for some prepayment to be made for up to one year of 
coal supply.” 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 66 of 145 
 
Let me stop there.  Mr Koko’s letter does not even talk about prepayment in order to 
accommodate whoever was running the mine at that point in time.  Correct? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Hm. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  When did you become aware for the first time that 
Eskom had arranged a prepayment to be made to Tegeta? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Shoo. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And we now know that on record it is about R659-odd 
million. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  When it was in the news. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Before that you did not know? 
10 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes.  No. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And then it proceeds as follows: 
“…prepayment be made up to one year for coal supply.  
Understanding the upfront capital injection to be made to ramp 
up production to meet coal supply requirements from these 
mines.” 
We now known that as a matter of fact the prepayment which was extended by Eskom 
to Tegeta was not even for the capital or operational requirements of any mine. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Correct? 
20 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  In fact it was used to provide for the shortfall for the 
purchase of Optimum Coal Mine.  Correct? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So this representation in this letter is false.  Of course 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 67 of 145 
 
you did not know, but whoever wrote this letter at that point in time was misstating the 
facts. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Hm, ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Do you agree that whoever formulated the letter at that 
point in time without your knowledge was simply misleading you as the DG? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes.  I agree and after listening to yesterday’s statements 
which were made here I now, with regards to the letter from Mr Koko, I now see that 
you know there were some ulterior motives associated with the two letters.  It is quite 
clear from where I am now I do not want to make conclusions, but that there were 
people who were working on the two letters and unfortunately it is when I saw this 
10 
statement I said what it is, I understood the letter to be saying that this is a proposal, 
okay and I will also go back to my statement Chairperson of saying Eskom cannot get a 
directive from the department or another department.  Can only get a directive from the 
Department of Public Enterprise and the management of Eskom if they want to say that 
was a directive I have got a problem with that.  They do not understand how corporate 
governance works, okay.  This I just saw it as a proposal and said look there is a crisis.  
When is a crisis, which was painted by them by Mr Koko, when is a crisis you can do, 
you can look at other innovative ways of addressing the crisis.  We have done it in the 
past in a department, you know, when we did things unconventionally within the law to 
address the crisis.  So I looked at this letter.  I assessed the risk.  To me there was 
20 
nothing illegal on my part in the letter.  There was nothing which I saw that you know it 
is not, it is untoward.  I just thought this can be a proposal.  A proposal which will help 
the country.  We have gone through power cuts, load shedding in the past and I just 
said if this man is painting that there will be load shedding, there will be power cuts, 
perhaps this letter can assist, but I knew the corporate governance if they had to 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 68 of 145 
 
implement anything there they will have to go through the processes of Eskom.  So I 
just left it as it is and I am surprised now that they did not have contact their department 
on this issue.  They only contacted the Department of Mineral Resources, very strange. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair two concluding remarks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, you may proceed. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Two concluding remarks Dr Ramontja, the first is we 
now know from your evidence you do not know what happened to this letter? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Do you know whether or not this letter yours and the 
preceding one of Mr Koko were ever used by Tegeta in order to accelerate fulfilment of 
10 
the condition precedents in the share sale agreement it concluded with OCM, OCH with 
the support of Glencore? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  No, I am not aware.  As I said I was not privy to these 
issues totally. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Are you aware whether or not this letter could have been 
presented to the Competition Commission with a view to aid it to accelerate the merge 
assessment and approval of the OCH transaction? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  I am not aware. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Are you aware whether or not this letter could have been 
presented the Bank of Baroda in order to ensure that Tegeta would comply with its 
20 
obligation to fulfil the condition precedent? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Chairperson this is news to me.  I. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I am not saying that they have done it.  I am just asking 
you whether or not are you aware that these matters? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  No, I am not aware Chairperson. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 69 of 145 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  There must have been a purpose to this letter and 
I am not going to bore you with what I consider to be the purpose.  When Eskom 
through Mr Koko presents a situation of crisis and your department responds to this 
situation in a manner that does not relate to Mr Koko’s request the two are not talking to 
each other.  In fact I suggested to you that there is a clean deception.  Eskom’s letter 
deceives you.  Correct? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And this letter that we have seen you have written. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Hm. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Deceives. 
10 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Hm. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Eskom. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Hm. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Because it does not talk to its requirements.  Correct? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  No, I agree.  I agree.  I agree Chairperson, yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What do you think is the reason for this scale and scope 
of deception? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Well with what is transpiring now you can see that it looks 
like to me that there were people who were trying to favour Tegeta to acquire this asset 
of Optimum and this is just my perception Chairperson and they used the system of 
20 
Government to try to do that, okay and with the letter why did they go to the 
Department of Minerals to do this, I do not know why they did that.  Maybe it was an 
easier route for them to do that or they were part of whatever they were planning, but it 
is quite clear that there is a linkage of some kind and the enquiry will probably find out 
those linkages. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 70 of 145 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  From our part I agree with you.  Chair that is the end of 
our questions to Dr Ramontja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Dr Ramontja, this letter is not dated, but do you recall 
more or less round what date you would have signed it? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  It is around. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The one to which you were responding was signed by Mr Koko on. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  6 December 2015.  So, and on 10 December you were asked to 
resign, to put in your letter of resignation 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you only left at the end of January. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So are you able to say more or less around what date you think you 
must have signed it? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  It was before I submitted my letter of resignation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Around the 7th, around there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Around the 7th? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Ja.  Just after. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just after the 6th? 
20 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Ja, just after the Minister.  I think they had gone to Zurich.  I 
think they came back on the 7th. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  So it is on the 6th. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 71 of 145 
 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Around there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Around. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Those dates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay and in preparation for coming here, did you ask 
Mr Raphela about whether he ever knew anything about this letter? 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  I tried now because when I was with the investigators I 
asked them.  I said I can contact Mr Raphela, because I know at some point when that 
letter surfaced in Parliament. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  I sent it to him, but we never went into its details.  So, but 
10 
when the investigators were discussing this issue I asked them, I said can I contact 
people to prepare for my responses.  They then said yes it is fine.  Then I tried to phone 
Mr Raphela.  He did not return my calls, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you.  Thank you Dr Ramontja for coming. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To give your evidence.  I am going to excuse you for now.  Should a 
need arise for you to come back we will ask you to come back. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you, you are excused. 
DR THIBEDI RAMONTJA:  Thank you.  Thank you Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair, may we ask for a short adjournment for our 
colleagues who are going to deal with Minister Nene’s evidence to set up and 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no that is fine. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Prepare themselves. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 72 of 145 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will five minutes be enough?  Shall we say five minutes? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Shall I suggest 10 minutes?  So then you should not 
move in and out.  I am doing it for a convenience, but we may not be ready.  We have 
to go and. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let us say we will resume at 10 past 12. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Good after DCJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good afternoon Mr Pretorius, good afternoon Mr Nene, thank you. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Chair you have before you or should have before you 
Exhibit K2 which is the second bundle now dealing with matters relevant to former 
Minister Nene.  There are three bundles here and they have been bundled 
unfortunately into one file because of stationery issues but I won’t bother you with that 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  There are two applications for condonation, one of which 
20 
at least is now moot, being an application for postponement, that postponement having 
already occurred.  May I ask Ms Sello to deal with the two applications before you and 
then I will lead the supplementary evidence of Mr Nene. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Morning Chair. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 73 of 145 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Ms Sello, some of us who have been working from quite early 
know that it is afternoon now.    
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair it’s morning until the sun goes down.  Chair based on 
what Mr Pretorius has just said perhaps the best place to start would be with the 
second application for postponement, the one he says is moot, it is under tab 2 of your 
file, of K2.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That was an application that was filed on behalf of Mr Nene 
for a postponement due to ill-health and just to place on record that that application was 
actually heard on the 15th of November. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that was my recollection, so what is it doing here? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It so happened in the compilation of the file these two have 
always been together and I think the error occurred in duplicating both of them for 
purposes of K2.  It really should not be in the file Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So that one has been granted on the 15th of November so it 
is deposed of.  So what I stand to address you on primarily Chair is the application 
brought by the legal team  for non-compliance with the provisions of Rule 33 and that 
would be under Tab 1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now just to briefly give you a background Mr Nene testified 
on the 3rd of October 2018 his statement having been received on the 1st of October 
and the annexures thereto, the complete annexures on the 2nd of October.  This made it 
impossible for the legal team to comply with their 14 day 33 notice  The notices were 
however issued immediately upon receipt of the complete file and they appear as 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 74 of 145 
 
Annexures B1 to B4 in your file.  The reasons for the delay are well articulated in 
paragraph 14.8 and Chair we submit that they are reasonable under the circumstances. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I don’t what they are. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At paragraph 14 point 8 at page 17 ...(intervention) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let’s deal with this properly.  Is this in respect of the supplementary 
statement or the original statement.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No it is in respect of the original statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, so just take me back what had happened then? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay let start with the date on which Mr Nene appeared 
before you Chair, that was the 3rd of October.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If the Chair would have regard to page 17 of the bundle at 
paragraph 14.8 the legal team states that the statement was only received on the 1st of 
October and the complete annexures on the 2nd of October when Mr Nene was due to 
testify the following day, on the 3rd.  That meant that the legal team could not comply 
with the requirements of the 14 day notice period in terms of 33.   From paragraph 
14.8.1 also on page 17 we set out the reason why the statement was late in the first 
place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and what were those reasons? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The reasons were, a few reasons, it was – apologies, 
20 
Minister Nene’s busy work schedule at the time, he was doing a whole lot of travelling, 
there was – the issues he had to deal with, the volume was increasing and he had to 
apply his mind thereto, the availability of his legal representatives to complete the 
statement including the voluminous issues that were raised subsequent to the first draft 
and then there was ...(intervention)  
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 75 of 145 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the statement was supposed to have arrived when? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The statement was supposed to have ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  So in other words how long was the delay? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If the Chair has regard to paragraph 14.5 that’s where we set 
the timelines. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, just tell me what it says? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It says that on 29th August 2018 it was contemplated that Mr 
Nene would give evidence on the 10th of September.  The date was later changed to 
the 14th of September in light of Mr Nene’s unavailability and on 7 September a new 
date was arranged for the 3rd of October.  So if one then has regard to the 3rd of 
10 
October which is the new scheduled date the statement should have come, should 
have been received by us as a bare minimum 14 days prior to that date, that would 
have been mid-September, around the 15th of September Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, it ended up arriving on the 2nd of October? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It arrived in two parts, the statement itself arrived on the 1st 
of October and the complete set of Annexures to the statement arrived on the 2 nd of 
October. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, so the delay was about two weeks. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The delay was about two weeks Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes for the reason that you have given. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now the persons implicated by Mr Nene’s statement former 
President Zuma, Mr Mahlobo, Ms Joemat-Pettersen and Ms Nkoana Mashabane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 76 of 145 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If you permit me Chair I am going to hand up a few 
documents which were received after the compilation of the application which are the 
responses from the various implicated person, 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, I may not need you to hand them up.  I just need you to tell me 
whether you sent out the notices, when you sent them out, whether there has been 
reaction to them and when that was. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Let me start with former President Zuma, there has been .  
Notice was delivered in terms of B1 of the file and there has been no response.  Ms 
Nkoana Mashabane responded on the 19th of October to indicate that she had received 
the notice, perused the notice together with the attachments and in particulars 58 to 
10 
106 and she drew her conclusion that she is not implicated by the allegations made by 
Mr Nene, so that was the position she took and no further correspondence has been 
entered into.  
 
The second one Chair would be Mr Mahlobo, Mr Mahlobo’s view was to 
confirm that he did receive the notice of the 12th, and he too draws the conclusion that 
he is not implicated by the evidence of Mr Nene, he therefore elects not to give 
evidence, to call any witness or to cross-examine Mr Nene. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  He however indicated that he has no objection to the 
granting of the condonation application that we sought to bring.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Lastly communication was received from Ms Joemat-
Pettersen’s attorneys, it was a fairly long letter, basically requesting a range of 
documents much along the lines of better discovery to enable her to deal with the Rule 
3.3.  She confirmed however in that letter that she had received the notice, together 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 77 of 145 
 
with Mr Nene’s statement and the annexures thereto, requested this list of documents, 
which we considered irrelevant for purposes of Rule 3.4 and should she be interested 
to receive those further documents she is at liberty to get in touch with Mr Nene’s 
attorneys to receive them directly.   
 
In light of that – of that long list, she then – she indicated that the 14 days 
period hasn’t started to run against her, we indicated that everything that the 
Commission received from Mr Nene on the basis of which we issued a 3.3 has been 
made available to her and that under the circumstances we are of the view that she is 
able to make a determination whether to invoke her rights in terms of the rules, and we 
haven’t received a response thereto. 
10 
 
In her original response she had however made indicated her willingness to 
appear before you and to answer any questions that the Chair may have and that is the 
status of the implicated persons Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay, no that’s fine.  The REQUIRED CONDONATION IS 
GRANTED. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I am indebted to the Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Pretorius, I think ...(intervention)  
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  It is perhaps appropriate given the lapse of time to swear 
the witness in. 
CHAIRPERSON: Just administer the oath, thank you. 
20 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
WITNESS:  Nhlanhla Musa Nene. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections to taking the prescribed oath? 
WITNESS:  No objection. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your conscience? 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 78 of 145 
 
WITNESS:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will be the truth, the whole truth, 
nothing but the truth, if you say so please raise your right hand and say so help me 
God. 
WITNESS:  So help me God. 
NHLANHLA NENE:  (duly sworn states) 
CHAIRPERSON:  I understood Mr Nene it was end of last year that you had injured 
your foot, I hope it has fully recovered. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Chair it is 97.3% recovered and I called in the benefits of old 
age, I turned 60 a few months ago, so it takes slightly longer for a person of my age to 
10 
recover, to head. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.    Yes Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you.  Mr Nene in the file K2 before you after the 
second divider you will see a document entitled supplementary affidavit of Nhlanhla 
Musa Nene signed, do you see that?  It’s after the third divider.  That part of the bundle 
has been separately paginated and if you would go to page 15 please.  Whose 
signature is that on page 15? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  It is my signature Mr Chairperson. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And the statement pages 1 to 15 is that your statement? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  It is indeed my statement. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Are you aware of the contents of that statement? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  I am fully aware of the contents. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Are they true and correct? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Absolutely. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Before dealing with the contents of your statements it’s 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 79 of 145 
 
perhaps necessary to explain Mr Nene why you are here today.  You gave evidence 
before this Commission on the 3rd of October 2019, you obviously recall that. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That’s correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  However in the one or two days before you testified 
several things took place, firstly an article appeared in electronic media and the press 
making certain what appeared to be serious allegations against you.  In the bundle 
before you they appear, and I will refer to them in detail in due course, from page 50 
and following, all these articles to which I am now going to refer were provided to your 
legal representatives in order to allow you an opportunity to consider them. 
 
Secondly on the 2nd and 3rd of October the Economic Freedom Front, the 
10 
EFF released public statements also making quite serious allegations against you, 
these appear at page 59 and 61 and we will refer to them in a moment, and then 
various other allegations appeared in social media for example the allegation at page 
69.  
 
Now on the 3rd of October – and we will come to them in a moment Mr Nene 
– on the 3rd of October there were discussions between the Commission’s legal team 
and your legal representatives, the result of which was that you were informed by the 
legal team that it would be unfair to confront you with these allegations at that stage 
when you had not had a chance to consider them and to consider your response, and 
in response to that information you undertook to come back to give evidence before this 
20 
Commission for two main reasons, one so that these allegations could be put to you, 
you having had a chance with your legal representatives to consider their detail, and 
secondly to allow you to put your own response to what is contained in these 
allegations, and that is the purpose of your evidence today. 
 
If I can take you then to page 50 so that we may understand these 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 80 of 145 
 
allegations, on page 50 and it appears that this is an article that appeared in Business 
Live and it was derived from internet sources, its source is less important for the 
moment at least than what is said in the article.   
 
The first paragraph reads: 
“Towards the end of last May a former colleague of mine, John Gludlu, who 
writes a column for Business Day wrote something that made my hair stand 
on end ...” 
Says the author of this article. 
“Julius Malema is at it again, he wrote “this time he has set his sights on 
Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene, holder of probably the most important 
10 
cabinet portfolio after the President.  During the debate on the Presidency’s 
budget vote Malema accused Nene, who was reappointed to his old job in 
February of impropriety, suggesting that the EFF is in possession of a 
dossier of meetings he had with dodgy business people during his tenure as 
deputy to then Finance Manager Pravin Gordhan.” 
That’s the first allegation that’s quoted in this article, you deal with it in your statement.    
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  I do. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  The second allegation that arises in this particular article 
is a quote from a former employee of the Mail & Guardian newspaper, one Zukile 
Majova, and he apparently circulated the following on Facebook and that statement 
20 
appears later, once again Chair we seem to be offline.  Chair we seem to be offline? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, I was looking at ... 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, perhaps the allegations be ... 
CHAIRPERSON:  We might have to take a short adjournment, let’s take a five minutes 
adjournment while that is being attended to.   
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66

INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you DCJ.  I’m told that I omitted to inform you that 
the legal representative of Mr Nene are before you, may she put herself on record? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Didn’t they before, or maybe – well let them do it, it’s okay. 
ADV ADILA HASSIM:  Thank you Chair, that might have been on behalf of Mr Fezile 
the last time. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV ADILA HASSIM:  I appear, together with my learned friend Ms Rajah for Mr Nene. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.  Yes, you may proceed. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Nene before the break we were 
dealing with the allegations that appeared in the article that is on page 50 of the bundle 
before you, and we were referring to a report that was circulated on Facebook, 
apparently authored by one Zukile Majova, and this person wrote: 
“Amon Bongani : Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene issues his son’s 
successful oil company funded by PIC while he was the Finance Deputy 
Minister and Chair of PIC.  Raymond Siphiso Debengwa and Kingdom are 
20 
both Zimbabwean friends of Nhlanhla Nene and were funded by the PIC for 
an IPP project, approved by Nhlanhla Nene hence Debengwa is now sitting 
on the Eskom Board.  Mail & Guardian will soon run this story.  They even 
have traces of money through Dubai (same banks as the Guptas).  They say 
Nhlanhla Nene was not only linked to the Guptas but instrumental in funding 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 82 of 145 
 
many of their business deals.  Some money went through Switzerland bank 
to RSA into the account of Nhlanhla Nene’s wife.  Apparently Nhlanhla wants 
to resign as Finance Minister.” 
Those allegations you deal with in your statement? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  We should note that Amon Bongani subsequently denied 
that they were the source of this report, although Mr Majova purports this report to be 
an Amon Bongani press release, is that correct? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Then on page 51 and I am not going to read the whole of 
10 
these allegations, but just to highlight the important ones, in the middle of page 51 
reference is made to a damaging narrative abroad that Nene pressed Survé, Iqbal 
Survé, to consummate the agreement with the Gupats and that he did that because the 
Guptas had something on him and then reference is made to an accusation made by 
the EFF, Mr Malema, that he, Mr Malema has got a scandal that they’ve got on him, 
that’s Mr Nene, that involves his daughter which they gave to him and they never 
reported it, that too you deal with in your statement, is that correct? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That is correct Commissioner. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  The Majova Facebook report appears in the following 
pages in small print but in the terms that have just been read onto the record, it appears 
20 
at page 58.  Do you see that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page is that Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Page 58, that is the Majova report that appeared on 
Facebook, it’s printed in smaller form on page 58. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, I see it ja. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 83 of 145 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And we’ve read that onto the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And then on page 59 is a press release at the hands of 
the EFF headed “our case against Nhlanhla, and we will come to that in detail in due 
course and the allegations made in it, but it was released on Tuesday 2 October 2018, 
the day before you gave evidence, and the first paragraph reads: 
“The Economic Freedom Fighters, EFF, notes the reports that the Minister of 
Finance intends to reveal his conditions and close working relationship with 
the Guptas when he was Deputy Minister of Finance and Chairperson of the 
State-owned 
asset 
management 
company, 
the 
Public 
Investment 
10 
Corporation.” 
They then refer to a letter written to you and the allegation is made that you refused to 
respond to the questions in the letter, you deal with that in your statement, is that 
correct? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Indeed I do. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And then in the middle of the page the EFF make the 
following statement: 
“What the Nhlanhla Nene developments reveal is that throughout his tenure 
as Deputy Minister of Finance and Chairperson of the PIC Nhlanhla Nene 
was captured by the Guptas and worked for them.  He negotiated business 
20 
deals for them and bullied those who sought money from the PIC to submit 
to the demands of the Guptas.  The reason Nhlanhla Nene was appointed as 
Minister of Finance by a captured Jacob Zuma was because he was working 
with the Guptas.  When he was Minister of Finance he stopped taking their 
calls and tried to work independent of the Guptas.  That is the reason they 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 84 of 145 
 
approached Ncebesi Jonas and later Des van Rooyen to be Minister of 
Finance because their appointee was no longer cooperative.” 
So in summary Mr Nene it seems that the allegation made by the EFF in regard to your 
conduct was that whilst you were Deputy Minister of Finance you cooperated with them 
but thereafter you refused to cooperate, that’s their allegation and you deal with that as 
well in your statement. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And then at the bottom of the page in the last paragraph 
the following allegation appears: 
“The EFF is aware of many other dealings and dark secrets that 
10 
compromises Nhlanhla Nene and will reveal all if he does not voluntarily step 
down as a Minister of Finance.” 
And then over the page the first paragraph reads: 
“The people of South Africa should know that there’s no one credible and 
honest in the entire leadership of the ANC, they have dark and dodgy 
secrets, that is why the ANC must be removed from power in 2019 and 
replaced by a revolutionary corrupt-free economic emancipation movement.” 
The next paragraph reads, which is a direct allegation: 
“Mr Nene what the Nhlanhla Nene developments reveal is that throughout 
his tenure as Deputy Minister of Finance and Chairperson of the PIC Nene 
20 
was captured by the Guptas and worked for them.  He negotiated business 
deals for them and bullied those who sought money from the PIC to submit 
to the demands of the Guptas|”. 
And then there’s a repeat of what appears on the previous page, and that appears to 
have been issued the day before you gave evidence.   
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 85 of 145 
 
 
The following documents are really repetitions in one form or another of 
documents that we’ve already referred to, but if I may just finally take you to page 69 
there appear again sourced from social media a number of allegations and a summary 
of those allegations, there’s nothing new there and we’ve already dealt with those 
allegations in summary and on page 70 lastly is an email addressed from one Mr Ancu 
Shamar to Duduzane Zuma concerning a project called Brakfontein, do you see that? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That’\s correct sir. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  That is then copied to Siyabonga, Nene, your son I 
believe, who acknowledges receipt and you deal with allegations in relation to that 
project as well in due course, is that correct? 
10 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Those are in short the allegations that were brought to 
your attention by the legal team that you were then given an opportunity to consider 
and form the background of your presence here today.  May we then please go to your 
statement, at page 1, and if I could just ask you to express your sentiments in your own 
words is there anything to add, or that you would wish to add about why you are here 
today, other than what we’ve already dealt with, and what may appear in paragraph 1.   
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Thank you Chair.  There isn’t much to add on the statement 
because as I indicated that I would be quite prepared to return to the Commission in 
order to answer on these matters and that these matters be put to me but I also at the 
20 
end of the term, submission, I did deny the allegations being levelled against me by the 
Economic Freedom Fighters and others and that it had any basis in truth, I therefore 
agreed to come back and be able to – and that is the reason why I am here today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you, thank you for coming back. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  May I just add Chair that the work of the investigators is 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 86 of 145 
 
ongoing, issues relating to the PIC will be dealt with by a separate work stream and 
obviously political parties including the EFF will have an opportunity to give evidence, 
but I may say that we have not received from any party any evidence to this – at this 
stage, or until now in regard to the allegations made, other than our own investigations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no that is fine.  Issues that fall under the PIC will have to be 
looked at carefully in the light of the fact that there is a commission chaired by Justice 
Mpathi which is looking at certain issues relating to the PIC so the legal team of the 
commission will need to apply their minds to the question whether it is not appropriate 
for those issues to be dealt with exclusively by the PIC commission to avoid a situation 
where same issues are dealt with in two different commissions with the risk that may 
10 
arise of different findings being made.  The legal team will need to apply their minds to 
those issues because if and when they come before me I will ask for argument on those 
issues. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair.  We do know – I do not have the terms of 
reference of the party commissioned here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  But the terms of reference do restrict. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Their own work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  To a particular time period commencing 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  So insofar as there is evidence before that period 
relative to the work of this commission we may need to deal with it independently.  But 
we are aware of the possibility of duplication. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 87 of 145 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no that is fine but you might need to do more than just relying on 
your understanding of the terms of reference because I seem to remember reading in 
the media and I do not know if it was true but I seem to remember reading in the media 
that that commission had taken the view that its mandate is wider than what seems to 
be generally understood. So some communication might be necessary to understand 
whether there is a different understanding of the terms of reference whether that is 
based on a different interpretation of the terms of reference so that we can be fully 
informed before we make up our own minds.  Ja okay. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  That will be thoroughly examined.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  For the moment  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  I am reliably informed … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  By the legal team. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Whose sources are ordinarily impeccable Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja thank you. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  If we may then go to page 2 of your statement Mr Nene.  
What position did you hold between the dates 8 November 2008 and 25 May 2014? 
20 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  I held the position of Deputy Minister of Finance and I was 
also the non-executive director and chairperson of the PIC board.  And as stated in the 
statement so although this is not required by law it has become practice that the deputy 
ministers serves as chair of the Public Investment Commission board or Cooperative 
board. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 88 of 145 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Now would you then please deal with the allegation that 
you knowingly acted to promote funding from the PIC to benefit your son or any 
business in which your son was involved in at the time? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  These allegations were made as you have correctly pointed 
out in the media before I appeared before this commission that I acted improperly 
concerning investments made by the PIC in particular that I knowingly acted to promote 
funding from the PIC to benefit businesses that my son Siyabonga Nene is involved in.  
My response at that stage and it remains that I did not promote any financing from the 
PIC to any companies involving my son and I go further to say that I was not aware that 
the PIC funded a business that my son was involved in during my tenure as Deputy 
10 
Minister and Chair of the board and he had never shared any information with me 
either. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright before you go on this issue was also the subject 
of a – of an investigation by the current Public Protector. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Public Protector yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Resulting from the a complaint lodged with her by the 
Democratic Alliance, the DA. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  We will deal with that in a moment. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  You say that in your capacity as Chair of the PIC you 
were not aware of any financial assistance given to your son or to any business in 
which your son was involved at the time, is that correct? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That is correct.  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Did your son ever tell you about any business benefit 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 89 of 145 
 
that he might have received from the PIC? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Not during my tenure as Deputy Finance Minister but he did 
share this with me at a later stage where he was indicating that they had applied for 
funding with the PIC and I do cover that in the statement. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Ja we will come to that in a moment.  Did you ever 
attend a meeting of the board of the PIC where a decision was made to fund a business 
in which Siyabonga Nene was involved? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Not according to my recollection and I trust the PIC board 
records would bear me out on that. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And did you ever receive any information from any 
10 
official or board member of the PIC that such an application for assistance from the PIC 
was being considered by the PIC? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  No. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Do you know whether at the time or did you know let us 
split that issue up into two what you knew then and what you know now.  At the time 
you were chair of the PIC did you have any knowledge of any grant to your son of any 
benefit from the PIC? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  No I did not. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What came to your knowledge after you took office as 
Minister of Finance and after your relationship with the PIC board had come to end? 
20 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Well that was after I had actually taken office as Minister of 
Finance after I also left the board my son and his – my son informed me that he himself 
and his business partner Mr Mirza who had applied to the PIC… 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Is that M-i-r-z-a? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That is correct yes.  That they had applied for financing of an 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 90 of 145 
 
investment in Mozambique Oil Refinery and I reminded him of my previous 
admonishments that he could not be involved in business with government because of 
my role in government that I also would never use my position for the private benefit of 
myself or any family member.   
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  So you knew your son was involved in businesses at the 
time you were chair of the PIC? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Yes Sir. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Just bear with me a minute Chair please? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  I am informed Chair that once again technical problems 
10 
have arisen and that we have been asked by our support team to request a short break.  
I am not sure what the problems are and what affect they will have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let us rather find out what the problems are because we see we 
are still online.   Will somebody talk to Mr [indistinct] Stimella  
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes he has spoken to us Chair and asked that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh he does not know? 
MR STIMELLA:  [indistinct] because there is a technical glitch with the vans outside the 
SABC vans have got a challenge they are tripping to give the live feed at home but we 
are live here but at home is a problem 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  At home? 
20 
MR STIMELLA:  Ja if the [indistinct] are not coming through. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Well apparently Chair although we are “live” here 
everything else outside is dead so that is the problem in a non-technical sense.  I do 
not have the fancy words to describe it.  But apparently the feed is not operative. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay then we may as well take the lunch break we are five 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 91 of 145 
 
minutes before one o’clock and hopefully those who need to attend to it will attend to it 
even during the lunch hour so that when we come back we can resume and proceed 
smoothly.  We will take the lunch adjournment and we will resume at two o’clock.  We 
adjourn. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may proceed Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Nene we were at paragraph 7 of 
your statement.  You would have at some stage read the news report or the news 
10 
reports to which we made reference earlier today and particularly the statement 
regarding your alleged role in the PIC. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Did you speak to your son about those allegations once 
you had read the report? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Indeed I did speak to him and he assured me that he never 
received any benefit from the Public Investment Corporation and [intervenes]. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  When did you discuss his alleged partner Mr Mirza? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Yes.  We did and he did indicate that Mirza may have 
benefitted but the extent of the benefit is unknown to me because it was now through 
20 
his company where my son was not involved. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Did he tell you what his relationship was with any 
business in which Mr Mirza might have been involved when Mr Mirza might have 
received funding from the PIC? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Look the relationship originally when they applied for funding 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 92 of 145 
 
was that they were partners, but when it reached a point of whatever benefit might have 
accrued to Mirza my son was no longer party to that. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  So did your son break with Mr Mirza? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Yes, from the company that was doing business. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Did you receive a communication from the Public 
Protector during October 2018? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That is correct.  I did receive a complaint from the Public 
Protector. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And did that complaint or did the communication refer to 
a complaint received from the Democratic Alliance particularly Mr David Maynier? 
10 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  If you look at Annexure NN1 please which is on page 16. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Yes, I [intervenes]. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  That is a letter which appears to come from the Public 
Protector’s Office addressed to yourself and it is dated as most public documents or 
communications are date at the end 24 October 2018.  That appears on page 18. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  The complaint, I might as well just go there, is in 
paragraphs 3 and four which read: 
“In his letter of complaint Mr Maynier alleged that “I am writing 
20 
to request an investigation in terms of Section 4(2) of the 
Executive Members Ethics Act into the conduct of the Minister 
of Finance Nhlanhla Nene whose son Siyabonga Nene 
allegedly may have benefitted from an investment made by the 
Public Investment Corporation.”” 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 93 of 145 
 
Paragraph 4 reads: 
“Mr David Maynier also stated in his letter of complaint that “the 
Minister was variously the Finance Minister, Deputy Finance 
Minister and Chairperson of the Public Investment Corporation 
at the time his son allegedly may have benefitted from the 
investment made by the Public Investment Corporation.”” 
And so the question put to you in essence appears at page 17 of the bundle at 
paragraph 6.2 an indication: 
“Whether you had any involvement and/or influence in the 
granting of an investment by the PIC to your son 
10 
Mr Siyabonga Nene and/or Mr Muhammad Amir Mirza and/or 
any entities or companies related to Mr Siyabonga Nene and 
Mr Muhammad Amir Mirza.” 
That is the communication received in relation to an investigation conducted by the 
Public Protector.  Did you respond? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Indeed I did respond Commissioner and the response is 
attached as Annexure NN2. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  You responded in writing? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  I did, yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Did you attempt to respond in any other way? 
20 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  In the letter the Public Protector had indicated that she would 
be amenable also to a one on one engagement and I had preferred that, because I 
thought that would answer all the questions, but then she felt that perhaps I just need to 
respond in writing if there is a need for a one on one we would be able to do that. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Did you ever have a one on one meeting/ 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 94 of 145 
 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  No, we did not. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Since she was not available for a one on one, but I submitted 
the written response. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Would you look at page 19 Annexure NN2 please? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Yes, correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Is that your response? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That is my response, sir. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  It reads in paragraph 2 or three: 
“During my tenure as a Deputy Minister of Finance and the 
10 
Chairperson of the Public Investment Corporation I in no way 
tried to influence the investment process and decision 
regarding the PICs consideration of investment in Mozambique 
Oil Refinery or its funding of the equity participation of 
Mr Amir Mirza and Mr Siyabonga Nene via Indiafrec Trade & 
Investment (Pty) Ltd or any other investment for that matter.” 
Now was that information regarding the partnership or the equity participation of your 
son and Mr Mirza?  Your recordal or was that the Public Protector’s recordal of the 
position? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That was the allegation, but also what I was stating in the 
20 
letter was that I had not tried to influence the investment process into this company at 
all. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Well did you know of Indiafrec Trade & Investment (Pty) 
Ltd or any investment in the Mozambique Oil Refinery by a concern in which both Mirza 
and Siyabonga Nene had equity? 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 95 of 145 
 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Indeed I had been informed later after my departure from PIC 
as Chairperson. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  At the time it is alleged to have been made? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  At the time, no. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  What did your son tell you about the allegation? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  He. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  In the paragraph above. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  He informed me that he derived no benefit from the 
investment by the PIC in the oil refinery and also that subsequent to them having 
applied for financing he had also resigned from that company, but also whatever benefit 
10 
might have accrued, would have accrued to the company that his partner alone was. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Do you know whether that company in which 
Mr Mirza had equity ever received a benefit from the Public Investment Corporation? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  I am not sure sir. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Did you then invite the Public Protector to engage the 
PIC directly on the matter? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Absolutely. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And you offer in the last paragraph or the penultimate 
paragraph to meet with the Public Protector? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  The communication that we have just referred to is dated 
26 November 2018.  Do you see that?  That is on page 19. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Yes, the NN2 of that document. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Since then have you heard anything further from the 
Public Protector? 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 96 of 145 
 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Indeed I did receive an acknowledgement of receipt from the 
Office of the Public Protector I think two days after that.  I think it is NN3. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  In that document on behalf of the Public Protector 
you are thanked for your assistance.  Has anything transpired since? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  No, nothing sir. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Let us move onto paragraph 11 please.  
Annexure A is dealt with in that paragraph and the paragraph that follow and Annexure 
A appears at page 50.  We have summarised the allegations in that already.  Generally 
speaking what do you say about the allegations made on page 50? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Sir. 
10 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And on the following pages up to page 52. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Categorically I deny all allegations made in Annexure 1 of this 
Commission’s questions and I truly can only describe this report and social media 
commentary as baseless and unfounded. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  It is a rather general allegation, but requires a 
response nevertheless.  You were alleged to have had meetings with quite “dodgy 
business people” and the EFF states that it has a record of these meetings.  What is 
your response to that/ 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Again my response is simply that I never had any meetings 
with those dodgy business people and I invite the EFF to provide such evidence to the 
20 
Commission and to myself. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What about the allegation concerning Iqbal Survé and 
the Independent Group?  Now one of the underlying facts that might be relevant is that 
we know that the PIC invested up to R1 billion in the Independent Group of Mr Survé 
[intervenes]. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 97 of 145 
 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Again I would perhaps refer the Commission to the processes 
that are followed by the PIC and I strongly refute any allegations that I might have 
anything to do with that, but the processes of the PIC would also, you know, bear 
testimony to what role as a Chairman and at that time personally and what Chairman is 
supposed to do in that instance. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  This might well be a matter that is currently being dealt 
with by the Mpati Commission. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Absolutely. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Dealing with PIC affairs and according to press reports 
that is in fact the case. 
10 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  But let us take it step by step please.  Did you have any 
role in bringing about the transaction which led to the investment in the Independent 
Group? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Absolutely none, sir. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What role did you play in relation to Mr Survé and 
Mr Ajay Gupta or the Gupta family? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Because I stated in my, when I appeared before this 
Commission that around August 2014 Mr Gupta asked me whether an arrangement or 
an agreement between the PIC and Mr Survé would preclude the family from 
20 
participating in the deal and I was able to confirm that that was not the case and that is 
about my only involvement in this matter. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right, would you speak up a little please.  I think 
[intervenes]. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  I am saying as I stated in my submission on 3 October that 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 98 of 145 
 
during August Mr Ajay Gupta had asked me whether an agreement between the PIC 
and Mr Survé would preclude them from participating in any arrangement with him and I 
was able to explain to him that was not the case. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  The news report refers to a letter that you 
allegedly wrote to the PIC.  Again it is not a very precise allegation, but I quote: 
“For certain people to get the money…” 
And it is alleged that Mr Malema is in possession of the letter, firstly have you ever seen 
such a letter? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  I have never seen such a letter and I have no doubt that there 
would not be such a letter, but I would again invite Mr Malema to produce that letter, 
10 
because it might assist in clarifying. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Whilst you were Chairman of the Board of the PIC would 
you have ever had occasion to write a letter to the PIC asking for people to get money? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Absolutely not. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  After that period did you ever communicate in 
writing with the PIC? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  No, sir. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  When this article was published had you been asked to 
respond to its contents? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  No, I was not asked and I mean it would have helped if I was, 
20 
because I would then have been able to explain my side of the story. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  You have said that you did advise the Guptas that 
they were not prevented from entering into a partnership with Mr Survé arising out of 
any establishment by him in the Independent Group? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That is correct. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 99 of 145 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Other than that did you ever facilitate any business 
transaction and I use facilitate in its most general sense for the Gupta family? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  None whatsoever. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Let us deal with the Facebook posing please apparently 
by one Zukile Majova and that appears in legible form at page 53.  This contains some 
far reaching allegations.  Perhaps you should go to page 58 where the legible version is 
please.  Firstly it purports to be a quote from the press entity amaBhungane.  Now we 
know that amaBhungane from other information in this bundle have denied their 
[indistinct].  In any event let us deal with the allegations.  The first is that: 
“His son Siya Nene…” 
10 
And I am going to read as it stands here. 
“…successful oil company funded by PIC while he was the 
Finance Deputy Minister and Chair of PIC.” 
You have dealt with that? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  I have dealt with that sir. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  It follows: 
“Raymond Sifiso Dabengwa 
and 
Kingdom 
are 
both 
Zimbabwean friends of Nhlanhla Nene.” 
Let us stop there.  Is that correct? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That is incorrect.  As I indicated also in my statement that I 
20 
only Mr Dabengwa as Sifiso Dabengwa because he was Chief Executive of MTN, but I 
have never made any personal contact with him. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Let alone being friends. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright and the person known as Kingdom? 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 100 of 145 
 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Kingdom is not known to me as at all unless he trades under a 
different name, but I do not know him. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  It says that these two persons were funded by the 
PIC for an IPP Project approved by Nhlanhla Nene.  Is that correct? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  It is not correct and I do not understand how I could have 
approved an IPP Program. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Is it correct that Dabengwa was at a time a 
member of the Eskom Board? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  I would not know, but on investigation I think he was, I mean 
earlier last year or late in 2017, I think he does feature because we only did that when 
10 
we were checking on the records because when we saw his name we wanted to check 
whether he ever was on the Board, but it is not something that I knew prior to this 
allegation. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Well what you say of the at least implied suggestion here 
that you were somehow influential in bringing Mr Dabengwa onto the Eskom Board? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That would be incorrect, because as I said I mean also in my 
capacity I do not understand how I would have actually influenced his appointment, 
because at that time I was not in Government and when the Eskom Board was 
appointed and I only knew about his appointment when I was actually following up on 
whether he ever was on the Board. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Following up from your being made aware of the 
statement? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  It is then says: 
“Mail & Guardian will soon run the story.” 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 101 of 145 
 
Do you know of any Mail & Guardian article dealing with these issues? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  I did not see it in the Mail & Guardian. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Then there is a reference to “they” presumably Mail & 
Guardian 
“…even have traces of money through Dubai same banks as 
the Guptas.  They say Nhlanhla Nene was not only linked to the 
Guptas but instrumental in funding many of their business 
deals.” 
What do you say to that in particularly the allegation that you funded it through a bank 
or funded the Guptas businesses through a bank in Dubai? 
10 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That Chair I also did deny this under oath before the 
Commission and goes on to say that my wife also received money in a foreign account 
and judging by how often my wife is broke I would have really, I would have really 
celebrated if she had a foreign account, because I would also share on that one. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Then it says apparently: 
“Nhlanhla Nene wants to resign as Finance Minister.” 
When did you decide to resign? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That was only in October last year. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right and we will come to those circumstances. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Correct. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  In due course. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Then if we go back then please to paragraph 18 
and well perhaps 17.  You do state there that: 
“You know Mr Dabengwa only as the, or a CEO of MTN and 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 102 of 145 
 
you never had personal contact with him and you disavow any 
knowledge of Kingdom.” 
Do you see that? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That is correct, yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And then in paragraph 18 you deal with the fact that your 
wife does not have an offshore account.  Is that correct? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That is correct, sir. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And again you invite evidence to this effect? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Absolutely. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  You repeat in paragraph 19 that you were in anyway 
10 
instrumental in funding any business owned by the Gupta family.  Have you ever been 
blackmailed by any member of the Gupta family? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Definitely not, sir.  I cannot remember or recall any such 
blackmail. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  There is a reference to a scandal involving your 
daughter.  Do you know anything about that? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Not that I know of, but you know I mean any issue involving 
my daughter would actually be private and, but as far as I know there was no blackmail, 
but I mean if there is a need also to. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Again you invite that evidence? 
20 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Absolutely. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  It is also alleged that you were appointed Minister of 
Finance on 24 May 2014 in exchange for a promise to deliver benefits to the Guptas.  Is 
that statement correct? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  It is definitely not correct, sir and again if there is any 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 103 of 145 
 
evidence to that effect.  It would be appreciated. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Generally what do you say about the contents of the EFF 
press statements of the 2nd and 3 October 2018 as annexed to your statement? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Look I mean it is, I find it very strange and I must say that it 
can only be speculation that I suspect one that this might have been political more than 
anything and as you have seen in the statement it does indicate that it goes further to 
say that there is no one who is clean in the ANC and the only solution to this would be 
to remove the ANC from power and elect a revolutionary force which is the EFF, but 
also sir I must indicate that while though this is speculation among other things that I 
was involved in it is common knowledge that there was a link between the EFF and 
10 
VBS at some point where it turned out it is common and public knowledge that 
Mr Floyd Shivambu’s brother benefited from the. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright, well let us just pause there for a moment, before 
we get there. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  There was an accusation in the press reports that you 
failed to respond to a parliamentary question put to you by Mr Floyd Shivambu of the 
EFF on 12 June 2018.  Do you recall that allegation? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  I do recall that allegation and I have provided evidence that 
that was also not true, because the parliamentary question was responded to and there 
20 
is evidence of that. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right and there is an email chain at pages 40 to 41 
which assert the hand delivery of the response to the questions? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And at page 42 is a letter addressed to Mr Shivambu 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 104 of 145 
 
which goes on to page 45 which on the face of it at least responds to his questions.  Is 
that correct? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Now if you were asked why do you think the EFF 
or anyone else for that matter, but in this case the EFF would want to publish 
allegations about you shortly before you came to this Commission to give evidence? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  As I said I strongly believe that there might have been an 
attempt at tarnishing my integrity before appearing before the Commission and 
therefore bring my evidence into question, but also these attacks on the National 
Treasury and myself in particular and other members of staff at the Treasury had 
10 
actually started mounting even prior to that.  There is a; as I was beginning to indicate 
that it is common knowledge and public knowledge that one of Mr Floyd Shivambu’s 
brothers or his brother had benefitted from the VBS matter.  A matter of which. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry what was your role in relation to VBS at around 
this time? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  I. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Do you want to let him finish properly before you follow 
up?  I thought you had not finished, Mr Nene had you finished answering that question? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  I had, but I think the second question also links quite 
20 
[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  I just want to be sure that you have been able to answer. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Fully, okay. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  I am comfortable Chair, thank you.  You know, my role was as 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 105 of 145 
 
Minister of Finance putting a bank like the VBS in that situation was the task of the 
Minister of Finance which is what I did a few days after I had been appointed and. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Can I ask you to? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Go back to your first sentence in answer.  I did not hear some of the 
words in your answer. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  It started from my role. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, just this last, the last two sentences I think. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Okay.  I said one of what I needed to do as Minister of 
Finance was to put, it was going to be my duty as Minister of Finance to take a decision  
10 
on whether to put a bank like the VBS with its challenges under curatorship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  So the application that was made by the Governor of the 
Central Bank was sent to the Minister of Finance and during that weekend a few days 
after I had been reappointed as Minister of Finance one of the things I had to do to 
engage with was dealing with VBS and I have it on record here that there was an SMS 
that was or a text message that was sent to me by Mr Floyd Shivambu and I have made 
a copy of the transcripts and my legal team will be able to provide you with the 
transcript of that SMS and if I. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  And if you allow me I would, it is not very long.  I can actually 
just read it out to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, you may do so, but just remind me again when was your 
reappointment of Minister of Finance [intervenes]? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  I was reappointed as Minister of Finance on the 20th, I think 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 106 of 145 
 
28 February 2018. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And soon after appointment you received a request or application 
from the Governor of the Reserve Bank or when you were reappointed it was already 
pending in your office? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  No the application was, when I was appointed I am sure the 
processes were under way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Because a report had already been received that the Bank 
was facing liquidity challenges. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  But the process had not reached. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The decision had not been taken yet? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were going to be the person to make a decision? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No, thank you.  You may read the SMS. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  And the short SMS which was copied also to the National 
Treasury DG reads as follows.  It says: 
“Greetings Minister, it looks like VBS will be placed under 
curatorship mainly due to something that National Treasury had 
20 
not clarified in terms of the accounts of municipalities which 
were withdrawn due to National Treasury’s instruction.  It 
becomes sad when a Black owned bank gets to be placed 
under curatorship because of things that can be managed 
differently.  Please assist, because it looks like the whole thing 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 107 of 145 
 
will need your final approval.  Regards, Floyd.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what was the date of that SMS? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  This was received either on the 9th or the 10th of March 
because it was copied to the DG, the DG was able to confirm that and when we met on 
the Saturday of that weekend we met at the airport because I was travelling to the UK 
for the first road show and we had to take this decision, but when we met both myself 
and the DG had received this communication so it was part of our discussion when we 
met on the Saturday prior to our departure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it was a week or two, within a week or within two weeks after your 
reappointment? 
10 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  After my reappointment, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, did you say around the 10th. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  The 9th or 10th of March, either Friday or Saturday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Just in relation to this, do you have personal memory of 
having received the sms in these terms? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That is correct, yes I do. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  You do have that sms any longer on any of your 
devices? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  I do not have it on my devices but we were fortunately able to 
20 
get it from the DG’s cell phone who was copied on this one.  When I left the National 
Treasury I needed to clean my phone of all the information that was on the phone so 
that I don’t leave with confidential information from the Treasury. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Where does this – did you forward this message to 
anyone? 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 108 of 145 
 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  We had a discussion because the DG had the message, I also 
had the message, it wasn’t forwarded. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And that message is still on his phone? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  On his phone yes.  So this is but one of those reasons that I 
think might have actually, because I did not succumb to this kind of pressure because 
this was meant to influence my decision based on something that I don’t think Mr 
Shivambu understood what was the reason because putting the bank under curatorship 
was not because we actually wanted to destroy the bank which was black-owned, the 
purpose was actually to make sure that we close the leakage because if we didn’t do 
that come Monday that bank would actually have collapsed, so the purpose here was to 
10 
actually remedy the situation and it was a decision that I found strange that somebody 
would want to influence my decision on that. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  In any event your evidence as I understand it is that you 
had certain responsibilities in relation to the VBS Bank which you duly carried out in the 
period before and after receipt of that sms. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That is correct.   
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Is there any other reason that you can think of that you 
might have been a target at that time? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Look I mean though it is also mere speculation but I would 
really want the perhaps the Commission to look into the issue of SARS of which I was 
20 
also responsible for assisting the Presidency in terms of putting together the terms of 
reference, because as we all know that at the beginning the EFF was in support of 
dealing with issues at SARS but all of a sudden there was a change of heart and they 
were defending the then Commissioner of SARS and the first point I would like to put 
on the table is that it is known that a gentleman by name of Adriano Mazzoti was under 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 109 of 145 
 
investigation by SARS during Minister Gordhan’s tenure and it is now known and 
admitted by Mr Malema that he had funded and supported the EFF, but also that the 
investigation into this particular gentleman was stopped when Mr Monyane was 
Commissioner of SARS and it’s also known that the EFF has now vigorously defended 
Mr Monyane against his suspension and eventual removal.  I would really love the 
Commission to look into the matter because these are some of the things that in the 
course of doing our work we might have trampled on people’s toes and the vicious 
attacks might have been necessitated by some of this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You seemed to be reading from something just now, is that 
something that’s part of what we have here or is it something ...(intervention)  
10 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Chair it is not, it  was just a reminder of the facts that I would 
want to bring to the attention of the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that’s fine. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  So in short during 2018 and before your resignation you 
under your watch as it was Minister were responsible for dealing amongst other things 
with the matters related to the South African Revenue Services? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That is correct sir. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Did you play any role in the decision to appoint the 
Nugent Commission? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:   Well our role was to assist the President and put together the 
20 
terms of reference and assist the Presidency also in identifying Commissioners so the 
National Treasury under my leadership was directly responsible for supporting the 
President and assisting in putting that together.   
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  In your last answer you mentioned the name of someone 
who had allegedly supported the EFF in relation to the matters raised by you regarding 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 110 of 145 
 
SARS, we may have lost that on the record, you spoke very quickly, what was his 
name? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  It is a gentleman known Adriano Mazzoti. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Mazzoti? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Did you support the establishment of Nugent 
Commission in your role as Commissioner, in your role as Minister? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Absolutely yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:   Then at the instance of the legal team we’ve asked you 
to deal in more detail with your visit to the Gupta residence and the Gupta business at 
10 
Sahara Computers, do you see that at the bottom of page 7? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That is correct Chair yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  You do deal with it in your statement of 5 October 2018 
on pages 47 and 48, but what I would like to emphasize please is two points, which you 
deal with in that statement and perhaps when you deal with your reasons for the visit 
you can deal with these two issues, the first is why would a Minister visit businessmen 
at their residence and without accompaniment by any Treasury official, and secondly 
why would those visits take place after allegations in the press regarding the at least 
questionable business dealings of the Guptas, so would you tell the Commission please 
in detail of your visits, why you visited, and deal too with those two issues that I’ve just 
20 
highlighted please. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Yes Chair as I indicted at my previous appearance to the 
Commission that I visited them on several occasions and when I did that of course 
there were other occasions when I got the invite that I was not able to honour the 
invitation, it was not always honoured, but it was difficult not to honour an invite 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 111 of 145 
 
because it is public knowledge that the family were friends with the President and they 
personally stated that they even provided employment to his son, so you know your – it 
is not easy to antagonise your boss’s friends, but having met with them they had also 
claimed to be advising him on economic matters and that Mr Ajay Gupta had served in 
the Economic Advisory of former President Thabo Mbeki and it was for those reasons 
that they invited me to – I mean that we were invited to events as they would, but also 
that they would invite me to have a conversation on these matters. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  May I just stop you there, this is a general explanation 
you’re giving together with some detail of your visits, I think the Chair would prefer you 
just to tell him without necessarily reading the statement.  You say you made visits to 
10 
the Gupta family on a number of occasions, can you recall how many? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  We were able to obtain these from a – because I mean it was 
not something that I kept a record of but we were able to obtain proof from my 
protectors’ logbook during that period in order just to try and ascertain as to the 
number, it turned out to be about eight times, eight occasions, but again in response to 
your original question ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before you do that can we just get the dates if possible that 
the first visit may have been around, what time and the last time around what time, if at 
all possible? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  The dates are not very clear but I would imagine as I have 
20 
said when I obtained it from my protectors diary but I do try and cover that in the 
subsequent paragraphs as to ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, if you do cover it somewhere you can just mention, I just want 
as you give the explanation I just want to know what period we are talking about. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  In my statement in paragraph 30 I do indicate that I was 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 112 of 145 
 
invited twice to have a tour of the Sahara Computer offices in Midrand in 2010, and we 
were informed that he was an economist and an advisor to President Zuma, I recall that 
he specifically told me on the first visit also that they – which is one of the points that I 
would like to emphasize that they don’t do business with government, but the purpose 
of the invites and the engagements were mainly to portray themselves as good 
corporate citizens, paying taxes but not doing any business and try to dispel the notion 
that they are getting favours from government. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Let’s go back to paragraph 25 if we may, you say there 
you made six visits when you were Deputy Minister of Finance and two visits when you 
were Minister of Finance, is that correct? 
10 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That’s what I was able to establish from my protectors logbook 
yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, the two visits that you made when you were 
Minister of Finance would in all probability have been after the press releases dealing 
with the Guptas business dealings? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That is correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in particular it would have been after also the landing of the 
aircraft at Waterkloof because you became Minister of Finance as I understand for the 
first time in 2014, is that right? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I think the landing of the aircraft was in 2013 based on some of 
the evidence, yes. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may proceed Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  When you made these six visits as Deputy Minister of 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 113 of 145 
 
Finance and the two visits when you were Minister of Finance did you go alone. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Well as I said it would mainly be with the protectors but I was 
indeed alone yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes you give your view in hindsight of the advisability of 
that and we will deal with that later. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That’s correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Why would you visit as Minister of Finance firstly to their 
home and secondly unaccompanied by any Treasury official after the Waterkloof 
landing or after the scandal or alleged scandal had appeared in the press. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Look as I have also indicated even in my letter or public 
10 
statement that I made after the appearance to the committee, or to the Commission, in 
hindsight I do think that perhaps that was an oversight and an error of judgment on my 
part, but I must also indicate that you know in the spirit of being accessible and not 
passing judgment on people only because of media reports, at times you continue to be 
– to remain accessible even to you know the people that you would rather prefer not to 
but it becomes difficult if you have paid visits to particular individuals and I must say 
there are quite a number of people that one does visit and when you are invited it’s not 
always that I would take somebody with, all in the interest of being accessible, because 
you know one of the things that we are accused of as politicians or people in the 
position that I occupied was that of not being accessible and I have always thought that 
20 
you know engaging with a person does not immediately constitute any form of 
impropriety unless I do something improper that arises out of that engagement and I 
mean perhaps it is my nature that I remain open to engagements even with people that 
perhaps one should actually try and keep a distance of, and I was talking to the legal 
team the other day, I said maybe I have read too much of Sanzo’s book on the Art of 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 114 of 145 
 
War of subduing your enemies you know without necessarily antagonising them, but I 
think in hindsight and I do say this with all the humility that I think perhaps one could 
have done differently. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  At the time these visits were made did you know or did 
you have reason to suspect that there were allegations of influence being exercised 
over the former President and government officials? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Look I actually took their assertion of not doing business with 
government at face value, but the only time that I got aware of them doing business 
with government was when I realised that National Treasury in 2013 was investigating 
the matter of the Daily in the Free State and at that time I actually you know had an 
10 
indication that it might not necessarily be correct that they don’t do business with 
government, but I did not want to raise that as an issue since there was a formal 
investigation that was on and I did not want to raise that in an informal setting when 
people invite you to say by the way you guys are being investigated for this because 
that would actually send the message that I already have – made my conclusion 
without allowing the investigation to run its course. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Well the allegations were pretty overwhelming, 
particularly when seen in the light of the landing at the Waterkloof Airforce base was it 
not a good idea to stay at arm’s length at that stage? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  I would imagine that was the reason why after that that there 
20 
were only two of those visits and after that I declined most of the invites. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  You will recall last time you gave evidence here 
in October of 2018, notwithstanding politicians, certain politicians view to the contrary I 
did ask you a series of questions dealing with probabilities, let me put them to you 
again in case they weren’t hurt.  We know from the evidence that the Gupta family is 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 115 of 145 
 
alleged to have made not one but several untoward approaches to senior government 
officials and politicians asking amongst other things for favours, raising expectations 
and even offering money in return there for, you know of those allegations? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Now to the extent that that evidence is accepted by the 
Chair it would seem quite improbable that similar approaches were not made to you, 
quite apart from the Iqbal Survé approach, what do you say to that, do you have 
anything to add to our answer given last time. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Again I would have thought that it would not have been easy 
for them having portrayed themselves as these good corporate – because it seems like 
10 
they employed a tactic of they charm offensive on the others and I am not too sure how 
many of my other colleagues may have actually been subjected to a similar approach, 
but it is unlikely that you will get any volunteers after the price I paid, but they would 
actually have those approaches, the charm offensive on the other side but on the other 
side also being arrogant and actually demanding favours from the other colleagues and 
just ...(intervention)  
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Can I just – what was the position in regard to any 
influence sought to be exercised over yourself apart from the matter you’ve raised in 
connection with Independent Group and Mr Survé? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Other than that I think all they needed to do was to play this I 
20 
mean PR exercise of appearing to be good corporate citizens and I think if they actually 
even made any attempt of an approach it would have actually been contrary to the view 
that they had actually been – or the projection that they have been putting forward. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Did you ever have a discussion with any of the Guptas at 
one or other of their premises, residential or business in regard to the launch of the 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 116 of 145 
 
television channel ANN7? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Yes they did allude to that. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What happened? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Well again they had to, they told me that they are going to be 
launching this TV channel and seeing that the ANC administration was under severe 
attack from the current media houses they would want to launch a TV channel and they 
were in the process of launching it, which would give a completely different perspective, 
they would give a balanced view of government, which is what according to Mr Ajay 
Gupta was what they would want to do once the new channel has been launched. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Then just to provide the detail insofar as the detail may 
10 
be relevant I understand from your statement that you visited the Gupta Family on 
about eight occasions, six visits while you were Deputy Minister of Finance and two 
visits when you were Minister of Finance, and those visits were at the home in 
Saxonwold and at the Midrand offices. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Once you were Minister of Finance did you have 
occasion to visit the Saxonwold home of the Guptas, and I’m at paragraph 39 of your 
statement. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Indeed in 2014 as Minister of Finance I did and again as I 
indicated it was just casual business. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And was it on one of those visits that you were asked to 
intervene in a dispute between themselves and Dr Iqbal Survé. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That is correct ja. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And then the second visit? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Again it was to respond to the matter and I would imagine that 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 117 of 145 
 
was the last one. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  You will recall at the beginning of your evidence 
we referred to the email chain at page 70 of the bundle. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  There appears there to be at least on the face of it some 
relationship between your son, Siyabonga Nene, and Duduzane Zuma in relation to a 
project called the Brakfontein Project, would you tell the Chair about what you knew of 
that and your interactions with your son in that regard please? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Again this is a matter that only came to my attention when this 
email was forwarded to me, it is only then that I again engaged my son who then 
10 
informed me that whilst they were looking for business opportunities they came across 
this opportunity where the owners were selling a stake in the mine, and they then 
embarked on a process of due diligence which led them to not proceed with the 
transaction because the mine was overpriced and a number of things that would not 
have made business sense. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  So did your – firstly this series of emails as they appear 
on page 70 were they drawn to the attention of yourself and your legal representatives 
by the Commission’s legal team? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That’s correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right, and you were asked then by your legal team to 
20 
respond to this issue that had been raised by the legal team of the Commission? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That’s correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And you say that as I understand it there was in fact 
according to your son at least contemplation of a project involving your son and 
Duduzame Zuma and perhaps others called the Brakfontein Project? 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 118 of 145 
 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  But it never eventuated. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  No it didn’t. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Why did you resign after giving evidence Mr Nene? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Chair you would recall that after my appearance ENCA played 
a previous interview which I had given three years ago where I had not disclosed my 
formal engagements with the Gupta Family and I felt that the office that I occupied 
should remain beyond reproach and it’s integrity should be unquestioned and realised 
that I did not respond honestly in my previous interview with ENCA after my dismissal 
from the position in 2015, I felt that it was inappropriate of me, you know if it wasn’t a 
10 
position of Minister perhaps I would have asked for special leave so that I have time to 
clear my name, but I felt that due to the nature of this impropriety of having not been 
honest at that time and although I say this message came, this question came as a 
number of questions as I always put it, from a journalist who otherwise had indicated 
that the discussion was only going to about what I’m doing after my dismissal and I had 
thought that it is not appropriate, it was not the appropriate time for me to discuss some 
of those issues but when the question arose I think I took an easy way of not being 
honest at that time and I felt that it is inappropriate for a person occupying my position 
as I first issued a public apology and after that public apology judging by how 
unforgiving South Africans are I felt I would rather vacate the position and make life 
20 
easy for the President rather than – because as I say if it was another position I would 
asked for special leave, but being a minister appointed by the President I’d rather make 
life easy for the President and ask the President to release me. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Did you consult the President in relation to your 
resignation? 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 119 of 145 
 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  I did, over that weekend sir I made several attempts to get 
hold of the President who was not reachable until the Monday after.  You would know 
Chair as it appears in the statement that during that Monday or Tuesday I was 
supposed to be travelling to Bali for an IMF World Bank meeting as a representative of 
the country I felt that it would be inappropriate of me to leave the country on such an 
important trip and assignment having not cleared this with the President and in my 
attempts to reach the President the communication was very clear that whatever it is 
that we do should be in the best interests of the country and I would strongly believe 
that with this cloud hanging over my head perhaps I should vacate the position but the 
President was unreachable until the Monday when he did come back to me, I shared 
10 
this with him and he said I must give him a bit of time and then he returned and said 
you know with a heavy heart well he agrees with me, perhaps he should accept my 
resignation. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Mr Nene your statement, public statement to fellow 
South Africans is at page 47 and 48 of the bundle, if you wish to I am going to invite you 
to read it because you deal there with at least two questions raised in relation to your 
relationship with the Guptas that we’ve discussed in evidence, the fact that they were 
visited at their private residence and secondly at the time in relation to at least some of 
the visits when there was public controversy regarding the Guptas.  So if you wish to 
read it onto the record it will take a minute, you may. 
20 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Chair would you want me to read me the entire 
...(intervention)  
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Well certainly paragraphs 2 and 3. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Yes, well in the – in this media statement I said: 
“Part of my duty as a Public Office Bearer is to meet fellow South 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 120 of 145 
 
Africans and other stakeholders when they request to do so.  
However I was wrong in meeting the Guptas at their residence 
and not in my office or at least a public place.  I say this being 
mindful of the fact that it is quite common practice not only in 
South Africa but globally for public office bearers to attend 
gatherings including dinners at residences of business people, 
fellow politicians and other stakeholders, but context matters, as 
soon as I became aware of the controversy swirling around the 
family’s business dealings I should subject to there being a 
legitimate reason for doing so have met the Gupta’s at my office 
10 
accompanied as is customary by a Ministry of Finance or 
National Treasury official.  In return for the trust and faith that 
you have placed on me I owe you conduct as a public office 
bearer that is beyond reproach but I am human to.  I do make 
mistakes including those of poor judgment.  However it is 
reasonable of the public to expect public office bearers to own up 
fully and timeously to the mistakes they make in the course of 
carrying out their public duties.  I should also have disclosed 
early and fully the details of these meetings in particular those 
that took place in Saxonwold.” 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  In that paragraph you set a standard that you say you 
should have adhered to and public office bearers should adhere to and then in the final 
paragraph the statement of paragraph – on page 48 you encourage anyone who has 
evidence in regard to the work of this commission to come forward and hand it over to 
the commission, do you see that? 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 121 of 145 
 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That is correct yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  A question that has been raised and perhaps I am pre-
empting a question that you would ask Chair so stop me if I am. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no continue. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  The invitation has been made several times by the Chair 
for people in government and people who have been members of the executive to 
come forward to the commission and to tell the commission what they know of the 
matters which this commission is investigating.  The response has been present but 
hardly overwhelming.  Can you explain from your own experiences why this should be 
so? 
10 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  You mean why the other office bearers are not coming here – 
forward? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Well not in the quantity that the Chair I think would have 
liked and the Chair has expressed that very sentiment this morning in a public 
interview. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Well I can only speculate again Chair that we are not wired 
the same.  There is always a price to pay and I do not think we are all prepared to pay 
the price.  We also have you know having taken the oath of office to be contentious in 
what we do our consciences might also not necessarily be the same to lead us to come 
forward and own up if there is any wrongdoing on your part.  But also there is – I would 
20 
want to say that there is fear of you know – you know the positions at times become 
more important than us.  The titles we are given some of us would like – would want to 
die for.  You know and it becomes therefore difficult for some of us I am only – I am 
merely speculating Chair.  But also for fear of retribution and what might come as a 
result of that and I always believe that there is nothing as liberating as being able to go 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 122 of 145 
 
to bed with a conscience that you can live with but also we are parents you do also 
want to be able to say to your kids if there is anything untoward that you have done 
own up so that we can move on.  And I do not think I can be able to do that if I do not 
own up myself.  So I do not have a direct answer to your question but I think you know 
as a nation these are some of the things that if we want to build a society we should all 
do some introspection into how we conduct ourselves. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you very much Mr Nene.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you Mr Pretorius.  I am going to want to talk more on the last 
topic that Mr Pretorius asked you a question on but before that I just want to ask a few 
questions in regard to other aspects of your evidence.  You said that you have been 
10 
able to establish that you visited the Gupta residence 8 times, is that right? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  About 8 times yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Six times when you were Minister – Deputy Minister of Finance 
and two times when you were Minister of Finance.   
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now that seems to me that – that seems to me to be quite a 
few times and I think you used the word several times a while ago and each time at the 
residence, is that right? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Each time at their residence but also I think that includes the 
visits to the – to their businesses. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh ja , ja. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But basically at their places? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Mostly yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja.  Now that may be concerning to some people to say was that 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 123 of 145 
 
not too many times.  What would you say if anybody thought along those line? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Chair I might say that you know as I said earlier that perhaps 
it is in the spirit of being accessible and I can attest to – I mean I can say without fear of 
contradiction that there are other you know business people I might have visited more 
than those times. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Because I did not see anything wrong in visiting them.  Of 
course with the controversy around them I think – around this particular family I do think 
and it is for that reason that I say perhaps I could have you know limited that.  But if you 
get an invitation from somebody as I say I do not think it is only – it is just the visit that 
10 
matters.  I think it is what comes out of the visit that matters.  And if I am invited to your 
house Chair and we have a casual chat about what you do especially people who 
would always say look I am in this kind of a business and this is you know my 
contribution to the economy but I would like us you know to have a conversation 
because of my experience in business because of my close proximity to government in 
terms of advising you know the president economically so it is important to hear those 
people out but not necessarily that and I am not – I can assure you that it was for me 
there never was a real issue with whether we can engage or not.  But we never – I 
never got that advice except things like when you talk about a deficit that you know 
your officials are too concerned with a deficit you know countries run as huge deficits 
20 
as they possibly can.  You do not have to be concerned so much about the deficit.  And 
with the little experience that I had I would actually be able to you know have such a 
discussion and explain the reason why a huge deficit can be a risk and what is it that 
we are doing as a country but other than that you know a casual discussion that you 
know translate into some kind of engaging with regards to how the economy is run for 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 124 of 145 
 
me I thought it is something one could handle.  Of course the number of visits and as I 
say that on hindsight perhaps I could have limited that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I think you are right to say in principle a visit to somebody even 
at their residence as a minister on its own you know should not be a problem.  But I 
think in the context of this family there may be part of the concern might be in the minds 
of some South Africans might be that we have heard evidence in this commission for 
example and I think it was in the media even before this commission that members of 
this family would sometimes boast that they call Ministers to their residence whenever.  
So partly when one has regard to evidence or allegations along those lines one then 
gets concerned if there are many visits to that family.   
10 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You understand where out of the concern maybe it might not be just 
a visit but the more visits there are to the family in the context of allegations such as 
these then the greater the concern might be.  Do you understand that? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  No I accept that Chair but I think the point I was making 
earlier was that prior to the commission and prior to some of the evidence that has 
surfaced other than the media reports you actually would not be able to say we think 
you guys are guilty of an act of impropriety and therefore it was – it was  the difficulty 
one had was of how do you then suddenly when you get a call all of a sudden you say 
no I cannot come to you you guys are you know in the media as having done XYZ but 
20 
with no evidence.  But at the same time as I said that the whole purpose of the 
engagement would mainly be from their side all these things that are about us in the 
media are not true.  So unless there is a particular matter either before the courts Chair 
I see the TV has switched off I hope … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You hope it is not you? 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 125 of 145 
 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  I hope I have not done anything untoward.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  I do not know whether I should – I should proceed Chair or… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do not proceed.  I do not know what is happening today.  I think we 
will just have to take a few minutes adjournment again.   
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  It is back on Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay maybe it is what you said. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Ja. Whatever it is I will not repeat it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us continue.  You were making the point that they were 
saying whatever you read about or you heard in the media about them the allegations 
10 
they were not true. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That is correct Chair.  And of course at that time I did not have 
any evidence to say but you know these matters are either before the courts or 
wherever but you know other than that – and I actually cannot rule out and it is for that 
reason that I actually regret having not heeded you know or having you know done 
things differently because one would have thought that when people keep on inviting 
you you would not even know whether you are even being filmed as one of those 
people that are you know the regulars here.  And your name could have even been 
used to say look he is a frequent visitor here.  So all of that I do not think one was alive 
to what they – what the consequences of that might be.  The – around there is a lot of 
20 
name dropping when people drop your name and there is evidence that you are a 
frequent visitor here.  It makes sense which might have been the reason why you get 
invited just in order to demonstrate that you know I have got him on my side.  But 
without necessarily asking for any favour from you but making sure that as long as you 
a regular here then I can always drop your name.   
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 126 of 145 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you did stop accepting invitations from them and when you 
stopped I guess nothing had been proved in court about them? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  I did Chair and I must say… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So why did you stop? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  And I must say that it was on realisation that perhaps it is 
indeed not appropriate because it could not continue indefinitely.  This was now as I 
said in 2013 there was an investigation already on the [indistinct] 
CHAIRPERSON: [inistinct] 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Yes on the dairy farm but again in 2014 and as I said when I 
declined an invitation it would not be just declining an invitation because I think you 
10 
guys are corrupt it would actually be very polite you know I am unavailable because of 
the work schedule as well as Minister then which was different when one was Deputy 
Minister but as Minister the responsibilities were you know also much more heavier.  
But it would be very polite declining.  I am not too sure whether if they had persisted I 
perhaps would not have again paid one … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ended up… 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  One or two visits again but ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know what I want to understand is for a certain period of time 
part of the explanation you gave for going there was your desire to be accessible 
number 1.  Number 2 saying that you know there may have been allegations against 
20 
the family in the media but nothing had been proved in court as yet and therefore you 
know your attitude was well there is nothing wrong with the visits as such as long as 
you did not do anything improper during that visit – during those visits.  So but I am 
saying then at a certain stage you decided no I am not accepting the invitations 
anymore from them.  So had that view changed about because about saying look the 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 127 of 145 
 
allegations have not been proved? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Look the allegation were actually getting stronger and 
stronger Chair and I – one needed to actually draw a line as to how long you actually 
would want to be associated with people who are always in the media for the wrong 
reasons.  But again as I said it would be a very polite declining of the invitation with the 
hope that that would not – they would not draw not any inferences with regards to 
whether I have already found them guilty which – because I had not.  But I felt you 
know there needs to be a line you need to find the right balance between being 
accessible but also a – between being accessible and your accessibility being abused 
for reasons that you believe might actually arise out of that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes the investigation that was conducted by the – by the National 
Treasury which I think you said was in 2013 when was it concluded do you remember 
and what was the outcome of the … 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  I am not sure other than what ended up being in the public 
domain as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  But I am not sure whether it – because once the investigation 
had been concluded by the National Treasury whatever wrongdoings had been 
identified had then to be referred to the law enforcement agencies to deal with the 
matter.  I would not have the dates but I would imagine that the National Treasury 
20 
would be able to provide us with the dates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would National Treasury after concluding the investigation have 
briefed you on the – on what had been found or would they not? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Chair I cannot recall whether there was – because there were 
a number of investigations that the National Treasury was working on and I am not sure 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 128 of 145 
 
whether – I cannot recall a briefing on this particular… 
CHAIRPERSON:  A briefing on it ja. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Not on this particular one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but normally it is something that they would not do when they 
have done certain investigations to make sure that the Minister is briefed maybe 
anything goes to law enforcement agencies? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Yes under normal circumstances. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Normally they would do that? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You just do not remember whether in this particular case they did it.o 
10 
not remember whether in this particular case they did it. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That is correct, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Now with the eight visits my understanding of your evidence is 
that the Gupta family never asked you to do anything for them really, is that right? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That is correct other than the one that I mentioned where they 
wanted me to clarify… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And these meetings or these visits when you visited them it was just 
discussions on economic – the economic situation or other issues connected with the 
20 
economy and so on and maybe personal – just personal issues or – I just wonder how 
you can describe the topics that were being discussed because the evidence that I 
have heard from some witnesses suggest that they were very vigorous in trying to get 
government business that is the Gupta family.  So I am just wanting to establish the 
kinds of issues they discussed with you what they were other than issues of the 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 129 of 145 
 
economy? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Look as I said earlier I think it would have been difficult for 
them to talk about any business with government after they have portrayed themselves 
as not doing business with government.  And I would want to believe that they wanted 
me to also buy into the story so that even if I hear issues of them having done business 
with government I would be under the impression that but they do not business with 
government.  So I do not think they would have been able to say anything about doing 
business with government.  But other than that Chair they would actually be very casual 
and I know for a fact that trying to promote their publications I remember in one of the 
engagements there was a request that I do a piece in their magazine The Thinker which 
10 
is you know still in publication you know. And I do not remember where we left that 
matter but it was one of the discussions that you know it would be good to do a piece 
that would feature in their publication.  But also when the – their newspaper was in 
circulation it would also be one of those opportunities to market themselves as – you 
see the stories that we write you know are publication are presenting a different 
narrative from what we would see in the you know media in general which means we 
i.e. a [indistinct] you know be publishing house.  But also that it is important for the 
public to get this different view.  So it would actually range from those issues without 
any particular matter other than on specific ones like I said when one was invited to the 
Sahara business to show how many youngsters they employ that are in the technology 
20 
space and what they produce and what they you know – what their contribution is to the 
economy both in terms of building this young and nurture this young talent but at the 
same time promote business. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you recall your first visit to them, do you recall how that came 
about, what the reason was, did somebody phone you and invite you, was there a 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 130 of 145 
 
formal invitation for some function, how did that come about if you recall? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  The first visit arose I think out of the encounter that we had at 
one of the government functions when … 
CHAIRPERSON:  While you were Deputy Minister? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Whilst I was Deputy Minister yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  When we  - when he introduced himself and told me what he 
does and then he indicated that we must meet for some – for tea sometime. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Yes and then I got a call some time later. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  I think a few months or a few days later inviting me for tea. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Ja.   
CHAIRPERSON:  On the other occasions what was the reason given for the invitation? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  It actually would be I would say it has been some time we 
have not met, do you mind popping in for tea? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Ja it would always be popping in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Something along those lines? 
20 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Now I heard evidence from Mr Masego last year in the  - in 
this commission where if his evidence is true what appeared to have happened is that 
the Gupta family was really fighting hard to get more government business and if his 
evidence is true they even or one of the Gupta brothers threatened him or said made a 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 131 of 145 
 
statement to the effect that either they would sort him out or they would deal with him 
and my recollection of Mr Masego’s evidence is that the circumstances under which 
that statement was made according to Mr Masego were that they must have seen him 
as not co-operating with them to make sure that they got business – more government 
business.  And that was early in 2011, that was early in 2011 and Mr Masego’s 
evidence further suggested or was to the effect that when he was subsequently moved 
I think in October or thereabout 2010 he – a threat was made or statement was made 
that he would be dealt with or he would be sorted out and in late January or early 
February of 2011 he was transferred from the GCIS where he was Director General and 
he was transferred to DPSA Department of Public Service and Administration in a rush 
10 
and his evidence was that he heard from his then minister, Minister Chabane that the 
former President – former President Zuma had called from outside the country because 
he had been outside of the country and had called and had a conversation with Minister 
Chabane and according to Mr Masego Minister Chabane told him that the former 
President had said to him, by the time he came back Mr Masego should no longer be 
there as Director General of GCIS and Mr Masego made it clear that at no stage had 
either the former President or Minister Chabane complained about his job, his 
performance and he said Minister Chabane was very sympathetic him and he acutally 
said something to the effect that he was feeling for him because he knew he had not 
done anything wrong.  And he said he would try and organise something for him and an 
20 
arrangement was made in terms of which Mr Masego was transferred to be DG of 
DPSA and according to Ms Masego the transfer was all done so quickly that the Minster 
of DPSA at that time Minister Baloyi apparently had not even been consulted.  Mr 
Masego might have said he doubted that Minister Baloyi was consulted I am not sure 
but that is what had happened and that was 2011. So if that evidence is true then – and 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 132 of 145 
 
I do not know if it is true I will decide that much later if that evidence is true then already 
in 2011 this family was acting very vigorously in getting government business.  And 
indeed maybe were intimidating and threatening people who seem to stand in their way 
and trying to make sure that they were removed.  And actually it was Mr Masego who 
testified that when he had a meeting with Mr Ajay Gupta at the – at Saxonwold I think 
he said Mr Gupta made a statement to the effect that Minister – they call ministers to 
their residence and actually that the former President would do what they wanted.  I 
hope I am remembering the evidence correctly.  So if that evidence given by 
Mr Mashigo is true would it not be strange that when they had the opportunity of 
meeting with the Minister of Finance they would not want to talk to him about you know 
10 
getting business or facilitating things.  Maybe particularly because we, I also heard 
evidence now I cannot remember from whom which suggested that Treasury was seen 
as a stumbling block in regard to certain issues and you may well have given evidence 
to that effect as well.  So I am just looking at this.  I wonder what comment could be on 
this.  So just, seeing one would expect that people, if this evidence by Mr Mashigo is 
true people who acted like that already in 2011 would really want to talk business with 
the Minister of Finance if they were talking business with other Government officials 
and so on. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  I think, as I said earlier I find, I think it was their style of 
playing differently with different Ministers.  As we explained also what the role of the 
20 
Treasury is.  I think it would be difficult for anybody to think that you can influence the 
Treasury, because the best way of doing that would be to influence a department that 
would be approaching the Treasury rather than trying to influence the Treasury, 
because the Treasury normally does not initiate processes.  Treasury would be 
approached by various departments and I think one of the reasons why I think it would 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 133 of 145 
 
be difficult for them to do that is precisely because of the image they were trying to 
project that they do not do business with Government and that they are this good 
corporate citizen.  So that I mean I think in their minds it was that if anything comes to 
the Treasury if you are a good, you know, if you are in good terms with them then you 
would be, you know, you would have a soft heart if anything comes your way, but they 
never got around to be able to say exactly what they would and I would imagine that 
they would either depend on the Ministers they have spoken to or in some instances 
perhaps that the former President would do their bidding and in our view we actually 
had very clear processes of dealing with things and focussing on the processes would 
actually be our best line of defence.  It is only after Deputy Minister Jonas’, you know, 
10 
story that when he came to me in 2015 when he actually explained what they had said 
because of my refusal to do something which I did not know had anything to do with.  
So my question was but in my view this had nothing to do with them.  It is a matter that 
we were dealing with, with the former President and not them.  So if they now are in a 
position to be able to advocate for my removal only because of that refusal it actually 
sounded very strange, but from their side I think they actually steered away from trying 
to influence directly rather than using either the other Ministries or perhaps even the 
Presidency to get through to the National Treasury to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Subject to the question of roundabout when it was when you started 
declining their invitations one would have expected that their thinking would have been 
20 
we need to approach the Minister of Finance rather than the Deputy Minister if we want 
somebody who is going to do, to help us.  Why go to the Deputy Minister but of course 
if they had tried with the Minister of Finance and failed one could understand them 
going to the Deputy Minister because then by then they would be wanting to have the 
Minister of Finance removed, but somehow one would have thought that at some stage 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 134 of 145 
 
they would have tried with the Minister of Finance before they got to, they went to the 
Deputy Minister, but you say they never tried? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  They did not try and think they probably must have got the 
word from the highest office that there is no way you are going to crack this one.  I 
mean I am not sure I do not want to claim to be that powerful, but. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  I suspect that they actually that was the only reason why. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  They felt if it cannot be cracked from the highest office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Then they must find other ways, but. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the other point I want to raise is this, you said also in your 
evidence that I think part of the reason why you went to see them was that you did not 
want antagonise the boss’ friends.  Now I am a little surprised by that because the 
impression I got from your evidence last time was that you would stand up to even 
those friends boss when you thought that you were not comfortable with doing 
something like the nuclear deal.  You would stand your ground even when it was clear 
to you what he wanted, which direction he wanted the whole thing to go.  You would 
20 
stand your ground.  So I wonder whether that can be reconciled with that kind of 
Mr Nene.  Namely going to the visits because you do not want to antagonise them 
whether that can be reconciled with the Mr Nene who according to the evidence I heard 
last year in Russia stands his ground and comes back in here, stands his ground 
against the nuclear deal. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 135 of 145 
 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Yes.  Again Chair I think it depends on whether they had 
raised anything, because if they had I would have stood up, but having not raised 
anything directly with me you know there was nothing to stand ones ground, to stand 
my ground on, because if there was nothing put on the table that this is perhaps the 
favour we would want you to do for us I would have been able to deal with that but you 
know having these light conversations without knowing what the underlying, you know, 
motive might have been one would not have actually just simply decided no I am not 
having a conversation with you.  Unless if they raise something which I think was in 
conflict with my principles and what the law requires of us to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, I think my point is this when you say as I understand you have 
10 
said I went to, I honoured these visits these invitations in, I am not going to say wholly 
because you did not want to antagonise the boss’ friends, but maybe in part because 
you did not want to. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To antagonise the boss’ friends.  That can only mean because you 
think the boss’ friend will talk to the boss if he is unhappy with you and there may be 
some consequences.  Otherwise I would not understand why that would be a factor to 
you.  In other words I would, the manner that I heard about last year in regard to the 
nuclear deal would only have gone, would only have honoured these invitations if he 
thought there was nothing wrong not because he thought I do not want to antagonise 
20 
the boss’ friends.  I thought that manner would have said well let the boss’ friend be 
antagonised if he is antagonised.  If I am uncomfortable going to his residence I am not 
going. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Ja, but maybe as I am saying Chair I might have put it badly 
just saying that could be the only reason.  That was not necessarily the only reason. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 136 of 145 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no you did not say it is the only reason. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Yes, but. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, you did not say that. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Ja, but it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I nevertheless. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Ja, but it was it was one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [Intervenes]. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Of those things were you think why because there is nothing 
that you think is behind the invitation would you want to do that.  If these people are in 
a good relationship with your boss why would you all of a sudden say I mean I cannot 
10 
accept your invitation, but I do think that perhaps I mean it is the manner in which you 
know it came across, but that is not necessarily the reason the only reason? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No that is fine.  Then the other question before we talk about 
the last topic that you dealt with is, did you understand why this family was so 
interested in having this good image to you that they are good corporate citizens and 
they were not doing business with Government which on the evidence that I have heard 
if it is true could not have been true.  As at the time that you were Minister of Finance 
because already if that evidence was true already in 2011 they had some business, 
Government business and they wanted more. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Well. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you have an understanding why it was so important to them that 
they should have this image with you that they are good corporate citizens and they are 
not doing business with Government? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  I think it was a matter of actually getting a person in my 
position to understand things differently other than what is portrayed in the public 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 137 of 145 
 
domain and portray themselves as these good corporate citizens when indeed it is clear 
that they were not, but at that time as I said earlier other than the media reports most of 
the stuff had not been tested in any given environment like we do have the evidence 
now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So as at 2014 when you became Minister of Finance, maybe 2015 
depending on when you stopped accepting the invitations, you were not aware that they 
were doing business with Government.  You accepted what they told you that 
[intervenes]. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  With Government entities no, I had. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  I did not have any. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Evidence of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine.  Then on the last topic that you dealt with when 
Mr Pretorius was asking you questions, it is indeed quite difficult to attract as many 
people particularly in Government who ought to know quite a lot of things that 
happened to come forward.  As Mr Pretorius indicated there, there have been a number 
of people who have come forward and you are one of them.  You came forward without 
any hesitation last year and you supported the Commission and there are other 
Ministers who have come forward, past and present, but when one has regard to the 
20 
numbers of Ministers who people who have said there are Ministers during some of the 
years that we are talking about and at the moment one thinks that there ought to be you 
know a much greater number of Ministers who have come forward and 
Directors-Generals, past and present, who have come forward and said no, I know 
something.  I want to help the Commission.  I want the Commission to get to the bottom 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 138 of 145 
 
of what was happening.  So it is quite difficult and you have given some of the reasons 
that you think might be behind that.  We will be going to elections and some of the 
people who are Ministers who probably know something and should have come forward 
might well continue to be Ministers and it is difficult to accept that out of so many 
Ministers who have not come forward there are not any who really know things that 
happened that should be brought to the Commission and it is a pity because they 
should be, because of their leadership role and the positions they occupy they should 
be exemplary to the rest of the people of South Africa.  I do not know, you might know.  
I do not know whether there is a possibility that some of the people who know 
something and should be coming forward do not come forward because maybe they, if 
10 
they give evidence they might be seen to be putting their organisation or their 
Government in a bad light.  I know that the ruling party has said many times that people 
must come forward.  The President has said many times that people must come 
forward, but they are not coming forward in the numbers in which one would expect 
them to come forward, but I guess that you have said what you have said and you 
appreciate the difficulty and among other things you think people might be feeling that 
they might lose jobs and so on, ja. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Yes Chair I think that what I have said is about all I can say on 
this matter, because I said we are not wired the same, but also that for some of us our 
positions and our titles are actually much more important than us as human beings and 
20 
you know without these titles perhaps we are nothing.  Forgetting that at the end of the 
day we actually acquire these titles for a reason and that is why we actually take an 
oath which we should live by our Constitution and our oath of office should actually be 
the guiding principle, but at times and as I said earlier we are able to perhaps this is 
one of the reasons why I always say I would not make a very good politician, because I 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 139 of 145 
 
do not believe in the language that say I was quoted out of context.  I believe in having 
not been honest and there is a need to be honest, but always coming forward to assist 
a Commission like this is an opportunity for our country you know to deal with issues of 
the past and be able to move forward and I think it is indeed tragic that we are not 
getting many of our colleagues coming forward, but again as I said earlier South Africa 
is very unforgiving.  So if you are prepared to pay the price that your fellow colleague 
has paid you can join in, but if you are not prepared to pay that price you might as well 
stay far from this Commission unless you are subpoenaed.  Well that is unfortunately 
the position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it is very possible that part of the reason why certain things 
10 
happened and happened the way they did in the proportions in which they did in this 
country and for as long as they happened, it is possible that part of the reason is that 
people who could have made a difference, who could have helped to stop certain things 
happening did not stand up because they may have been concerned about the kinds of 
things that you have just mentioned. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  [Intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And now there is an opportunity, there is a Commission which seeks 
to find out exactly what happened, who could have helped to stop things and they know 
things that happened that were wrong and some of them may have taken the oath.  
Some of them may have maybe going around saying they have the best interest of 
20 
South Africa in their hearts, but here is an opportunity for them to come forward and 
they are not coming forward and people want to help rebuild the country and people are 
not coming forward because maybe they are just concerned about among others the 
things that you are talking about.  It is a great pity. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  I could not agree with you more Deputy Chief Justice. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 140 of 145 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, I do not know if there is anything Mr Pretorius [intervenes]. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair two issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  As a matter of some controversy both within the 
Commission and outside in the public eye, I would just like to summarise with Mr Nene 
at least a view of the questions that we have asked both on the first occasion now and 
the questions that you have covered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And then I would like to put a request before you on 
behalf of Ms Hassim. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And I will deal with that second. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Mr Nene just to summarise the position in regards to the 
visits to the Guptas.  We know of eight visits to residence and business of the Guptas.  
We know that those visits were made alone and at least in relation to some of the visits 
at a time when controversy surrounded the Guptas business dealings.  We know those 
as fact.  You have said that various topics were discussed including the Iqbal Survé 
interaction, but you have said and I think this the crucial point around which some 
controversy arises, you have said that no influence was sought to be exercised over 
20 
you by the Guptas. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Now in relation to that we have no evidence to the 
contrary.  The only evidence that we have of what happened during those visits is your 
evidence and it is perhaps unlikely that we will get any other evidence to the contrary.  
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 141 of 145 
 
We have though evidence from amongst others Messieurs Mashigo, Jonas and 
Ms Mentor which is evidence which would strongly suggest that it is very improbable 
that when you visited the Gupta residences and businesses no attempt would have 
been made to exercise influence over and you have given your explanations in regard 
to that.  Of course the legal team can only put that to you as evidence rather than as 
factual findings of the Commission because those factual findings have not been made, 
but we must conclude that there is at least a question mark albeit a qualified question 
mark concerning the probabilities as to whether influence was sought to be exercised or 
not and that is as far as we can take it and I presume you will accept that that question 
mark must remain? 
10 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Absolutely.  I do not have a problem with that Chair, but I 
would imagine perhaps linked to the point you made earlier with not enough people 
coming forward because I would have thought that the approach that the family used to 
me might have been used on some of my colleagues but who have not come forward 
because you are not getting enough of that, because if there are some of my 
colleagues who are willing to come forward to testify that they were on the, you know, 
invited for casual visits and could not were not asked for any favours or coerced to do 
anything that would have helped, but it is unfortunate that I also cannot you know be 
able to encourage and I actually would want to use this platform to encourage some 
people who actually might have had similar experiences like the one I did, because that 
20 
would help to put this into perspective because I have no doubt that I cannot be the 
exception the only exception to not being coerced but being used, you know, to project 
a completely different [intervenes]. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  That is an avenue that we might well explore then. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Absolutely. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 142 of 145 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Chair I have a request from Ms Hassim to ask three 
questions.  The regulations do allow re-examination.  Technically this would not be 
re-examination, but we would support it. 
MS ADILA HASSIM:  Thank you Chair I will be very brief. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MS ADILA HASSIM:  Mr Nene did you attend the wedding of a Gupta family member? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  No, I did not. 
MS ADILA HASSIM:  Why did you not? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  That was in 2013.  Exactly as I said that was the time when I 
began to be, you know, weary of the relationship with the family. 
10 
MS ADILA HASSIM:  Did you receive an invitation to the wedding? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  I did, yes. 
MS ADILA HASSIM:  Are you aware of any other of your colleagues, Government 
officials who did attend the wedding? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  I think there is a parliamentary record where there was a 
question that was posed in Parliament that would be useful that there were people who 
attended. 
MS ADILA HASSIM:  And what did you understand at the time when you first visited 
the Gupta family what did you understand to be their relationship with former 
President Zuma? 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Well it is public knowledge and they themselves said it 
was public knowledge that they were friends to the former President and the President 
had also gone public to say that they were his friends who had offered his son a job 
when nobody wanted to employ him.  So I did understand them to be very close to the 
President. 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 143 of 145 
 
MS ADILA HASSIM:  Were they advisors to the President in any form? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  He did say that they do play an advisory role in terms of the 
economy. 
MS ADILA HASSIM:  Did you have any personal expectations from these visits? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Not really other than as I said that for me being accessible is 
one of the things that I actually you know do without at times checking even the blind 
spots and on hindsight I would really think that perhaps as I said I could have avoided 
that. 
MS ADILA HASSIM:  Did you receive any payment or gifts from the Gupta family? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  No, I did not. 
10 
MS ADILA HASSIM:  Did the Gupta family or any one of the Guptas offer you the 
position of Minister of Finance? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  No, I was not offered by the Guptas any position. 
MS ADILA HASSIM:  And are you satisfied as we stand and sit here today that your 
conscience is clear?  Is there anything else you would like to saying relation to your 
resignation? 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Crystal clear. 
MS ADILA HASSIM:  Those are my questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.  Nothing further Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  There is three minutes to go Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say you have nothing further to ask? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Nothing further. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Nene thank you very much for coming back to the 
14 MARCH 2019 – DAY 66 
 
Page 144 of 145 
 
Commission.  From what I was told earlier on it appears that nobody has applied for 
leave to cross-examine you as yet although what I was told suggests that maybe 
Ms Joemat-Pettersson did right letters that may suggest that maybe she might want, I 
am not sure, she might want to but she has not submitted any application.  So you are 
excused.  Maybe we will not ask you to come back.  Maybe we will, but you are 
excused and thank you very much for coming. 
MR NHLANHLA NENE:  Thank you Deputy Chief Justice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you, thank you.  We have nothing further for today? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And tomorrow it is Mr Jonas’ evidence? 
10 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And is he the only witness tomorrow? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Thus far Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  I was previously informed that he may well take the 
whole day.  I have received a message. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  From Mr Makwena who says that might not be the case, 
but at the very least there is no need for the Chair to start early. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Well maybe we, ja maybe we can just start at half past 
20 
nine.  That I fix for this week at the request of the legal team and then we will see when 
we finish. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  As you please Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  We will adjourn then the proceedings for today and we will start 
at half past nine tomorrow morning.  We adjourn.
