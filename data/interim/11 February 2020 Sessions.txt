PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 11 FEBRUARY 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Hofmeyr, good morning everybody. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ys are we ready? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We are indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay you… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela we were at the end of yesterday’s 
evidence dealing with your involvement in the various components 
10 
tenders for SAAT and the one point I want to pick up on is Ms Sambo 
provided to the commission a series of WhatsApp communications 
between yourself and her.  You will find them in DD18 and you can pick 
it up at page 532.  Exhibit DD18 page 532.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Memela are you fine this morning? 
MS MEMELA:  I am okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright you – you did not look fine to me. 
MS MEMELA:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MS MEMELA:  Page? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you able to find the bundle?  DD18. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja the bundle is here. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And page 532.  Ms Memela yesterday your 
evidence was that you denied having given Ms Sambo pricing 
information on a flash disk, is that correct? 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 3 of 217 
 
MS MEMELA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela if you will just turn on your 
microphone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your microphone. 
MS MEMELA:  Oh.  Thanks. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So let me just ask the question again for the 
record.  Your evidence yesterday was that you denied giving pricing 
information to Ms Sambo on a flash disc, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you give pricing information to her relevant 
10 
to the tenders at any other point? 
MS MEMELA:  As I said Chair yesterday that it will be relevant pricing 
from the market – on the market that time. For instance like information 
that is – is known to us at procurement not because it is coming from 
the CFST. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Sorry so let me just get clear.  You do admit to 
giving pricing information to Ms Sambo, is that right? 
MS MEMELA:  No I am not admitting.  I am saying it would not be the 
pricing information that is coming from the CFST the bid evaluation 
committee. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But Ms Memela we need to focus on the 
specific question.  We can break it up if we may in due course?  But 
first of all what is your version on whether at any point you gave pricing 
information to Ms Sambo? 
MS MEMELA:  Chair I said I do not remember giving Mr Sambo – Ms 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 4 of 217 
 
Sambo any information on the tender. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
MS MEMELA:  Pricing information.  And Chair just to add there.  These 
WhatsApp messages this is the first time I see them today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
MS MEMELA:  So like – like the memory stick. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  I do not – I am not sure of the authenticity of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine. 
MS MEMELA:  I would like my lawyer to intervene ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine.  Well she will ask you questions and we 
will see if you are able to answer or if there is any problem. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ms Mbanjwa. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Thank you Chair.  I just want to draw the 
attention of the Chair to the fact that these sms’s or WhatsApp 
messages we have the same objection that we had to the alleged 
information from the flash disk.  Because we do not know whether this 
20 
information is the genuine information that was downloaded.  So before 
cross-examination or asking question on this information we would be 
happy if we can be given an opportunity to make an application so that 
we can test the authenticity thereof.  And in a way Chair I am not 
making this request on an ugly basis.  I was phoned this morning by 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 5 of 217 
 
someone who said there is information which she knows was at CIPRO 
in a particular format and it seems as if that information has been 
tampered with.  It is not concerning this matter of Ms Memela but I am 
just saying that it seems as if in these matters where there is electronic 
evidence there are problems.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No I do not think it is a matter for an objection.  
Ms Hofmeyr may put questions to Ms Memela on the WhatsApp 
messages but you do have – you will be given an opportunity to make 
whatever investigations and challenge the validity in due course if you 
want to challenge anything.  But she will be able to say, I am able to 
10 
answer this because I know I have never sent such a message or she 
will say, I do not remember whether I sent a message and then we will 
take it from there. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  As it pleases Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela I would just like to pick up on the 
point that you made a moment ago that this is the first time you are 
seeing these WhatsApp messages. 
MS MEMELA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You received Rule 3.3 Notices more than 16 
20 
days before Ms Sambo was going to testify that she was going to 
testify.  Did you not? 
MS MEMELA:  I did Chairperson and these messages were not part of 
that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is correct. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 6 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And in that notice you were notified that one of 
your rights was to be present during her evidence which was going to 
commence on Tuesday last week, do you recall seeing that in the 
notice? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes I recall that Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And when you began your evidence you 
indicated that you had followed some of the evidence last week, is that 
correct? 
MS MEMELA:  I followed some of the evidence – what do you mean? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Some of the evidence presented by Ms Sambo? 
MS MEMELA:  I followed it? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She is saying when you began your evidence. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Last week you said that you had followed some of Ms 
Sambo’s evidence. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes I had gone through some of the attachments that I 
received from the commission. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh I thought you indicated that you had 
20 
watched some of the evidence from home? 
MS MEMELA:  No I did not. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You did not. 
MS MEMELA:  I even said Chair yesterday I heard from people that 
were talking that the – she is talking about a certain memory stick that 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 7 of 217 
 
she has eventually found.  Ja that is what I heard.  And the reason why 
I decided not to watch Ms Sambo’s video before I come to testify it was 
because I did not want to distract myself emotionally.  I wanted to 
prepare and not focus on her assertions.  So I thought I will watch her 
videos only when I come to cross-examine her. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela you see the challenge I have with 
that is that on Wednesday last week you communi – Ms Sambo started 
her evidence on Tuesday and she continued her evidence on 
10 
Wednesday.  And on the afternoon of Wednesday last week you sent an 
email to the commission indicating that you did not intend to appear for 
your evidence on Friday.  So how could it have been that you were 
using that time to prepare for your evidence when your communication 
to the commission on Wednesday was that you did not intend to 
appear? 
MS MEMELA:  Chair I am not sure if Ms Hofmeyr listens to me when I 
speak.  I did not say I used that time to prepare for evidence.  I said 
the reason why I chose not to watch Ms Sambo’s videos was to ensure 
that I do not distract myself why I am preparing – look preparing myself 
20 
to come and appear here.  Yes I have said on Thursday I do not know 
which day did I send my email between Wednesday and Thursday that I 
am waiting for my lawyer who is in Cape Town and I heard from 
somebody saying okay the Chairperson had said I would need to be 
here and then I see if I will apply for postponement and stuff.  Then I 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 8 of 217 
 
decided on that last day that I will be coming tomorrow morning. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm.  Let us go to what is recorded in this 
Whatsapp message at page 535?  And the part that I am interested in is 
a fairly long message from yourself – it is indicated as Nontsasa SAAT 
Memela and it is against the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say 535 Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies I might have I meant 532 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I -532? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And where the relevant communication is, is 
just below halfway down the page.  You will see the last date entered 
on the left hand side is 217.03.20 and the time is at 21:44:19 and then 
it indicates that the communication comes from Nontsasa SAAT 
Memela.  And then what follows is what Ms Sambo said in her evidence 
was a WhatsApp message she received from you.  I would like you to 
move down that to about a third of the way in that discussion because 
it is there that it is recorded in this WhatsApp message under the name 
of Nontsasa SAAT Memela that the following appears.  It is E – it 
begins with the sentence “even before that”, do you see that? 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It says there: 
“Even before that when you wanted price info for 
Cheryle I gave that to you.” 
MS MEMELA:  No, no, no, where are you reading it? 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 9 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So are in the last communication on that page 
that begins with 2017.03.20? 
MS MEMELA:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Can I request since I have not read these I would ask 
Ms Hofmeyr to read the whole thing. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine ja. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja because ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right so we starting in the last one on that 
10 
page. 
MS MEMELA:  I just want to understand the background. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And Ms Memela it begins “so she said” this is 
your communication to Ms Sambo. 
“So she said by the time you got to her you were 
ready to show her the info. Which made her 
uncomfortable because she started asking herself if 
you had shown it to someone else.  You were even 
contemplating to call City Press to give them the 
info.  Now my Sister all I want to know is when…” 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one second Ms Hofmeyr do not forget where you 
are. Are you able – have you been able to identify where she is – where 
she is reading? 
MS MEMELA:  I have identified Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright.  Okay. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 10 of 217 
 
MS MEMELA:  I have. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Let me pick it up from: 
“Now my Sister all I want to know is when did this 
become about me?  When did I become your sudden 
enemy?  Apparently you said to her, I am the one 
who forced you not to work with AAR.  I was on 
speed dial because every decision you took it was 
my advice.  Hibo, I was really shocked.  All I ever did 
for you was to help.  Even the info. That you are 
using now was sent to you in good faith to help you.  
10 
Even before that when you wanted price info for 
Cheryle I gave that to you as I never thought you 
would one day plan to use it against me.” 
Let us stop there.  That appears to be a reference to you confirming 
that you gave price information to Ms Sambo when she wanted it for 
Cheryle.   I assume that is a reference to Cheryle Jackson.  Is that 
correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair it looks like that but at the same time as I said 
it might be price information that as is standard knowledge from Supply 
Chain.  So I – it is not price info from the CFST as I had indicated 
20 
earlier that I do not sit in CFST. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why would she be using it against you then? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay hang on one second.  Ms Mbanjwa. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 11 of 217 
 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  I must once more raise my serious 
reservations about the prejudicial nature of this information.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Apart from the fact that we have placed 
on record the fact that we are not happy with the authenticity whether it 
really came from Ms Memela.  But there is a second problem here.  The 
identification of the information.  It is said that you wanted price info 
for Cheryle.  I believe that it would be in our best interest and remove 
the element of prejudice to Ms Memela.  If Ms Hofmeyr can say, this 
price info it was price info that related to what?  Because if we are to 
10 
re-examine… 
CHAIRPERSON:  No but she is just reading an email that the 
investigators believe came from her and an email that Ms Sambo says 
came from her.  She is not talking about somebody else she is just 
reading what is here and asking Ms Memela to comment on that. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Yes – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Assuming… 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That the – the – this came from her phone. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Chair with all respects I do not want to be 
20 
argumentative. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  But I would like to remind Chair of the 
prefacing statement which started yesterday and was repeated today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 12 of 217 
 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  It was said that you shared pricing 
information of the tenders with the bidders.  And now today Ms Hofmeyr 
has again said, are you denying that you shared this pricing 
information?  So the understanding given the context that has been 
said by Ms Hofmeyr is that, this is pricing information for the tenders or 
for the bids which were currently in operation.  It is for that reason why 
we are of the humble view that we need to have Ms Hofmeyr she can 
identify it and say, this was the pricing information that pertained to a 
specific bid.  So that when we deal with the question in re-examination 
then we can be able to dispute that actually and when we have this 
10 
information which is allegedly in this flash disk then we can compare if 
really this information that is in the flash disk is the information that 
was in the said tender.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Ms Hofmeyr has heard what you say.  She will 
indicate how she intends proceeding.  It seems to be that you – you 
think there is some uncertainty about whether the information – price 
information relates to a specific tender or not. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Yes Chair.  Actually that is where the 
element of prejudice comes in.  It is because a statement has been 
made that information that pertains to tenders and it is pricing 
20 
information which is obviously very sensitive information has been 
shared by Ms Memela. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  In all fairness that information needs to 
be identified because I am not going to be in a position to re-examine if 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 13 of 217 
 
I cannot even say what pricing information is?  But I think Chair 
understands my difficulty. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What – I understand.  What – what is clear is that Ms 
Memela is able to say – because I think she has said so.  She would 
have shared with Ms Sambo and I think she may have said with other 
people as well particularly black owned BBBEE enterprises pricing 
information that was available in the public domain and not specific 
pricing information – not info – pricing information specific to a 
particular tender.  And it may be because if she is able to say that 
maybe she takes care of that concern. 
10 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Regrettable Chair again without being 
argumentative. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  I see things from a different perspective. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  And that perspective with all humility is 
this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  In order to defend Ms Memela’s position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  We need to have all the guns firing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  We are limited if a broad statement is 
going to be thrown out there because in the same way that Ms Hofmeyr 
is actually not only eliciting information but is cross-examining – is 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 14 of 217 
 
cross-examining as to credibility.  We also need to be given an 
opportunity to state if the information that has been placed before this 
tribunal is actually incorrect information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Or if the information that has been placed 
before this tribunal is information that has not been properly 
researched.  And in order for us to do that we need to be able to attack 
the very information that is the actual information.  If for instance it is 
figures the figure is 100 we need to be able to say, no that figure was 
not 100.  That figure was R50.00. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Okay thank you.   
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  I would just like to respond 
to Ms Mbanjwa in one respect and then proceed with the questions.  
Chair we began a line of questioning yesterday in relation to the flash 
disk.  And it was in response to that that an objection was received 
because Ms Mbanjwa acting for Ms Memela was concerned about their 
inability to test and possibly dispute what our expert within the 
commission had said about that flash disk.  It was at that point that the 
20 
line of questioning in relation to the flash disk seized because you had 
given an indication that there should be a process whereby they could 
interrogate it.  I left any further questioning in relation to the flash disk.  
Had I been able to persist many of the questions that Ms Mbanjwa 
wants answered today would have been answered.  Because we have 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 15 of 217 
 
an affidavit from Mr Robertse who explains on affidavit precisely how 
that spreadsheet was created.  It explains precisely where the pricing 
information came and he explains precisely when it came which was 
when the five month tender was still open and AAR were still bidding on 
it.  But we did not go there because there was an objection.  The 
consequence of that is that I pick up today on the WhatsApp 
communications.  That is a different matter.  All that I am asking Ms 
Memela today is for her account on the WhatsApp communications.  It 
is in black and white on the page before me that Ms Memela said at a 
point in communications that Ms Sambo said she received from Ms 
10 
Memela that “even before that when you wanted price information for 
Cheryle I gave that to you as I never thought it would one – you would 
one day plan to use it against me.”  Ms Memela’s response under oath 
has been clear.  If there was any pricing information she shared with 
Ms Sambo it related to generally available pricing information. And that 
is the point I would like to pick up with her on in relation to the context 
in which this recordal of this message appears. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I see Ms Mbanjwa you want to respond? 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  What I need to put on record Chair is it 
seems as if Ms Hofmeyr does not understand or accept the nature of 
20 
evidence.  Each evidence is an independent specimen before the court.  
The evidence of the flash disk was independent.  We objected to it 
because of what covered it.  This evidence of the Whatsapp is another 
separate specimen of evidence.  She cannot say because our objection 
to the evidence of the flash disk was upheld.  She therefore has a right 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 16 of 217 
 
to submit.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well… 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  To submit now… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let us just make.. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  This evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us make sure we are accurate. We did not get to 
the stage of upholding or rejecting any objection.  But we – I gave 
some indications with a view that we could have progress and some 
understanding.  Even now I have not made any ruling.  I am seeking to 
make sure that we can have progress and if we can do so without 
10 
having to make a ruling that would be fine. But if I have to make a 
ruling I will.  So I am listening to both of you and seeing whether we 
can make progress without having to make a ruling.  But if – if we 
cannot find a way to move forward and have progress without a ruling I 
will have a ruling.  So – so no ruling has been made but I made some 
inclination – some indications and to see if there could be common 
ground and Ms Hofmeyr was able to handle the matter the way she did 
and to accommodate your concerns.  If I have to make a ruling I will 
say make your submissions and I will now make a ruling.  So right now 
I think that we need to find a way of moving forward and if we cannot 
20 
find a way I will just have to make a ruling and we move on.  As I see it 
you know listening to your objection and listening to Ms Hofmeyr I can 
understand why Ms Hofmeyr who knows more about the evidence that 
she is presenting because she has focussed on it in preparation and 
knows why she is bringing a certain witness at a certain time why she 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 17 of 217 
 
might say, not proceeding and finalising the evidence relating to I keep 
on calling it a – 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Flash disk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A flash? 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Flash disk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Flash disk.   
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She knows what is it in there and she knows what 
affidavits relate to that.  I may have my – my attention may have been 
directed to one affidavit or two.  So – so it does not surprise me if she 
10 
says, look had I proceeded and gone ahead with that line of 
questioning these issues would not be arising.  You see.  So – so I – I 
think what I am going to do is this.  I do have need to take a five 
minute break to attend to some – something.  So I am going to take a 
few minutes break and give a chance to you and Ms Hofmeyr to have a 
discussion on how we can achieve a smooth running of the proceedings 
without prejudicing your client’s rights.  If when I come back you have 
found each other and I am happy with what you have reached we will 
proceed.  If you have not found each other I may have to make a ruling.  
Is that alright? 
20 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Ms Hofmeyr is that fine? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So it is twenty-eight minutes past on my watch 
let us say I will return at twenty to eleven.  We adjourn. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211

ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Thank you Chair. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair, Ms Mbanjwa indicated to me over the 
break that they were happy to have Ms Memela answer the questions, 
but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I understand from Ms Mbanjwa that there is 
10 
something she nonetheless wants to raise with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  No.  It is fine Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it fine? 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela, you indicated that the only pricing 
information you would have given to Ms Sambo was general publically 
20 
available information.  Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair.  That is my understanding.  Maybe it will be 
prices coming from previous tenders and - and stuff.  I have not 
checked Leon’s affidavit.  That Ms Hofmeyr kept on - I have not read it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 19 of 217 
 
MS MEMELA:  So we just preparing other that are relevant to the re-
examination.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why would pricing information from previous 
tenders be publically available? 
MS MEMELA:  Remember it has already - the tender has already 
passed … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS MEMELA:  And usually I - I do not know if you remember during our 
meeting - during our meeting Chair with Ms Hofmeyr and Ms - 
Mr Kaplan (?).  I mentioned to them that our purpose from 2013 when I 
10 
joined procurement - the purpose was to ensure that we save as much 
as possible to SAAT, because Air France - the previous supplier - had 
been charging SAAT an arm and the leg since two - 2008. 
So I remember Mr Kaplan even asking me okay, but how was 
testing the market for that short period going to help, because anyway 
the tender before that had given prices and I said if he - he will have 
the full information from SAAT and take the tender from 2013/2014 
when it was awarded to Pegasus and it was cancelled and the five year 
tender and the final tender. 
He will how much SAAT has saved since then.  Right now in 
20 
the current contract my understanding on the submission that was done 
by the same Leon Roberts that Ms Hofmeyr was referring to.  SAAT - 
my understanding - is saving 800 million out of this current contract 
compared to Air France. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela, the pricing information of a bidder 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 20 of 217 
 
is commercially sensitive to it.  Is it not? 
MS MEMELA:  Commercially sensitive how? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is confidential to the bidder.  It is their 
pricing. 
MS MEMELA:  No, no, no.  Oh.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I see that there is another objection Chair.  If I 
may just make a point in advance of Ms Mbanjwa’s … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Objection. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair, we are now at quarter to 11 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I understood from your indications yesterday … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That there was a request that there be an 
ability for the evidence to flow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That matters either come to me by a note. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If there is a matter or it be reserved for 
re-examination … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Provided it is clarificatory. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 21 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I believe it is my duty at this point … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To indicate we will not finish this evidence 
today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If these objections happen after every second 
or third question … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And we will not finish the evidence of 
10 
Mr Ndzeku tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If we do not move more fluidly today … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But let me hand over to my learned friend. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  It is fine Chair.  She can continue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela, I was saying it is confidential to 
the bidder.  What their pricing was for a particular bid.  Do you accept 
20 
that? 
MS MEMELA:  It is confidential like during the tender process.  
Something that … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja.  Something that happened previously. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 22 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS MEMELA:  It is something that I mean has given us an indication at 
supply chain that maybe at the market currently this is how much they 
are charging. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS MEMELA:  So which is the reason why maybe we had tested the 
market previously.  So it does not necessarily mean that if the bidder 
had tendered - tendered the certain amount previous tender.  They will 
- they will be the - the same amount for the next one. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  As much as I am - I am actually trying to explain this 
Chairman.  I am - I am still not saying it was the - whatever price.  I am 
saying like it - it could have been any other normal price that like we 
would have known from SCM.  I am saying it cannot be coming from the 
tender, because even if like Leon would say okay.  I had said he must 
do a spreadsheet.  It would not be a spreadsheet coming from the 
CFST. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Memela, let us go back to crisp answers. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  To the crisp answers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Like yesterday. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  It is just that Chair sometimes … 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 23 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  These kind of questions.  They leave a bitter taste in the 
public’s mouth, but it is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no, no. 
MS MEMELA:  I will try and be as crisp as possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no, no.  I understand.  I understand.  I am 
trying to make sure we make progress.  I - but also I am saying this 
because I know I will grant your lawyer … 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  An opportunity to re-examine. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Re-examine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So she can pick up some of the things where she 
knows you would have liked to put a certain perspective. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you check with the previous bidders 
whether they were happy for their pricing information to go to a 
competitor in the market? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay.  Remember Chair Ms Hofmeyr did read something 
on the bid about the Project Manager - being Leon in this regard.  That 
20 
is the only one that was supposed - what - inquire by information and 
whatever.  So my understanding is that there is - there is no way that I 
would have forced Leon to five me information that is forbidden. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No Ms Memela.  It is not clear whether he knew 
you were going to give it to another bidder.  My question to you was a 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 24 of 217 
 
different one.  Did you yourself before you handed over the pricing 
information to Ms Sambo check whether the previous bid prices of the 
bidders … 
MS MEMELA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  They were happy … 
MS MEMELA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To have handed over to a competitor. 
MS MEMELA:  Remember Ms Hofmeyr - remember Chair, I - I - the 
memory stick that she is referring to - because I can see when she is 
using the hand now.  It is like she say when you gave that information.  
10 
Remember the memory stick part of the information is still questionable 
from us.  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the question is. 
MS MEMELA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whenever you gave pricing information to Ms Sambo 
or anybody else based on previous tenders - I think - as you say. 
MS MEMELA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The question is whether you would have checked with 
20 
the previous bidders to which that information related that they had no 
objection to you giving this information to a potential competitor. 
MS MEMELA:  Chair, since - you remember when Ms Hofmeyr read that 
document - that tender document yesterday.  That all inquiries will be 
done with Leon.  My understanding is that if I ask for information from 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 25 of 217 
 
Leon that is something confidential for the CFST.  She would have 
checked then with the bidders, but like it shows that this one was not 
something that is forbidden if I were to share it at all.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is your answer that you did not? 
MS MEMELA:  I did not Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and then what would be the problem 
Ms Memela and how could that information be used against you - as is 
reflected in the WhatsApp communication - if it was information that 
10 
could freely be shared? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay.  You see she is talking about the information that 
could be used against me.  The other information that she is not 
mentioning other the price that she is focusing on.  It will be the JV 
that we discussed yesterday and the proposal.  So that is exactly what I 
was saying to her, because remember I had sent that to her 
confidentially. 
Helping her as a Black owned supplier and like we will then - 
we will show that with my lawyer during the re-examination what is my 
obligation towards Black owned suppliers and stuff. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So Ms Memela, when you said and I quote: 
“Even before that when you wanted price info …” 
MS MEMELA:  Okay.  Where are you - where are you Ms …? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies. 
MS MEMELA:  Hm. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 26 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I am at 5-3-2 in EXHIBIT DD18.  It is the same 
sentence that I have read previously.  It is about midway down that last 
… 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Communication on the page. 
MS MEMELA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So I just want to be clear on your evidence.  
When you wrote to Ms Sambo and I quote: 
“Even 
before 
that 
when 
you 
wanted 
price 
information for Cheryl …” 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  “…I gave that to you as I never 
thought you would one day plan to use it against 
me.” 
You were actually not referring to the pricing information.  
You were referring to the proposal and the JV Agreement.  Is that your 
evidence? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay.  No.  This is - has something to do with the price 
Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  As I said like I have not read this WhatsApp.  So I am 
saying some of this WhatsApp it is very long.  I have not read it this 
morning, but my understanding is that it was on JV proposal and 
whatever price.  That is from the claims I have given to her and Ms - 
Ms Hofmeyr’s next question was - before we took a break was why 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 27 of 217 
 
would Sibongile or Sambo turn against me.  I do not know if she is still 
going to come to that question. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No. 
MS MEMELA:  Because I would like to clarify. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What I am focusing on is … 
MS MEMELA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  This very sentence. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You have explained in your evidence that you 
did give pricing information, but it was pricing information that you 
10 
could freely share with Ms Sambo, because it related to historic tenders 
and I am asking you if that is the pricing information that you are 
referring to in the sentence.  How could that possibly be used against 
you if it is information that can freely be given? 
MS MEMELA:  Chairperson, I am sitting here today.  I am answering 
the question regarding the same information.  So that is exactly what is 
being used against me - against me.  Well the person … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well at that time you did not know you would sit here 
today. 
MS MEMELA:  No.  Remember Chair … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MEMELA:  She - she - there is somewhere where I have mentioned 
City Press and stuff.  So I am talking about information that a person is 
using, because they talking City Press or maybe whatever.  So going to 
the media about those kind of things and stuff and you know the media 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 28 of 217 
 
with no full background information and when they write about stuff - 
somebody.  So like it was that used against me.  Not because it is 
illegal or anything like that.  As I understand Ms Hofmeyr’s question. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela, to conclude on this point I want to 
give you an opportunity to comment on the following observation. 
MS MEMELA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It will be our likely submission in due course 
that this information was not freely available and it was given and that 
is why you were concerned that it would be used against you in future.  
If it was to be freely given there would be no worry about Ms Sambo 
10 
going to City Press … 
MS MEMELA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And there would be no reason for you to say it 
could be used against you.  Do you have a response to that? 
MS MEMELA:  I have a response to that Chairperson and I will refer to 
the JV information that you asked me about that why would a supplier 
talk to me about JV.  I would refer to the proposal as well.  As I said 
yesterday that when suppliers come to me.  It is all about Supplier 
Development and as much as then Air France BEE would have come to 
me for information. 
20 
JM would have come to me.  Sibongile herself or any other 
supplier.  When I give them information it is not something that I expect 
that in the future like it has done now.  It will be used as evidence 
against me.  So that is - that is the point that I was trying to make there 
and this JV is here, but like at least we will be able to clarify during 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 29 of 217 
 
re-examination in terms of JV what was my obligation in terms of 
helping suppliers and all that. 
So that is where I think my point was being made on that 
WhatsApp.  It is a pity that Chair I mean when you discuss certain 
things with a person.  The last thing that you - you think the person is 
doing is to keep certain information that was discussed a long time ago, 
because now we do not really recollect exactly what was said at that 
time and from what context and - and I did not mention on Friday - 
earlier - that the - the Supplier Development issue was a sensitive 
issue at SAAT. 
10 
Unfortunately I was looking for an email that I wanted to 
read.  For the Chair to see exactly what I had to go through to try and 
prove - to push the Supplier Development.  Some of my team during 
like this whole process were really against it.  They will agree in my 
face and then behind my face they do something else and not empower 
the same people. 
As I said that BEE was called Nontsasa’s BEE and stuff.  So 
that it was my way of trying to say okay.  I will help the people in terms 
of I mean making sure that they understand exactly what is expected of 
them and stuff.  Not - not to say I was taking something so confidential 
20 
that is illegal you know.  So I will explain that during my re-examination 
Chair in - in detail. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you have said quite a few times. 
MS MEMELA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Something that gives me the impression that you are 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 30 of 217 
 
saying that it was part of your job to share information with … 
MS MEMELA:  Suppliers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Black suppliers in order to assist them. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now it may be that we should deal with that now 
rather than in re-examination.  I - is that your evidence that that was 
part of your job? 
MS MEMELA:  That was part of my job Chair.  We will read that from 
the SCM and the enterprise … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Policy.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I - I would like us to go there if there is 
something written down that says that was part of your job.  So that 
before your lawyer re-examines.  We have had a chance to understand 
the source of or the basis of that evidence.  Ms Mbanjwa. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Thank you Chair.  I have actually prepared 
something very specific.  So I do not know if the Chair wants us to 
present it now.  We can present it, because we have documentation and 
we have proof of what we are saying.  So we are actually using 
documents from SAAT.  We just thought that it will be proper that we do 
20 
it as part of our re-examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No, no.  It is better that when Ms - Ms Hofmeyr 
finishes she has been able to canvas everything and all that remains is 
clarificatory questions from your side.  Maybe what we should do is that 
share with Ms Hofmeyr during the tea break what you have and 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 31 of 217 
 
whatever other documents you may have been intending to hand up. 
So 
that 
she 
can 
see 
whether 
they 
could 
assist 
in 
understanding certain things and then putting certain questions to her 
and then - so that when she sits down.  The re-examination is really 
aimed at clarification and not at raising new things, because that is not 
what it is supposed be. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Yes Chairperson, but can we please with 
all due respect reserve our rights.  I am going to be upfront 
Ms Hofmeyr’s attitude is very confrontational.  I am not complaining.  
She has chosen to follow the path.  Can we please reserve our own 
10 
re-examination?  She has decided to do things - to conduct things in 
this way.  When she gave me the file the other time she threw it at me. 
MS MEMELA:  Hm. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  I am fine with this Chairperson.  I - I will 
continue like this.  The hostility is fine.  It is welcome.  Let us proceed 
like this Chairperson.  We are just grateful about the fact that you are 
really considerate in these proceedings.  You noted immediately that 
client is not really well today.  She is indeed not well, but she is able to 
continue. 
We do not want to delay the proceedings, but I prefer to play 
20 
my cards very close to my chest.  I will not prejudice, because the 
documents which we are going to use are the documents which come 
from the files that are with them.  The only thing that we have done is 
to extract them and to put the proper interpretation.  There will be no 
surprises Chairperson. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 32 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay.  Okay.  Well I would just encourage of 
course I have not heard what Ms Hofmeyr has to say and she might 
choose not say anything.  I will just encourage that - I would encourage 
collegiality and I would encourage that we all try and work well together 
and try and may - ensure a smooth running of the proceedings.  I am 
sure that things can be sorted out. 
So if the documents you are talking about are documents that 
come from the bundles that Ms Hofmeyr has.  Then it should not be a 
problem, but it would help if her attention and my attention is drawn to 
specific documents that might deal with this area - area, because as I 
10 
say the - the examination - re-examination is supposed to be - just to 
clarify issues that might not have been clarified. 
So - but we - we will see.  I mention that.  I am not forcing 
you to do anything that you might not want to do now, but as long as 
you bear that in mind. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  I have borne it in mind your worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it?  Yes. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  We will be very, very, very brief. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Thank you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair, I do not think it is fruitful for me to 
engage in the allegation of hostility.  It is my submission that that is 
false. That I have a job to do here in … 
MS MEMELA:  Huh-uh. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 33 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  This Commission and I have been doing it and 
as far as collegiality goes Ms Mbanjwa and Ms Memela know the steps 
that I have gone to - to ensure that they can consult freely and not in a 
situation where there is any chance that we would overhear them.  
There is an issue with the rooms next door to us and there is actually 
an ability to hear between the rooms. 
I took steps to go to them and indicate that they must be 
aware of the fact that there is a - a transmission of sound between 
them, because I wanted to be absolutely sure that they could consult 
freely. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So I would like to move on then if we may. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let us then go Ms Memela to a point that you 
referenced.  I think it was yesterday or Friday. 
MS MEMELA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is a part of your statement where you raise 
Mr Bezuidenhout’s previous involvement in speaking to a - a bidder and 
you said you were hoping that we would get to that and so I would like 
to take you to it.  It is at page 10 of your statement and that is in 
20 
DD25A and you will find it at page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That does not mean we are done with the WhatsApp 
messages or does it? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No.  It does mean that we are done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 34 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
MS MEMELA:  Oh.  Are we done? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  So we move … 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are not done with the WhatsApp messages.  She - 
she will still continue. 
MS MEMELA:  Oh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No, no.  Sorry.  I am indicating we are done 
with the WhatsApp messages. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  You say you … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We have concluded.  I have put to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela what I wanted her response on and 
now we are moving to an aspect in relation to the interactions between 
tenderers and the - SAAT. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  No.  I … 
MS MEMELA:  Which page Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am - I am sorry.  Can I take you back to the … 
MS MEMELA:  Oh. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  WhatsApp messages? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Certainly. 
MS MEMELA:  What was the page? 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was 5-3-2 of EXHIBIT DD18. 
MS MEMELA:  I am there Chair. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 35 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you there? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I have nor refreshed my memory on this 
WhatsApp message, but last week I had looked at it properly.  I 
understood that one of the things you said or the message - the 
WhatsApp message reflects is that you acknowledged having given 
Ms Sambo some information to give to Ms Jackson - Cheryl Jackson. 
Is - is that your recollection of one of the things reflected in 
the - in the SM - in the WhatsApp message? 
MS MEMELA:  Chair, I had said - my response was if I had given her 
10 
any information with regard to pricing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  It will be just the standard pricing that we know from 
supply chain … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  And from - it will be maybe from the previous tenders 
and - and whatever. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  So I said if I had given … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  To her.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If - if you had given.  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 36 of 217 
 
MS MEMELA:  It was more helping her more than anything and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  We will go in detail.  Not - not long in terms of her 
looking for prices … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Versus her coming back to Ernst & Young and saying 
she did not bid with AAR. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja.  So that is my point that I will make later on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  In any event I think she did testify that you gave 
10 
her information that was relevant to the tender that AAR wanted to bid 
for that she was going to give to Ms Cheryl Jackson. 
MS MEMELA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What do you say to her evidence in that regard? 
MS MEMELA:  Chair that could not be accurate, because I do not sit at 
CFST.  As I said that if Leon had done a spreadsheet he had done a 
spreadsheet not out of the CFST.  Remember CFST works together 
whatever the information they do.  They do together.  So I am not sure 
in his affidavit if we - if he had stated that he had taken the information 
from the CFST. 
20 
From what I read like when I was browsing through his 
affidavit.  He had said I had asked her (sic) to compile a spreadsheet 
about certain information and then he went as far as the historical 
prices.  I think e.g. Lufthansa.  He gave an example of Lufthansa.  So I 
- I do not agree that I gave Ms Sambo what was on that tender for - for 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 37 of 217 
 
the five months contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She said you gave her this information when she had 
- she met with you at a Shell Garage in Alberton.  Do you remember 
any meeting that you may have had with her at Shell Garage in 
Alberton? 
MS MEMELA:  Chair, I would not remember.  That is why I said you see 
some of this information is coming from 2017 and, ja.  So I said to my 
statement I do not remember meeting Ms Sambo at the Shell Garage.  
Most of our meetings were at - at SAAT.  She will just pop up and come 
to my office.  Ask for certain things and stuff.  So I do not remember 
10 
the Shell Garage part. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I - I am - I … 
MS MEMELA:  As much as I do not remember me giving her the 
memory stick. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I take - I take your evidence to be that you are not 
necessarily denying that you had a meeting at some stage with her at 
Shell Garage, but you say you - you cannot remember. 
MS MEMELA:  No.  I do not remember Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Hm. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  She also told me about a meeting that 
she said she had with you at a restaurant.  Was it Mimosa? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I do not recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At - when - when you broke … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  (Intervenes). 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 38 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The news to her that the tender had been given to … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  AAR. 
CHAIRPERSON:  AAR … 
MS MEMELA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And she said she - she cried and you were quite 
surprised at her reaction.  Do you remember that meeting with her at - 
at a restaurant in Alberton again? 
MS MEMELA:  I do remember that meeting Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do remember that one? 
MS MEMELA:  I remember that meeting. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  I am not sure about her saying I - I was quite surprised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  I am not sure if maybe she is trying to paint a picture 
that maybe I was not feeling sorry for her or anything like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well … 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the contrary my - my understanding of that part of 
her evidence is that she was conveying that you - you may have felt 
that you - that this was bad and that you know you did not expect her to 
20 
- to be hurt like that by that decision, but I - I did not get the 
impression that she was saying … 
MS MEMELA:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Anything in that meeting at the restaurant to hurt her 
as such. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 39 of 217 
 
MS MEMELA:  Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja.  In her statement what - my understanding of what 
she was saying.  She said I wanted - maybe I wanted her to be the first 
one to tell her the information.  Since like I knew that - how she felt 
about AAR and whatever and I am saying that - that cannot be correct, 
because I remember very well when we made a recommendation. 
It went to the Board and then I do not know how long the 
Board took and then before we knew we were getting calls.  I cannot 
mention name here, because I have not mentioned the names from - but 
10 
we were getting calls from a high - top people asking why did the Board 
give the tender to AAR and we - we explaining that we have from supply 
chain submitted for Air France and we have not even received the 
Board Resolution yet. 
Arson - he is not back yet from the meeting.  In fact every - 
everybody was already going up and down discussing this thing and I 
do not know how it went out of the Board Meeting, but it was already 
discussed and then before we knew it.  It was on the news and then A - 
Air France was taking SA - SAAT to court.  So I am saying it is - it 
cannot be true that I - I went to her there, because I wanted me to be 
20 
the first person to tell her. 
I could have went there to - to tell her, because I could tell 
that she was not okay and the reason why I have - like I mean shared 
some of the JV information and I was preparing her if she could meet 
up with other multinational suppliers and stuff and it does also show in 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 40 of 217 
 
this WhatsApp that I have advised her from the beginning that you 
cannot have any claim from somebody if you do not have a contract and 
I even offered if I could draft it for free, because I mean I - I thought 
maybe she was worried about legal fees and stuff and I said I can draft 
it for free, because I want to make sure that like you have an exclusive 
agreement from these people. 
So me sharing the JV with her was actually trying to highlight 
to her that this is how you enter into a JV agreement with multinational 
suppliers to ensure that your rights are protected and stuff, so going 
there and the yes she cried, I remember that, and there was nothing I 
10 
could do and I had to explain to her that remember as much as maybe I 
cared for you and you have been working so hard on this component 
tender from 2012 and I was hoping that one day maybe you will get a 
supplier that you will work with successfully. 
 
I did say, Chair you promised that you will give me some time 
at the end but I wanted to say that the only other problem I have 
mentioned also in my statement is that Ms Sambo had a severely sense 
of entitlement, I don’t know how many suppliers I have introduced to 
her.  There is one ...[indistinct] and Aerospace where the lady from 
Dubai was supplying parts to SAAT every day and then Ms Sambo sit 
20 
and do nothing but when the invoice is sent to SAAT to pay she will go 
and say okay but you are using my name and stuff also, that is when I 
had – I thought I had an obligation to explain to her that supplier 
development is not about a black face, you don’t just sit and do 
nothing. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 41 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MEMELA:   Okay I will explain that later Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes, you will. 
MS MEMELA:   But I just got carried away. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let’s – so the meeting at the restaurant you 
remember. 
MS MEMELA:   It did take place. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The one at the Shell Garage you don’t remember. 
MS MEMELA:   I don’t remember that one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are not saying it did not happen, you are just 
10 
saying you don’t remember. 
MS MEMELA:   I don’t remember it yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, now please explain to me how giving her 
information about pricing from previous tenders to give to Ms Jackson, 
if you did give, because I think you said if you did give, how that would 
have helped them.  Why would that information be relevant? 
MS MEMELA:   Okay, uhm ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   In your view? 
MS MEMELA:   I think in my view then if I had shared such information 
with Sibundi one thing I’d noticed from her is that she did not have 
20 
much knowledge about MRO and she did not have much knowledge 
about the kind of parts or part numbers or whatever the kind of 
components that SAAT requires, so those are the kind of information 
that I remember, AAR when it was still tendering with her from 2012, 
they kept on getting disqualified because they were short on certain 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 42 of 217 
 
part numbers when they were bidding, so I think it will be maybe 
something in that way I would notice that okay maybe we should do 
something like this next time.  Remember sometimes you as the head of 
supply chain or the CPO you can give a person a feedback, the reason 
why you did not succeed on the previous tender was because of these 
gaps and stuff, so my understanding is that it would have been maybe 
the information around that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you accept that she could have used such 
information to the prejudice of any previous bidder if there was a 
tender, a similar tender in the future? 
10 
MS MEMELA:   No Chair it wouldn’t be to the prejudice to other 
previous bidder, remember the information with the previous bidders 
was working for that previous tender, that other tender would be 
something else because CFS, or CFST when they go out and keep on 
going back to the bidders and saying okay maybe you must sharpen up 
your pencil, do this now, so it has nothing to do with their previous bid. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if there is a similar tender in the future then if I 
have an idea what that competitor’s pricing was a year or two ago I 
could be able to have a good indication what their likely pricing is a 
year later isn’t it? 
20 
MS MEMELA:   Not really Chair that’s not how it works. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why not? 
MS MEMELA:   Remember as I said that this tender started in 2013, 
and if we can get, if we had the time for this Commission so that 
everybody out there understands if we had the file for 2013 versus 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 43 of 217 
 
2014, 2015 and the last one 2016 we will see like how much difference 
like in terms of the prices.  It does not mean that okay because that 
one bidded, for instance I will make an example with A J Walters with 
their BEE supplier Pegasus, in 2014 they bidded extremely low, 
extremely low, and through Pegasus and then we had a problem that 
okay because Pegasus was going to sub-contract to A J Walters and 
then out of the blue then remember the PPFA does not actually even 
allow that 25%, more than 25% sub-contracting, that is the reason that 
they couldn’t get, that was 2014. 
 
If you can check the submission of the A J Walters in 2016, the 
10 
final tender the reason why they were disqualified they kept on going 
up instead so that’s why I am trying to say that it does not mean that 
like when it comes it’s coming from the previous tender then when you 
run another tender the supplier automatically goes lower than the 
previous one, and remember that previous one, the five year period 
tender versus – the five months period tender versus the five year 
period tender, those are two different periods.  You know that’s the 
reason why we even ended up giving to Air France which was the 
current supplier at that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr? 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I am indebted for those follow up questions.  
With your leave I do propose to move to the next topic. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s fine yes. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 44 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.   Ms Memela that was going to be 
in your Bundle 25A, DD25A and to pick it up at page 10. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see we are at quarter past but I am quite happy to 
take the tea break at half past unless the witness or somebody pleads 
that we take the break now? 
MS MEMELA:   Is it DD? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Sorry DD25A but we’re proposing 15 more 
minutes and then we will break? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, we will take the tea break at half past. 
MS MEMELA:   Okay Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair. 
MS MEMELA:   Which page? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Page 10.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Which bundle are we going to? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   DD25A Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The one that has got Ms Memela’s statement? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed, and we are going to be in her 
statement at page 10. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Ms Memela there’s a paragraph just before the 
heading on that page which reads “discussions with AAR”, do you see 
that? 
MS MEMELA:   I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And in that paragraph you talk about the rule 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 45 of 217 
 
of a tender that does not allow bidders to meet with anyone who is a 
decision maker from the company while the tender is still running, do 
you see that? 
MS MEMELA:   Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And I understand you in this paragraph to be 
saying 
that 
there 
had 
been 
previous 
meetings 
between 
Mr 
Bezuidenhout and Mr Parsons that you regarded as in conflict with that 
rule, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:   Okay, can we read until the end. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes certainly, why don’t you do so. 
10 
MS MEMELA:   Okay I said at the end there “but Air France was not 
disqualified because Mr Bezuidenhout and Mr Parsons were not part of 
the evaluation nor adjudication team.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you, no that does clarify. 
MS MEMELA:   I don’t know where you read about the conflict. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No apologies, that is my error, I was confusing 
evidence you gave previously where you said you wanted to go to the 
Mr Bezuidenhout issue and I had understood from your testimony that 
you were concerned that he had breached the rule of the tender, but 
you have clarified for me now, you weren’t saying he breached it, but 
20 
can I just clarify, do you regard it as a rule of tender procurement that 
you can’t meet with a bidder, if you are part of a decision making body 
in relation to that tender while it is still open. 
MS MEMELA:   Chair my understanding of that question, and correct e 
if I didn’t understand it well, it says – she says if you are part of the 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 46 of 217 
 
decision making body. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, let me put the question this way, is it your 
understanding that if somebody is part of the decision-making process 
in regard to a tender that person may not meet with somebody who is 
bidding for the tender before decisions have been made? 
MS MEMELA:   Chair we do not have a specific provision from the 
supply chain that talks to that.  Ms Hofmeyr read from the bid, the 
tender documentation when she was talking about who is prohibited to 
meet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but hang on, hang on, hang on, she is not 
10 
asking what the tender document says, she is asking whether it is your 
understanding that it is not allowed for somebody who is involved in 
decision making in regard to a tender to meet with a bidder before the 
tender is finalised, she is asking your understanding. 
MS MEMELA:   Okay my understanding on the tenders is based on the 
delegation of authority.   Remember I said these tenders were within 
the delegation authority of the Board and the Board is the decision 
maker, the final decision maker when it comes to the tenders, so for me 
to say I think it is wrong for decision makers to meet suppliers, or 
maybe potential suppliers I would be wrong because we all know, all 
20 
over South Africa, not just SAA or SAAT in corporate State Owned 
Companies, board members meet with their suppliers and discuss with 
them, so I would be wrong to say okay they are not allowed because 
that would be coming from me, I am not sure which provision of the 
legislation that would be prohibiting them from doing that.  Maybe I 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 47 of 217 
 
don’t understand the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no I think you do understand that question.   
Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair, it is just your own statement 
Ms Memela, that is what I am working from, so your statement at page 
10 says the last paragraph before the heading: 
“This is also the time when Air France went and met with the 
then acting CEO, Mr Nico Bezuidenhout and Mr Barry 
Parsons.” 
And this is the part I would like to emphasize: 
10 
“...against the rule of the tender that does not allow bidders 
to meet with anyone who is a decision maker from the 
company whilst the tender is still running.” 
I am taking it from your own statement, is that consistent with your 
understanding that it is a rule of tender procurement that the members 
of the decision maker cannot meet with a bidder while the tender is still 
open. 
MS MEMELA:   No, no, Chair I would say then she is using a wrong 
reference there in trying to raise her point.   Mr Bezuidenhout and Mr 
Parsons did not sit in the Board of SAAT that took the final decision of 
20 
the tenders, so they were not the decision makers of SAAT. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well let’s start by what your statement that she 
refers to means, because she is basing her questions on what the 
statement says.   You say in that paragraph this is also the time when 
Air France went and met the then Acting CEO Mr Nico Bezuidenhout.  
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 48 of 217 
 
So now we know Air France and Mr Bezuidenhout met and Mr Barry 
Parsons also, it was the two of them, and you say against the rule of 
the tender that does not allow bidders to meet with anyone whom is a 
decision maker from the company whilst the tender is still running.   I 
understand that sentence to say there is a rule relating to tenders that 
prohibits meetings between bidders and anyone from the company who 
is a decision maker while the tender is running. 
 
Is my understanding of what you are saying here correct? 
MS MEMELA:   Chair the tender rule I may have been referring to the 
provision that Ms Hofmeyr was referring to yesterday and remember I 
10 
did say that we never got that documentation, and so but I 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but hang on, let’s go back to our crisp answers 
like yesterday.  So my question is I told you what my understanding is 
of what you are saying here, my question is whether my understanding 
is not correct?   
MS MEMELA:   Okay, I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I repeat it, I understand you to be saying in this 
statement it is – there is a rule relating to tenders that prohibits the 
meeting between a bidder and a decision maker in relation to that 
20 
tender from the company whilst the tender is running.   Is my 
understanding of what you are saying there correct? 
MS MEMELA:   Okay, ja maybe Chair that is your understanding of 
what I was saying, but now the sentence ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I didn’t hear what you said, just repeat. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 49 of 217 
 
MS MEMELA:   I am saying that is your understanding of what I was 
saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes now but is it a correct understanding of what it is 
as far as you are concerned? 
MS MEMELA:   Not per se Chair because there was a continuation in 
terms of the paragraph. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, just tell me what you say you understand the 
statement yesterday to mean? 
MS MEMELA:   Okay, I said this is also the time when Air France went 
and met the then Acting CEO, Mr Bezuidenhout and Mr Barry Parsons, 
10 
against the rule of the tender that does not allow the bidders to meet 
with anyone and I said in brackets whom is a decision maker from the 
company whilst the tender is still running, yes.   And that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, and what is your understanding of what that 
means, is it different from my understanding that there is a rule? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, it does not necessarily mean when I put decision 
makers within the bracket I was saying they were the decision makers 
of SAAT, but remember they could influence the decision because of 
the role they hold. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no leave out as to whether Mr Bezuidenhout and 
20 
Mr Parsons were decision makers; let’s just take what their role means 
that you are referring to, I am saying I understand you to be saying 
there is a rule relating to tenders that there should be no meeting 
between a bidder and somebody within the company who will be 
involved in decision making in relation to a particular tender to meet.  
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 50 of 217 
 
Do you understand it differently?   Just what that rule is that you are 
referring to. 
MS MEMELA:   Chair I think then maybe how my statement is written 
because when I add that, but Air France was not disqualified because 
these two guys that I have mentioned here do not sit in the evaluation 
committee and the bid evaluation committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no I accept that.  Remember that what I am still 
trying to establish now is, is there a rule and if there is what does it 
say, that is without applying it to Mr Bezuidenhout and Mr Parsons, just 
what the rule is that you are referring to, so that it is at the general 
10 
level that I am talking. 
MS MEMELA:   There is no rule Chair that I know of. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MEMELA:   As I said that most of these decision makers according 
to their delegation of authority they would meet with potential 
suppliers, suppliers and discuss certain information. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mmm, but remember that the fact that they meet 
doesn’t necessarily mean, shouldn’t necessarily mean there was no rule 
because they could be meeting suppliers in breach of the rule, so are 
you saying that in this, this statement should not be taken to say you 
20 
are saying there is a rule. 
MS MEMELA:   Ja, because I am this person Chair who when I refer to 
something or when I agree to say okay that is the rule, I shall be able 
to pick it up and say okay this is the rule, this is the paragraph that 
says that.  So that’s why I am saying I don’t remember of any rule that 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 51 of 217 
 
– other than that rule in the tender document that was read by Ms 
Hofmeyr yesterday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   It was Mr Human’s evidence, he now is in an 
acting position in the position that you previously occupied as the head 
of supply ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Ms Hofmeyr to do this to you, Ms Memela 
I just want to close off our discussion a few minutes ago.  I understood 
your evidence maybe on Friday or maybe yesterday to also be to the 
effect that the reason why there was nothing wrong with you 
10 
communicating with J M Aviation and so on was because you were not 
going to be involved in any decision making? 
MS MEMELA:   I was not going to – I was not involved in the CFST. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but ...[intervenes]  
MS MEMELA:   In the evaluation committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is my recollection of your evidence that you 
thought part of the reason you used to justify the fact that you were 
communicating with them was that you were not going to be involved in 
decision making and therefore if you are not involved in decision 
making there is no problem.  Is my recollection of your evidence 
20 
wrong? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes that is a correct recollection Chair but it was in 
addition to say I don’t yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, now the reason why I am referring to it is 
because it seems to be consistent with this statement that we have just 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 52 of 217 
 
been discussing. 
MS MEMELA:   Okay so remember there was even a part where Ms 
Hofmeyr asked if when I sign or when I signed the recommendation to 
the Board was I signing as the Exco member and I explained that no I 
was signing as HOD SCM, supporting the CFST because she was 
getting to a point where she wanted to find out who makes a decision, 
she even asked me Chair so is it just a recommendation ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I said why was BAC called adjudicating committee if 
it does not adjudicate. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, it does not take a decision exactly, and I said 
10 
because of the delegation of authority the final decision maker falls 
within the tender, sorry the Board of SAAT because it was within the 
delegation of authority. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the point, the reason why I am referring you to 
your evidence, as I do, is that I am saying if that is what you said to 
justify your interactions, engagements with J M it is consistent with 
what I understand you to be saying in this sentence namely I am not 
breaking any rule by getting involved with J M and discussing with them 
because I am not involved in decision making, by implication if I was 
involved in decision making I would be breaking a rule if I engaged with 
20 
J M. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes Chair, that is what I just said that it was in addition 
also, like I added that but also I did not take a decision to this tender 
to award to them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 53 of 217 
 
MS MEMELA:   In addition to the cross functional evolution. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but what it leads to and I just want you to 
comment on that, what it leads to is that if that was your evidence then 
it is contradictory for you if you now say there is no such rule, because 
you have now said, and you must tell me if I have misunderstood, you 
have now said no, no, no there is no such rule.  
MS MEMELA:   No, okay Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Have I misunderstood you? 
MS MEMELA:   Ja, I am really confused Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay maybe – yes? 
10 
MS MEMELA:   I am really confused because I think the way it is 
interpreted how I had responded to say I did not see any conflict of 
interest because I don’t sit in the bid evaluation committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MS MEMELA:   And I even said – and also in addition to that I did not 
take a decision or make a decision or even recommend for them to be 
awarded a tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MS MEMELA:   So ja now it is – what confuses me is the rule versus 
what I had said. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you see at a certain level it looks strange to me 
that you would be engaged with J M the way you were engaged.  At a 
certain level when you say as long as I was involved in decision making 
I was not breaking any rule, there is something to be looked at there 
because it may be that it makes sense that as long as you are not 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 54 of 217 
 
going to be involved in any decision making what is the problem, but 
there is still something about that engagement that I think needs 
clarification. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But now with special reference to this I am simply 
saying I would have expected you in relation to this statement in that 
paragraph at page 10 of your statement I would have expected you to 
say yes there was a rule or I believed that there was a rule, whether it 
was a rule that is written down or just a rule that is understood by 
everybody, even though not written down, that if you are involved in 
10 
decision making you can’t be having meetings with one or more of the 
bidders and that for me would be consistent with what you said when 
you said there is nothing wrong with me engaging with J M because I 
am not involved in decision making.   
 
So I am making this so that you get a chance to comment and 
if there is something missing you get a chance to say here is something 
that may be confusing you Chair. 
MS MEMELA:   Okay Chair, now let me try and go because I am trying 
to remember back at the time.  Ms Michelle Lalloo who was reporting to 
me at that time, I was driving to Eastern Cape and she wrote me a long 
20 
email saying she is coming from a meeting between Mr Bezuidenhout 
and Mr Parsons, it was Air France that was actually presenting what 
was – they had bidded in that bid that year.  So her understanding at 
that time when she came to me was that there is this role and 
remember she actually printed just part of that legislation, which if I 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 55 of 217 
 
remember it was regulation 16A of the National Treasury Regulations 
and after I said remember yesterday I said I engaged legal from SAA, I 
engaged Dr Dhawas who was the CPO of SAA, and upon talking and 
sitting down and then also when I had already returned to Air France 
asking them why should I not disqualify them we realised I think upon 
reading the proper applicability of Regulation 16A that we found out 
that it did not apply to a Schedule 2 company so that would have been 
the rule that I thought they acted against at that time, so that’s why I 
am thinking there is no rule at SAAT but at that time when she came to 
complain to me and then we took steps and sat on the meeting and 
10 
discussed how we are going to handle this, it was 16A and we realised 
that 16A does not apply to Schedule 2 companies. 
 
So the reason why I did not put that here is because like we 
had since realised that we had applied the wrong rule. 
 
So that’s why you see there ...[indistinct] would collude 
disqualifying them because the reason with the bidder would be 
disqualified would be then if Mr Parsons and Mr Bezuidenhout would sit 
in the bid evaluation committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I think we should take the tea adjournment. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   We are at twenty seven minutes to, shall we resume 
at five to twelve? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Certainly, thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, we will adjourn and we will resume at five to 
twelve.  We adjourn.

CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Alright.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   And then put on your mic. 
MS MEMELA:   It is on, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Oh, I think the bottle was… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Obscuring it? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair.  Miss Memela, I would like to 
pick it up at the second of the five-year component’s tenders.  Do you 
recall that that tender was issued in October 2014.  Does that accord with 
your memory?   
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 57 of 217 
 
MS MEMELA:   Can I ask Miss Hofmeyr to repeat the question, please? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Sure.  So, there was a series of these tenders 
over time, right?  The second one, just for the record that was SP437 of 
14 that is one that came second, and it was a five-year tender and it was 
issued on the 29t h of October 2014.  Do you agree with that? 
MS MEMELA:   Where are you reading Miss Hofmeyr? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No, it is my note. 
MS MEMELA:   Okay Chair, I cannot agree on something I do not have.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, she was asking whether what she is saying 
accords to your recollection and if you do not recall you can say you do 
10 
not recall. 
MS MEMELA:   Okay Chair, because like there were lots of -of - of 
tenders.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Or if there is something you want to look at that would 
help you remember that is fine.   
MS MEMELA:   And I would request Miss Hofmeyr to go back to my 
statement because there was somewhere, ...[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where you had written that. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes.  Where I had given them the history of the 
component tenders from 2013 up to so maybe so like that when she 
20 
quotes a certain tender I am able to - we are in the same page. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, indeed.  Let me take you there.  I have not 
anticipated that it would be contentious.  So, let me just take you there it 
is in DD25(a) and you will find it at page 8 at the bottom.   
MS MEMELA:   Alright.  I have got it Chair. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 58 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   In your own statement you said, 
“The second tender which was SP437/14 was issued 
on the 29 t h of October 2014.” 
 
Do you see that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Right at the bottom.  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So, we are on the same page it was issued on 
the 29 t h?   
MS MEMELA:   We are on the same page.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Correct, and then by the middle of 2015 that 
10 
tender was still open, correct?   
MS MEMELA:   Hmm? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   In the sense it had not been decided yet? 
MS MEMELA:   In the middle of 2015 it looks like, Chair we are on the 
same page where it says date retracted.  Looks like it was retracted 22 of 
June 2015. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, so, sorry.  So, let me be much more specific 
so in May of 2015 the tender was still open?   
CHAIRPERSON:   Miss Hofmeyr when you say it was still open are you 
disregarding the retractions or are you saying there had been no 
20 
retraction in the meantime. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No, not at that point yet because as 
Miss Memela has correctly pointed out at page 9.  Her records record that 
it was retracted on 22 June 2015.  So just to get the chronology right, it 
is issued on the 29 t h of October 2014 as Miss Memela correctly states at 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 59 of 217 
 
page 9 it was retracted on 22 June 2015.  So, my follow-up question was 
as a consequence of that in May 2015 it was still open.  Correct 
Miss Memela?   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MEMELA:   Oh, 2015?  Yes, it was still open according to the… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   According to your statement?   
MS MEMELA:   Ja, according to the history, ja.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, and it was during May 2015 that you and 
three members of the SAAT Board travelled to AAR in the United States.  
Is that correct? 
10 
MS MEMELA:   That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So that was at a time when the tender was still 
open and AAR had bid in that tender, correct? 
MS MEMELA:   AAR had bided in this tender.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And amongst the people accompanying you were 
members of the SAAT Board, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, they were members of the SAAT Board. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   They were I think we had from evidence 
previously they were Miss Kwenana, Mr Zwane and Dr Tambi, is that 
correct?   
20 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, Mr Zwane is the - was the CEO of SAAT. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Right so an executive member of the Board and 
Miss Kwenana and Dr Tambi were non-executive members of the Board, is 
that correct? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, yes, Chair. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 60 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Now that was at a time when the tender was still 
open and what I am interested in is whether you conveyed to them prior 
to that trip that they should not be meeting with AAR because of the 
previous point that we debated before the break, which is that people in a 
decision making role in relation to tenders should not be having meetings 
with bidders while the tender is still open. 
MS MEMELA:   Chairperson, I am not the advisor of the Board right, and I 
will give you an example as why I say this it is because the decision to go 
to AAR was actually taken from I think SAA Board and then because it 
was a matter of technical it was moved to SAAT Board and they had 
10 
decided from there that the reason why they were going to AAR is to view 
their facilities and before they can actually try and discuss anything with 
regard to the partnership framework that was in place at SAAT at that 
time. 
There was a partnership framework Chair that had been talked 
about at SAAT as far back as 2012 during the Board changes and stuff 
like that because, in 2012 there was a different Board from the 2015 one. 
 
Ja.  So they were going to discuss that and I did say during in 
my statement also during the our meeting with Miss Hofmeyr and 
investigative team that I was only informed on the day we were going to 
20 
Chicago that we will be going on a trip and the reason why they actually 
came with me was to ensure that I do not allow maybe AAR or any other 
party to talk to them about anything that have to do with the tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat that last statement. 
MS MEMELA:    Okay so they, their reasoning for [intervenes]. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 61 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   For including you. 
MS MEMELA:   For including me in the trade because I was not included 
in the trade all this time and was that because from a procurement point 
of view I would advise them during meetings when they go through the 
facilities or should AAR maybe try and talk about something that is 
related to components instead of talking about the MOU or maybe 
partnership framework that they were going there for. 
 
So, like the trip was more like on the partnership framework that 
has been long going at SAA and it even had a document that was put 
down.  I even mentioned and actually forwarded the Commissions team 
10 
the MOU between Air-France and SAAT and an MOU between IAI Israel 
Aero Space and SAAT to prove that the MOU between AAR and SAAT was 
not the first MOU that was put in place and I know if maybe the former 
CEO or maybe the former Board members are called in they going to 
confirm this that there were other MOU’s with Rolls’ Royce as well as, 
although I was not part of that.  Ja, so Chair, yes.  We, ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So I understand your evidence to be that you did 
not at any point advise them that that trip would be against the rule of the 
tender that does not allow bidders to meet anyone who is a decision 
20 
maker from the company while the tender is still running.  You did not 
give that advice to the Board members? 
MS MEMELA:   I did not give that advice to the Board members. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you.  Do you now regard it as wrong for 
them to have attended? 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 62 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, Miss Mbanjwa has something, Miss Mbanjwa 
MS MBANJWA:   Chair the reason why I am objecting to this question is 
because [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do not start speaking while you are far from the mic, 
otherwise. 
MS MBANJWA:   In this pressure of time, Chair, thank you.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MBANJWA:   Chair the reason why I am objecting to this question is 
because one of those questions were Chair, was at pace was to explain, 
to get clarification from Miss Memela, and if we can turn to that page 010.  
10 
I am not saying that matter has been resolved Chair, but in the same 
bundle I just want to [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well tell me first what the basis, whether it is an 
objection and what the basis is before we go and look in the document. 
MS MBANJWA:   I am objecting [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, what is the basis for objection? 
MS MBANJWA:   The basis for objection is because what is now put to 
Miss Memela is what Miss Memela has already explained that there was 
nothing wrong, because they were not part of the evaluation nor 
adjudication team.  Because this is a similar scenario to the Bezuidenhout 
20 
scenario  [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think leave it to her to deal with the question. 
MS MBANJWA:   As it pleases Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you Miss Mbanjwa. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you Miss Memela.  It was after that group 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 63 of 217 
 
returned from the U.S. that that five-year component tender was 
cancelled or retracted, correct? 
MS MEMELA:   It was after that Chair, and the reasons were stated.  I 
remember the first one, if I remember correctly was because Pegasus, is 
it the correct one? Ja.  Pegasus had bided okay extremely low which was 
good for us because we wanted to save but they were going to sub-
contract to AJ Walters and that was not allowed in terms of the PPFA.   
You cannot sub-contract as a local company if you have bided 
you must at least take full responsibility of 75 percent of what should be 
done.  Otherwise that would be fronting.   
10 
 
And then the second one was, it was stated that it was 
to give the Board enough time to actually continue with the discussions 
regarding the MOU or partnership framework with AAR. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   The challenge that that presents for me 
Miss Memela and I would like to have your comment on it is, the facts 
seem to indicate that the Board of SAAT while a tender is still open goes 
to visit the facilities of one of the tenderers, and thereafter that very 
Board takes a decision to retract the tender in which there would have 
been other competitors and the reason for doing so is that they want to 
embark on a partnership with one of those bidders.   
20 
And the subject matter of that partnership was going to be to 
provide that exact same services that the tender which was retracted 
would have provided to SAAT.  Do you not see that as a concern? 
MS MEMELA:   You see that as a concern?  Chairperson, I do not.  And I 
will give you an example why, to get into a partnership requires an 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 64 of 217 
 
approval of the shareholder in terms of section 54 of the PFMA.  And 
before it even gets to that there is no way that the Board will be talking 
about what is with regard to the component services without the approval 
of the shareholder.   
But like my understanding is that like the discussions between 
the Board in terms of the Board resolution that are in the file, they were 
not discussing anything hat had to do with the tender but their reasoning 
like I mean to allow to cancel the tender at that time was to ensure that 
nobody feels maybe infringed or feels prejudiced while they are 
discussing, as much as they are not discussing what is in the bid.  Yes 
10 
Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   The partnership was to provide the exact same 
services that the tender would have provided to SAAT.  Is that not 
correct? 
MS MEMELA:   Chair, there were lots of list, there were a list of what 
could have been part of the partnership, as much as it was part of the list 
with Air France and II, Etihad and any other supplier or maybe airline.   
But what I am trying to put on record for Miss Hofmeyr is that 
before that partnership could even go on it will be approved by the 
shareholder.  There is a long process that is followed there.  So, in terms 
20 
of the non-binding MOU, that is when they realised, they had to enter into 
a non-binding MOU that will guide their discussions, you know?  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   But the decision to retract the tender and go on 
the partnership, happened before any section 54 approval, correct? 
MS MEMELA:   Remember you cannot go and apply for section 54 before 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 65 of 217 
 
you have everything in place.  That is why I said to the Chair there are 
processes that you have to follow first before you even get to the 
partnership approval.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, Miss Memela my question was not what 
processes you have to follow, it was just a question of fact.  At the time 
that the decision was taken to retract the tender and go on the 
partnership model, there was no section 54 approval from the shareholder 
was there? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, there was not, because remember the partnership 
model is something that was approved Chair by the Board of SAAT as far 
10 
back as 2012.  So, the partnership model is something that is actually 
just guiding them on how they move forward with the partnership 
framework.  It does not require the approval at that time. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   But from the time that the partnership model was 
being pursued by the SAAT Board there was no competitive process being 
followed was there? 
MS MEMELA:   There was no competitive process.  That is why I am 
saying Chair it was something that was done by the Board of Bagus, 
Mr Mpondo with Mr Mabizela and stuff before the other one that followed, 
and the one that actually was in this trip. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you, and then I would like to go to another 
meeting that took place while that second five-year tender was opened 
[intervenes]. 
MS MEMELA:   Okay before you get there, Miss Hofmeyr I am sorry Chair 
can I add also on the same trip. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 66 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MEMELA:   Just to lay out there to the public so that they understand 
that the trip was not just taken by certain people.  After the Board 
members came back.   
I remember some of them were taking photos of the facility to 
come back so that when they give feedback, they actually even have 
photos.  And then after that there was a trip that was taken by the IT the 
Chief, the former Chief IT officer of SAA.   
Because also if you remember on that frame, partnership 
framework there was also systems, okay they had updated systems, 
10 
compared to SAA that they could help us upgrade on.  And then there was 
technicians I think like two groups of technicians went to their operations 
facilities.   
So I am just trying to put it out there that it was not just the 
Board, like just to prove that it was something to ensure that we know like 
the Board knew what it was getting itself into before they even maybe 
continued to move forward to a partnership framework   
That is my understanding Chair.  I do not sit in the Board and I 
am not talking on behalf of the Board.  I understand that the Commission 
will give the Board their opportunity to state their side.  So, whatever that 
20 
I am putting here is my view.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Before Miss Hofmeyr moves away from the trip, 
you said that you were told that you had been included in the trip on the 
day of departure, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:   That is correct Chair.  
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 67 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say that you were told that the reason why you 
were included in the trip was so that you could advise the delegation with 
regard to not talking to AAR people about the pending tender? 
MS MEMELA:   To ensure that should AAR raise, because remember AAR 
does not know the rules of this Country at that time.  So it was to ensure 
that should they during the discussion of what they were there for, should 
they raise anything that I have to do with the like component tender or 
anything like that, that I would be able to say you cannot discuss this.   
Ja, because this is part of the component tender and we will have the 
tender running.  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Am I right to think that the reason why it would have 
been thought that you were the right person to play that role was because 
of your position as H.O.D. of procurement. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, Chair that was the reason.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes – yes. 
MS MEMELA:   Because I remember the Board does not understand, they 
do not really know what is being, what is part of the tender or maybe what 
is put to them  Remember when they take a submission to the Board it is 
just a brief summary of what they have written and ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now, was there a rule that was to the effect that the 
20 
members of the delegation could not discuss the tender with AAR people 
on that trip? 
MS MEMELA:   Not that there was a rule that I know of Chair.  As I said 
that the concern was more from the side of AAR.  Being the private 
company from U.S and not knowing how we work in South-Africa that they 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 68 of 217 
 
do not raise some things or certain information that they are not 
supposed to talk to the Board with.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but that is exactly what I am talking about.  
MS MEMELA:   Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Your, what you - the reason you say that was given to 
you for including you in the trip suggests to me that there was a rule that 
prohibited people who might have been in the delegation or all of them, or 
some of them, from discussing the pending tender with anybody from 
AAR.   
MS MEMELA:   There was no rule Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you saying there was no rule? 
MS MEMELA:   There was no rule Chair.  I will give you an example as to 
why I say so.  For instance, on the five-months tender that was ran 
afterwards to test the market.   
The Board had already or maybe through the SAA legal had 
appointed the transactional advisor from CDH to help them with regard to 
this non-binding MOU and also the discussions going forward.  So at 
procurement we were off the view that, okay because they are discussing, 
remember the reason for retracting the previous tender was to give the 
Board chance to discuss with them, and – and – discuss with them like 
20 
issues of non-binding MOU.   
And then now we decided okay since that was the reason, we 
were going to exclude them when we run the five year tender and then the 
transactional advisor from CDH advised against that because we had 
already excluded them and the tender was already issued to those that 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 69 of 217 
 
were not discussing with the Board, and they said no because the Board 
is not discussing anything that has to do with the component tender so it 
will be prejudicial to AAR to exclude them from the tender.   
I am sure Miss Hofmeyr will see that there was a separate 
tender issued for AAR to include them.  But it was easy because it was a 
closed bid because we were just testing the market.  It was not an open 
bid.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So you understand that when I talk about a rule I am 
not necessarily talking about a rule that is written down, I am also talking 
about ...[intervenes].  
10 
MS MEMELA:   The understanding. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Any rule that everybody may have understood exists 
even if it was an unwritten rule.   
MS MEMELA:   Okay, I can agree with you there Chair because maybe 
that was an understanding at that time and also what lead us to decide to 
exclude AAR from the five months tender at first.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So, to go back to this trip at the time of the trip to AAR. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, was there a rule written or unwritten that either 
some of the people in the delegation or everybody in the delegation with 
20 
not have been allowed to discuss the pending tender with AAR people? 
MS MEMELA:   I do not remember any written rule, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Unwritten? 
MS MEMELA:   I do not remember any written rule, but the instruction 
that I be part of the tender came from them and of course like I did not 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 70 of 217 
 
know what to do because I did not even have the visa the U.S visa at that 
time and I am sure [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who did this who told you that this was the motivation 
for including you? 
MS MEMELA:   I think I was called by the company’s secretary at that 
time and said the Board had decided that they should include 
[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They should include you? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and gave this reason as the reason. 
10 
MS MEMELA:   And gave this reason but it was not written down. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And now there may have been no written rule.  You as 
head of procurement in the company did you understand it to be, would 
you have understood it to be acceptable for any member or members of 
the delegation and you know who was in the delegation, who were in the 
delegation.  Would you have regarded it as acceptable if they discussed 
with AAR people the pending tender? 
MS MEMELA:   Would I have regarded as acceptable?  No Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You would not have accepted as acceptable? 
MS MEMELA:   I would not have regarded it as acceptable. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And why would you have though it would be 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 71 of 217 
 
unacceptable? 
MS MEMELA:   Because the Board is the one that makes the final 
decision.  Therefore, to discuss that current tender at the time instead of 
discussing what they were going there for which was the non-binding 
MOU, will be something opposite to what they went there for. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now the actual meeting even if they did not discuss the 
pending tender, would you not have considered that the timing of the 
meeting could give rise to perceptions that maybe AAR was being given 
special treatment even if you and the Board did not think so because 
there was still a tender that was still to be finalised in which AAR was 
10 
interested.   
Should the timing not have been after the finalization in terms 
of your understanding of acceptable behaviour during procurement 
processes? 
MS MEMELA:   My understanding from here Chair, AAR had already been 
disqualified, but just to answer your question [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well you must point out if I am missing something 
because I could miss, I could be missing something.  I thought that at 
that time the tender was still pending.  
MS MEMELA:   Ja no it was pending but Air France, AAR was disqualified 
20 
[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   AAR was not bidding at the time? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, they were disqualified at the time.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay, okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Miss Memela I [intervenes]. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 72 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry but if they were disqualified at the time why 
would the Board have been concerned that they should not discuss the 
tender with a bidder who has been disqualified, because the bidder is not 
in the race? 
MS MEMELA:   I think maybe it was for the reason that like for the future 
or for I am not sure but there are no specific dates here, so I am just 
reading here that disqualified bidder it says AAR.   
So, I am not sure if it was by the, during the time of the trip, it 
was disqualified already.  But I know it was disqualified on the, for not 
bidding on the full spare list. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Miss Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   It was not disqualified at the time of the trip.  
MS MEMELA:   Not yet. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No. 
MS MEMELA:   Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And the reason for that is that you can go to DD 
22(c) at page 1066.  
MS MEMELA:   1066. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   This is a letter written by Nisha Laloo.  Who was 
20 
that Miss Memela? 
MS MEMELA:   Oh, you want me to read the [intervenes]. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No, I am just saying who was Nisha Lalloo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The letter that Ms Hofmeyr is addressing is written by 
Nisha Lalloo and it is addressed to ... (intervenes) 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 73 of 217 
 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Okay I will read that- her title.  She was 
Senior Manager Strategy Procurement. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what is the date of the letter? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  The date of the letter was 27 May 2015. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That was after the trip to the US, correct? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  When was the trip to the US? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The 2 n d to the 9 t h of May 2015. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Oh okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So, it was after. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Ja it was after. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And as I read this- feel free to read it if you have 
not done for a while.  It is a request to AAR that they extend the validity 
period of their bid which was still open for a further 6 months. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Mm-hmm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  While the process on that tender was still being 
finalised. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Okay.  I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So, it could not have been a reason for the board 
to be able to have the trip in early May that AAR had already been 
disqualified, correct? 
20 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes Chair, we have just confirmed and to 
answer your question because you said why had they ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I was about to say it resuscitates my question. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 74 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  In terms of your understanding of acceptable 
conduct and behaviour during procurement processes was the time when 
this trip was undertaken the correct time when there was this tender 
pending.  Did this time- did the fact that there was this tender pending 
not make it unacceptable for people particularly those who would be 
involved in decision making to undertake a trip to AAR? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Okay Chair, as I said that I am not a member 
of the board and I will be speaking from the level that I have occupied. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes.  And sitting here I do not really 
10 
understand the duties and responsibilities of the board.  But I do know 
that they are responsible to ensure of the continuous improvement within 
the company and also implement certain proposals that will see the 
company change for the better and act in the best interest of the 
company.  So, I would from where I am sitting, trying to think from their 
shoes that the reason why it was ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, I do not want you to try and think- to put yourself in 
their shoes. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I want ... (intervenes) 
20 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  I must answer from my perspective. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You were the HOD for procurement in the 
company.  Here is the board deciding that it is going to undertake a trip 
to one of the bidders in regard to- I mean one of the bidders and there is 
a tender that is still pending in which they are bidding and you are Head 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 75 of 217 
 
of Procurement.  Was that acceptable in terms of procurement processes? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  You see now Chair, in terms of procurement 
processes- because the board does not sit in the bid evaluation 
committee so we cannot involve the procurement processes.  Of course, I 
can answer you in terms of the decision makers.  We go back to that 
question although we had agreed that there is no return rule. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you emphasised earlier on that the board is the ... 
(intervenes) 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Decision maker. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The final decision maker. 
10 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, I asked the question. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it an acceptable thing for the board being the 
decision maker in the tender that was pending for the board or some of its 
members to undertake a trip to one of the bidders in regard to the tender 
while that tender had not been finalised? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  We cannot help the perception Chair but if the 
board was going there to discuss something that has nothing to do with 
the tender.  I do not think it was unacceptable except they started 
20 
discussing the bid or something to do with the tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So are you saying as Head of Procurement in the 
company at the time you would have found it acceptable for the board 
which was going to make a decision on a pending tender in which AAR 
was involved to go and have meetings with AAR overseas while that 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 76 of 217 
 
tender was pending. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Chair the board had a transactional advisor. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mm? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  The board ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Had a transactional advisor appointed to 
advise them exactly on those kinds of discussions and the board ... 
(intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you were the HOD of Procurement.  I expect that 
you would be the one official in the company who had the responsibility to 
10 
alert even those members of the board who might not be au fait with some 
of the do’s and do not’s in regard to procurement, to say, no, no, I know 
you might not know but this would taint your decision afterwards if you- if 
you do this this would taint the procurement.  I would expect that that 
would have been part of your responsibility.  Is that understanding on part 
of your role not correct? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Chair I do not advise the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  I said in my earlier answer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, you said so but you then said that you were phone 
20 
by the company secretary who told you that the board wanted you to 
come along on the trip because they needed your advise in regard to not 
discussing the tender with AAR.  So, and you agreed to go. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Chair it is as if maybe I was given an 
opportunity to advise the board before they decided to go.  They had 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 77 of 217 
 
already made that decision that they were going to Chicago.  And 
advising maybe the board about how I feel that maybe they should not go, 
I would not have stopped them from going.  I am not sure if I understand 
your question because I just wanted to take you through the roles of the 
board in terms of the SEM. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, I am not looking at the roles of the board.  I am 
looking at the role of HOD. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  No, no, I am saying Chair the role of a board 
in the SEM activities. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no, I am not interested in that one.  I am 
10 
interested in what you as HOD would have regarded as acceptable and 
whether what you would have said to whoever in the company that might 
do something that might taint the tender process.  Whether they would 
listen to your advice or not might be another matter because they might 
say we have other responsibilities because of this and that and that.  But 
as I understand your position you have said that you would not have 
regarded it as unacceptable for the board to go and have this- to go on 
this trip as long as they would not discuss the tender with AAR.  Is that 
right? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes, Chair and also just to add. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  I do not sit in board meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mm? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  I do not sit in board meetings other than 
through an invite.   
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 78 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  So, to be expected to have advised the board 
outside the meeting, that is the part that I do not get. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, I mean it is legitimate for you if you say I did 
not- well maybe legitimate is not the right word.  But you may say I did 
not consider it as part of my duty to advise the board because maybe 
there are other people whose duty it was to advise them even on these 
issues, not me.  Maybe someone more senior than you, I do not know.  
That is why I said I wanted to check with you whether my understanding 
of your role was the same as yours.  But you say that you did not think 
10 
that it would have been your role to advise the board. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  I am saying Chair also I am not even close to 
that level to advise the board.  That is why I was saying the board has got 
a company secretary with that duty to advise the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  And there is GM legal that sits in the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  That is supposed to advise the board around 
those issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  And just to raise Chair, we did not- I think we 
did not only visit AAR also during that time.  I remember myself and 
Ursula Fikelephi also visited Air France and went and negotiated the 
price, their current price to SAAT. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mm. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 79 of 217 
 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes, but the board members was not- the 
board members were not ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were not involved. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Ja, were not involved ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies, that was another trip, correct Ms 
Memela? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  That was another trip. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  I just want to pick up one thing in your 
answers to the Chair.  You said this trip- I am talking about the May 2 n d to 
10 
9 t h of 2015 trip that you took with the board. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I tried to take down your words.  Had nothing to 
do with the tender.  Do you recall saying that? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:   I recall saying that because during that 
meeting I was there, I know that they did not discuss anything that had to 
do with the tender at that time.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But it did have something to do with the tender in 
a different way did it not?  
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  What different? 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because it was a consequence of that trip that 
when the board returned, they later decided to retract that very tender so 
that the partnership could be pursued with AAR. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Chair I am saying at Chicago when the 
meeting took place there was no discussion regarding the tender that was 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 80 of 217 
 
pending. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So, it is not that it had nothing to do with it.  It 
was that there was no discussion about the pending tender, is that 
correct? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I then want to move to an event a 
little bit later in May of 2015 because you will remember this trip is the 
2 n d to the 9 t h of May and then on the 27t h of May you had a meeting with 
AAR at SAAT.  Do you recall that? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  I had a meeting with AAR or with the team at 
10 
AAR- with the team at SAAT with AAR. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes, we had a meeting with the team Chair 
from SAAT and AAR. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  And in your response to Mr Human’s 
evidence in which he made reference to what Mr Kenny had to say about 
that meeting on the 27 t h of May.  You said to- in response to Mr Human 
and I picked this up in your statement in your application to cross-
examine Mr Human at page 6 paragraph 5.7.  It is one sentence.  I will 
read it for you for the benefit of the record. 
20 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is not true that Mike Kenny advised me that 
SAAT should not be engaging with a component support bidder.  As I was 
not the one who was call the shots, what would be discussed and what 
not.  Do you recall saying that in your statement? 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 81 of 217 
 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  I recall saying that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So, do you maintain in your evidence today that 
Mr Kenny did not warn you about going to that meeting with ... 
(intervenes) 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Which meeting? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The 27 May meeting that I was talking about. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  But he was there as well. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No, he was not. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Okay do we ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that not one of those where he says he was and she 
10 
says he was not? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  No, no, no Chair those are different ones. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or you say he was and then she says he was not. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Can you ... (intervenes) 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  This is one where there is at least email 
correspondence that suggest that Ms Memela did know that he was not 
going to go. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Okay can you direct me to the, ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes certainly.  But before we go to the letter, I 
just want to understand whether it remains your evidence today that he 
20 
did not warn you about going to the meeting on the 27 t h of May? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Chair I do not understand why would Mr Kenny 
advise me from not going to the meeting because we were all given 
instruction to engage the representative of AAR as some of our- what you 
call this- technicians have gone to the AAR facilities.  So, and now they 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 82 of 217 
 
were doing the same now coming here.  They are coming to SAAT to 
check the MRO facilities as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mm.   
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes so I do not understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Mbanjwa. 
MS L MBANJWA:  Thank you Chair.  I understand that there is pressure 
for time but I just want Ms Hofmeyr to observe the order.  If the witness is 
saying, can I please be referred to a particular document in order to 
confirm because that document that she wanted to be referred to- I am 
not saying she is correct, is a document which would assist in showing 
10 
whether she is correct this Mr Human was there.  So, the question cannot 
precede the document because by the time she goes to the document 
then already there will be a problem.  So, I know the rush but. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but I think it is the kind of thing that when you re-
examine you can go back and say, do you remember you were asked such 
and such a question and you wanted to have a look at a document and Ms 
Hofmeyr asked a question before you could look at the document.  Let us 
look at that document.  And then you take care of it. 
MS L MBANJWA:  Chairperson I am not being argumentative because it is 
today. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS L MBANJWA:  I just want to explain something. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS L MBANJWA:  The reason why there is an English word 
contemporaneous unfortunately that is the only word, I cannot translate it 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 83 of 217 
 
into your language.  The reason why there is that English word 
contemporaneous is because the trust and the value of the evidence in 
equity comes with contemporaneousness.  I am going to re-examine on 
evidence that was given on Friday.  Already that evidence is dead.   
So, we cannot kill the evidence more that even when a witness is saying, 
please refer me first to a particular document to ascertain this fact that is 
left for cross-examination because Ms Human now is forcing her to admit 
that this gentleman advised her not to go.  She wants to demonstrate 
contemporaneously that actually this gentleman was in that meeting.  
That is my plea Chairperson, I will not press it further. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no, you see it has happened that I ask her a 
question and she want to go to a document but I know that before we go 
there, I would like her to give an answer to a certain question.  It does 
not mean we will not go there.  But her answer might make it unnecessary 
to go there.  So as long as in the end if there is still a need we go there.  
But the need might fall away during the exchange you see. 
MS L MBANJWA:  Ja as long as ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, I might ask a question and she understand in a 
certain way and wants to go to a document but I see that for my purposes 
I do not need the document.  Then I ask her but having answered she still 
20 
feels that for her answer to be meaningful she needs to go to the 
document, then she mentions that again, I will still like us to go to that 
document and then we take it from there. 
MS L MBANJWA:  That will maintain the contemporaneous Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright, thank you.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 84 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  The document is that I was going to 
take you to after the question Ms Memela is in DD22C at page 1263. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:   1263. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mm.  It is DD22C at page 1263.  Now this is an 
email chain that was attached to Mr Human’s affidavit in respect of which 
Ms Sambo- Ms Memela you received a Rule 3.3 notice.  And so just to 
follow the train chronological Chair I suggest we start at the bottom of 
page 1263. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just before we proceed are, we still on matters 
connected with the trip? 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So, this is- we have returned from the trip and 
now there is a meeting later in May on the 27 t h of May. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And this email correspondence relates to that 
meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, before we do that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Memela. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I would have expected that while the delegation was 
visiting AAR and I think it was- was it over 4 days or 5 days or more or 
less ... (intervenes) 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I think it was 7 days, the 2 n d to the 9 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About 7 days, ja. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 85 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Mm 7 days? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I think some people might have been there for a 
bit shorter Ms Memela or were you ... (intervenes) 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  The 2 n d to the 9 t h? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  My record says the 2 n d to the 9 t h of May. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Oh I- ja I do not remember Chair but I think it 
was cut short.  It was not more than 3 days. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  If I remember correctly. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well somebody will check.  I assume that as you host 
AAR would have hosted the delegation in dinners and so on socialising as 
one would expect when one is a host.  Is that right? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am saying I would expect that AAR being your host 
would have had dinners with the delegation and so on.  Is my assumption 
correct? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes, your assumption is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And just in so far as that is concerned, I am 
looking back at the Facebook post that you made at the time which would 
assist us with the dates.  But amongst the things that AAR provided to 
you was a private jet, is that correct 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 86 of 217 
 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes, we flew to- from Chicago to Indiana 
Police and then from Indiana Police to Miami.  Because it was something 
that had to be done within one day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In their private jet. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Ja I am not sure if it is theirs owned by them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  I am not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  I cannot confirm that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And did they pay for the transportation by the 
limousine back to the jet? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Payment? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes, did they cover the cost of the limousine ride 
back to the jet? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Our understanding is that is their limousine.  I 
do not know. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is their limousine. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Mm-hmm. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay, thank you.  Right, so just back to the 27 t h 
of May if we may- sorry, now I have lost my page reference because I was 
going back. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  It is 1 ... (intervenes) 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  1263, was it not? 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 87 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  1263, ja. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Great, thank you.  Okay so we are at 1263 and 
we start at the bottom.  There is an email from Sonia Lopez to yourself 
Ms Memela.  Do you see that? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And Sonia Lopez, where was she from? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  From AAR, it is written here. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if you will just read- sorry, that is the date of 
that email? 
10 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  It is 26May 2015. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what does she say to you in that email? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Can you please arrange transportation to pick 
up Ken Hein, Chris Fiddes and Cheryle Jackson at 10:30 AM on 
Wednesday, May 27 t h from the Intercontinental Hotel. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And then you deal with that in an 
email above it between yourself and Mr Kenny.  Do you see that? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So, what do you say to Mr Kenny in the next 
email? 
20 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Hi guys, please take note. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And if you go a page earlier because 
now, we are following it chronologically.  So, if you go to 1262. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  And then Mr Kenny responds; Will do. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Will do.  And that is on the 27 t h of May 2015, 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 88 of 217 
 
correct? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then will you read us the next email from you 
to him on the 27 t h of May 2015? 
CHAIRPERSON:  At what page? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  1262 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Thanks Mr Kenny.  Will you please let me  
know when your guy goes to fetch them so I can leave Premier Hotel to 
there.  Further take note that we will be using the Operational Purchasing 
10 
boardroom. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Then if you go back a further page 
1261. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What does Mr Kenny respond to you? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Hi Nontsasa, not sure when the guy will 
leave SAAT but will be at the hotel at 10:30. I will not make it to the 
meeting. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what do you respond to Mr Kenny above 
that? 
20 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  I say, why? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why? I think with sad face emoticon, is that 
right? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Is it a sad version of a smiley face?  I do not 
know. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 89 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No, I do not know.  Maybe it is a smiley face. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  You tell me.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I can never make out these faces. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I cannot, indeed. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Ja, I am sure you have noticed Ms Hofmeyr I 
smile a lot so it cannot be ... (intervenes) 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It could- no, it might have been a- if it was a 
smiley face then you were happy that he was not coming. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not think you would ask why ... (intervenes) 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Oh my God. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you were happy. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes indeed. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Even though it’s changing and getting back to 
me that I was happy that Mr Kenny was not going. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, that is fine.   
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  I really do not understand that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No, I had just assumed it was sad because you 
were disappointed that he was not coming.  But that might have been an 
unfairness assumption to have made. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  We are still on the fact finding mission right 
20 
Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes, because it is related to his response at 
1260. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What did Mr Kenny respond to you. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 90 of 217 
 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Understand that- okay where is this? After why 
... (intervenes) 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is at the bottom of 1260. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So, you have asked, Why?  And then Mr Kenny 
responds as to why he will not be attending the meeting. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Okay.  He said, I have a meeting with a 
customer regarding work in Uganda taking place in plan and concerned 
about discussing components support issues with someone who is the 
bidder in the process and the process is still ongoing corporate 
10 
governance issues.  However, I will not be available for this meeting.  
Anyway, you prior arrangement which have been confirmed. 
 
So, Chair here in this email he is raising his concerns.  There is 
nowhere, where he advises me not to go to a meeting.  Maybe Ms 
Hofmeyr is still going to show me that email. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Wait for her to ask you questions. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let us go to your response because as I read 
what Mr Kenny is saying there, he is saying, he is concerned about going 
20 
because you would be discussing components support issues with 
somebody who is a bidder in the process and the process is still ongoing.  
What was your response to Mr Kenny above that? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  He is saying; And are concerned about  
discussing component support issues with someone who is the bidder. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 91 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  He is not saying because you will- ja so I 
would like us Chair to read the email as it is and not put words that are 
not there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No, I was just trying to give the context for your 
response.  What was your response Ms Memela. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  And then I said; The process has been put 
  
on hold.  I am sure it is when then it was retracted. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No, it is not yet. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Okay.  Ja. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because actually on the very same day that was 
when we looked at the letter previously where AAR had been asked to 
extend the validity period of its bid.  So, it was very much still alive. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you said to Mr Kenny the process has been 
put on hold and then what did Mr Kenny respond. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  I understand that it is on hold but that  
means it is still open and ongoing.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Ja. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So, Ms Memela do you stand by your evidence 
that Mr Kenny did not advise you to attend a meeting with a bidder while 
a tender was still open? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  This is not what his email is saying Chair.  
That is not my understanding of his email.  He was concerned for himself 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 92 of 217 
 
because he is saying he was attending a meeting with a customer from 
Uganda and he is raising his concern with me, his colleagues, why he- 
what the discussions that are taking place with the bidder whilst the bid is 
still ongoing.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you did not have any difficulty going to the 
meeting while the bid was still open? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  No, I did not have any difficulty because it 
was the technicians from AAR as much as we had the technicians from 
SAAT going to AAR. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did it not give you pause for concern that 
10 
somebody who was not even in the procurement space was not willing to 
go to a meeting with a bidder while the bidder was- while the bid was still 
open? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Chair, I am not sure how I am supposed to 
answer this question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say, yes, I did have concern or no I did not have 
concern. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  I did not have concerns Chair because they 
were discussing what was in the MRO hangers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
20 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And then I would like to go to one 
other interaction in this period before the bid was retracted.  And that is 
something that Ms Jackson said in an email on the 5 t h of June 2015. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Where is that? 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 93 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I would like to take you to that.  It is at Exhibit 
DD22C the file that we are in at page 1278.  Apologies, I have to do 
something before that in the chronology.   
So, there is this meeting on the 27 t h of May that you attended, is that 
correct?  That is the one that we have looked at previously. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Oh, the one that Mike Kenny had a concern 
of? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Then I just want to establish because there is an 
10 
email that suggest to me you had a discussion after that meeting with Ms 
Jackson.  So, could we go to that?  That is at page 1274. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  1274. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  What is that document? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Oh, this is an email coming from me Chair on 
the 30 t h of May 2015.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And to whom is it sent? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  It sent to Cheryle Jackson, Bongani More and 
R Bagus of Morning Tide. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that a Mr Rafique Bugus? 
20 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Whom we have heard evidence about.   
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Now what makes me thing there was 
a discussion after the 27 May meeting is because in the third line there 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 94 of 217 
 
you will see you say;  
Good afternoon, I hope my email finds you well.  I refer to the discussion 
we had on the 29 t h May 2015 and wish to confirm the following.   
Do you see that? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Mm-hmm.  Yes, I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you recall that discussion, was it telephonic, 
was it in person? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  I recall Chair, it was in person.  A meeting in 
person. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  So, there is the meeting on the 27t h then 
10 
there is a meeting on the 29 t h were you at this stage responsible for most 
of the interactions with AAR? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Chair, can I ask- I know that we are actually 
running out of time.  I would like to read this. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Sure. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  If I ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes ja.  Okay you want to ja. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes.  I do not know if you want me ... 
(intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  You want to read it to yourself or? 
20 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Ja, I just want to read it quickly so that I am 
able ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Able to remember. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  To respond properly.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 95 of 217 
 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  I do not know if you also want me to read for 
everybody no ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, you can read for yourself. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  For myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Okay.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready to answer or do you want the question to 
be repeated? 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I just asked at this stage were you the person 
mainly responsible for the interactions with AAR? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Chair I do not know if you have noticed that 
the email is on about Supplier Development BEE initiatives and stuff.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I have not read ... (intervenes) 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It carefully. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but ... (intervenes) 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  So, this is a question ... (intervenes) 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The question is factual. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, it does not need you to look at the email. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  No, I am just talking about interaction with 
AAR. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 96 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Because she is talking AAR. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay ja. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  And there were apparently BEE companies 
that they had selected on their own there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes.  Ja, so this was in- with regard to that 
meeting that took place and I was advising them on the stand of SAAT.  
Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Sorry. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, she is asking whether at that stage and we are 
talking end of May 2015. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were the person mostly responsible at SAAT for 
interactions with AAR. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  There is a board resolution Chair that gives 
Mr Musa Zwane that authority, not me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no, let us not talk about the authority.  
Factually, is it what was happening?  Were you the person- he may have 
been given authority but he might have decided he will ask you to do most 
20 
of the interactions and report to him?  So, the question is, looking at the 
factual position as to- as opposed to what was the legal position, did you 
have authority or not have authority.  But the question is simply whether 
you were the person that was mostly interacting with AAR at that time? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  No Chair. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 97 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You might not know.  You might know. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were not. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Ja this meeting was not with- about AAR or 
with AAR.  It was regarding Supplier Development and BEE. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But it was a meeting that AAR attended, correct, 
on the 29 t h of May? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  One of the employees of AAR attended 
together with a local black owned representative. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  And that was Ms Jackson who attended, is 
10 
that correct? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes, that was the employee of AAR. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And then I would like to go to the 
email that I went to incorrectly in the chronology.  That is at 1278. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Chair, before we go to that email. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Can I read then what at the end, not the whole 
meeting- not the whole email. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja on page 1274. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  1274 Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes read. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Kindly take note that as discussed 
yesterday SAAT had already identified some of the local black owned 
companies.  Mostly of which is owned by black women to participate on 
the program Enterprise Supplier Development and benefit out of the 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 98 of 217 
 
potential transaction.  As advised yesterday and as initially agreed 
between management of AAR and SAAT it will benefit both the parties if 
SAAT and AAR work together in concluding in any kind of agreement that 
will regulate the empowerment program.   
 
So, it shows what was discussed there and what I had advised 
them from SAAT point of view in terms of Supplier Development. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And then if we can go to 1278.  Now 
this is- if you pick it up at the bottom of the page it appears to be an 
email that Ms Jackson writes to a number of her colleagues including 
John Holmes, Rahul Shah etcetera.  Do you see that? 
10 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And we- I am not going to read the whole email 
into the record but it starts off by saying;  
Hi all, last week Chris Fiddes, Ken Hein and I met with the SAAT team 
and membership.  Below is a scope of work and list of initiatives that 
SAAT would like to work on with AAR- work with AAR on or explore further 
as part of a partnership.   
And then the email goes on over two pages but the part that I am 
interested in is at page 1280. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Mm? 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If you go to page 1280.   
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  1280. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  See- I do apologise, I should have 
indicated.  This was an email written on the 4 t h of June 2015 Chair.  
Apologies for that.  But at the- at 1280 Ms Jackson is setting out a 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 99 of 217 
 
timeline there and the first item on the timeline she indicates as June 5:  
SAAT PBHRFP cancellation becomes official.  Do you see that? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Ja I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  How would Ms Jackson have known on the 4 t h of 
June 2015 that there was going to be a retraction of the tender that was 
still open at that stage? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  I cannot answer for her Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So, you were not party to any meetings at which 
that was communicated to Ms Jackson by SAAT officials? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Ja no, I would not- I do not remember. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mm. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because it was only actually ever retracted on the 
22 n d of June.  Do you recall that? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  And then when was this one? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  This was- she was writing it on the 4 t h of June 
and she is anticipating that it is going to be cancelled the next day or at 
least officially cancelled the next day. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Chair I ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  You ... (intervenes) 
20 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  I would not know how she knew that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How she got the information. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Would it concern you that she had that 
information before the decision had officially been taken? 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 100 of 217 
 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes Chair, that will be a concern.  Thank you 
Chair, I see we have gone just over the lunch break. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So, it may be convenient time to adjourn. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Let us adjourn for lunch and we will resume at 
14:05. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair I see ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh Ms Mbanjwa. 
MS L MBANJWA:  Chair maybe this is an opportune time to just place on 
record that we were told yesterday that Ms Hofmeyr has only 30 minutes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS L MBANJWA:  After which she will finish.  I am not saying she must 
finish. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS L MBANJWA:  But I am just saying this is how difficult our re-
examination is going to be.  Because yesterday I had already asked for 
an estimation of the day and we are now again meeting all this 
information that is in emails and which may be necessary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mm. 
MS L MBANJWA:  So, when we ask for more time, I just want Chairperson 
20 
to make a comparison to see how difficult it is to wrap these things up.  I 
do not want to irritate Chairperson ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well but do remember that part of the delay is the 
interruptions that have happened and I am not saying that the 
interruptions were not legitimate.  I am just saying as reality we have had 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 101 of 217 
 
interruptions.  Certainly, it has been more than we normally see in these 
proceedings.  So, as I say I am not saying illegitimate but certainly that 
has contributed.  Let us see how it goes.   
MS L MBANJWA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that alright?   
MS L MBANJWA:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay we will take the lunch adjournment and resume at 
14:05. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
10 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURN 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us continue. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Chair and Ms Memela before 
lunch we had concluded on the aspects in relation to the second tender 
that I wanted to take you to and so I would like to now move in the 
chronology to the final tender which takes us to 2016.  Ms Memela we 
have already looked at in the evidence the submission that went to the 
BAC from the CFST for the recommendation on the final tender.  And 
20 
you will recall that although Lufthansa was the cheapest bidder for the 
final tender CFST recommended not to go with Lufthansa, do you recall 
that? 
MS MEMELA:  Initially Chair the CFST recommended to go with 
Lufthansa, yes. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 102 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then by the time they make the final 
submission to the BAC as I understand it they were then recommending 
Air France, is that right? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay Chair let me explain how the process works at 
SAAT.  SAAT being the technical part of SAA.  Remember I explained 
that for BAC they go for BAC – to BAC for notification.  Sometimes they 
could go even afterwards because it is just for notification of approval.  
So it went to the Board and the Board – because there was – they 
questioned why did it go to BAC and then apparently there was no-one 
who understood that part where it said to the BAC just goes for 
10 
notification and then the Board said, okay take it back to the CFST.  
Yes and then it must go back to BAC.  But like I think they raised also 
concerns about like why – why would CFST recommend and 
management of SAAT recommend Lufthansa based on the lower price.  
And the fact that they were not committing to supply development.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela I – I am now talking about May 
2016. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  When on the 4 May there is a submission to the 
BAC and then that is followed by the acting CEO’s submission to the 
20 
board for their meeting on the 9 May. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And as you have pointed out previously in your 
evidence although CFST originally identified Lufthansa as the preferred 
bidder and the one who should be awarded the contract there was 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 103 of 217 
 
certain reservations that they expressed about Lufthansa, do you recall 
that? 
MS MEMELA:  I recall that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what I want to know is you attended a 
CFST meeting in the lead-up to that in April, correct? 
MS MEMELA:  I attended the CFST in the? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  A meeting – it was in April? 
MS MEMELA:  April.  Can we… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is the one where it records that your 
joined the meeting and you stress the urgency of the decision that 
10 
needed to be taken and you were there to provide guidance. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you recall that? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay so ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay so all that I am wanting to glean from you 
is the reasons for not going with Lufthansa.  We see those from the 
BAC’s submission and we see them later in the CEO’s submission. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And the one that I just want to pick up on is 
there was a concern raised that Lufthansa still had outstanding NIP 
20 
obligations.  Do you recall that as being a reason for not going with 
Lufthansa? 
MS MEMELA:  From the Board? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No this is from now CFST is doing their 
submission to the BAC and that is taken as the submission by the CEO 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 104 of 217 
 
to the Board.  And in both of those submissions which are virtually 
identical the point is made that amongst the problems with Lufthansa is 
that the bidder still has outstanding unresolved NIP obligations.  Do 
you recall that? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay can you direct me to the document? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes certainly 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is at DD22F. 
MS MEMELA:  DD22F. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  DD22F and it will be at page 2294.   
10 
MS MEMELA:  Page? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  2294.   
MS MEMELA:  2294. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just to orientate you Ms Memela this is a page 
within the submission that was prepared by Leon Robertse for the BAC. 
MS MEMELA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  And the page I am interested in is the 
one at 2294.  Because you will see that page they have dealt with the 
scoring and they have set out in the submission and now we get to 
page 2294. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And it says the following at the top of the page. 
“Based on the above scoring tables Lufthansa has 
quoted the lowest price but due to the risk 
highlighted below the CFST recommend the bid be 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 105 of 217 
 
awarded 
to 
Air 
France 
Industries 
subject 
to 
successful contract negotiations.” 
And then there is another line: 
“Risks identified with the tender would be defined as 
follows:” 
And there is a heading for the risks identified for JM/AAR and then 
there is a heading Lufthansa.  Okay and it is the second bullet that I 
am highlighting there. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   
10 
“The issue raised as a risk with Lufthansa was that 
the bidder still had outstanding unresolved NIP 
obligations from a previous tender.” 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you see that? 
MS MEMELA:  I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  Were you – was this something that was 
discussed at that meeting that you attended in April with the CFST? 
MS MEMELA:  On the NIP obligations? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  The NIP obligation I would believe that Chair it was the 
knowledge of everybody at Supply Chain because he supplier – what 
Lufthansa was the – the previous supplier components supplier of 
SAAT.  And they have never adhered to NIP obligation.  As I had 
explained that it is actually managed by the DTI and then also I think – 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 106 of 217 
 
because the final tender was the one that included the supplier 
development.  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But can you remember whether it was discussed at 
the meeting? 
MS MEMELA:  I would not remember Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would not remember? 
MS MEMELA:  I would not remember yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you saying everybody was aware of it? 
MS MEMELA:  Everybody was aware of – of their… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Their situation on this point? 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Their reluctance into anything that has to do with 
transformational agenda. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  Because even on the final one they did not want to 
commit on a supply development. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But – but supply development as I understand it 
is different to the NIP obligation.  That is why I was concerned to pick 
this up.  Because your evidence yesterday was that the NIP obligation 
20 
had nothing to do with this final tender because there had been a 
decision to replace the NIP obligation with a supplier development 
obligation.  If that was your evidence why would Lufthansa’s previous 
performance under a NIP obligation be relevant to this tender at all? 
MS MEMELA:  Chair I want to explain again my testimony yesterday 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 107 of 217 
 
with regard to NIP. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  I explained to Ms Hofmeyr that there is direct NIP and 
indirect NIP.  They are both NIP but the supplier development falls 
under indirect NIP.  So it is still NIP regardless.  And also both these 
elements are still under transformational agenda of this country.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did anyone actually find out whether Lufthansa 
had complied with its NIP obligations? 
MS MEMELA:  I remember who is this – the CM operation at that time 
Chair we had gone to DTI with them and HOD Workshop because we 
10 
wanted to find out with regard to certain other contracts with Lufthansa 
other than that previous one that they had adhered to the NIP 
obligation.  But at that time there was just like some disagreements 
between them and the DTI.  As I said that it is always a relationship 
between Lufthansa and DTI.  Sometimes these multinational companies 
they understand to have adhered to the NIP obligation only to find that 
like how it is explained by the DTI it is not what it was supposed to be.  
Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You see the DTI has given an affidavit to the 
commission.  It is the one that we looked at yesterday in which they 
20 
have confirmed that Lufthansa was never non-compliant with its NIP 
obligations.  Do you have a response to that? 
MS MEMELA:  Can you go to that affidavit for when? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes certainly since 2013.  I will give it to you.  
It is at Exhibit DD22G. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 108 of 217 
 
MS MEMELA:  Since 2013 Lufthansa in 2013 Chair so that we do not 
waste time.  Lufthansa in 2013 was not the supplier – service provider 
for component tender.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No the point that I am making, you said for 
what period had they not been non-compliant.  In other words for what 
period had they been compliant?  According the DTI’s affidavit I will 
read it to you. It is in 22G at page 2977. 
MS MEMELA:  Page?  29… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  2977.   
MS MEMELA:  I am here Chair. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So what the Director General of the Department 
of Trade and Industry Mr October says at the bottom of that page in 
paragraph 27 is the following: 
“I should also place on record that Ms Kurland…” 
That is a reference to the commission’s investigator. 
“Requested information in relation to Lufthansa’s 
performance of its duties flowing from the obligation 
agreement which was entered into between the DTI 
and Lufthansa.  The agreement was signed on the 17 
February 2013 and is attached hereto marked 
20 
Annexure I.  According to the DTI’s NIP records there 
is no indication that Lufthansa is non-compliant in 
relation to its current NIP obligation.  In this regard I 
have attached hereto a printout of Lufthansa’s 
performance status as at 30 September 2019.” 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 109 of 217 
 
And he attaches that as an annexure.  He goes and says: 
“The DTI has never received correspondence from 
SAAT in relation to Lufthansa’s non-compliance with 
its current NIP obligation.” 
MS MEMELA:  Chair I think maybe there is a misunderstanding with 
regard to the interpretation of Ms Hofmeyr or maybe Mr Kurland or – 
and Mr Human.  In 2013 Lufthansa was not the service provider of 
component for SAAT. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MEMELA:  This tender that you were talking about like their non-
10 
compliance with NIP obligation it was specifically referred to that 
tender.  Remember Lufthansa may have had other contracts at SAAT 
that have nothing to do with tender – component tender or component 
services.  So they might comply. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They might have been compliant. 
MS MEMELA:  On the other. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In regard to other tenders. 
MS MEMELA:  Exactly Chair.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  So… 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No but – then I do not understand.  Because I 
understood you to say that a reason for not recommending Lufthansa 
was that it had outstanding NIP obligations from a previous tender.  
That is what was recorded… 
MS MEMELA:  Previous component tender. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 110 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No. 
MS MEMELA:  Not the other – not the other services.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No but there – what previous components 
tender had Lufthansa been awarded? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay like – Chair remember there is commitment that all 
the suppliers should make they respond to the tenders.  With regard to 
the NIP obligation there is a form that they are supposed to fill in to 
commit to NIP obligation.  So it was actually referring to that previous 
tender for the component.  Remember the component tender started 
from 2013 up to – it was finalised in 2016.  So Ms Hofmeyr referring to 
10 
the affidavit of Mr October. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr October. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes like that – whatever that is confirming has nothing 
to do with component tender.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela I do have to just conclude this 
point.  Lufthansa submitted a compliant bid for the final components 
tender because they were not disqualified.  Amongst the requirements 
in the final components tender was the filling out of the SBD5 form that 
we looked at yesterday.  So they had fully undertaken to comply with 
the NIP obligation for the final tender. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  In the final tender. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  What was… 
MS MEMELA:  There was no need – there was no NIP obligation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let – let her finish Ms Memela. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What is recorded here is that the bidder still 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 111 of 217 
 
has outstanding unresolved NIP obligations from a previous tender. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. But that tender was never awarded. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But then I struggle to understand because there 
could never be a NIP obligation that was undertaken in respect of a 
tender that was not awarded. 
MS MEMELA:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think Ms Hofmeyr is saying to you and Ms Hofmeyr 
you will listen. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you will tell me if I misunderstand your question. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think her point is if Lufthansa was compliant in 
regard to the NIP obligation or undertook to comply with that obligation 
in regard to a tender that was being looked at, at that time. 
MS MEMELA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is difficult to understand why they would be 
disqualified or they would not be given a tender simply because in the 
past there was a tender in respect of which they did not comply.  Ms 
20 
Hofmeyr is that – 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If I may? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think that is… 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 112 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If I may say far more eloquently than I put it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  Were they disqualified for not complying with the NIP? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No the point Ms Memela is that the final tender, 
the one that CFST was evaluating in April 2016. 
MS MEMELA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Had a requirement that you had to undertake a 
NIP obligation and you had to with your bid submission sign a SBD5 
form.  And all of these bidders, Lufthansa, JM, AAR, Air France 
complied with that.  So in their bids for the final tender they submitted 
10 
the SBD5 form.  That is why when CFST records this they do not talk 
about this tender. They say the bidder still has outstanding unresolved 
NIP obligations from a previous tender.  And I understand you to say 
your understanding of that was that one of the previous components 
tenders that was never awarded they might not have submitted a SBD5 
form.  Is that your understanding? 
MS MEMELA:  My understanding Chair was that since Lufthansa was 
the previous component tender of SAAT before Air France.  They had 
never adhered to the NIP obligation as required by the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the past? 
20 
MS MEMELA:  In the past. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you … 
MS MEMELA:  That will be my understanding of what is written here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  I do not know what is the understanding of Ms Kate but I 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 113 of 217 
 
was still going to ask him – ask her to direct me to the agreement that 
she said it was an attachment to the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay before that.  Let us just make sure we 
understand the basic information.   
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you accept that in regard to the tender that Ms 
Hofmeyr – that we are talking about now – in regard to that tender do 
you accept that Lufthansa was compliant or undertook to comply with 
the NIP obligation? 
MS MEMELA:  I would not know Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would not know? 
MS MEMELA:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And do you – or have you come across anything that 
suggests that CFST at the time thought that Lufthansa was not 
compliant in regard to the NIP obligation in regard to the tender they 
were considering? 
MS MEMELA:  Not on the tender they were considering Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja only the previous one? 
MS MEMELA:  On the previous contract that they had with SAAT. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Because remember a NIP obligation started long time 
ago. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes and Lufthansa was the previous component support. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 114 of 217 
 
MS MEMELA:  Like supplier of SAAT. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes before Air France. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now – well my question and maybe Ms Hofmeyr’s 
question is, why would they – if they were compliant with regard to the 
NIP obligation undertook to comply in regard to the tender that was 
being considered. 
MS MEMELA:  The final one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja the final one.  Why would the fact that some time 
in the past in regard to another tender they might not have complied 
10 
why would that be used against them? 
MS MEMELA:  My understanding is that like because the final tender 
the 2016 one required all the multinational suppliers to bring their 
commitment towards the supplier development.  And my understanding 
will be that Lufthansa did not bring the commitment like other company 
– other multinational companies like Air France brought in Kwane 
Capital.  AJ Walters brought in Pegasus. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I do not want to – I am not sure that I 
understand I think we are on the same page. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That with regard to the final tender you have not 
come across anything that says, Lufthansa was not compliant?  You are 
not aware of anything that relates to them not having being compliant 
in regard to the final tender.  You are aware of a concern that sometime 
in the past – sometime before this tender. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 115 of 217 
 
MS MEMELA:  Before this tender yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They were not compliant? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So my question before I speak to Ms Mbanjwa is I am 
not sure that I would understand why the fact that some time in the past 
in respect of a previous tender they might not have complied and it was 
not awarded to them, why that would be used against them in regard to 
the final tender. 
MS MEMELA:  I guess Chair it will be used based on the fact that SAAT 
and SAA that time was driving a national – a transformational agenda 
10 
and NIP is part of the transformational agenda. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So even if they were compliant at the moment so to 
speak. 
MS MEMELA:  I am not sure I am still going to ask Ms Hofmeyr if they 
have a complaint on the 2016 one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  But like from what I was reading, what was written there 
by the CFST it said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja.  About supply development I do not… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay she will address your concern.  Ms Mbanjwa has 
your concern fallen away? 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  No this is not an objection Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Just for me to be able to follow. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 116 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  I wanted to know if because I hear Ms 
Memela saying Lufthansa was previously. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Non-compliant. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  No was previously the supplier for the 
components tender.  I want to clear that or is it not like that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I did not understand that.  I think the… 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Yes because that is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think leave a note for Ms Hofmeyr but my 
understanding is that it was not – Lufthansa was not compliant in 
10 
regard to the NIP obligation but that tender for which it had put in a bid 
was not awarded.  Is that fine Ms Memela?  Okay Ms – we will clarify it 
Ms Mbanjwa. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Please.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we confusing you? 
MS MEMELA:  Yoh I am so confused Chair.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair if I may assists. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because Ms Memela first of all asked could she 
20 
be taken to the agreement. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes like the one we talking about. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Between Lufthansa and the DTI.  Because in 
fact it is an agreement. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja let us… 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 117 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Related to SAAT. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And component support.  So let us go to that.  
It is in DD22G and it is at page 3124.  Apologies the first page is 3123. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry did you change the page number? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  3123 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  3123? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair just to orientate ourselves what Mr 
10 
October had said in his affidavit was, he had been asked by the 
commission’s investigators whether Lufthansa was non-compliant with 
its NIP obligations and he had gone back to the records and he found 
the agreement that was entered into and you see that at page 32 – 
3123.  It is between the Government of the Republic of South Africa 
and Lufthansa in broad terms.  And if you turn over the page it tells you 
what contract this is in relation to.  That is at the top of the page.  It 
says: 
“Whereas the obligor that in Lufthansa has been 
awarded a contract for the maintenance classic 
20 
power by the hour and cost prevent PBTH of and 
then it is a series of engine – well an engine – 
operated by South African Airways and or maintained 
by South African Airways Technical from time to time.  
Currently this number is 39 engines.  Contract 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 118 of 217 
 
reference and then it has got the SAAT reference. 
And it says it was entered into in writing on the 23 
July 2013.” 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So I understand Mr October’s evidence in his 
affidavit he says: 
“This agreement was inforce at the time that the 
2016 bids were being adjudicated and according to 
the DTI records Lufthansa was fully compliant.  He 
attaches the schedule to that effect and he says that 
10 
there was no respect in which non-compliance had 
been raised in writing with the DTI.”  
But does that assist Ms Memela? 
MS MEMELA:  Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Ms Hofmeyr I do not know maybe she does not want to 
listen to my explanation.  Before she read this agreement she said… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well we – we are all – we can – at different times we 
all – we are all getting confused at some stage or another so. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay Chair she had said – said that has nothing to do 
20 
with component tender.  And she said that actually has everything to do 
with component tender.  This agreement is an engine agreement.  It is 
not the component tender agreement.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MEMELA:  So I do not know how I explain this.  Like I am saying it 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 119 of 217 
 
does not matter how many contracts… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you did – you did make the point earlier that … 
MS MEMELA:  Yes so I am trying to explain. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were referring to the specific component tender 
and that they might have been compliant in regard to other tenders. 
MS MEMELA:  They – they have complied to engine contract not the 
component tender contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Which one was that?  Was that the one from 
10 
2008? 
MS MEMELA:  This is – no, no, the one from 2008 remember is 
between SAAT and Air France.  Lufthansa was the supplier of SAAT 
before that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh before 2008? 
MS MEMELA:  Before 2008. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Sorry, sorry that obligation that you 
understood… 
MS MEMELA:  And also… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So that obligation that you understood they had 
20 
been non-compliant in respect of? 
MS MEMELA:  That would have been but like remember also Chair I 
said this tender was run from 2013 and it was only finalised in 2016.  
2016 that is when the supplier development was introduced.  So by 
previous although they are not specific they might be referring to one 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 120 of 217 
 
of those tenders where they did not commit.  But I do know at the back 
of my mind Lufthansa has always been that supplier that is reluctant to 
adhere to NIP obligation.  And that applies to the one previously 
because remember NIP obligation started in 1997 so a person cannot 
say okay because it was long time ago therefore it is okay.  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
MS MEMELA:  But like I am glad that Ms Hofmeyr understands now that 
this agreement sent by Mr October is for engine.  It is not for 
component. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So in 2013 it was compliant with its NIP 
10 
obligations, correct? 
MS MEMELA:  For engine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No but it was not a supplier for components at 
that time.  So in 2013 Lufthansa was a – I understood you to say the 
components related to the pre 2008 position? 
CHAIRPERSON:  [indistinct] it will be sorted out.  I am sorry I am 
thinking it will be sorted out maybe let us wait a bit. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Thank you Chair.  It is not only she who is 
20 
being confused.  I am also being confused.  And it is the manner in 
which the evidence is being handled. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  She is given an omnibus set of questions 
to which to respond to.  Broken down so that I can also understand as a 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 121 of 217 
 
legal representative which tender was Lufthansa involved in?  Was it a 
components tender or was it an engine tender? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is why I was saying if you wait a bit it is 
going to be sorted out. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  That way I was going to ask Chairperson 
you to intervene because you have a way of taking those steps. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  If you can assist us the way you have 
been doing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Otherwise I am also very confused. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no that is fine. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela am I correct to understand your 
evidence to be that prior to 2008 Lufthansa was a supplier of 
component services to SAAT? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And it is in respect of those services that it 
may not have been compliant with its NIP obligation? 
20 
MS MEMELA:  And it could also be possible Chair that like within these 
tenders from 2013 when they were – when they were responding like 
they did not commit to NIP obligation.  Because also not committing 
like that is counted as work does not matter whether the tender is 
awarded or not.  Once the supplier shows reluctance like that by the 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 122 of 217 
 
CFST it is looked at.  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay so then that has been helpful.  So from 
2013 it may – your evidence is it may have been that when they 
submitted previous bids for tenders they did not comply with the NIP 
obligation, is that right? 
MS MEMELA:  Why we talking about 2013 now? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because you just spoke about 2013. 
MS MEMELA:  No like this 2013 was referring to this engine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you did talk about 2013 Ms Memela. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just in your answer a moment ago. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  No but like I was explaining Chair that remember the 
tenders that kept on being retracted started from 2013 and finalised in 
2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  So it might – I said it might happen between 2013 and 
2016 on those tenders that kept on going out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what she is talking about. 
MS MEMELA:  Them I have not … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is exactly it. 
MS MEMELA:  But now she is referring to 2013 alone. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well not really.  No I do not think she refers to it 
alone but she is following up on your evidence that it is possible that 
even from 2013 onwards Lufthansa might not have been compliant or 
might still have been reluctant. 
MS MEMELA:  For components? 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 123 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  For components. 
MS MEMELA:  Not want engines. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think she is - that is where she is … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  She is, ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Precisely where I was.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I am indebted.  So when this risk in relation to 
Lufthansa was identified for the final components tender.  What was 
taken into account was that on previous bid submissions they had made 
on components since 2013.  They may not have committed to an 
obligation. 
MS MEMELA:  It is not written there Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  I am getting the benefit of your insight. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja.  I am saying - remember I said it is possible … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS MEMELA:  But what the CFST has written is not - is not saying from 
20 
- that is why you hear me - they may have been referring to the one 
before Air France … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Or maybe between the ones that were cancelled or 
whatever. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 124 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  That is fine.  So you are saying you are not sure 
which ones they gave.  You are referring to … 
MS MEMELA:  Ja, because it is not clear of the dates.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you are saying that you do know … 
MS MEMELA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That in the past … 
MS MEMELA:  They did not comply. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There had been reluctance on their part to commit 
10 
themselves to … 
MS MEMELA:  To NIP Obligations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  NIP Obligations. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  In terms of the component … (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of the components? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In regard to other contracts you do not know? 
MS MEMELA:  Ja.  With regard to other engine contracts … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  Because they had lots of … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Contracts, ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Contracts with SAAT. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 125 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then we can move to the Board decision 
itself on the final award Ms Memela. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The … 
MS MEMELA:  Can we go there if … (intervenes)? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The Board decision took place on 9 May 2016.  
You will recall that. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  Can you - can we go there? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes of course. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I am just wanting to establish where we are in 
the evidence and your knowledge of it. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you - you recall that the decision was on 
9 May 2016.  Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Chair, the reason why I am asking if we can go there.  I 
want to confirm something I - I am looking at. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  So that I do not say … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let us go to it. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  I think so … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Let us go there. 
MS MEMELA:  Or I do know exactly. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is at DD22F.  I think it is the one that was in 
front of you.  DD22F and you will find it at page 2-3-0-4. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 126 of 217 
 
MS MEMELA:  Page? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  2-3-0-4. 
MS MEMELA:  Page 2-3-0-4. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair this is the page that you do not like, 
because there is handwriting over the pagination … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But we did look at it before in Mr Human’s 
evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If you look at 2-3-0-5.  It is - it is easier.  What 
10 
is this document Ms Memela? 
MS MEMELA:  I am still getting there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Sorry. 
MS MEMELA:  2-3-0-4 right? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think ultimately she wants you to go to 2-3-0-5. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed and while you are getting there maybe I 
just read into the record what we are looking at.  We are looking at the 
minutes of the Special Meeting of the South African Airways Technical 
20 
SOC Ltd Board … 
MS MEMELA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of Directors held on Monday 9 May 2016 at 
08:30 at the main boardroom and I indeed wanted to direct you to 
2-3-0-5, because that as I have it at Clause 4.1 on that page or 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 127 of 217 
 
paragraph 4.1 is where the submission relating to the final tender is 
reflected and then a little bit further down that we have the resolution 
of the Board in relation to the final tender. 
MS MEMELA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you have that Ms Memela? 
MS MEMELA:  2-3-0-5? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  2-3-0-5 … 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There is a paragraph 4. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That says matters for consideration or approval 
… 
MS MEMELA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And at 4.1 it records in these minutes: 
“The 
submission 
was 
tabled 
and 
considered.  
According 
to 
the 
submission 
management 
recommended that the tender be awarded to Air 
France.  A discussion on the matter ensued and the 
Board 
made 
the 
following 
comments: 
 
a, 
management’s rationale for recommending that Air 
20 
France be awarded the tender was not substantive 
considering the bidders resistance to align itself to 
SAAT’s 
development 
agenda 
i.e. 
supplier 
development.  Furthermore the benefits as outlined 
by the submission as a result of selecting Air 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 128 of 217 
 
France were not compelling enough to position the 
latter as the preferred bidder.  The concerns 
regarding JM/AAR especially management view that 
this bidder was lowballing could be mitigated by 
reducing each party’s obligations as well as terms 
and conditions to writing.” 
And then the resolution is reflected. 
“Resolve that the request for the approval of the 
award of a tender for the aircraft component 
support and services on ATA Chapter for both the 
10 
Boeing and Airbus Fleets for a period of five years 
to JM/AARB and here is hereby approved subject to 
the mitigation of all risks highlighted in the 
submission.” 
Do you see that? 
MS MEMELA:  I see that Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Were you aware of this resolution at the time it 
was made? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or soon after it was made or - ja.  You might not have 
been aware at the time … 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was made, because you were not at the Board 
meeting. 
MS MEMELA:  Exactly.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 129 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No.  Apologies.  Maybe later that day or … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Shortly thereafter.  Were you aware of the 
resolution? 
MS MEMELA:  We were made aware Chair after Mr Malola Phiri - I 
think he sent the - the Board resolution, but already as I said earlier 
there were already talks that some people already knew what was 
happening and some had already notified Air France.  Air France was 
already taking steps to take SAAT to court and all that, but I - I do 
know that of course we usually get now when I am talking about formal 
10 
- provisional formal. 
Ja.  We - we get the feedback after the - the CEO comes back 
from the Board Meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you were not present at that meeting.  That 
is clear from the minutes.  Correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And did you support the decision that the Board 
had taken on that day? 
MS MEMELA:  Did I support it? 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS MEMELA:  Chair, remember … 
CHAIRPERSON:  What she is talking about - what she is talking about 
is when you came to know that this was the decision that was taken.  
What was your view about it?  If you had any. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 130 of 217 
 
MS MEMELA:  Okay Chair.  First of all when the Board - what - what we 
used to.  Not that it is a legislation or any rule.  So that we - we do not 
come back discussing a written rule or what.  The precedents so far 
like what we have seen with regard to the Board Resolution.  When 
they are not happy like they were not happy with Lufthansa.  
Remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that - when you say “they” now.  You mean the - 
the bidders? 
MS MEMELA:  The Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Board? 
10 
MS MEMELA:  The Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When - when they are not happy with a bidder? 
MS MEMELA:  With a - huh-uh.  With a recommendation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A recommendation? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  From CFST and - and management they either - they 
usually comment and ask for work and - and state what needs to - to be 
corrected.  Like for instance they have said here that the risks that are 
raised - whatever shall be this and that … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am going to interrupt you. 
MS MEMELA:  But … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Memela. 
MS MEMELA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I want us to go back to the crisp answers. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 131 of 217 
 
MS MEMELA:  Oh.  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was your view of this resolution?  Did - did you 
have a view?  Did you think it was good - a good decision?  Did you 
think it was not a good decision or you had no view at all about it? 
MS MEMELA:  Of course we were all shocked.  We - we were not used 
to the Board making a decision there and there on the recommendation.  
As - okay.  Now I am worried that I will not be crisp, but like the - the 
Board usually says if they are not happy …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Sends it back to - to … 
MS MEMELA:  Go back for a work … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And work, ja. 
MS MEMELA:  And then when you come back and then they will say 
maybe approval subject to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  Or something or maybe decline. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  Go back for work and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MEMELA:  Address these issues and come back to us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you say you were all shocked.  Can - can I take 
that to mean you did not support the - the decision or are you saying I 
was shocked.  Not necessarily that I did not support it or I did not have 
a view on it, but I did not expect it. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 132 of 217 
 
MS MEMELA:  Okay.  I - I would say when you say we were, because 
some of us - executives were discussing this and we said we - we have 
never dealt with an issue like this, but at the end of the day we 
understood the Board being the accounting authority and they had their 
own reasons that they made that decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I would then like to take you to the 
minutes of the Board Meeting that occurred on 15 June 2016. 
MS MEMELA:  The 15 t h. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So it is about a month or so later.  For that 
10 
Ms Memela you will have to go into DD25B.  That is your bundle.  It is 
the smaller second bundle and you will pick it up at page 2 - page 
6-2-1.  While you are looking for it Ms Memela.  I do apologise.  My - 
my … 
MS MEMELA:  Page? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let me give you the page.  It is DD25B at page 
6-2-1.  Ms Memela, I have made an error in what I put to you earlier 
and I - I do need to correct it for the record.  I - I apologise.  I have 
been alerted to it.  I said in one of my questions to you.  You were not 
present at the Board Meeting on 9 May 2016 and that seems to be 
20 
incorrect based on the minutes. 
You will see where we were previously in DD22G at page 2-3-
0-4.  Sorry F.  We were in DD22F.  The minutes of that meeting - the 
one where the decision was taken to award it to AAR indicates that 
attendance included you.  Can you assist us on that? 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 133 of 217 
 
MS MEMELA:  15 June 2016? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No.  Sorry.  Ms Memela, I did not want to 
disrupt things too much.  We are going to move to 15 June meeting in a 
moment.  So please keep that open. 
MS MEMELA:  Oh.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I said that - it has been pointed out to me that I 
made an error in a question I asked you previously.  I said that I had 
thought the minutes reflected that you were not in attendance … 
MS MEMELA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  At the Board Meeting on 9 May, but it has been 
10 
brought to my attention that the minutes reflect that you were in 
attendance.  I would like us just to clear that up in your evidence. 
MS MEMELA:  (Intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The previous minutes - Chair I do not suggest 
you need to go there.  Just for the record it is DD22F at page 2-3-0-4.  
You will see that is the minutes of the meeting of 9 May and in 
attendance includes yourself.  Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  (Witness reading to herself). 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  (Indistinct). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Certainly. 
20 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  The page? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The page is 2-3-0-4. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  2-3-0-4. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja.  The - the attendance Chair it is written that I was in 
attendance. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 134 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you recall that? 
MS MEMELA:  No.  I do not recall, because as I said I remember that 
we got it through the calls. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS MEMELA:  It is just that this one compared to the one for the 
GPUs.  You see that one it shows that a person walked in for a specific 
item - to talk about a specific item.  So I may have been given what do 
you call this?  A pack to attend for a specific item, because I can see 
that there were also tyres - the approval for tyres as well and then also 
it looks like I was going to talk about - confirm something from BAC 
10 
point of view. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  So it might happen that I was called for that 
specific item. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS MEMELA:  It is just that this one is not specific as the GPUs one … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS MEMELA:  Because the GPU one the - in fact it depends which 
company secretary writes, but others say a person walked in during this 
moment. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you for that.  So you do not have a 
recollection of being in attendance? 
MS MEMELA:  I do not have a recollection. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 135 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja.  Of … (intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I just wanted to clear that up.  We can now go 
to the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But - I am sorry.  You do not have a recollection, but 
it is possible that the minutes are - are right? 
MS MEMELA:  I am - I am saying Chair.  It might be possible that 
because of how - like - like I mean … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja.  It differs from one company secretary to the other. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Others are specific that a person is walking in. Joining 
the meeting for a specific item. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay.  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  You know, because I remember I said I do not attend the 
meeting, but only through and invite when the Board requires certain 
feedback from me or … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can - can I take the minutes then - can I take it that 
what you are saying in regard to these minutes is that to the extent that 
the minutes reflect that you were present.  You do not dispute having 
20 
been present … 
MS MEMELA:  Ja, but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what you - what you suspect is that it is unlikely 
you were present throughout the meeting. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja.  Not throughout the meeting. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 136 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  You - you would have been present you think for 
a certain period of time … 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the minutes just … 
MS MEMELA:  For a specific item. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Happens not to show - not to make a distinction 
between people who were present for the entire meeting and those who 
may have come and attended for - only a short time? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Then I would like to go to DD25B, 
because we were going to look there at the minutes of the meeting of 
15 June 2016 and that was at page 6-2-1.  Do you have that 
Ms Memela? 
MS MEMELA:  Page 6-2-1?  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  Now these are the minutes that we have 
looked at previously related to the GPUs … 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And as I have your evidence you - as you have 
just indicated you joined the meeting at a point and you can actually 
20 
find that at page 6-2-5.  If you go to page 6-2-5 at paragraph 4.6 there. 
MS MEMELA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Under the heading “Logistics Phased Approach 
Rollout”.  It is reflected there in italics. 
“SAAT HOD Supply Chain Management joined the 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 137 of 217 
 
meeting.” 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that what you were referring to? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  That is what I was referring to … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
MS MEMELA:  Chair, but also was saying different - like I mean 
depending on which company secretary is sitting there.  My 
understanding is that I think for the Board at that time it was Mr Maso 
and then for GPUs it was Ms Maake (?). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  So each company’s secretary writes the minutes their 
own style.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
MS MEMELA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No.  I - I do not think that is a matter of 
contention. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What I would like to look at is what you said 
after you joined that meeting about the AAR award of the components 
tender, because that was also something that was actually discussed at 
20 
this meeting and you will find that at page 6-2-7.  At page 6-2-7 … 
MS MEMELA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There is a paragraph 4.9 which is headed 
“Addressing the Sunday Times Article on AAR.”  Do you see that? 
MS MEMELA:  I see that. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 138 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So what this minute reflects is that the Deputy 
Company Secretary circulated two documents from the SAA Board 
Chairperson. 
MS MEMELA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  A letter addressed to the SAAT Board 
Chairperson and an additional draft letter addressed to the Minister of 
Finance regarding the AAR article. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you recall that article? 
MS MEMELA:  I do not recall it detail by detail. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja, but I do recall there was something written on that 
matter. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  It goes on and it says: 
“The Chairperson gave feedback to the letters and 
indicated that the SAA Board had initiated an 
investigation 
into 
procurement 
processes 
and 
contracts management at SAA and its subsidiaries.” 
MS MEMELA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  “She stated that AAR was not - was 
20 
initially not within the scope of the investigation 
which was conducted by Ernst & Young, because it 
was not yet conducting business with SAAT.” 
MS MEMELA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  She continued that: 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 139 of 217 
 
“The Chairperson of the SAA Board had then 
indicated that she would not accept the SAAT 
Report without investigation into AAR.” 
MS MEMELA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  “Thereafter Ernst & Young had 
initiated an investigation into AAR.  The meeting 
was informed that the SAA Board Chairperson was 
of the view that the AAR Contract should be 
terminated.” 
And then we go over the page to page 6-2-8. 
10 
“Member of the Board discussed the matter and 
concluded that on presentation of the tender 
evaluation to the Board.  SAAT Management could 
not support their recommendation to appoint Air 
France and therefore the contract was awarded to 
AAR which was second best.” 
Do you see that? 
MS MEMELA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then it is recorded here that you reported 
something to the Board, because it says: 
20 
“The HOD SCM …” 
That is a reference to you as I understand it.  Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You reported that: 
“SAAT Management supported the Board’s decision 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 140 of 217 
 
to appoint AAR, because it was justifiable.” 
And you went on and stated that: 
“SAAT had responded to a letter received from 
Lufthansa and Air France and had not received any 
further correspondence thereafter.” 
MS MEMELA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you highlighted that: 
“The MRO would be more at risk of facing litigation 
should it endeavour to cancel the AAR award.” 
And then it concludes with: 
10 
“The Board observed that it was clear that the 
complaints against the award of the contract to AAR 
were that of a disgruntled service provider as 
opposed to legitimate concerns.” 
Do you see that? 
MS MEMELA:  I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Would it be fair to say then that by 
15 June 2016 you - you were in support of the Board’s decision to 
award this to AAR? 
MS MEMELA:  Chair, I - I think I - actually even before I answer this.  
20 
Remember I was saying to Ms Hofmeyr during our meeting on 
6 December last year that as much as we - the Board - had made their 
own decision that was different from management and - ja.  So - but 
when the company faces issues like the media reporting negatively on 
the company and Air France taking the company to court. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 141 of 217 
 
Our duty as SAAT Executives is to ensure that we - we act in 
the best interest of SAAT.  That is when I even said we then had 
appointed the lawyers to represent SAAT and make sure that SAAT 
does not lose and indeed the - SAAT won the case from court with 
costs.  So supporting from that period of course there was absolutely 
nothing that I could have done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well l am not sure I understand the connection that I 
think you make between the stance of sending lawyers to the - to court 
to defend SAAT … 
MS MEMELA:  Hm. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because of the obligation to act in the best interest of 
SAAT, because that obligation is always there whatever you do.  Is it 
not? 
MS MEMELA:  Thank you.  So I was just confirming that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  That we always have to support the company and the 
decision that was made by the Board at that time.  It had already been 
made and we had to go with it and make sure that we defend in court. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But your obligation to act in the best interest of the 
company does not mean supporting a - a wrong decision.  Is it not? 
MS MEMELA:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or does it go that far.  I am just wanting to clarify this 
particular part of your evidence. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 142 of 217 
 
MS MEMELA:  Chair, remember I - when I responded I said … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  The Board made their own decision … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  And they had their reasons why. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Which is - my understanding is that I - I know that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  Maybe one time or eventually … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  You - you will call the Board … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MEMELA:  Members in … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MEMELA:  To respond on their behalf. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MEMELA:  On - on their own. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MEMELA:  So they will be able to give reasons why … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  They - they took that decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see … 
MS MEMELA:  So I said for - I said for us … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  Because we are talking between … 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 143 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  Management and we were shocked at that time … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  And I explained why we were shocked.  It is because 
usually … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  The Board when they are not happy … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do not explain again. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Oh.  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I - I would understand when - if you say look we might 
not have agreed with the decision, but the Board had made the decision 
and some of the decisions that are made by the Board we as 
management just have to live with and that - that I would understand, 
but I … 
MS MEMELA:  Oh.  I thought I was making … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I did not - I did not understand … 
MS MEMELA:  Oh.  I did … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The acting in the best interest of the organisation … 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In that connection. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja.  Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  No.  I - I … 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 144 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Meant it that way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So when it was recorded in the minutes that 
you reported that SAAT Management supported the Board’s decision to 
appoint AAR, because it was justifiable. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You see when I read that it suggests to me that 
you devaluated the reasons given by the Board and you regarded them 
10 
as justifiable.  Is that not the correct reading? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay Chair.  Of course like it will - it will be based on 
the interpretation of what the reasons of the Board were at the time and 
of course the Board had said the risks that we had raised - that 
because there was lowballing in some parts of the spares and then also 
- I do not remember what other risks were in terms of the fact that AAR 
was not - did not have a footprint in Africa. 
Therefore - ja, but let - there were lists that were - were 
listed by CFST and management.  Yes.  So when - I think when the - 
the management sat and discussed we understand that okay.  I think we 
20 
- we thought this could have been something that was going to be 
managed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I thought that you were saying earlier on that the 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 145 of 217 
 
- you were all shocked at the decision taken by the management … 
MS MEMELA:  The Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By the Board. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry … 
MS MEMELA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And my understanding is that the decision you were 
talking about was the decision that AAR be appointed.  Was I correct in 
understanding your evidence like that?  That the decision that shocked 
you was the Board’s decision to appoint AAR.  Was I correct 
10 
understanding that? 
MS MEMELA:  That - ja.  That - that was the Board’s decision to award 
- or make a decision … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  To award there and there … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Because usually they send - like I even said there is no 
legislation against this or the rule. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  But like I mean we were used to the Board … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was a practice? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  We were used to the Board when they are not happy 
about a certain submission - about a recommendation.  They - they will 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 146 of 217 
 
send it back for work or maybe say approved subject to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Subject to, ja. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes - or declined. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what - did - did you mean that you did not have - 
you were not shocked by the fact that the Board said the tender should 
go to AAR.  What you were shocked about - what - what shocked you 
was that the Board did not say we are happy that the tender should go 
to AAR, but we are sending it back to management to do the 
formalities? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay Chair.  I am - I am going to repeat.  I said I am - 
10 
we - we were shocked … 
CHAIRPERSON:  By what? 
MS MEMELA:  That the Board had made an immediate decision to 
award. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  Remember the - the recommendation is made by the - 
the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Management. 
MS MEMELA:  CFST and then through management until it gets to the 
Board … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  And - and when the CFST makes that what the - the 
recommendation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MEMELA:  It is based on - it is based on the evaluation … 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 147 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  And satisfied and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  So when the Board made that decision we were 
shocked with that, because we - we - like we were not used to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were you shocked by the fact that the Board made a 
decision that went against management’s recommendation. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that what shocked you? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  We were shocked about that Chair.  The fact that it 
was against the CFST recommendation and management. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But how … 
MS MEMELA:  But … 
CHAIRPERSON:  How - how would you be one of those who were 
shocked if at the meeting you said you - SAAT Management supported 
that decision? 
MS MEMELA:  No.  This was not the same meeting Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Remember … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is not the same meeting? 
MS MEMELA:  No.  I said this is the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay.  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  The meeting for the Board was on  
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 148 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The 9 t h. 
MS MEMELA:  9 May … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  That is - that is fine. 
MS MEMELA:  And then that one was on - was on the 15 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I must have misunderstood. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
MS MEMELA:  So that followed after the Board decision.  So it was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had taken place? 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  It was not something that was said … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  On the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So by 15 June had you satisfied yourself about 
the justifiability of their reasons? 
MS MEMELA:  Had I satisfied … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the answer can only be yes I had or no I had 
20 
not. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay.  No.  I had not Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  That is crisp. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  So did the minutes not correctly 
record then what you reported to the meeting? 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 149 of 217 
 
MS MEMELA:  Okay Chair.  When you support it does not necessarily 
mean you agree … 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Indistinct). 
MS MEMELA:  With that person.  Exactly.  When - when management 
says we support … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MEMELA:  The Board decision, because there is nothing you can 
change. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS MEMELA:  They took that decision.  Their - their senior power and 
10 
even if maybe we - we had shown our dissatisfaction or maybe our - our 
disapproval.  Maybe I will be sitting here being charged for 
insubordination.  I do not know, but I am just saying supporting does 
not necessarily mean you agree with how the decision has been taken.  
It means like you respect authority … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I … 
MS MEMELA:  But at - at the same time Chair I am not saying … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MEMELA:  I have - I had at that time when we were saying we 
supported - what - satisfied … (intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Evaluated. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  You had not evaluated … 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you are saying that when in this meeting you said 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 150 of 217 
 
the SAAT Management supported the Board’s decision. 
MS MEMELA:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are saying that that did not mean - you are not 
meaning that the SAAT Management agreed with the decision? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair, because I - I think even if I had said I 
disagree.  There was absolutely nothing that I was going to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you see I - I do not understand your evidence 
when you say if you say you support.  You do not mean you agree.  I 
thought if you support something.  It means you agree with it.  I would 
understand if you said - if you said management - the SAAT 
10 
Management will implement the Board’s decision … 
MS MEMELA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because implementing does not necessarily mean you 
agree with it. 
MS MEMELA:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It might just mean, you accept that there is nothing 
you can do, your job is now to implement, not that the decision has 
been made but if you say you support, that suggests to me that you are 
happy with the decision. 
MS MEMELA:   But the decision, Chair, was made on the 9 t h of May and 
20 
this meeting was on the 15 t h of July and…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it could have been made the year before but if 
you didn’t agree with it you would still not want to say you support it? 
MS MEMELA:  Then the only way that I could have shown my, maybe, 
disagreement will be if the Board would have sent back to CFST and 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 151 of 217 
 
then we would have stood our ground maybe and said, okay we still 
recommending [indistinct] base don these grounds then should the 
board should decide otherwise then it’s up to the Board, so they took 
the decision then and there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you, let’s move then to your role in the 
contract negotiations Ms Memela if we may, I understand you to have 
been involved in those contract negotiations, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:   Chair, involvement versus attending the first contract 
negotiation where all parties, like between SAAT and AAR / JM sit 
10 
ja…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you say limited involvement? 
MS MEMELA:  Limited involvement, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MEMELA:    Yes because after that then the negotiation was not – I 
was not involved in the negotiation. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Amongst the team who were negotiating were 
Ms Mbeki and Mr Kenny is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes Ms Mbeki from the legal framework point of view 
and Mr Kenny was there to guide in terms of – it’s just that I don’t 
20 
remember who exactly were there but was there to guide in terms of the 
technical side of things yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Ms Mbeki has provided an affidavit to the 
Commission and it’s been included in your bundle, she - let me take 
you to it, it’s in DD25B and it commences at page 4-6-4. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 152 of 217 
 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So this is an affidavit of Ms Mbeki who 
indicates in it that she was involved in the negotiations but I’d like to 
pick it up at paragraph 12 of her affidavit which is at page 4-6-7. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   At paragraph 12 there page 4-6-7 Ms Mbeki 
indicates the following, and I’ll read it into the record, 
 
“Given the complexity and technical nature of the component 
 
support services Advocate Memela established a team of 
 
people to take part in the review and negotiation of the said 
10 
 
agreement and then she goes on and she says, the said team 
 
consisted of the following officials”, 
 
And then there’s a list of a number of officials and she 
concludes that paragraph to say, 
 
“The SAAT team was under the leadership of Advocate 
 
Memela with the assistance of Mike Kenny in their capacities 
 
as SAAT executive and executive committee members”, 
 
Do you have any reason to dispute what Ms Mbeki says there 
about the fact that you were leading this SAAT team? 
MS MEMELA:   Leading the SAAT team throughout the negotiation or 
20 
what? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes she said you established the team and then 
you led the team.  
MS MEMELA:   I suspect that maybe she did not put the date but I 
know that as she states here, this is the team Chair that was on that 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 153 of 217 
 
first day that I’m talking about because we had noticed that people are 
coming from AR where they had senior people like Vice Presidents and 
all that, so we attended on this one, so it was not throughout the 
negotiation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you remain the leader of the team throughout 
even if you did not attend every meeting? 
MS MEMELA:   The leader how Chair, where I negotiate...[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Here she says, 
 
“The SAAT team was under the leadership of Advocate 
 
Memela”, 
10 
 
Is that part correct? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes and my understanding is she’s talking about that 
first day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At that particular meeting? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes that first day yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the – she says you established a team and she 
gives the names of people there is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes people who will be representing certain section. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja over a certain period of the negotiations isn’t it? 
MS MEMELA:   Over a certain period but for me I only participated on 
20 
that first day ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja but would those people not be reporting to you 
over that period? 
MS MEMELA:  No, no they will not be reporting to me because they will 
be – for instance Wellington Niswa…[intervenes]. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 154 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who would they be reporting to about progress in the 
negotiations? 
MS MEMELA:   Progress, like how far is the negotiations? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja to say we had a meeting these people are being 
difficult now or this and that or anything like that? 
MS MEMELA:   There’s never been that kind of progress reporting 
Chair, that okay they report to Nontsasa now okay this is where we are 
and stuff, my understanding that once the contract is being negotiated 
people are independent to play their role as management because all 
these people that we see here they were part of management except – 
10 
well [indistinct] was a specialist and Stan Vosloo. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Ms Mbeki says that you were not only in 
attendance at the first meeting, she says you were in attendance at the 
second set of meetings as well, we can find that at page 4-7-0 and at 
paragraph 18 she says, 
 
“I do not remember the exact date of the second set of 
 
meetings but it also took place in June 2016, it took place 
 
over two days, I do not remember receiving a meeting 
 
invitation for this meeting and it does not appear in my diary 
20 
 
but I confirm that I did attend the meeting.  I was called to 
 
the meeting by Evelyn Fallett”, 
 
Evelyn Fallett is that SAAT representative or an AAR 
representative? 
MS MEMELA:   Is a SAAT representative she’s actually a specialist 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 155 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And she goes on and says, 
 
“I was called to the meeting by Evelyn Fallett who said that 
 
Advocate Memela had sent her to call me. It is at this 
 
meeting that the draft component support agreement was 
 
presented to the SAAT team by the JMAAR team, if I 
 
remember well the following team members were present on 
 
the first day of that meeting”, 
 
So that’s the second set of meetings over two days, it took 
place in June, does this help jog your memory? 
MS MEMELA:   Chair I feel that…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe we can take note of the fact that she starts 
that sentence, “if I remember well”. 
MS MEMELA:   No Chair I feel that if I should have received a Rule 3.3 
in this…[intervenes]. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   It’s been in your bundle since last 
week…[intervenes]. 
MS MEMELA:   No, no the Rule 3.3, I’m not talking about the bundle 
I’m talking about the Rule 3.3 where I’m supposed to respond to – when 
somebody is talking about me and…[intervenes]. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No you get a 3.3 Ms Memela when there’s a 
20 
witness whose evidence is going to be presented who implicates you.  
This is the evidence of a witness who is talking about, not whose giving 
oral evidence, whose affidavit is admitted provisionally and who’s just 
talking about who attended meetings. 
MS MEMELA:   No but Chair, here the affidavit says I was the leader of 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 156 of 217 
 
the negotiation and I have led the negotiation throughout, I’m not sure 
about that because…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay well you see there have been …[intervenes]. 
MS MEMELA:   Because I’m not sure even…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, hang on, Ms Memela, there have been 
issues where people have said the Commission is bothering them by 
sending them Rule 3.3 Notices when they are not implicated by 
witnesses but the Commission has said, you know, sometimes it’s clear 
that somebody’s just been mentioned as in not being implicated in 
anything but sometimes difficult to say and therefore just to be on the 
10 
safe side sometimes they send.  So – but it’s true to say, you know, the 
legal team needs to take a view whether somebody’s name being 
mentioned is sufficient to be implicated but I thought Ms Hofmeyr was 
making the point that the Bundle was made available to Ms Memela 
some time back? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, so Ms Memela received the full set of her 
bundles when she appeared for her evidence on Friday, so this has 
been in there since then.  The second point is that, as you’ve indicated 
Chair, all that happens in Ms Mbeki’s affidavit at this point, is she’s 
talking about who was attending meetings at what point.  That’s on it’s 
20 
face, certainly the view of the legal team was that, that did not 
implicate Ms Memela. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   It is arising from her evidence that there 
seems to be a dispute between her and Ms Mbeki but that is only 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 157 of 217 
 
something that we learn in the course of the evidence because it is as 
possible that when I put to Ms Memela, did you lead it, she might have 
said yes, she might have confirmed having been at more than one 
meeting but it’s in the course of the evidence that she says it was only 
at one meeting and then I draw her attention to the different version 
that Ms Mbeki has.  There’s no reason why Ms Memela can’t tells us 
she disagrees or the basis for why she disagrees. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And so I submit that we continue to look at Ms 
Mbeki’s affidavit. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Ms Memela? 
MS MBANJWA:   Thank you Chair I just want to point out, I see that 
every time there is a complaint from the Witness, Ms Hofmeyr raises 
the point, correctly from her perspective to say, you have had this 
bundle since Friday but let us be realistic, there is no human person 
who can be able to go through each and every item of these bundles if 
these bundles were given to a person or on Friday and I’m not wasting 
time Chair, I’m just putting it on record, even myself, ever since I came 
in back from Cape Town I started consulting, first on the videos, and I 
only had three hour’s sleep.  Yesterday I had two hour’s sleep because 
20 
we are receiving…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I had, only four. 
MS MBJANWA:   Yes Chairperson, maybe you even sleep less to be 
honest but all I’m trying to say – I’m saying irrespective of how little we 
sleep, these documents remain voluminous.  So it is a bit, maybe – I 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 158 of 217 
 
understand from the position she comes from because she is not in our 
position.  For instance, and I just also want to put it on record here, if 
you look at the manner in which the evidence is being presented on the 
first day it will go on GPU’s it is left, again on the second day it goes 
back to the GPU’s.  Even for me to concretised the evidence because it 
is being presented in such a jumbled manner, it’s going to be a problem 
and I’m raising these issues now so that when we complain later, we 
have placed them on record Chair, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Chair Ms Memela, until Friday morning was not 
10 
– her public indication was that she wasn’t going to be appearing on 
the morning of Friday that is the background to why the bundle is given 
to her on Friday morning and it’s since that point that there has been 
available access to it.  I fully understand Ms Mbanjwa’s point that the 
documents are voluminous, they are we’ve had to get on top of them 
similarly and deal with things at quite a rate as additional statements – 
for example, Ms Memela’s cross-examination applications, responses 
came in, in the course of last week.  I don’t intend to belabour the point 
there are one or two aspects of Ms Mbeki’s affidavit that I’d like to put 
to Ms Memela, if she believes she’s not in a position to answer them, 
20 
she can give that answer but it’s really one or two further matters, if 
you give me leave to so? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that’s fine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You understand that Ms Memela? 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 159 of 217 
 
MS MEMELA:   Yes Chair I will take the...[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you are not able to answer, you, don’t remember or 
you need time to refresh your memory, you know. 
MS MEMELA:   Chair I will take the question but I feel that – remember 
I was affirmed that this was the fact-finding mission but as we continue 
and with all these new affidavits coming to me and before getting the 
Rule 3.3 that you mentioned, that you’re being the leader of the 
negotiation, I feel everything about this ARJM is being pointed at me, 
that – because, like I’m being asked about like my support for the 
Board, what did I think and stuff and while I am still focusing on that 
10 
how do I – and then there is here that I’m leading the negotiation.  So 
that’s why I was confused that leading the negotiation, does it mean 
that I’m the one whose running with the negotiation discussing them 
with the other lawyer from the other side, or was Ms Mbeki the one who 
was drafting and negotiating the agreement because that was my 
understanding that when Gugu was brought in SAAT…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well let me say something to you about the question 
of whether you were leading the negotiations or the team, that’s what I 
understand Ms Mbeki’s affidavit to say but if you are asked the 
question, were you the leader of that team, you given an answer based 
20 
on your own concept of the understanding of the concept of being a 
leader.  If you say, as far as I’m concerned I was not the leader of that 
team because if you look at the number of meetings that were attended, 
I attended less than 20% of the meetings and the people were not 
reporting to me.  So you give your own understanding to say, I don’t 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 160 of 217 
 
know what she has in mind, namely, Ms Mbeki but as far as I’m 
concerned I was not the leader, this was the position. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, because until now, Chair, I’m learning as if maybe 
Ms Mbeki was not independent enough to draft or negotiate or review 
the contract on her own and…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if as far as you know, she was the leader of the 
team, then you should say, as far as I know she was the leader.  If it 
was somebody else, you say so. 
MS MEMELA:   She was leading the negotiations from the legal point of 
view. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MEMELA:   And like she was taking care of the legal framework and 
I remember during – as I said that I was there in the first meeting, and 
my understanding was that the reason why it was put, like, it was for 
her and the lawyer from AR to work on the template of the contract that 
was going to be worked on going forward and then once that is cleared 
out, with Mike and other people that were there that will be talking 
about the technical/commercial part of the contract then she will 
continue independently with the legal team of ARJM.  Ja so know it’s as 
if now it’s – I don’t know, maybe I’m interpreting it wrong…[intervenes]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no all I’m saying is that just because somebody 
is saying something about you that is not true, that doesn’t mean it 
should be a problem, you can say that’s not true at least on my 
understanding, that’s not the position this is the position as far as I’m 
concerned.  Okay alright, let’s move on. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 161 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Ms Mbeki refers to the second day 
of that second set of meetings at page 4-7-3 and she indicates at 
paragraph 25 there, that during the contract negotiation process – this 
is paragraph 25, there were a lot of instances where there was 
…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that 25 of her affidavit? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed Chair at page 4-7-3. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   She says,  
 
“there 
were 
a 
lot 
of 
instances 
where 
there 
were 
10 
 
disagreements between the SAAT team and the JMAAR team 
 
on some issues, some of the disagreements were so bad that 
 
I was accused by the JMAAR team of deliberately delaying 
 
the conclusion of the contract and frustrating the process.  
 
They told me that I keep on raising issues and/or concerns 
 
which are already discussed and agreed to with the SAAT 
 
team.  I was even reported to my superiors for allegedly 
 
frustrating the process and causing a discord among the 
 
negotiating team.   
 
I do not know when, what, how or to whom I was reported.  I 
20 
 
only came to the realisation that I was reported when Ms 
 
Shabalala informed me that Advocate Memela said she must 
 
tell me to call her urgently.  This happened on the 2 n d day 
 
and as I stated in paragraph 20, Advocate Memela did not 
 
attend the meeting that day.  Upon receiving the message 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 162 of 217 
 
 
from Ms Shabalala I called Advocate Memela, during the 
 
telephone conversation/discussion, Advocate Memela told me 
 
that she’d received a complaint, that I keep on raising issues 
 
which were already discussed before I joined the team the 
 
previous day and that as a result of my conduct the 
 
discussions were taking longer than necessary.   
 
She also told me that this concern was also raised with the 
 
then Chief Executive Officer of SAAT who was also the Acting 
 
Group Chief Executive, Mr Musa Zwane.  I admitted that I 
 
indeed had been alerted by the team that a lot of the issues 
10 
 
that I was raising were already raised, discussed and 
 
resolved the previous day”, 
 
Do you recall that conversation that Ms Mbeki said you and 
she had? 
MS MEMELA:   I don’t remember Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And she goes on and talks about the remainder 
of the negotiations and her role in them.  She particularly exercises the 
points in the contract that she was fighting for, being retained and then 
she tells us what happened in the final sing-off of the agreement.  
There are just two aspects I’d like to draw your attention to there, and 
20 
for that purposes you’ll have to go back to page 4-7-2 at paragraph 23. 
MS MEMELA:   Page 4-7-2. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Apologies Chair I see Ms Mbanjwa would like 
to make a comment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Ms Mbanjwa. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 163 of 217 
 
MS MBANJWA:   Thank you Chair, it’s not an objection but I just want – 
my apologies Chair, I’m still far.  This is not an objection but because 
the idea is a fact finding of this Commission, I’m just drawing the 
attention of Ms Hofmeyr to the fact that she has read from this 
paragraph selectively and with your permission Chair, I just want to 
point out that she must read the paragraph to the end, because what 
has been left out is also very important and if I can just include it 
quickly…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on that quite appropriate for re-examination 
where you say, your – she might not be an opponent in a Commission 
10 
set-up but you point it out in re-examination and you direct the 
attention of the witness to the whole part that should have been read. 
MS MBANJWA:   Thank you Chair, I don’t want to be wrong on this, I 
just want Chair to take it into account in conducting these proceedings.  
I am trying to avoid objections because it wastes time now I’m saying to 
my colleague, because if my colleague is going to read documents take 
the prejudicial part and leave out the favourable part, it means 
therefore, that when I re-examine I’m going to technically re-examine 
on every document that she has presented to this Commission.  
Whereas it would be very easy, if for instance, she could have included 
20 
what the admission is because if one looks at that paragraph it says 
that Ms Memela complained about the fact that Ms Mbeki was causing 
frustration because she was re-visiting things that had already been 
done.  But there’s a very important caveat to that, it says,  
 
“I admitted that indeed I have been elected by the team that a 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 164 of 217 
 
 
lot of the issues I was raising were already raised, discussed 
 
and resolved the previous day’, 
 
Therefore, there will be no need for me to re-examine because 
the paragraph itself contains the concession. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I understand what you say but let’s try – make a 
note and raise it in re-examination, issues like that because the more 
we have an interruption to talk about them, the more the delay whereas 
if she ends up not covering it, I will allow you to cover that to say, 
there is a part where she read only a certain part and left out a certain 
part, that’s important for the witness’s evidence.  So make a note and I 
10 
will allow you. 
MS MBANJWA:   Chair I’m not being – this is the last statement I’m 
making.  I am saying Chair, if the documents presented to the 
Commission by Ms Hofmeyr were read in their fullness, including where 
the fullness will reveal the fact that the documents are not blaming Ms 
Memela that would save time because then I would not have to re-
examine on those documents, like for instance, this is a very crisp 
example.  Here is a document where an accusation is being made 
against Ms Memela, but that accusation has already, in it, a concession 
then Ms Hofmeyr deliberately doesn’t read the concession so that she 
20 
takes only the accusation, which therefore means I’m going to waste 
time because then I must...[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see she might, for the question that she was 
posing, she will talk for herself, she might not have seen that part as 
particularly important but you representing the witness, might see it’s 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 165 of 217 
 
importance.  So that’s why I’m saying it might have not have been 
deliberate but it’s fine she’ll talk for herself, but I’m emphasising that, 
make a note you get a chance when you re-examine to say, let’s go to 
that page, Ms Hofmeyr read only up to this point before you answered, 
here is another point and then the witness can then deal with that. 
MS MBANJWA:   Thank you for your patience.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   The transcript will bear out that I read that last 
10 
sentence of the paragraph, I was absolutely scrupulous to ensure that I 
read the entire paragraph 25 and I included the last sentence that Ms 
Mbanjwa has just said publically, I deliberately omitted, I read it out, 
and the transcript, when we get it tomorrow will reflect that. 
CHAIRPERSON: Yes, thank you.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Let us then move to what she says about the 
aspects that she emphasised in the course of the negotiations.  One of 
the things that Ms Mbeki was…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe, Ms Hofmeyr, I see we’re at half past three. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   If we are not going to adjourn at four, it might well be 
that we should talk now or if we are going to adjourn or not.  I know 
that it’s been difficult to keep to the timeframes that we were all hoping 
to keep.  How far are you from finishing? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I have two more pages of notes to cover. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 166 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that should – absent questions from me and 
assuming Ms Memela gives crisp answers as she did…[intervenes]. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes and there aren’t objections and comments 
I would imagine about twenty minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   About twenty minutes? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And can I just be clear, I’m not suggesting by 
my answer that there shouldn’t be interruptions, I’m just endeavouring 
to give a timeframe on the only basis I can, which is what I can control.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no that’s fine and then once you are done, which 
it looks like will be around 4 o’ clock. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Have 
you 
and 
Ms 
Mbanjwa 
talked 
about 
what…[intervenes]. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   We have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What could happen after that, subject to my 
approval? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed, it was always subject to your approval 
Chair but I did confirm with Ms Mbanjwa if she and Ms Memela are in a 
20 
position to stay later than four, she did indicate to me that they were, 
they’ve travelled together so that they can both remain to beyond 4 o’ 
clock.  It would be our suggestion that we do use additional time, my 
grave concern is that we haven’t even commenced Mr Nzeko’s evidence 
today.  So my proposal would be, I complete by four, then we move to 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 167 of 217 
 
the re-examination that Ms Mbanjwa would like to conduct and we take 
that as far as we can.  It would also be our suggestion that we try and start 
a bit earlier tomorrow because it is a short day, so that we can get as far 
into Mr Ndzeku’s evidence as possible.  Those are our proposals. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, we can go beyond four, but unlike was it yesterday?  
Ja, unlike yesterday when I could have gone up to six I do not think that I 
could go beyond five today.  But the question arises if we can only go up to 
five, how much can we cover? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Well, Miss Mbanjwa’s indication yesterday was that 
she would probably need about two hours for re-examination [intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   She said much more, she wanted a good day.  I was the 
one [intervenes]. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And you confined her sorry.  Apologies you 
absolutely right, but whatever amounted time you permit it would be my 
suggestion that using an hour beyond 4 o’clock to make some serious 
headway in the re-examination would be conducive [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, it would be. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Mr Ndzeku does need to start tomorrow in his 
evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, how long is Mr Ndzeku likely to take once he has 
20 
started? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   You know, Mr Ndzeku we do not have a statement 
or affidavit from, so and we still have not got an affidavit that has been 
promised to us for a week from his co-director in JM Aviation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 168 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   But I was told by my learned friend that by lunch 
time it should have been coming through sometime this afternoon.  I do not 
know if it has come through yet.  Based on the areas that I proposed 
traversing with Mr Ndzeku, I should imagine half a day would be adequate 
for his evidence.  That is why I am particularly keen to start tomorrow and 
hopefully finish. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if we, if Miss Mbanjwa starts all that about, we can 
go up to five and I agree that whatever we can use should be used.  Then if 
we start at, I do not know if we could start at nine, but maybe we can start 
at half past nine.  Then if it is another hour that takes to half past ten or 
10 
depending when we start at let us say up to eleven.  That leaves us with 
very little time for Mr Ndzeku before I become unavailable.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So I have my reservations whether we would finish 
with Mr Ndzeku even if we started with him, and if we will not finish, if we 
are unlikely to finish it may well be that an alternative arrangement should 
be considered because he would have to come back anyway.  And then 
attempts will be made to make sure that on the day he comes back he 
finishes on that day but one can never be hundred percent sure about these 
things.  So that is what is going on in my mind rather than start with him 
20 
tomorrow and not finish.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes. Understood Chair, indeed.  The only challenge 
will be that we have an absolutely full schedule next week.  There will be no 
period within next week to slot him in. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, we previously talked on the basis that we would not 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 169 of 217 
 
sit on Friday. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There may be a possibility that maybe we could sit from 
sometime about maybe after lunch or thereabout, but it may be that we 
might not need to do that if we can find another day [intervenes]. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Another day 
CHAIRPERSON:    Within Feb, when Mr Ndzeku can then come back. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Chair why do I not do this, why do we not proceed 
with Miss Memela.  I can then have engagements with Mr Ndzeku’s legal 
team at the conclusion of today.  Because whatever happens Mr Ndzeku’s 
10 
not starting today and then we can come back to you with a proposal for his 
evidence.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay let us do that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So if we can then just continue to round this off.  
Miss Memela one of the things that Miss Mbheki says she was pushing for in 
the negotiations, and you will find this at page 472 at paragraph 23.  Was 
the inclusion of a penalties clause in favour of SAAT?  Now we have looked 
at the contract previously in the evidence and we had the evidence of Mr 
Human about this.  That penalties clause was not ultimately incorporated in 
the contract.  Do you know what, it is a penalty clause in favour of SAAT.  
20 
There is certainly a penalties clause that if SAAT does not perform then JM 
or AAR have penalties levied against SAAT.  But there is no concomitant 
penalties clause against JM or AAR.  Can you help us with insight as to why 
that proposal of Miss Mbheki’s was not carried through in the contract? 
MS MEMELA:   Proposal to which Chair? 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 170 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   In the course of the negotiations of the contract? 
MS MEMELA:   I am not sure Chair because my understanding is that the 
only time when she was asked about why was the penalty clause not in the 
contract.  She was asked by Airbus when I was Acting the Chief Procurement 
Officer at SAA.  And then she defended and stated like which provision, that 
she had, but she had never to me said Boss, this is what happened.  I was 
raising this point.  It was kicked away or something like that.  So I am not 
aware of it.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And did you take any steps to ensure in the 
contract negotiations that there would be a penalty clause in favour of 
10 
SAAT? 
MS MEMELA:   Me? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MS MEMELA:   Okay Chair, Cookie, Miss Mbheki when she negotiate and 
drafts and reviews contracts, she does that since like she has been, she was 
what, appointed specifically for that, she does that independently without 
me.  So me taking a contract from her and checking it, like that was, that 
has never been a norm, like okay I must check and finalize even in her sign-
off form, sometimes when she finalize a contract she takes it to certain 
people, not to me to sign it off, because remember now I will be, we will be 
20 
doing a duplicate work.  She is a lawyer, I am a lawyer, so I am yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So what steps did you take in the contract 
negotiations to make sure that SAAT’s interests were protected? 
MS MEMELA:   Okay I did not negotiate the contract Chair.  The contract 
was negotiated by Miss Cookie Mbheki for legal framework.  
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 171 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So you did not play a role in the negotiations? 
MS MEMELA:   I did not play a role except when that first day Chair where 
you said it was put on the projector and then the provisions were put down 
of what should be in the contract and then like all the people that she listed 
in her affidavit were sitting there. 
We looked at the projector.  It was not something that me, as her 
boss like would be, ja, because I know she was doing that, one thing I do 
not know, I do not micro manage.  All the Senior Managers that reported to 
me were doing their job independently, except when there is something they 
need my support.  Because my understanding she was quite strong and 
10 
knowledgeable in terms of negotiating and I showed her my support from the 
first day when we were sitting there, it was I remember like she was 
supporting the view that maybe, in fact I supported her on that, the view that 
maybe the JV or maybe what the JM Aviation should be an annexure to the 
contract.  And the other point that I remember that she made, was like to 
make sure that the low-balling that the CFST had raised in terms of like 
AAR.  She had put or she had forced AAR to agree to a certain provision 
that talks to capping or putting like I mean keeping fix the price until 2018 if 
I remember correctly.  So like those were the provisions like I mean she 
discussed with me and I supported her.  So, I do not know maybe Miss 
20 
Hofmeyr did not understand our structure and stuff that certain things does 
not really come to me for my finalisation because Miss Cookie Mbekhi is not 
a junior lawyer. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No, but she was junior to you in the structure of 
SAAT, is that correct? 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 172 of 217 
 
MS MEMELA:   She was junior to me but like I mean SAAT was heading her 
legal and contracts management unit.  According to me as H.O.D.  
Remember like I actually read the portfolios that I was heading.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So she reported to you but at no point prior to this 
agreement being concluded did you satisfy yourself as to its contents.  Is 
that right? 
MS MEMELA:   I am saying Chair, I mean I was I gave her the independence 
to negotiate because I know her when she is not happy about something she 
will come to me in fact for like I mean ask if she needs my support.  So that 
is why I am saying like I am surprised with the issue of the penalties that 
10 
she said she was pushing for penalties and then she was not allowed but 
like she is not saying by who did not allow her I am surprised because this 
was raised by Airbus and she and the meeting was between myself her and 
Airbus and she had already moved to SAA at that time. 
 So she never raised this as something like she was not allowed 
she had pushed for it in fact she defended that okay but, even if this is not 
there still I mean there is this provision that are protecting SAAT. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So can I just get clear on the evidence you did not 
satisfy yourself as to the content of the agreement before it was signed on 
the 7th of July 2016.  Is that correct? 
20 
MS MEMELA:   I did not check or maybe finalise the contract because it was 
not negotiated by me. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And do you know that Miss Mbekhi did not get to 
check the contract either before it was signed? 
MS MEMELA:   I do not remember that. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 173 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Her evidence at page 475 at paragraph 29 of 
DD25(B) was the following  
MS MEMELA:   The page? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   475 it is a few pages on in her affidavit and I pick it 
up at paragraph 29.  She says: 
“On the 7th of July 2016 my plan was to arrange a 
meeting with the SAAT team members to go through 
the agreement clause by clause as I usually do.  I was 
not aware that the agreement had already been signed 
until about midday on 7th July 2016 when one of the 
10 
other SAAT team members informed me that the 
agreement had already been signed.  I cannot 
remember whether was Mr. Vosloo or Mr. Kenny who 
informed me about the signing of the contract.  Upon 
hearing that the agreement is signed I then stopped 
reviewing it.  I did also not go ahead with the plan of 
arranging a meeting with the other team members to 
further deliberate on the agreement because the said 
agreement had already been signed.” 
Who arranged for the signing of the agreement Miss Memela? 
20 
MS MEMELA:   Chair, I would not know remember the signing of agreement 
share will be arranged by the person who was working on the agreement 
naturally.  So I am not sure like who [intervenes]. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So, it was not Miss Mbekhi, who could it have 
been? 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 174 of 217 
 
MS MEMELA:   No, I do not know because like I am seeing this evidence 
now I do not know if she said she was not the one [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You would have expected her to have been the one. 
MS MEMELA:   She should have been the one because remember she was 
the one who was negotiating with the legal person from AAR so I do not 
understand why at what point that [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it seems strange that if she was the leader from the 
legal point of view in the negotiations of the contract it seems strange that 
while the leader legal team so to speak who was to advise whether the 
contract is ready for signing while she was reviewing looking at the contract 
10 
clause by clause somebody decided it should be signed. 
MS MEMELA:   Ja 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   You have no knowledge about that. 
MS MEMELA:   I have no knowledge about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   She goes on in her affidavit to explain the standard 
practice that she follows to ensure that there is proper review when she said 
she had no opportunity to do that.  But, I take it that your evidence says you 
do not know how that signing was arranged. Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:   Ja, I do not know Chair. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I would like to pick up on my final point before 
concluding aspects [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that I am sorry that has to be taken to also mean that 
you were not at the signing of the, did not attend the signing of the 
agreement. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 175 of 217 
 
MS MEMELA:   I do not remember Chair can we if the contract is here can I 
be directed to it? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I want to look at this signature page. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, certainly.  I just put it away, I am sorry I have, 
where were we? Right, we were in  
CHAIRPERSON:   The signatures are at 489 490 491 is that right, or am I in 
on a different contract? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   There are two contracts and I just want to be sure 
that we are not in the wrong one.  One is the Swissport and the other is the 
components and I literally just have it in front of me. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Let me find it, Chair. Oh here we go, here we go, 
here we go.  Alright sorry.  Apologies.  It is DD22(F) and you are not 
reflected on the signature page Miss Memela I will take you to it the 
agreement commences there at 2318 
MS MEMELA:   2318? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   2318 and you will find a signature page at 2333. 
MS MEMELA:   Oh, which bundle? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   At DD22(F). 
MS MEMELA:   22(F)? 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MS MEMELA:   Ja, page? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   The signature page is two triple three 2333. There 
is no indication on that page that you were signatory to the agreement, do 
you see that? 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 176 of 217 
 
MS MEMELA:   I just want to go to the first 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, the first page is 2318. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is interesting that there were no witnesses to the 
signing of this contract. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed, Chair.  The other thing that is noteworthy.  I 
will take you to some of the clauses, the clauses are very oddly numbered.  
If you go to for example to page 2325 where I am actually going to pick it up 
you have got a heading there for pricing and payment sorry at 2325 you 
have got clause four there pricing and payment and then the first sub clause 
is 4.23.  This is it is all over this agreement. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Which does seem to lend some credence to the 
notion that this was rushed towards the end because these would have been 
points presumably that Miss Mbekhi would have picked up on.  So it is very 
strangely arranged.  Miss Memela I would like to take you next to 2325 
because there is a particular clause there that is the last aspect I would like 
to deal with you in evidence. 
MS MEMELA:   Hmm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Do you have 2325?   
MS MEMELA:   Sorry, 23? 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   2325. 
MS MEMELA:   Oh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Miss Memela just before we get to this clause we 
dealt with Mr Kenny’s affidavit in the evidence of Mr Human that was an 
affidavit where there was an implication in respect of you, and so you 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 177 of 217 
 
received a 3-3 notice.  Mr Kenny indicated that after the contract was 
concluded he attended a meeting with you at which he requested to be given 
a copy of the full contract and you said to him he could only have the page 
relevant to him and he makes the allegation that you had said that was to 
protect him.  Do you have a response to that? 
MS MEMELA:   Chair my understanding of Mr Kenny’s affidavit, it was 
referring to the collaboration agreement.  Yes that was [intervenes]. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No it was referring to the components agreement 
but do you have a recollection of a meeting with him at which you said that 
he should not be given a full copy of the agreement [intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe let us go to that document, I mean that is what 
Miss Mbanjwa and Miss Memela would like.  Let us go to where he says that.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I just need to find which one it is going to be in.  It 
is in G.  It is in 22(G), ah yes.   
MS MEMELA:   22(G)? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   22(G) and you pick it up, apologies, Mr Kenny’s 
affidavit begins at 3150.  That is where the affidavit starts and the relevant 
paragraph I am referring to is at page 3155.  So we are in DD22 (G) and we 
are at page 3155.  This is in Mr Kenny’s affidavit.  And in paragraph 23 on 
that page, I will just read it into the record, he says: 
20 
“At one of the Exco meetings after the agreement with 
AAR, JM Aviation had been signed, I asked to be 
provided with a copy.  Miss Memela told me I could not 
be given a copy of the full contract and would only be 
given a part of it.  I took issue with this and asked why 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 178 of 217 
 
I could not be given the whole contract and Miss 
Memela said that it was to protect me.  I did not 
understand what that meant at the time and I still do 
not understand what she was conveying.  I have never 
seen the full contract.”  
Do you have a response to that? 
MS MEMELA:   Chair, I think I may have read, oh I have not responded to 
this affidavit, I think.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No you have not provided any statement or 
anything but we have the opportunity now just to ask you now what your 
10 
response is. 
MS MEMELA:   No, I do not remember this discussion with Mr Kenny.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Did you receive [intervenes]. 
MS MEMELA:   Was it a verbal discussion, written discussion? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   He says he asked to be provided with a copy 
[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja I think he says it was at a meeting. 
MS MEMELA:   It was? 
CHAIRPERSON:   He says it was at a meeting  
MS MEMELA:   At a meeting 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of Exco, if I 
MS MEMELA:   At Exco? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So it would have been verbal. Ja. He says at one of the 
Exco meetings after the agreement with AAR stroke JM Aviation had been 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 179 of 217 
 
signed.  
MS MEMELA:   Chair, I am, I have raised this concern again before, I feel 
that I do not know, I may be wrong, the way people are writing about 
Nonsasa to an extent, where even Mr Human, Skalk Human, who has never 
set eyes on me has something to say about me.  I am not sure if they are 
being guided or something, but like I will just like answer the part where it is 
not even possible that MR Kenny, remember first of all I do not manage 
contracts.  There is no way that like he will ask me for the signed contract 
especially during Exco meeting that is chaired by Mr Assan Malolo Phiri, 
who was an acting CEO who signed the contract.  You understand like I 
10 
mean I am not sure why he would ask me specifically for the contract 
instead of asking Mr Assan Malolo Phiri the signatory to the contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well he may, he may have asked you because he says in 
another paragraph of his affidavit, paragraph 21, the page before the one 
where there is paragraph 23, she says you and Miss Mbheki were 
responsible for the legal aspects during these negotiations with Miss Mbheki 
taking the lead on the drafting.  So she [intervenes]. 
MS MEMELA:   So you see [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where you said Miss Mbheki was as far as you are 
concerned supposed to be the leader of drafting maybe part of what he says 
20 
here supports that. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But he does say that you and Miss Mbheki were 
responsible for the legal aspects or during the negotiations.  Maybe that is 
why he was asking you for a copy.  
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 180 of 217 
 
MS MEMELA:   But Chair, Mike knows that I only managed contracts when I 
was holding Miss Mbheki’s position.  Legal and contracts manager.  So there 
is no way he will ask me because from procurement now I was not managing 
any contracts, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
MS MEMELA:   That was the role of Miss Mbheki and I am saying now since 
Miss Mbheki, in fact Miss Mbheki was taking part in Exco when Mr Zwane 
had gone and acted at SAA.  So I am saying with Miss Mbheki there and Mr 
Assan Malolo Phiri they being the signatory of the contract.  Both in 
attendance in Exco and then he specifically asked for the copy of the 
10 
contract from me.  Chair no, it just does not add up, ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Miss Memela did you ever receive yourself a copy 
of the contract after it was signed? 
MS MEMELA:   I think during the time there was where we were supposed to 
go to U.K. and oh no no, in fact before that.  When Air France took SAAT to 
court so we had to get a copy, it is just that I do not remember where we got 
the copy from, but we had to get all those copies, as much as we had to get 
the tender documentation from the CFST to respond to National Treasury, to 
respond to Miss Dudu Myeni, who was also asking questions about the 
award and stuff, ja.  
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So you do recall at some point because that 
litigation was actually quite shortly after the award was it not? 
MS MEMELA:   It was shortly after the award, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So it would have been around the time of the 
conclusion of the contract then that you did get a full copy? 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 181 of 217 
 
MS MEMELA:   It will have been around the time when we were preparing to 
defend the matter in court.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I would then like to [Intervenes]. 
MS MEMELA:   Sorry Miss Hofmeyr I just, because this is written it is still 
about AAR and JM.  Can I direct you to DD25(B). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat what you are saying? When you do that part 
of what you say, we cannot hear. 
MS MEMELA:   Exhibit DD25(D) that is my file Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, what do you want us to look at? 
MS MEMELA:   I would like us to go to page 487 of that file. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Is that in response, to respond to a question? 
MS MEMELA:   I am trying to see what is this documentation? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which documentation? 
MS MEMELA:   The one on page 487 Chair of DD25. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   It is an annexure to Miss Mbheki’s affidavit. 
MS MEMELA:   Is this part of the contract or? Let me [intervenes]. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No it is not, Miss Mbheki explains what it is at page 
469 in paragraph 17 
20 
MS MEMELA:   four six nine? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   She says in the meeting on 3 June 2016, the team 
discussed the binding agreement to enter into definitive documentation.  The 
said agreement is dated 3 June 2016, for ease of reference see annexure 3. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But why do you want us to go there Miss Memela?  
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 182 of 217 
 
Because we are still with Mr Kenny’s affidavit. 
MS MEMELA:   No, no, no, I was just like still, my mind is still in the AAR 
contract, there being signed and then I see this one.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us, Miss Hofmeyr is about to finish her 
questions, let your mind come back. 
MS MEMELA:   Okay, sorry Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Miss Memela I wanted to draw your attention to one 
of the provisions of the signed agreement which you have confirmed for us 
you did see at a point when the litigation was being pursued by Air France, 
and you will find that in DD22 at page 2325.  
10 
MS MEMELA:   Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   It was the one I drew your attention to a moment 
ago.  This is a clause that we dealt with in Mr Human’s evidence and the 
clause that is relevant is Clause 4.26 at the bottom of that page.  And I 
would just like us to look at it because there is going to be a series of 
questions that flow from it so it will be useful just to have it in the front of 
our minds.  What it says at 4.26 is: 
“Prior to the commencement date JM AAR will invoice 
SAAT for the deposit.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, are you at 2325? 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I am at 2 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Apologies Chair 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you at 2325? 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 183 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I am at 2325 and I am reading from the last clause 
on that page 4.26 [Intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Apologies.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Actually, we may. Oh no, okay let us continue because I 
think you were close to finishing [Intervenes].  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I am indeed 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am not putting pressure on you [Intervenes].  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No,no,no.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just that I was thinking whether there should be an 
10 
adjournment but let us finish first and then we can take it from there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I think Miss Mbanjwa would like to say something. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Miss Mbanjwa would you like to say something? 
MS MBANJWA:   No, not really.  It is a personal thing Chair [Intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh  
MS MBANJWA:   I want to just get a quick comfort break and come back just 
now.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay, no.  That is fine, let us do that.  Ten minutes? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is ten minutes fine? 
20 
MS MBANJWA:   It is more than enough. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us just say ten minutes.  So we will resume at 
quarter past.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair 
CHAIRPERSON:   We are adjourned.  
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 184 of 217 
 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  We were going to look at clause 
4.26 on page 2325 of Exhibit DD22F.  And because it is going to frame the 
next set of questions, I propose just to read the clause into the record.  It 
provides the following; 
Prior to the commencement date JM/AAR will invoice SAAT for the deposit.  
SAAT will pay the deposit by way of irrevocable stand by letter of credit from 
10 
a bank acceptable to JM/AAR and in a form to agree to by JM/AAR. 
The parties agree that; 
4.26.1 
JM/AAR will have the right to set off 
any SAAT invoices not paid by its due date against the 
deposit. 
4.26.2 
SAAT 
shall 
when 
necessary 
throughout the term of this agreement replenish the deposit 
to maintain the amount invoiced by JM/AAR prior to the 
commencement date. 
4.26.3 
At 
the 
time 
of 
expiration 
of 
20 
termination of this agreement JM/AAR will arrange for the 
release of the deposit to the extend that SAAT has paid all 
outstanding invoices. 
Ms Memela, you had a copy of the agreement at the time 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 185 of 217 
 
around which it was signed and the litigation.  Did you have cause to look 
and consider this particular clause? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  No, I did not Chair.  I do know that from the- that 
first meeting that I was referring to, the deposit was part of the condition’s 
precedence between both parties.  And there was conditions precedent for 
SAAT as well and as much as there was conditions precedent for the other 
party.  So that was discussed on the first meeting. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But what was concluded was actually an 
arrangement whereby there will be an irrevocable standby letter of credit 
from a bank which would serve the purpose of the deposit.  Is that not 
10 
correct? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  According to the contract, yes that is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  So, then I would like to just follow up on what 
happened with the payment of cash to AAR because what starts to happen in 
September of 2016 is that it appears that AAR starts to raise the issue of 
why it has not been paid a deposit.  Do you recall that? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  I recall Chair that they were not paid because 
SAAT was not in a good financial space I think so SAAT could not pay that.  
But I think the person who can answer that better will be the CFO of the 
company. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well there is quite a bit of correspondence involving 
you so that is why I would like to take you to that. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And we can commence that in your file DD25B at 
page 649.2.   
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 186 of 217 
 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Page? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  649.2 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  So, 649.2 the first of the emails in this email 
chain is in the second half of that page.   
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is an email from Ms Phumeza Nhantsi, who was 
she? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Phumeza Nhantsi Chair is the- was the former 
Group Chief financial Officer of SAA. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair you will recall we had Ms Nhantsi give 
evidence in June of last year before the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I was trying to remember whether ... (intervenes) 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You remember? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The name is the same. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is indeed.  And she sends and email to Mr Michael 
Klein and Dev Arya and it is copied to yourself and Mr Musa Zwane.  Is that 
correct? 
20 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  She sends the email to Michael Klein being the- 
from what do you call this?  It is the department reports to finance from SAA 
but just for- Treasury Department and then Mr Dev Arya- I thought I should 
explain since Ms Hofmeyr wanted me to explain also Phumeza Nhantsi that I 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 187 of 217 
 
should explain others as well thereon.  And then Dev Arya is the CFO- was 
the CFO of SAAT. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then it is copied to yourself and Mr Zwane, is 
that correct? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And it is dated the 29 th of September 2016? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes, that is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And just to read into the record what Ms Nhantsi 
says on that email.  She says;  
Good day, my understanding from the discussion that I had with the ACEO- I 
10 
take that to be Acting CEO – AAR now wants us to pay them 1 month deposit 
which is equivalent to 1 million US dollars.  We can make the payment if you 
can facilitate the paperwork.   
As I understand that it is part of their policy that we should pay a deposit 
which we did to the previous service provider.   
 
And then the next email in response is from Mr Klein to Ms Nhantsi, 
Mr Arya and copied again to yourself and Mr Zwane.  It is on the same day a 
little bit later.  And Mr Klein says;  
Dear all, please discuss with AAR the possibility to replace the cash security 
deposit with a bank guarantee or standby letter of credit sometime in the 
20 
future.  If it is not currently a clause in the agreement.  It is a standard 
clause we have introduced into aircraft lease agreements as well. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Mm-hmm. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 188 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then if you go back a page to page 649.1 you 
will see your response to that group of recipients.  Could you read into the 
record what you said in response to Mr Klein? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  From page 6.- 649.1? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes, at the bottom there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  We will do Michael.  All I remember during 
the negotiations we fought against this and they confirmed that this is part 
of their policy.  Unfortunately, we could not walk away and automatically 
10 
disqualify them because the deposit or lack thereof was never part of our 
tender requirement.   
So, we can safely say that Air France one would have been a better deal as 
this deposit is still part of the price in the contract.  We still stand to save a 
significant saving out of this.  Thanks Michael. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela why did you not respond to Mr Klein and 
say, no, no, it is not a problem.  The agreement does actually only make 
provision for an irrevocable standby letter of credit? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Mm?  Why did I not say- sorry, can you repeat 
that? 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because what Mr Klein is saying is he saying; we 
are now being asked to pay cash of 1 million US dollars and he says to you 
at page 649.2;  
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 189 of 217 
 
Please discuss with AAR the possibility to replace the cash security deposit 
with a bank guarantee or a standby letter of credit sometime in the future is 
it is not currently a clause in the agreement, right.   
And your response to him was;  
Reflecting on the negotiations and that you fought hard and ... (intervenes) 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  No, the first on before the negotiations say, we 
will do Michael. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes.  Meaning we will check what he said should 
be checked.   
10 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Oh, so you did check, did you? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  No, no, I am say- you say why did I not just- that 
is why I am saying Chair the response to Michael was, we will do Michael. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  And then I just went on to explain to him as I 
was saying it was part of the condition’s precedent.  I remember this 
because it was discussed in that meeting. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  First meeting so I went just through that because 
20 
he is sitting at Treasury at SAE that is why I had to explain who is who so 
that he understands the background. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 190 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  Thank you.  So sorry, I did misunderstand.  
So then did you go and check the agreement? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  I will not remember right now.  Remember ... 
(intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you are- you ... (intervenes) 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  When I say ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on one second. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But is my understanding correct that that what you have 
just said is that you were saying, you will check the agreement? 
10 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  I said we. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja we. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  We will do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  We will do. That involves the CFO ... 
(intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Checking of the agreement. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Of SAAT because he is the- no, he said we must 
check with AAR. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mm. 
20 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  If the replacement of ja and that is the financial- 
what, topic.  Ja, so my understanding, that will be done through finance not 
me checking directly.  So, I am not sure if I checked that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Sorry, but I understood you to emphasise a moment 
ago in response that you said, we will do that. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 191 of 217 
 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes.  I was reading that because you were 
focusing on the negotiations only.  So, I am saying I did respond to Michael.  
Because you were saying why did I not respond and say this.  So, I am 
saying I did say, we will do Michael. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.   
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So, what did you do? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  I do not remember.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You do not remember? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  No. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  Oh, there seems to be a comment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh Ms Mbanjwa, you had your hand up.  I did not see it. 
MS L MBANJWA:  Oh, sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I did not see it but okay yes. 
MS L MBANJWA:  Yes, sorry Chair that I should have waited for you.  No 
Chair, I am just correcting.  What I think is going to confuse Ms Memela.  
What Ms Hofmeyr started by doing was to read from volume DD22 2325 and 
that is the agreement.  So, she directed our attention to clause 4.26 which is 
already an agreement that is there.  And that agreement does have a clause 
that says;  
20 
prior to the commencement date JM/AAR will invoice SAAT for the deposit.  
SAAT will pay the deposit by way of an irrevocable standby letter of credit 
from a bank acceptable to JM/AAR and in a form agreed to by JM/AAR.   
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 192 of 217 
 
 
So that clause is there.  Now this other document which is Exhibit 
DD25B Ms Memela’s bundle if I could call it that.  There is that letter in ... 
(intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Next time you check just check and stop speaking and 
come back to the mic and speak.  Because when they transcribe there will 
be a lot of inaudible for during the time when you were looking at the file. 
MS L MBANJWA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So then not everything you say will be captured in terms of 
the transcript. 
MS L MBANJWA:  Thank you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.   
MS L MBANJWA:  I can continue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Continue ja. 
MS L MBANJWA:  Then in this bundle DD25 page 649.2 there is that email 
from Michael Klein dated the 29 September which says;  
please discuss with AAR the possibility to replace the cash security deposit 
with a bank guarantee or standby letter of credit sometime.   
 
So, what I am trying to point out is that that clause for 4.26 already 
provides for substitution of a cash security deposit with a bank guarantee or 
a standby letter of credit.  So, why I am scared that Ms Memela is being 
20 
asked to answer is because what she- what Ms Hofmeyr is saying she 
should have checked is something which is already in that agreement.  It is 
there.  I just do not know why the parties had this engagement.  Maybe the 
party you asked was not aware of the provisions of this contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I think let us leave Ms Hofmeyr to ... (intervenes) 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 193 of 217 
 
MS L MBANJWA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Conduct the questioning.  Ja okay alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So, Ms Memela I understand your evidence to be 
you do not recall what you did to follow it up.  Is that right? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  I do not recall what I did to follow that up but I 
do know that it is finance that is supposed to do- dealing with this thing 
which is my understanding is that the reason why at the first place Ms 
Pumaza Nhantsi was involved.  She was the group Chief Financial Officer 
whom is the one who actually approves from Treasury what should be paid 
to which supplier. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mm-hmm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So, at no point after these email in September did- 
well let me ask it differently.  Did you at any point after these emails in 
September of 2016 go and get the contract and looked for the provisions in 
relation to the deposit? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  I do not remember Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well let us go to what then happens because there 
is a jump in time to about April 2017 in the correspondence that we have in 
relation to this matter.  And you will find that in your bundle DD25B. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Mm-hmm. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  At page 650. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No at 650 there is an email there from Mogotso 
Masese, who is that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, at what page? 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 194 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies Chair.  We are at 650. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And I am starting at the bottom of the page to follow 
the chronology. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Chair can we before we get to Makgotso, start 
from the email from AAR right before Makgotso? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh, over the previous page.  Yes, certainly let us 
start at 651. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes.  There is that email Chair where Makgotso 
then is I guess he is following up on. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  The email is coming from Mr Mathew Dobbs from 
AAR. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mm-hmm. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Returned to Makgotso Mosese.  Ms Hofmeyr 
asked me who is Makgotso.  Makgotso is Management Accountant of SAAT 
form finanace department.   
Dear Makgotso, hope you are well.  In attachment you will find the statement 
of account.  We are 3 invoices overdue, would you please have a look and 
let me know if you need additional info from us.   
20 
In addition, you will find the late fee calculation sheet.  I remain at your 
disposal for any additional info you need.   
 
And then Makgotso responds adding Wellington who was the 
Business Analyst ... (intervenes) 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 195 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela just to interject there, I do not think it is 
the response to Mr Dobbs.  I think what Makgotso Mosese does then is- it is 
an internal correspondence.  Is that right? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes.  That is why I said he- she followed up or 
maybe sent it to the internal people. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Based on Mr Dobbs email. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes, and what does she say? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  She is writing to Wellington Nyuswa from finance 
as well, he was the manger there.   
10 
Hi Wellington, AAR is enquiring about the security deposit invoice that we 
were contractually suppose to pay.  The payment never happened.   
Wellington, I believe the expense authorisation was last with you.  I do not 
quite remember why the payment was never made but I think it had 
something to do with Treasury.   
Please remind of why we never made this payment so that I can give AAR an 
appropriate response. 
 
And then Dev Arya the Chief Financial Officer response on the same 
date ... (intervenes) 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And Ms Memela he now includes you in the 
20 
response.  Is that right? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  He includes me in the response and then he 
adds Bongile Mtembo.   
Hi Makgotso, please refer the query to Nontsasa and she will respond 
directly. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 196 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then your response is at the top of the page.  
What did you say? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  My response at the top of the page.   
Dear Makgotso, according to the contract we have with AAR we are actually 
supposed to have made a payment for security deposit upfront before they 
ever started providing services for us.  That was conditions precedent.   
What happened then, we negotiated with them to pay one month upfront 
instead of the whole three months security deposit.  We again negotiated 
with them to only charge the remaining two months by including it to the 
normal invoice and spread it over six months.   
10 
This exercise was supposed to have happened two months ago already.  I 
am not sure why they are not paid. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela what I am interested in there is your 
introductory words.  According to the contract we have with AAR. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Mm-hmm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We were actually supposed to have made a payment 
for security deposit upfront. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Mm-hmm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Before they even started providing services for us. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Ja. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is not what the contract provides.   
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  On the condition’s precedence Chair- that is why 
I say the discussion was that we- SAAT will pay three months upfront but 
through the negotiations they were able to agree on certain changes as I 
just stated in my email. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 197 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  Why would you say that the contract that was 
concluded with AAR required a payment of a deposit upfront when that is not 
what the contract provides. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Okay.  Can we go to- Chair before I answer this 
question because I just want to check what is in the condition’s precedence?  
I will direct you just now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Okay Chair the- page 2327 at DD22F of Mr 
Human. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Exhibit DD25. 
10 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  22F. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that what is written on the spine? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Mr Human. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  On the contract of AAR. 
CHAIRPERSON:  22F? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  22F. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, you- what is the page number? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  The page number is 2327. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay 2327. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 198 of 217 
 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  It says JM AAR obligation to provide the services 
to SAAT is conditional upon fulfilment and delivery to JM AAR of the 
following conditions precedent.   
 
6.23.1 
Payment of the deposit. 
 
And then it states other conditions precedent.  I am trying to 
remember where was the three months because I remember there was a 
discussion of three months. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if there was three months, what was going to be your 
10 
answer? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Okay the question from Ms Hofmeyr was that, 
why did I say it was three months when the contract does not say that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No, that was not the question.   
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Oh okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The question was why did you say according to the 
contract. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Mm-hmm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You had to make payment of a security deposit when 
all that the contract required was a standby letter from the bank? 
20 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Okay.  Chair can I read again and explain my 
interpretation? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  According to the contract we have with AAR we 
were actually supposed ... (intervenes) 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 199 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where are you reading from? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  I am reading the same email that Ms Hofmeyr is 
reading. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, ja. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  According to the contract we have with AAR 
we are actually supposed to have made a payment for security deposit 
upfront before they ever started providing services for us.  What happened 
then, we negotiated with them to pay one month upfront instead of the whole 
three months security deposit.   
 
So, the negotiation happened before the contract was concluded. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela we are at cross purposes.  What I am 
interested in is the contract clause 4.26 that we looked at does not require 
any money to be paid by SAAT to AAR. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Mm? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What it requires is an irrevocable standby letter of 
credit from a bank in respect of which drawdowns can be made.  But rather 
than saying that, Ms Memela, in your response to the queries from finance, 
you said;  
According to the contract we have with AAR we were actually supposed to 
have made a payment for security deposit upfront before they even started

providing services for us.   
I understand the negotiations is about whether it is one month or three 
months but the point I am interested in is why would you say that it is 
necessary that a payment be made for the security deposit ... (intervenes) 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Okay. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 200 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  When all that the agreement- if I could finish my 
question.   
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  When all that the agreement required was a standby 
letter of credit to be provided. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  But you are reading from pricing and payment 
versus the deposit.  The deposit Chair was the payment that was going to be 
made upfront. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where in the agreement does it say there needed to be a 
payment of ... (intervenes) 
10 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  The deposit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A deposit? 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  That is why Chair I had taken you to the 
conditions precedent page 2327 of ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 2327. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Of 22- of Exhibit 22F of Mr Human. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  2327 of 22F. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Of 22F, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  2327, I am there. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes, and then there is provision 6 that talks to 
conditions precedent and conditions subsequent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are referring to 6.23.1 payment of the deposit. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes chair. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 201 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  So, Ms Hofmeyr is mixing these provisions.  The 
one in 4- he is talking about pricing and payment. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes, let us ... (intervenes) 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Towards the contract. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Look at what ... (intervenes) 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  And I am referring- in my email it is referring to 
the deposit that SAAT had taken time to pay to AAR.  It is not referring to 
pricing and payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But go to clause 4.26 Ms Memela at page 2325. 
10 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It says; prior to the commencement date JM/AAR will 
invoice SAAT for the deposit.  And then it says ... (intervenes) 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Where are you reading Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Clause 4.26 at page 2325 same bundle. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes.  33? 
CHAIRPERSON:  2325. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  2325. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes sir. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  The clause is the last clause on the page 4.26. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Mm-hmm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It says;  
Prior to the commencement date JM/AAR will invoice SAAT for the deposit. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Mm-hmm. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 202 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then it says;  
SAAT will pay the deposit by way of an irrevocable standby letter of credit 
from a bank acceptable to JM/AAR. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in a form agreed to by JM/AAR. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, this does not mean as I see it that cash was required 
to be paid. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  No I- yes Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  The submission of a standby letter of credit from a bank 
10 
acceptable to JM/AAR would be regarded as that deposit. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes Chair.  But what I was explaining to the 
finance team was that before the contract was concluded the AAR had put 
on the negotiation table on that first day that we were supposed to have 
made a payment for security deposit upfront and they said that was their 
policy when we stood up to that.  I think there is somewhere where I am 
actually explaining.  I think it is in the- where I am explaining to Michael 
Klein ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  But do you accept now having looked at clause 4.26 even 
having regard to the condition’s precedent clause 6. 
20 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That in terms of the agreement SAAT was not required to 
pay cash so to speak?  It needed to simply provide a standby letter of credit 
from a bank acceptable to JM/AAR. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 203 of 217 
 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Chair where I am responding that I am not sure 
why they were not- they are not paid.  I was responding to Makgotso’s email 
to Wellington where she is saying;  
Wellington, I believe the expense authorisation was last with you.  I do not 
quite remember why the payment was never made but I think it has- it had 
something to do with Treasury.   
CHAIRPERSON:  But that is the point that MS Hofmeyr is pursuing to say, 
why is anybody talking about as I understand what is being said in the 
emails, payment as if it is payment of cash.  I am saying cash including 
electronic transfers whereas what is all that SAAT was obliged to do. 
10 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Mm-hmm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And all that JM/AAR were entitled to was simply a standby 
letter of credit from a bank that was acceptable to them. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Okay Chair I do not remember but my 
understanding is that finance would have the copy of the contract to 
understand what are the terms of payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but what I am asking is whether- okay no, maybe not 
now. 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you accept that that is – what I have just said is 
20 
what the agreement required? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  Was required yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You accept that.  Have that always been your 
understanding or was your understanding at some stage different? 
MS MEMELA:  As I had said Chair that like the last time I had talked 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 204 of 217 
 
about this contract the first time it was that first day when we were 
negotiating and I remember like the discussion around conditions 
precedents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but… 
MS MEMELA:  it took long yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am not talking about before the conclusion of 
contract. 
MS MEMELA:  Oh okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  After the contract has been concluded had your 
understanding been different in regard to SAAT’s obligations about the 
10 
deposit? 
MS MEMELA:  After the contract had been concluded Chair I doubt that 
I had gone back to the contract except the time when we were 
preparing to go to defence such at court. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you are not sure what you may… 
MS MEMELA:  I am not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or you may have not have known at the time. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Ms Hofmeyr I think the hand has been 
cleared. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is not cleared?  Okay Ms Mbanjwa. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair just before I hand over to Ms Mbanjwa.  I 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 205 of 217 
 
would just like to raise a caution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What would diminish the weight of Ms Memela’s 
evidence after this point is if in any comment or objection that Ms 
Mbanjwa raises she effectively leads Ms Memela to an answer and it is 
just something that I raise because it ultimately has an impact on the 
weight that is afforded to Ms Memela so I would just suggest to my 
learned friend that she not lead Ms Memela in any question that she 
now or comment she wants to raise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
10 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  The reason why I am raising a hand is 
because I believe [indistinct] Ms Hofmeyr and Ms Memela I am not 
going to raise it now I am just noting it because when I re-examine I 
will re-examine at exactly this point.  And where is that error?  The 
error is the fact that what is happening is two separate issues are 
being conflated.  One is a condition precedent which is either a letter 
of guarantee which would be a deposit that stays there.  And then when 
the expenses come they would then be debited against that account 
20 
and then this is being conflated with the fact that insofar as the deposit 
is concerned a letter of guarantee would be sufficient. But what the rest 
of the emails talk about?  They have moved away from the letter of 
guarantee.  They are now talking about expenses that have already 
been incurred. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 206 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think … 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  But I will clarify that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think Ms Mbanjwa that is the kind of thing Ms 
Hofmeyr was talking about.  That it – it – you – you raise an issue 
which may be seen as explaining to Ms Memela.  You might not be 
intending to do that but she may have that benefit in answering.  So 
maybe because it is important that her evidence be given the weight 
that it deserves.  Maybe keep it for your re-examination and let her as 
– I mean answer to the best of her ability.  Nobody is suggesting that 
you are doing anything deliberately.  But sometimes when one is trying 
10 
to raise points this effect could arise. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  But Your Worship – but Mr Chair what I 
just want to point out the way I understand proceedings of any nature.  
If you are representing a party and a question that is confusing is 
directed at the party you can stand… 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no  
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Stand up and say the question is 
confusing.  I do not think Chair the test is the test of what Ms Hofmeyr 
with due respect has said.  She said if I am standing up to point out 
that she herself is asking a confusing question that would then mean at 
20 
the end of the day when evidence or credibility of that witness is being 
judged it will be against her. That is not the test.  The test would be 
was the question confusing?  Because if the question was confusing 
then it means we are in the right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no if the – if you believe the question is 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 207 of 217 
 
confusing you are – it is legitimate for you to raise that.  But even from 
your own explanation it seemed to confirm my own understanding which 
was that I certainly did not see it as confusing.  That does not mean 
you did not see it as confusing.  You may have seen it as confusing.  
But… 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  No thank you Chair I thank you for your 
patience. But I will take it up in re-examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright.  Yes okay. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Thank you Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair Ms Mbanjwa in her comments a moment 
10 
ago and seeking to clarify the confusion made a statement that these 
invoices were related to expenses.  That is not the case.  And the 
reason for that is because the way that the deposit worked under the 
agreement I will take you to the provision now.  I just have to find it 
again.  Was as follows.  You find it at the agreement it is tucked away 
this is a very complex agreement.  But it is at page 2335 of DD22F.   
CHAIRPERSON:  At 2235 yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  You see that is where you find the 
definition of deposit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You will see against 3 it says: 
“Deposit equal to three months revenue to be 
reviewed and adjusted annually in line with fleet 
growth and annual escalation.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 208 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So Chair the whole structure… 
MS MEMELA:  Chair. Sorry where are you reading Ma’am? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh sorry 2335. 
MS MEMELA:  2335.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is the part of the agreement that gives the 
definition of deposit and it is the place I think you were looking for 
earlier Ms Memela because it refers to three months.   
“The deposit is equal to three months revenue to be 
reviewed and adjusted annually in line with fleet 
growth and annual escalation.” 
10 
So what happens is when you read the conditions precedent Clause 
4.26 and the definition.  And this is played out in the invoices that then 
come from AAR.  So I will go to the facts in a moment.  It is a 
requirement of this agreement and Ms Memela I am putting this to you 
so that if you have a different understanding you can clarify that for the 
commission. 
MS MEMELA:  Where are you – you are still on 2335? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No I am now drawing the condition precedent, 
the definition of deposit and Clause 4.26 together.  Because you have 
to understand the agreement in its totality.  And if you have a different 
20 
understanding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on.  Ms Memela. 
MS MEMELA:  Chair I am just saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You getting confused. 
MS MEMELA:  I am not getting confused I am just saying maybe it will 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 209 of 217 
 
brush my ego a bit if Ms Hofmeyr would say, okay the three months 
deposit that you were referring to on your email I am sure this is the 
one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But she just said… 
MS MEMELA:  No but she did not say it the way I want her to say it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No but she is on a certain point.  She is on a certain 
point.  She is on a certain point. 
MS MEMELA:  Because I said it and I now… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on, hang on, hang on Ms Memela.  She is on a 
certain point that she regards as relevant for now but she realises that 
10 
it refers to three months and remembers what you said earlier on. 
MS MEMELA:  Wow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And says in passing because she is on a certain point 
maybe this is the clause you had in mind. That is what she said. 
MS MEMELA:  So – so … 
CHAIRPERSON:  What did you want her to say? 
MS MEMELA:  No, no Chair I am – I am just – you know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
MS MEMELA:  I do not know how to explain it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Just – ja – let me leave it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine. 
MS MEMELA:  But I am just – I was just. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr. 
MS MEMELA:  I was just hoping that she would have said… 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 210 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Continue. 
MS MEMELA:  You know.  This is what you are talking about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay she is on a certain point. 
MS MEMELA:  Now I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, she is on a certain point. 
MS MEMELA:  Where you are coming from? 
CHAIRPERSON:  She is on a certain point. She might or might not 
come back to that point but she is on a certain point that she is busy 
with.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair what I would like to do is explain what 
10 
the understanding of the conspectus of this contract is so that Ms 
Memela can offer a response.  The contract works as follows as we 
read it.  It is a condition precedent of the contract that a deposit be 
paid.  It is then provided in Clause 4.26 at page 2325 how that deposit 
is going to be paid.  And it is going to be paid prior to the 
commencement date.  So it is consistent with the conditions precedent 
provision.  And it says:  
And when you go to the definitions for what the prior 
to the commencement date JM/AAR will invoice SAAT 
for the deposit and SAAT will pay the deposit by way 
20 
of irrevocable standby letter of credit from a bank 
acceptable to JM/AAR and in a form agreed to by 
JM/AAR.” 
t deposit will comprise you are told that it will be calculated on the 
basis of three months revenue and it will be escal – reviewed and 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 211 of 217 
 
adjusted annually in line with fleet growth and annual escalation which 
in the conspectus of the contract makes absolute sense because it is 
standing there as a guarantee against default and late payments by 
SAAT.  That means annually it must be reviewed because over the five 
years of the contact it may well have to be increased to provide the 
same level of security against late payment by SAAT.  Ms Memela that 
is what we understand the agreement to mean and I would like to have 
your comment if you understand it in any different way? 
MS MEMELA:  I have not comment Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then just to confirm I said I would go to the 
10 
facts because that is precisely how AAR invoiced for it albeit that they 
were now wanting cash.  They did not want a standby letter of credit 
anymore.  You will find that at DD22F, is it?  F and that is at page 
2403.   
CHAIRPERSON:  2203? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  2403 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2403. 
MS MEMELA:  2403. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  This is the invoice that AAR sent to South 
African Airways technical. And it is just around the time of this 
communication in 2017 because it is dated the 18 April 2017.  And you 
will see that the total amount of this invoice is 4 382 224 Dollars and 
71 cents.  And the description that is given of it is security deposit – 3 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 212 of 217 
 
month minimum flight hour billing April 2017 minimum FH billing and the 
indication is that the monthly billing was US Dollars 1 460 741.57 times 
3. That is how they calculate the three months that they are now 
requiring be paid.  So back to the questions Ms Memela.  What then 
happens is in May there is a follow up.  Apologies I need to have – ja 
the DD22G in front of me.  The challenge that SAAT was facing at that 
moment was a cash flow problem.  And that is evidenced from the 
communications that we will go to next.  And Ms Memela what I want to 
put to you for your comment is the following.  The difference for SAAT 
between a standby letter of credit from a bank and actually paying 
10 
money is that – that has an immediate impact on cash flow. Do you 
accept that? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay Chair that would be answered by the financier that 
made this payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well are you sure that it is something you cannot 
answer because it seems to me that it would be quite logical that if you 
pay somebody with cash logically after paying somebody with cash you 
are left with less cash.  Your balance goes down and if your – you or 
your company is going through difficult financial times you may be 
needing the cash.  Are you sure it is something you cannot answer? 
20 
MS MEMELA:  No Chair I – I am not trying not to answer anything but I 
just feel that maybe if I was the one who was approving the payment 
then like it will have been logical for me to answer.  But  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Then I would answer in a general statement that of 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 213 of 217 
 
course that would – what it means. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  To a lay person who does not have a financial 
background. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Mbangwa. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Thank you Chair.  The question is unfair 
to Ms Memela because the premise is incorrect.  If a person says 
provide a letter of guarantee of credit it does not necessarily mean that 
that letter of guarantee of credit is not under pinned by cash.  Take for 
instance my example I am going to give.  I work as a conveyancer.  If a 
10 
client is buying property and then before the transfer can take place 
the seller of the property is going to want guarantees that on the day of 
the transaction of the sale. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Do you want to say something? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you can deal with it in re-examination. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Thank you as long as it is accepted it is 
unfair for her. Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let us go to DD22G to pick up where finance 
starts to raise with you their concern about the cash position. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  We – we are at five o’clock. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I would prefer that we adjourn when you are done but 
we – we are at five o’clock and maybe – maybe we should adjourn and 
– and you – you finish tomorrow morning. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 214 of 217 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair.  I think it may be safer because any 
estimation of time that I give you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja is difficult. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is unrealistic. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So let – this is an aspect to conclude the 
payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then there will be a few concluding 
aspects. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So we should just do it tomorrow if that suits. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  But of course we have to start looking – we 
should talk about what arrangements can be done with regard to Mr 
Ndzeko. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  Chair what I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I – I think if we are not going to finish with 
him if we will be able to start and not finish with him and of course we 
20 
should be able to start.  But if we are going to be able to start and not 
finish with him it may be that we should just arrange another date 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When he can come and we deal with his evidence. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair I did have a brief opportunity to speak to 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 215 of 217 
 
his legal representatives over the break.  They indicated to me that 
they may have a proposal that will facilitate his evidence.  I think the 
chances are extremely likely – unlikely that we will start Mr Ndzeko 
tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Especially because of the time that is indicated 
and your limitations tomorrow for how long we can sit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So it would be my proposal that I conclude 
briefly in the morning.  We hand over for the re-examination and then I 
10 
will have discussions with the legal representatives of Mr Ndzeko 
immediately after this hearing adjourns and then I can come back to 
you with proposals for when he may be able to return. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of course that will have to fit in with the 
schedule. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But we will be able to discuss that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no that is fine.  Ms Mbanjwa it seems that we 
should adjourn for today.  Have you got anything to say about that? 
20 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  No Chair I quite understand that we are in 
your hands.  I just wanted to voice a difficulty I may have.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  After tomorrow Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 216 of 217 
 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  I have a part heard trial in the 
Magistrates Court.  Unfortunately on Thursday I have to attend to that 
part heard trial so I am just saying I do not know what arrangements 
but I do not want to inconvenience the commission by just jumping. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  This thing on the commission tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja well you – tomorrow we will not sit the whole day 
because I will have to leave tomorrow after lunch.  It may well be I am 
not sure about – it may well be that we – we can only go up to one or it 
may be before one.  Maybe half past twelve I am not sure.  So – and on 
10 
Thursday we will not sit because I will not be available.  So we will use 
the time tomorrow that is available and if we do not finish – I hope we 
finish but if we do not finish then we will arrange for some other time.  
But I am hoping that we can finish but it has not been easy to estimate 
time.  So – so if your concern was about Thursday that should not be a 
problem. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ms Memela you understand you – you are part of 
the agreement that tomorrow you are still available? 
MS MEMELA:  Chair I was just going to raise something which I am 
20 
sure I could have raised it through my lawyer.  I was going to ask 
because Ms Hofmeyr as much as she thinks I am the one who actually 
delays these – once she has given tomorrow morning I think we will 
take the whole day again. So I wanted to check if I cannot give crisp 
answers and then we are done.  I will not take long so that we know 
11 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 211 
 
Page 217 of 217 
 
that tomorrow we start with… 
CHAIRPERSON:  We – we can do with a firm undertaking to give crisp 
answers Ms Memela. 
MS MEMELA:  I – I undertake Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja we will see.  The – the – if you give crisp answers 
it will help. 
MS MEMELA:  I will do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it will help.  Okay I think we will have to adjourn 
and – and I think we must start at ten.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Certainly Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja.  Okay we will adjourn then and tomorrow we 
will start at ten.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.
