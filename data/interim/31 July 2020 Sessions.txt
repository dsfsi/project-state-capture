PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 31 JULY 2020 
CHAIRPERSON: Good morning Mr Hulley, good morning 
everybody. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Good morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we ready? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Chairperson we are ready to 
proceed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Mr Chair if I could mention the matter of 
Major General Zinhle Mononopi who was testify today. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  The heater or the noise seems to be quite 
high today – this morning but I think they will attend to it you 
just raise your voice. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Mr Chair this is the matter of Major 
General Mononopi. As I understand the position there is an 
application for a postponement in respect of Major General 
Mononopi.  I understand that the basis of the postponement 
is twofold. 
20 
 
In the first instance there is an allegation supported 
apparently by a report by a medical doctor to the effect that 
she is suffering from – she is suffering from depression and 
that is the one basis upon which the application is brought. 
 
In the second instance it is – there is a report to the 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 4 of 255 
 
effect that she has tested positive for Covid-19.  We have 
indicated insofar as the first ground is concerned obviously 
insofar as the second ground is concerned the report is what 
it is.  It is only come in very recently.  We are not in a 
position to challenge it.  We do not oppose the application so 
far as it goes. 
 
We do however say that insofar as the first ground is 
concerned that she suffers from depression we would like to 
have her tested by our own – the commission’s own medical 
expert and I have spoken to Mr Khumalo who appears on 
10 
behalf of Ms Mononopi.  His indicated to me is that they are 
agreeable to such an arrangement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No, no that is fine.  I think that will 
be important because I do have a distinct recollection that it 
is not the first time that she provides the commission with a 
medical certificate when she is supposed to appear which 
says she is suffering from depression. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That is correct Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It may be once, it may be twice before but 
I think sadly it is not the first one and it is concerning. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  It is yes concerning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If each time she is required to appear she 
suffers depression.  But you will look into the issue. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  We are making arrangements to 
investigate the issue. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 5 of 255 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  If Mr Khumalo would like to address you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Khumalo ja. 
ADV KHUMALO:  Thank you Mr Chair.  My instructions are I 
confirm with my colleague he said and I confirm also the 
instruction that we will oblige to the request. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KHUMALO:    And to my colleague. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KHUMALO:    And then my instructions are to liaise 
with the Registrar. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KHUMALO:    In connection with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  No it would be 
helpful if there will be cooperation because if she is 
genuinely depressed then that is fine.  It is just that it is not 
the first time that it happens so one is bound to be 
concerned.  So – but you have indicated that she will 
20 
cooperate and I think that is important. 
ADV KHUMALO:    As it pleases the Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Otherwise I understand the – the – 
certainly the issue of Covid-19.  There are many people who 
are affected so I think that is the main basis on which we will 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 6 of 255 
 
postpone.   
ADV KHUMALO:  As it pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the application for the postponement of 
the hearing of the evidence of I think it is Major General is 
that right?  Major General Zinhle 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That is correct Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mononopi.  It is Major General of Major 
General Zinhle Lutricia Mononopi is granted and the hearing 
of her evidence is postponed to a date to be determined. 
ADV KHUMALO:  I am indebted to the Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you are excused. 
ADV KHUMALO:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Khumalo.   
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  Mr Chair that brings 
us to the testimony of Mr Sandile July.  He is a director at 
Werksmans.  He was one of the authors or the author of the 
so called Werksmans Report which is dated 24 April 2015.  It 
has been testified to on several occasions before.  He has 
20 
been implicated by Mr McBride, Mr Sesoko and Mr Khuba in 
respect of the report that he has compiled. You have granted 
him leave to come and testify before the commission.  Thank 
you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Actually, I think we asked him to come 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 7 of 255 
 
rather than had – I think he did not ask to come – we asked 
him to come and he obliged. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you that is in fact so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  He simply placed his affidavit before the 
commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  We have asked him to come and testify. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  In support of it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine.  Thank you.  Oh yes I think 
Mr Ngcukaitobi you need to place yourselves – yourself on 
record yes. 
ADV NGCUKAITOBI:  Yes.  Thank you Mr Chair.  I act for 
Werksmans and Mr July together with my learned friend Ms 
Talc that as Your Worship knows the practice, I will only play 
a role only at the end. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADV NGCUKAITOBI:    Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no that is fine.   That is fine.  No 
20 
thank you.  Hm.  Please administer the oath or affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MR JULY:  My name is Sandile July. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 8 of 255 
 
MR JULY:  I do not. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
MR JULY:  Yes I do. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give 
will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the 
truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help me 
God. 
MR JULY:  So help me God. 
REGISTRAR:  Thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you Mr July for coming to give 
evidence when asked to do so.  Thank you very much.  I – I 
do not think that we should take more than two hours at most 
three hours with Mr July’s evidence if we focus simply on the 
real issues.   
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I am just mentioning that so that 
everybody has an idea what kind of timeframe I have in 
mind.  Obviously, the issues must be dealt with – we must do 
justice to them but I think the issues are rather narrow. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  They are fairly narrow Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja there may be a lot of files.  I see a lot 
of lever arch files behind you and I see a lot of files in front 
of Mr July but the issues I think are rather narrow. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 9 of 255 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Mr July just for the benefit of the record 
you are a director at Werksmans Attorneys is that correct? 
MR JULY:  Yes I am. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And you have been in practice for how 
long? 
MR JULY:  I have been in practice for 24 years. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now you compiled a report – you 
together with certain other members of your firm compiled a 
report. 
10 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  In relation to a certain letter of 
instruction that was given to you by the former Minister of 
Police Mr Nkosinathi Nhleko on the 23 February of 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second Mr Hulley.  My Registrar 
opened one of Mr July’s supplementary affidavits.  I thought 
that I need to look at the main affidavit – his main affidavit. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  His main affidavit appears Mr Chair at 
Exhibit Y8[B]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the bundle? 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Pardon me Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Number. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Mr Chair this is Bundle LEA1.  I trust by 
now your… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it is the right bundle.  That bundle the 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 10 of 255 
 
top. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  The top affidavit is that of Mr Nhleko, is 
that right? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  It is Mr Nhleko.  Mr July’s affidavit is the 
second exhibit in that bundle and that appears at page 189. 
CHAIRPERSON:  189? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  189 Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  You will see this is a response. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  To the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I think I am – I was mistaken.  I 
think I read answering affidavit as supplementary affidavit.  
So. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It says answering affidavit. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the main affidavit. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Correct Mr Chairman. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay no that is fine. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  To place you in the 
complete picture as far as this affidavit is concerned it is one 
of three affidavits that has been filed by Mr July.  The other 
two affidavits relate in succession to Mr Khuba and to Mr 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 11 of 255 
 
Sesoko.  They also form part of the file.  Much of the 
evidence is incorporated in this particular affidavit Exhibit 
Y8[B] but a lot of the information that relates specifically to 
the other two witnesses appears separately in a separate 
affidavit.  Mr July we were dealing with the fact that you had 
compiled a report pursuant to instructions that had been 
given to you. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  By the former Minister of Police, is that 
correct? 
10 
MR JULY:  That is correct. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you.  And the affidavit that – you 
in fact filed three affidavits in this matter.  One appears in 
Bundle LEA1. 
MR JULY:  LEA1.  Yup. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I think take it out.  I would like you to 
turn with me to page 189. 
MR JULY:  100 and? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  189 of that bundle. 
MR JULY:  Yup. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And that is the first page of your affidavit.  
If would turn to the end of that document which is at page – 
page 100 and – sorry 376.  You have that? 
MR JULY:  I am almost there.  Yup page 376. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And that is your signature is it not? 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 12 of 255 
 
MR JULY:  Yup it is my signature. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now I will take – I might take you 
successively to the other affidavits to confirm them as well.  
They are in the bundle. 
MR JULY:  Yup. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  But I would like to take you at this point 
in time if you will… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one second Mr Hulley.  I just want to 
say Mr Ngcukaitobi your team should feel free to create more 
social distancing.  There is enough space even behind.  Ja.  
10 
We do not want anybody blaming the commission if anything 
happens after this.  Yes thank you Mr Hulley you may 
proceed. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  The specific report 
that was compiled by – that has become – or that has been 
referred to as the Werksmans Report if you would turn with 
me to a preceding exhibit at page 113 of the – sorry 114 of 
the same bundle.  This Mr Chair is an annexure to Mr 
Nhleko’s affidavit.  It is Exhibit Y8[A].   
MR JULY:  114 yes I am there. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And if you would then go to the end of 
that document which is at page 187 of the same bundle.   
MR JULY:  Yup I am there. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now it indicates over here that this report 
was signed on the 24 April of 2015 at Sandton.  This is in 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 13 of 255 
 
fact the complete report, is that correct? 
MR JULY:  Yup. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you very much.  Now just to get to 
the Terms of Reference that were given to you insofar as this 
is concerned and if you – if you do desire, we can go through 
– you can go through the specific document is you like.  But 
I would like you to – and I have indicated to you that perhaps 
you should have thirty minutes just to explain how this entire 
event came about?  How you got – were briefed and 
ultimately how you handed up the report?  What was your 
10 
interaction with the Minister and specifically the aspects that 
you – you filed three affidavits as we have indicated and 
specifically 
the 
aspects 
that 
you 
think 
ought 
to 
be 
highlighted before I ask you certain questions relating to the 
report and to your various affidavits?   
MR JULY:  Mr Chair I – can I exercise a right to use my 
thirty minutes if I am allowed? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no I am. 
MR JULY:  At the end.  At the end of the cross-examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
20 
MR JULY:  I am doing so because I am mindful of the fact 
that you want the space time – I mean this – the – you have 
got time pressures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Yes. 
MR JULY:  And you want to deal with the facts. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 14 of 255 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR JULY:  And I am not – I am not here to deal with 
peripheral issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR JULY:  So I will deal if necessary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja at the end. 
MR JULY:  I do not want – yes if necessary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  I want to deal with the facts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no thank you.  Ja thank you. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Very well.  The – you have obviously 
listened to – no doubt read the transcript and looked at the 
allegations that have been made against you by Mr McBride, 
Sesoko and Khuba, is that correct? 
MR JULY:  Yes, Yes, no I did. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now obviously the aspect that troubles – 
certainly troubled them most is the fact that you came to a 
conclusion which is that they were guilty based on the 
investigation that you had conducted, the witnesses that you 
had – the witnesses that you had interviewed and a 
20 
consideration of the [indistinct 00:17:07] papers you came to 
the conclusion that they were guilty of – sorry – that one of 
the three of them might be guilty of the crime of defeating 
the ends of justice or obstructing justice. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 15 of 255 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Is that correct? 
MR JULY:  That they are concerned about that? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Pardon me? 
MR JULY:  You are saying I did not hear the first part. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay let us go to page 186 to look at 
what your conclusion is. 
MR JULY:  No, no I know my conclusion. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  I am saying you said – a statement there is 
something that you said. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I did not hear the whole question. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  They – you would be aware that Mr 
Sesoko, 
Mr 
Khuba 
and 
Mr 
McBride 
had 
expressed 
unhappiness. 
MR JULY:  Correct. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Particularly about the fact that you came 
to the conclusion as expressed in paragraph 6.4.5 on page 
186 of the – of your report that you recommended that one of 
the three of them. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Was guilty – maybe guilty and charged 
criminally for defeating the ends of justice or obstructing the 
administration of justice and that disciplinary charges be 
brought against them in their capacity as employees. 
MR JULY:  That is one of the concerns but of course when 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 16 of 255 
 
they came to the commission, they said a lot of things. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  No that is no doubt true but that was 
their primary concern that you had come to that conclusion. 
MR JULY:  Yes.  But there is also a concern why Werksmans 
was appointed. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  It is an issue that was must be dealt with as to 
why Werksmans was appointed as a private law firm.  So I 
do not want to limit this to what you already know. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay. 
10 
MR JULY:  It is more than that. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now let us consider – let us consider the 
conclusion that you have come to.  You came to the 
conclusion that… 
MR JULY:  And what page is that? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Page 186 of the same bundle.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 186? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  186 Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR JULY:  Yup. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  You say at paragraph 6.4.5.  
“That in the absence of any information as to which of the 
three co-signatories were responsible for the deleting of 
information from the first report we recommend that Khuba, 
McBride and Sesoko be charged criminally for defeating the 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 17 of 255 
 
ends of justice or obstructing the administration of justice 
and that disciplinary charges be brought against them in 
their capacity as employees.” 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now let us just consider that. 
MR JULY:  Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  If you could take us through how you 
came to the conclusion that they were guilty of those – of 
that specific charge or rather that you recommend – made a 
recommendation that one of the three of them may be guilty 
10 
of that charge. 
MR JULY:  Chair the question is going to be – the answer is 
going to be a long answer.  But I will try… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja try to… 
MR JULY:  I will try… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Try to –  
MR JULY:  I will try to be short. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja to be – to be – ja give the gist. 
MR JULY:  Chair you would – 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR JULY:  I think we are all lawyers here.  The mandate the 
co-mandate of IPID is stipulated in Section 28.  That is the 
co-mandate.  Anything else that they do it is secondary to 
the co-mandate.  And co-mandate tells you what is it that 
they are supposed to do.  They are supposed to do the 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 18 of 255 
 
investigation.  And what do they do with the investigation 
you come up with a report.   
 
Now the question now is what is it that they were 
investigating?  Khuba was investigating rendition.  What is 
that rendition?  I know McBride wants to make a rendition an 
American concept.  Rendition is rendition.  And it is an 
illegal transportation of fugitives from one country to another 
country. 
 
When you supposed to do that you supposed to do it 
through normal processes which is legal processes.  There 
10 
must be extradition of a person from one country to another 
country.  You do not do it by just arresting people and put it 
– and hand over to other people – I mean to another 
authority that belongs to another country. 
 
Not only that you also allow the police from another 
country to come and do policing in South Africa.  So for 
anyone to be able to understand why we recommended what 
we recommended you need to understand the issue of what 
is it that was being investigated?  Was there anything wrong 
with what was done?  And we know that – they conclude by 
20 
saying – when I am saying they conclude I am talking about 
the 18 March report which was signed by McBride on the 9 
April which says: “Only one person”  They are not saying 
there is no rendition but they saying only one person is 
responsible for that.  And that person is just a captain.  And 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 19 of 255 
 
that captain was able to amass such resources that took 
over – that operation took over two months – actually three.  
It was November, December and January.  Although two 
happened in November you needed serious resources that 
you cannot just as a captain you have them. 
 
So that is where the issue comes.  We need to talk 
about where does the legality start or illegality start?  The 
illegality start with the rendition.  And the question is who 
was involved? At what level were they involved?  Right. And 
you then say what then did IPID do?  The IPID then did the 
10 
investigation. At what point was the recommendation which 
was made on the 22 March was changed?  I can tell you now 
Chair they did not because of McBride’s employment at IPID 
we would be having a 22 January report.  We would not be 
here. 
 
We would be talking about the 22 January report.  
And for anybody who comes here and want to tell this 
commission that those reports mean nothing those people do 
not deserve to be in IPID.  Because the investigation that is 
done by IPID is done in terms of Section… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I do not think anybody has said 
those reports mean nothing.  I do not think anybody has. 
MR JULY:  They said they do not have any legal status 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well that might be something else. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 20 of 255 
 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I am not sure that that necessarily 
means. 
MR JULY:  They said they may be ignored. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They mean nothing.  You know. 
MR JULY:  By nothing there is a context here Chair.  This 
says we make reports and these reports they do not have to 
be considered.  I have met a number of prosecutors who said 
to me that is him now Khuba.  I met a number of prosecutors 
who said to me they do not even consider these reports. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well that – that I – that somebody did say.  
I think something along those lines. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  I think the impression I have at 
least from one or more of the witnesses is that they were 
saying or somebody said we make these recommendations. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the prosecutors, the NPA looks at them 
but they must – they are not bound by them.  They look at 
them and I am paraphrasing now. 
20 
MR JULY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Make – make out of them what they make. 
MR JULY:  Yes.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But we make them.  I got the impression 
what they – that what they are saying is if the NPA takes a 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 21 of 255 
 
different view we accept that. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If the NPA goes along with what we 
recommend that is fine.  We do not fight over the 
recommendations to say we recommended this why do you 
do something else?  That is the impression I got from the 
evidence. 
MR JULY:  Yes Chair.  Chair I can respond there.  They are 
saying two things.  They are saying exactly what you are 
saying about recommendations.  Recommendations are 
10 
recommendations.  They can be accepted they cannot be 
accepted.  But we accept – we are at the same page.  But 
the second part is a person comes here and proudly tells you 
that he meets other prosecutors who tell them. They do not 
even look at these recommendations.  And you work for the 
institution which has been recorded here and which I agree 
with that is a constitutional body established in terms of 
Section 206 of the Constitution.  Only for that purpose to do 
investigations. And those investigations must have reports.  
And you want to make those reports to look like it is 
20 
something that – and you proudly say that.  Chair and you do 
not see anything wrong about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you see we have got to make a 
distinction as to what the legal position may be about those 
reports. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 22 of 255 
 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what may be happening at a practical 
level between IPID and prosecutors.  It may well be that it is 
true those who say they have heard a lot of prosecutors who 
say they do not even consider them.  Maybe that is true.  
Maybe a lot of prosecutors do not place much weight on 
them. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But whether that is their right to do that or 
not that might be another issue.  So it might simply be that 
10 
at a practical level there may be a certain attitude towards 
those reports by certain prosecutors probably not all at a 
practical level. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR JULY:  Well Chair the context – the design why that 
answer is given is given to give the impression that why are 
you making an issue about a report?  As if this report binds 
somebody else when these people can just decide to ignore 
these reports.  I am saying even if that is true it is wrong for 
20 
a person who is employed to do that job comes here to this 
commission in order to justify what he wants to say seem to 
aligning himself with that type of conduct.  That is all what I 
am saying Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I understand what you are saying 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 23 of 255 
 
and – and obviously I have to look at what you are saying. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I do not want us as lawyers and judges 
to forget that certain people who are put in certain positions 
may not have the benefit of the legal knowledge that we 
have when they are not lawyers. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They may be adopting certain positions 
and dealing with matters to the best of their understanding. 
MR JULY:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which might or might not be correct but 
they just reflect what they understand to be the position. 
MR JULY:  I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that is the only part I want us to 
remember. 
MR JULY:  I understand Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.   
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  If I understand you 
correctly and certainly, I think in your affidavit you have 
articulated 
it 
quite 
well 
you 
have 
spoken 
about 
the 
20 
importance of the IPID Reports. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And to paraphrase as closely as I recall 
your statement in your affidavit you have said the IPID 
reports means something. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 24 of 255 
 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And when you say that you – of course 
you making the point that as a matter of law. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  They have got weight and you making the 
point that they have got to be taken into account.  Because – 
as a matter of law. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now the – and without delving too much 
into the legislation per se if I understand you correctly you 
10 
basing that on your reading of the IPID Act? 
MR JULY:  Yes not only that Chair there is an IPID Act 2011 
Act.  You have regulations.  You have SOP the Standard 
Operations Procedures.  The Act will tell you that there must 
regulations.  And the regulations in the same Act it tells you 
that in Section 34 of that Act there must be standard 
operations 
procedures. 
 
So 
when 
you 
look 
at 
these 
instruments in totality the procedure explains what the 
investigator should be done.  That is the regulations.  The 
Act explains to you how do you go about appointing the 
20 
investigators and what are their responsibilities.  The SOP 
then tells you what then internally although it is an internal 
document it is an internal document which comes out as a 
result of the Act which sets out how the investigation goes 
and who has the powers to sign the report.  And I am saying 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 25 of 255 
 
when you look at this issue of the report you cannot avoid to 
look at how did this report come about?  What happened to 
this report?  What was the reason for it to change?  Then all 
those issues cannot be just issues of common sense, are 
issues that must be answered by looking at the legislation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  So it is not just the Act. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Sure. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So if I understand you correctly, you are 
10 
looking at three instruments? 
MR JULY:  Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  The Act, the regulations, the SOP? 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And the process by which these reports, 
the first report was amended, as you say, to give rise to the 
second report? 
MR JULY:  The first part is how it was produced. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  And what makes it a final or complete.  Because I 
20 
want to be very careful.  Because people can hear and use 
terminology which is not there.  I want to be careful about 
that because we talk about completed report or preliminary 
report, right? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Sure. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 26 of 255 
 
MR JULY:  So I mean...  Sorry.  Completed investigation or 
preliminary investigation.  And we talk about... there are 
three types of reports in IPID, Chair.   
 
Three types of reports.  The first report is an interim 
report.  There is no such thing as a provisional report in 
IPID.  There is no such thing as a preliminary report.  There 
is no such thing as a draft report.  You have an interim 
report.  What the interim report does, it becomes what we 
call the final investigative report. 
 
The other report is what they call closure report.  That 
10 
closure report talks about the archiving of the document 
within IPID. 
 
Now the investigation is complete, the courts have made 
their decisions on the matter.  Now the question is, how do 
we close this file?  Who has the powers to give the final say 
on the closure of that file? 
 
Those are the three reports.  Anybody who comes up 
with another term of a report and talk about draft report and 
talk about preliminary report, provisional report...  I do not 
know where that comes from. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  You say it is an investigate... it is 
an interim report? 
MR JULY:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then after the interim report, which one 
comes? 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 27 of 255 
 
MR JULY:  It is the final. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The final... 
MR JULY:  It is final investigative report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR JULY:  Those are two reports in ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, they are two reports. 
MR JULY:  ...in closure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The closure is something else. 
MR JULY:  It is an eternal document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, just to say ...[intervenes]  
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...officially we have nothing further to do 
on this matter. 
MR JULY:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja.  Now, the reference to interim and 
final.  Is that in the legislation or in the act or regulations? 
MR JULY:  It is in the Standard Operations Procedure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, can we go there? 
20 
MR JULY:  It goes... if you go to the definitions in the 
Standard Operations Procedure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Hulley should be able to direct us. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if you are able to remember, that is 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 28 of 255 
 
fine. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  The first thing is.  If I can be of 
assistance.  We can turn to pages ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Hulley, your mic is rather far from you. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Pardon, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So when it is far from you, I cannot hear 
you well. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Pardon me, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Just for your benefit Mr Chair and for the 
10 
benefit of Mr July, is a legislation bundle that has also been 
part of the Exhibit Y Series.  Of course, it does not bear an 
exhibit number and that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, I think somebody must assist Mr July to 
find the level arch file that has got legislation.  Oh, are you 
able to see it? 
MR JULY:  You just said? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  It is the legislation bundle.  It would have 
on the spine Legislation and Authorities.  It is likely to be at 
the extreme right.   
20 
MR JULY:  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I have got the act.  It is at 
...[intervenes]  
ADV 
HULLEY 
SC: 
 
And 
then 
at 
page 
148 
is 
the 
...[intervenes]  
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 29 of 255 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, 148.  Oh, those are the regulations at 
148, is that so? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  No, these are the... this is the statute. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, this is the statute.  Oh, I see down... 
about the middle, it is saying Regulations under this Act. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Pardon me, Mr Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, I was seeing where it says in the 
middle of page 148 Regulations under this Act.  That is why I 
was thinking it is regulations. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Yes, I see that.  I am actually not sure 
10 
why that is so.  That is will have to editors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, at 150 it says “in this act unless 
context indicates otherwise”  [laughing] 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it must be the act ...[indistinct] 
something. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That is so Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Then ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I think we are looking at... we should be 
20 
looking at the regulations, should we not be? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  The regulations... if you would turn with 
me Mr Chair to the file Divider 19 at page 445. 
MR JULY:  I have got it. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Of the same bundle. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 30 of 255 
 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  You have got it? 
MR JULY:  The number? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  445. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say 405? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Double four five Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  445? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That is so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And then, as far as the Standard 
10 
Operating Procedures are concerned.  If you would bear with 
me, I will locate it specific because there is incomplete 
Standard Operating Procedures.  I want to provide you with 
the complete set Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry.  You say this is... these regulations 
are not complete? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  No, these regulations are complete. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are complete, ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So you want to look at the three 
instruments that the witness has referred to.  It is the Act, 
20 
the regulations and the Standard Operating Procedures.   
 
As far as the Standard Operating Procedures are 
concerned, the copy that I had was incomplete.  I want to 
provide Mr July with a complete copy.  If you will just bear 
with me? 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 31 of 255 
 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Well, 
the 
part 
relating 
to 
Standard 
Operating Procedures, is it part two of what is not there? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Pardon me, Mr Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The part that deals with the standard... oh, 
but I think the part that we are looking for in the Standard 
Operating Procedures is the one that talks about what types 
of reports are contemplated. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it not in what we have? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  It is not the... because the other witness 
10 
has referred to additional aspects. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, oh. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I understand Mr July is also going to 
refer to the additional aspects. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  But Mr July, do you happen to have the 
relevant parts from....?  Maybe he should just read to us the 
relevant part. 
MR JULY:  [Indistinct] [Microphone not turned on] 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, switch on your mic and you can keep it 
on Mr July.  Ja, keep it on for the time.  Ja. 
MR JULY:  Oh, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe you can just read us... to read the 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 32 of 255 
 
relevant parts of the ...[intervenes]  
MR JULY:  The ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  ...the interim and the final reports? 
MR JULY:  It says Chair: 
“The case investigative report refers to investigative 
report that include the interim case ...[indistinct] 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  And you are reading from what part of the 
Standard Operating Procedures? 
MR JULY:  Ja, the Standard Operating Procedures. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  They have like ...[intervenes]  
MR JULY:  But no one... it is not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  ....not like paragraph or anything. 
MR JULY:  [Indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:  The definition clause. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Alright. 
MR JULY:  The definition clause. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright, alright.  Just read, ja. 
20 
MR JULY:  And it talks about the interim report, final case, 
investigate report, as well as, closure report.  That is what it 
says. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes. 
MR JULY:  So the point I was making in addition to that 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 33 of 255 
 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes? 
MR JULY:  ...you will not read any word here even if it is not 
included 
here 
which 
talks 
to 
the 
preliminary 
report 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Or provisional report. 
MR JULY:  ...which talks provisional report, which talks to 
the draft report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  You will know where to find it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do the Standard Operating Procedures 
define what an interim report is? 
MR JULY:  I think it does Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is final. 
MR JULY:  It does. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you want to just read that point there? 
MR JULY:  I will do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, please.  Ja. 
MR JULY:  Then it defines the interim report Chair to mean... 
let me go there.   
20 
“Interim case presentative investigative report means 
a case investigative report where the investigations 
have been completed but where a recommendation 
cannot be made to the DPP due to outstanding 
technical reports.  However, recommendation may be 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 34 of 255 
 
made to the SAPS...” 
 
I think that is where I need to explain to you now Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is fine. 
MR 
JULY: 
 
When 
IPID 
investigates, 
there 
are 
two 
possibilities.  The investigate a criminal part.  They also 
investigate the misconduct part.   
 
So when they investigate the misconduct part or both 
and they have got an interim report, they cannot make 
recommendation on the criminal part.  Then that report will 
qualify as an interim report because it does not have 
10 
recommendations.  It is the interim report. 
 
But the one... that very interim report can be regarded 
as a final report for misconduct purposes.  That is why it 
goes to SAPS for SAPS to discipline its own employees. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  Yes.  So interim report can be used for two 
purposes.  One, it is a reporting without recommendations 
which does not go to the DPP or even if it goes but it 
remains an interim report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Now, I hope somebody in your team 
Mr Hulley will be working to get us ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...the Standard Operating Procedures. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 35 of 255 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I will provide you with it shortly Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I just want to make sure I understand 
the definition Mr July.  For many of us here in the room, 
interim means provisional in the sense that we think about 
an interim order. 
MR JULY:  Jip. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is an order that may be... that may need 
to be confirmed later or discharged, you know. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It does not represent a final view. 
10 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR JULY:  I agree Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That ...[intervenes]  
MR JULY:  That is... I agree Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because of our legal background. 
MR JULY:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Now, what I am trying to understand 
is whether that is the same meaning that is contemplated 
about 
an 
interim 
report 
in 
the 
Standard 
Operating 
20 
Procedures or whether interim report does not carry that 
meaning.   
 
In other words, it may be called interim for all intense 
and purposes it is final.  That is what I am trying to 
understand. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 36 of 255 
 
MR JULY:  No ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of the Standard Operating 
Procedures. 
MR JULY:  Not.  No, it is final insofar as it relates to 
misconduct part. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  Insofar as it relates to the criminal part of the 
investigation, it is not final. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR 
JULY: 
 
It 
is 
interim. 
 
It 
does 
not 
even 
have 
10 
recommendations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  You do not even know what is this person’s prima 
facie vision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  It could mean that you have just collected the 
information, we have got evidence and it is still called a 
report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR JULY:  Because it does not have recommendations. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So as you understand the Standard 
Operating Procedures, the provisions relating to interim 
report, the only thing that makes it interim is the absence of 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 37 of 255 
 
the recommendations? 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And does it... as you understand those 
provisions in the Standard Operating Procedures, do they 
seem to restrict an interim report to the criminal part of the 
investigating of the report? 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Therefore, in other words, it does not 
10 
contemplate 
that 
a 
report 
that 
does 
not 
have 
recommendations or in regard to misconduct, would also 
be... would also fall within the definition of interim report? 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that how you understand it? 
MR JULY:  This is how I understand it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR JULY:  There is information that would be missing.   It 
does not just become interim because I want to call it 
interim.  What that information that would be missing, is 
20 
mention, that they could be technical reports that are 
outstanding. 
 
Because the technical report is outstanding, then it 
remains an interim for criminal purposes because there is 
not technical report. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 38 of 255 
 
 
But that very report, you can make recommendations 
without a technical report to the SAPS for purposes of 
misconduct.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But for purposes of the criminal part, you 
cannot make a recommendation ...[intervenes]  
MR JULY:  You cannot. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ... at that stage. 
MR JULY:  You cannot. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  You cannot. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Therefore, it is interim. 
MR JULY:  It is interim. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If and when you get to the records 
...[intervenes]  
MR JULY:  The ...[indistinct], yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then it can be... it seizes to be interim, 
once you have got that and made... and then you put in your 
recommendation. 
20 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or... ja. 
MR JULY:  Then it becomes the final report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then it becomes the final report. 
MR JULY:  Once you have that outstanding information 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 39 of 255 
 
which is specifically mentioned which is the information that 
is outstanding which makes a report an interim, the Standard 
Operating Procedures makes it very clear what type of 
information is that.  It is only a technical report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A technical report.  Yes, yes. 
MR JULY:  That makes it interim. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
MR JULY:  And so ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:  Mr Chair... sorry, for your benefit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja? 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:  The relevant document is at page 1542.  
This is of LEA4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV HULLEY SC:  LEA4 and it is at page 1542 of that 
bundle.  It is part of annexure... or Exhibit Y8D. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So let us continue Mr July while I am 
looking at that. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At least on your understanding, if IPID 
provides a report and in regard to... and the report deals 
20 
with the criminal part and the disciplinary part, if in regard to 
the criminal part there is a technical report still outstanding, 
then that report is interim. 
MR JULY:  Interim, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But does... do the provisions contemplate 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 40 of 255 
 
that you referred to that report as interim even if in regard to 
the disciplinary matters it is final? 
MR JULY:  It seems to suggest. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR JULY:  That because there is an outstanding report for 
the purposes of ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  The criminal part. 
MR JULY:  ...for purposes of criminal part. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR JULY:  But you can still make recommendations for the 
10 
purposes of ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  A disciplinary. 
MR JULY:  ...of a disciplinary hearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR JULY:  Misconduct, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  So once there is outstanding 
information 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
criminal 
part 
and 
the 
information 
that 
is 
outstanding 
is 
information 
as 
contemplated in the definition of interim report, namely a 
technical report, then that report is interim? 
20 
MR JULY:  It is interim. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It does not matter that in regard to the 
disciplinary matters, there is nothing outstanding? 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And on your understanding, if in regard to 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 41 of 255 
 
the criminal part there is no report outstanding, technical 
reports outstanding and there is a recommendation but in 
regard to the disciplinary matters, there is still something 
outstanding 
and 
there 
is 
no 
recommendation 
on 
the 
disciplinary matters, would that on your... would that report 
on your understanding fall under interim or where would it 
fall? 
MR JULY:  It will still be interim. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It will still be interim? 
MR JULY:  Once it does not have ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Everything? 
MR JULY:  ...recommendations. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Once 
it 
does 
not 
have 
the 
recommendations. 
MR JULY:  Have recommendations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR JULY:  Even for the purposes of disciplinary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  If it does not have recommendations, it will 
remain an interim. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Okay, okay. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair.  I think for your 
benefit Mr July, the paginated document that you are 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 42 of 255 
 
referring to is at page 1549. 
MR JULY:  1549, same bundle? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Part of Bundle LEA4. 
MR JULY:  One... you said page? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  1549. 
MR JULY:  1549. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And this Mr Chair for your benefit is 
Exhibit Y8D.  It is the response.  It is an annexure to the 
response of Mr Sesoko to the affidavit of Mr July.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
MR JULY:  Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  The document starts on page 1542.  I 
think the definition you were referring to is at... is on page 
1549.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, the final one is at 1548 and then the 
...[intervenes]  
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It says interim case investigative report. It 
means: 
“A case investigative report where the investigation 
20 
has been completed but where a recommendation 
cannot be made to the DPP due to outstanding 
technical reports.  However, recommendation may be 
made to the SAPS...” 
 
Well, on that definition, as I understand it.  Mr July, it 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 43 of 255 
 
seems to me that you may not have been accurate or correct 
when you said, as I understood you, that even if something 
is still missing on the disciplinary part it could still be 
interim. 
 
From this definition, it appears to me that what must be 
missing is a recommendation to the DPP.  And obviously, the 
DPP has nothing to do with misconduct issues. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Am I right to think you were not accurate? 
MR JULY:  Chair, no.  I think ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or did I misunderstand you? 
MR JULY:  I think Chair will insist that I am accurate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I may have misunderstood you. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR JULY:  What I am saying Chair.  If you read that 
definition, the first part, it says it is an investigation which 
has been completed which is something that we are going to 
deal with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes. 
20 
MR JULY:  What does it mean an investigation is completed? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  Then it says but where a recommendation cannot 
be made.  So investigation is one thing.  Now we are talking 
about the report.  But it says investigation is completed, 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 44 of 255 
 
alright.  But that completed report on investigation, lacks 
technical reports. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Reports.  Yes.   
MR JULY:  Right.  But the investigation is completed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  But it lacks technical report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  So that report that you are writing is interim. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no.  I accept that. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought when I asked you the question 
whether if the criminal part has got a recommendation of the 
report ...[intervenes]  
MR JULY:  No, no, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...but there is no recommendation in 
regard to disciplinary matters, whether it would still be an 
interim report? 
MR JULY:  No, I misunderstood you Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR JULY:  No, I misunderstood you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Okay, okay. 
MR JULY:  Because immediately it has recommendation, it 
changes completely. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 45 of 255 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, no. 
MR JULY:  Yes, it changes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, because I wanted to see ...[intervenes]  
MR JULY:  No, no, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...the only thing that makes it interim in 
terms of this, is the absence of a recommendation because 
of outstanding technical reports and so on. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No, this point I understand now.  
Then the... at page 1548, the definition of final investigative 
10 
report. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It says, that means: 
“An investigative report which documents the entire 
investigation and contains the conclusion, summary 
of 
affidavits 
and 
technical 
reports, 
written 
recommendations to SAPS, DPP with regard to the 
actions to the SAPS, MPS member concerned...” 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I see there is a definition of full 
20 
investigation just below that.  It says: 
“That refers to where a case-worker takes over a 
docket/copies of the docket from the SAPS.  Conduct 
an independent inquiry and assessment and proceed 
with any other search inquiry for further evidence to 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 46 of 255 
 
enable him or her to make a finding...” 
 
Okay.  Alright.  So a final case investigative report, you 
must... 
the 
report 
must 
be 
documenting 
the 
entire 
investigation. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And must contain the conclusion, summary 
of affidavits and technical reports and must have reached 
recommendation to SAPS, DPP with regard to the actions of 
SAPS and MPS member concerned. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
MR JULY:  So you will notice Chair there are two issues that 
makes this report that you have just read, it different from 
interim. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes. 
MR JULY:  One is that, that outstanding information, which 
is a technical report, is included in the final. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  And not... and the other thing that has been 
included now is the recommendations. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  Once it has the recommendation... once it has 
technical report, it becomes a final report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 47 of 255 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course... an important part of your 
evidence relates to the question whether the investigation 
was complete ...[intervenes]  
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...at the time that ...[intervenes]  
 
MR JULY:  Yes, exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...the report of the 22 nd of January was 
submitted. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it seems from this definition that that 
is important because if the investigation has not been 
completed, then it would not fall within the definition of final.  
Is that right? 
MR JULY:  Yes.  Mr Chair, can I clarify something? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes, yes. 
MR JULY:  There are two issues here.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR JULY:  And we need to deal with them correctly.  And the 
terminology, we must get it right. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR JULY:  What we are busy talking about is the report and 
the final report.  When we talk about investigations, we are 
going to deal with that separately because ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no.  Mr July ...[intervenes]  
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 48 of 255 
 
MR JULY:  Yes? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The definition of final case investigative 
report 
that 
we 
have 
just 
looked 
at, 
refers 
to 
an 
investigative... it says that is an investigative report which 
documents the entire investigations. 
MR JULY:  Yes, I agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:  An entire investigation seems to me to 
refer to a completed investigations. 
MR JULY:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would you go along with that? 
10 
MR JULY:  But the draft of the SOP, they felt it was 
necessary to make a distinction between the actual report 
that you write and the investigation itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  So they distinction here.  That is why I want us... 
I agree with you Chair that in any event when you have the 
final report, you would have completed your investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes. 
MR JULY:  But I am saying, the SOP, they decided the draft 
...[indistinct]  That we are going to have these two 
20 
terminologies.  The issue about the report defines differently 
from the actual investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR JULY:  So that is why they have got a term called 
completed investigations. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 49 of 255 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  Preliminary investigation.  But of it, of course, it 
will end up to a final report or an interim report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes. 
MR JULY:  So that is why I was saying, when we deal with 
them, we must first talk about whether the investigation was 
completed because you must remember Chair what is the 
allegation.   
 
First is, that the allegation is that the investigation itself 
was not complete and which is the reason why the docket 
10 
had to be requested to come back to complete the 
investigation. 
 
Now this SOP explains what is a complete investigation 
and what is a preliminary investigation.  So I am saying, we 
may have to go back. 
 
As much as we are on report, but we may have to go 
back to deal with the terminologies to what does it mean to 
be completed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no.  That is fair enough.  I think we 
might not be at cross-purposes. 
20 
MR JULY:  Ja-no, we are not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We might not be at cross-purposes. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because as I see it, you cannot be said... 
you cannot document in a report the entire investigation 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 50 of 255 
 
unless the investigation has been completed. 
MR JULY:  Is completed.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see? 
MR JULY:  Yes, I agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that is where I am coming from. 
MR JULY:  I agree Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, if you are going to complete the 
investigation, whatever the document, it is not the entire 
investigation. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.   
MR JULY:  Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Hulley. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  In fairness to you Mr July.  I think you 
were trying to wrap up or to explain these definitions with 
reference, obviously, to the body of the SOP.  How you can 
apply it in the context of the SOP.  Perhaps you can just 
...[intervenes]  
MR JULY:  Do you want me to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I just want to say... I am sorry.  I am 
20 
sorry. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I know that I probably took Mr July off his 
track but I think I took him off his track to another very 
important ...[intervenes]  
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 51 of 255 
 
MR JULY:  Very important, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So this discussion, I think, has been very 
important but I am quite happy that you take him back to 
track. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair. 
MR JULY:  Yes, yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Mr July, to be fair.  I mean, you are 
welcome, if you think you have been diverted, you are 
welcome, of course, to go back to where you thought you 
were going but I thought you were going to take these 
10 
definitions and you were going to plug them in to the body of 
the SOP. 
MR JULY:  Yes.  Now Chair, now before I go to the SOP, I 
would then have to say, to make a reference to a report.  You 
will recall Chair that there were two reports.  The one report 
is dated the 22 nd of January 2014.   
 
The other one has got two dates, of course, in it but it is 
what is commonly referred to as the 18 March report, right.  
We can call it March or April, but there are two reports. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR JULY:  Now, how did the first report come about?  That 
is the question.  The first report, you will recall, what 
happened 
in 
November 
2013. 
 
Khuba 
conducted 
the 
investigation and came with the report in 2013, and he 
submitted that report to Mosing.  What I do know, what I 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 52 of 255 
 
had been told is that all this investigation, most of them, 
they are so-called prosecutorial investigations, there would 
also always be a prosecutor involved.  Now he does the 
investigation, Khuba, comes up with a report and if you 
look 
at 
that 
report, 
Chair, 
it 
does 
not 
have 
recommendation.  That is the November report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  On the 22 n d and they prosecutor 
who was assigned to Khuba then write a memo, the same 
year, November, and stating what is outstanding in that 
report, right?  That in January, Khuba goes with what he 
10 
considered to be a final report.  He takes it to the 
prosecution authority, with the docket and says here is my 
report.  So you guys, you must proceed with whatever you 
want to do because the reason why it goes for the  
Prosecution Authority is because there is something wrong 
that 
has 
happened. 
 
Otherwise, 
if 
you 
make 
no 
recommendation to the Prosecution Authority, there is no 
reason why the docket should go there, right? 
 
It goes there because there is a recommendation.  
He makes a recommendation, then it gets to Mosing and 
20 
Mosing says no, no, no, Khuba, there is something missing 
in this report and you will notice, Mr Chair, the report that I 
am talking about had 25 pages.  25 pages and Mosing 
writes on that report, it is dated 22 n d, Draft, and say to 
Khuba, Khuba, please go and include your own statement.  
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 53 of 255 
 
We need to know how did you go about to produce – how 
did you go about you producing this report?  So those 
statement must be included in this report.  Khuba goes 
with the report.   
What he then does, he comes back with the report 
after two days.  Now I am quoting what Mosing says.  
Mosing says Khuba comes back with a report after two 
days.  So two days is 24 January but now with that report 
has got 30 something pages because Khuba included his 
statement.  Again, it is signed.  You remember he signed 
10 
the first one thinking that there is no need for anything, it 
has his signature.  Mosing write “Draft”, so you will have 
two draft, a November one, which was a draft which was 
interim in nature, then you have what was considered by 
Khuba as final report, being written “Draft” because it led 
Khuba’s statement.   
Then Khuba include the statement, it comes back 
on the 24 t h but what has not changed is the date of the 
22 n d.  We call it the 22 n d January report when in fact the 
report, 
which 
had 
Khuba’s 
statement 
which 
was 
20 
outstanding, was submitted on the 24 t h and Mosing said I 
did not feel it was even necessary to ask Khuba to change 
22 n d to 24 t h.  So that report is the final report.  Why I am 
saying 
it 
is 
the 
final 
report, 
it 
had 
one, 
the 
recommendations.  Once it has recommendations, it had 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 54 of 255 
 
the technical report.  So that is what makes it a final 
report.  
On the basis of that, in February – I think around 
the 8 February 2014, Mosing writes a memo and say now 
the investigation has been finalised, please find the 
following.  Now that memo is going to DPP, Chauke, in 
Johannesburg, for a decision whether to prosecute or not 
to prosecute.  But the state of that report, Chair, is final.  
It is final in every respect.   
So he list the documents that are there.  You have 
10 
been told that normally – but let me not rush and get to 
what was missing because I will tell you the versions that 
have been given about that report, various versions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  One second?  There is a file that  - 
two which I referred during Mr Nhleko’s evidence that I am 
looking for, the one that has got handwritten notes of it.  
You need water – they did not give you water. 
MR JULY:   I need some water, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They should have put some water… 
MR JULY:   That is Mr Hulley’s strategy towards me. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:   He asks for it and then complains when 
I give it to him. 
MR JULY:   [Laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, no that is fine.  Well, we are 
about to take the lunch break. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 55 of 255 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:   The tea adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not lunch break, tea break. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Mr Chair, perhaps I could be of 
assistance, which bundle are you looking for, Mr Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I do not know the name of the 
bundle but I can deal with – I deal with this.  There is a 
memo and maybe the one you are referring to is the one. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That was written by Adv Mosing. 
MR JULY:   Yes, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   To Mr Chauke. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And to Ms Jiba. 
MR JULY:   Nomgcobo Jiba. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Nomgcobo Jiba.  Where, as I 
understand it, he says something that suggests to me that 
the report – there was still something outstanding here that 
he wrote, I think in terms of the notes I made here, which I 
also read to Mr Nhleko, it is the memo of 13 February 2014 
and in paragraph 6.3 of his memo I say: 
20 
“Mr Mosing said in part when talking about his view 
that Major General Sibiya did not appear to have 
been involved.” 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He said the following and I quote: 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 56 of 255 
 
“The 
cell 
phone 
evidence, 
however, 
does 
not 
corroborate his presence during the operations.  
This can be looked at again more closely after an 
expert has been procured to analyse the cell phone  
data.  This could not be done by the time of writing 
this report despite it being pointed out to the 
investigating team.” 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So when I read this, the impression I 
had was well, Mr Mosing is saying there is a need for an 
10 
expert to analyse cell phone records.   
MR JULY:   Yes, yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have told the investigators to get that 
done but they have not got that done. 
MR JULY:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And if that is factually true, my 
inclination would then that report of the 22 n d could not be 
said to be final.  What do you say to that? 
MR JULY:   Let me tell you why that report was final. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR JULY:   That report was final, one, recommendations.  
You will see in the list of the documents that Mosing is 
forwarding, he writes – there is a handwritten report that 
he is referring to there.  That handwritten report is the 
report that was provided but in handwritten that you cannot 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 57 of 255 
 
locate Sibiya in Diepsloot.  That information is known to 
Khuba, is known to Mosing but is in handwriting, right?   
 
He writes it in the list of the documents that he is 
submitting but now here is an issue, he then says we may 
have – we cannot be held back by this.  Now the context of 
that statement – and Mosing should be called – the context 
of that statement, you have got two witnesses – I think 
three witnesses, the two witnesses who were part of the 
investigation, Campbell and someone else and one of the 
civilian – the victim, one of the people who were victims, 
10 
the family members, who claimed that they have seen 
Sibiya.  Now Mosing says this issue we cannot conclude it 
but here is the report, it is handwritten, it says Sibiya was 
not in Diepsloot.   
So let us go to the March, just to visit March for the 
purposes of this, you go to the March report which they 
considered now to be final.  What is different in terms of 
analysis, it is the same, but the difference is that it is 
typed.  That is all, it is that same report which says Sibiya 
was not in Diepsloot although the witnesses, two or three 
20 
witnesses say he was there, but that report, Khuba collects 
it, it is now a typed report.  You are not going to find 
anything in the March report which tells you as a result of 
an analysis, what was submitted has changed is the same 
information 
which 
says 
Sibiya 
was 
not 
involved 
in 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 58 of 255 
 
Diepsloot. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Now I think we seem to be on the 
same page with regard to the principle that if there is still 
a report outstanding, then you would accept that the report 
is not final. 
MR JULY:   I would accept that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you would accept that. 
MR JULY:   I would accept it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think that is important.  So what then 
remains is that you are saying there was no report 
10 
outstanding here. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The part that I have read from Mr 
Mosing’s memo is that – actually, he puts it as there is still 
analysis to be done, you know?  Now you would then say, 
based on your evidence on what you have said, you could 
say, I imagine, he is wrong to say, that is analysis to be 
done because you say the analysis has been done, it is 
contained in the handwritten report. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Whereas he says the analysis is still to 
be done.  I do not know whether in your investigation you 
deal with him – you kind of confronted him with it to say 
how could you say the analysis outstanding because the 
analysis has been done and if you did, what did he say? 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 59 of 255 
 
MR JULY:   If I remember well, Chair, the context was 
explained which is you have got two versions.  One, you 
have got an analyst’s report which is handwritten which 
says Sibiya was not in Diepsloot.  You have got witnesses 
that says Sibiya was in Diepsloot but the report which says 
Sibiya was not in Diepsloot, it is there.  therefore, the 
statement that he makes, it cannot be divorced from the 
context. I could be that he wanted to address how do we 
deal with this issue that there are witnesses that would 
have seen Sibiya but we have an analysis which says 
10 
Sibiya was in Pretoria when this happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I understand that part. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am asking the different question 
whether 
during 
your 
investigation 
when 
you 
had 
to 
interview Mr Mosing and being aware of this part of his 
memo whether you did say to him but how can you say in 
this memo that there is analysis outstanding from a 
technical expert or whatever because here is the analysis, 
it just happens to be in handwritten form. 
20 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that something you raised or not 
really? 
MR JULY:   No, not in that fashion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not directly. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 60 of 255 
 
MR JULY:   Not directly in that fashion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not directly, okay, okay. 
MR JULY:   Because we picked up what he was explaining. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR JULY:   That no, no, no, his understanding, which is 
why he was saying it is final, you must look at how he 
starts.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR JULY:   His memorandum. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR JULY:   He starts by saying now it is final, the 
investigation has been finalised.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR JULY:    And now it is for you to take a decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR JULY:   And you remember, Chair, we are talking of a 
very experienced Advocate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR 
JULY: 
  Who 
has 
been 
allocated 
dealing 
with 
specifically with this special project who was chosen 
20 
deliberately to deal with this matter.   So he knows what he 
is doing.  So when he says this issue can still be dealt with 
– and that is exactly the attitude that was adopted by Adv 
Baloyi and Mzinyathi when they were given the same 
reports by Mr Nkhosani because Mr Nkhosani was also 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 61 of 255 
 
confronted by the same thing, for these two reports.  So 
what do we do? 
CHAIRPERSON:   But, of course – well, I do not know how 
experienced Mr Mosing is, of course, but I take what you 
say that he is an experienced, you know, prosecutor or 
advocate precisely because he is experience and precisely 
because he seems to have been part of this investigation 
from its inception. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It kind of surprises one if he says there 
10 
is analysis still outstanding, if in fact that is not so. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You understand that? 
MR JULY:   I understand that but I am saying, Chair, you 
cannot read that paragraph in isolation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just say that again? 
MR JULY:   I am saying that paragraph cannot be read 
isolation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No obviously, it should not be read in 
isolation, it should be …[intervenes] 
20 
MR JULY:   Yes.  And we also had the benefit of speaking 
to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes.  Yes, you see, this 
particular issue, what I am saying, it is just that it is 
important to come to a point whether at a factual level he 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 62 of 255 
 
was correct in saying there was analysis still outstanding 
because I think you and I have agreed that if factually he 
was correct then the report of the 22 January was not final 
but you have said he was not factually correct because 
there was analysis that he was talking about, it just 
happened to be in handwritten form.  That is what you said. 
MR JULY:   And that view, Chair, is confirmed even by the 
subsequent report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
MR JULY:   That there was no analysis. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR JULY:   There was no further analysis that was done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Yes, not that is why it 
becomes important to – that you tell me what you can tell 
me. 
MR JULY:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To show that there was no analysis that 
was outstanding.   
MR JULY:   Outstanding at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then, the next question would be to 
20 
say one, you may – it may be legitimate for you to say 
well, the report of the expert may have been in handwritten 
form but I think the fact that it is not typed does not make 
it – does not render the report not final.   
Maybe 
Mr 
Khuba, 
maybe 
Mr 
McBride, 
maybe 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 63 of 255 
 
somebody else might say well, that is where we differ, we 
think it makes a difference.  Then we know where the 
differences are. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it is a question of just – so 
identifying where the difference are. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR JULY:   You see, where they fail, they do not show you, 
Chair, they do not show this Commission after that analysis 
10 
what other analysis did they get after the handwritten one.  
For them to be able to produce the 18 January because if it 
was outstanding, they should be telling you, Chair, and say 
we then obtained, after the 22 January, an analysis which 
was outstanding, which informs the report of March. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR JULY:   There is no such thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Mr Hulley, I am sure you 
are looking at both of us and saying we are having this 
conversation by ourselves but …[intervenes] 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:   No, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   After the tea break, I will let you 
continue. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is just that for me these are some of 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 64 of 255 
 
the really important issues. 
MR JULY:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I want to be sure that I understand 
exactly where Mr July stands. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I raise my own issues with him. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I think let us take the tea break, we 
are at twenty two minutes past eleven.  Let us take a break 
and return at twenty to twelve.   
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue, you may proceed, 
Mr Hulley.  Your mic. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Pardon me, Mr Chair.  For the benefit 
of the witness and for yourself, Mr Chair, there is a bundle 
which is marked as EXHIBIT Y6, that is one the historic 
bundles that does not follow the current formatting and the 
20 
specific document that we are referring to is at page 322 of 
that bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   It would perhaps be useful if we all 
spoke on the same page. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 65 of 255 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR JULY:   Yes, thank you, Mr Hulley.  Chair, can I before 
Mr Hulley takes me back to where we were, to deal with 
that page, because I wanted to address this issue about 
the outstanding information. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR JULY:   If you read paragraph 2 …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, which bundle? 
MR JULY:   Y6, 322. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The one that has just been handed up to 
10 
me. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, what page? 
MR JULY:   Page 322. 
CHAIRPERSON:   322.  Yes.  Oh, ja, that is the memo to 
which I was referring. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR JULY:   They start by giving the purpose of the memo, 
I am not going to read that.  Then paragraph 2, it gives the 
20 
background.  He says: 
“The investigations...” 
Supposed to say investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR JULY:   “...has now been finalised.” 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 66 of 255 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR JULY:   “...and a report from the IPID has been  
submitted for purposes of considering the 
merits of the case.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR JULY:     “The case docket comprising of two lever  
arch files together of other files containing 
the 
cellular 
phone 
data 
and 
evidence 
obtained from the computer belonging to the 
DPCI is also enclosed.” 
10 
So I want to Chair to bear in mind when we talk about that 
cell phone, that it is going come up every now and then. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR JULY:   Because that is the issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR JULY:   Whether the cell phone data, what is it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR JULY:   That was outstanding, [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja, okay.  Maybe we can just for the 
20 
sake of completeness, if we can identify the one that I also 
mentioned, I think – ja, 6.3.  It is at page 327. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Says: 
“The involvement of other senior police officers 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 67 of 255 
 
could not be established beyond reasonable doubt 
including the head of the DPCI, Gauteng, Major 
General Sibiya who, it is alleged, was present 
during the first two operations but the evidence is 
not conclusive.  He is also responsible for the 
[indistinct] 03.23 in Gauteng and it is unlikely that 
the 
operations 
were 
carried 
out 
without 
his 
knowledge.  The cell phone evidence, however, 
does 
not 
corroborate 
his 
presence 
during 
the 
operations.  This can be looked at again more 
10 
closely after an expert witness has been procured 
to analyse the cell phone data.  This could not be 
done by the time of writing this report despite it 
being pointed out to the investigating team.” 
Okay, I just was saying for the sake of completeness. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Hulley, proceed. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  Now just to be 
clear, as far as this is concerned, Mr July, if I understand 
correctly, what Advocate Mosing is saying – said to you in 
20 
an interview is that at this point in time, i.e. 22 January 
2014 or 24 January 2014, to be more specific, the analysis 
of the cell phone records was complete except – then the 
only difference between what was in existence at that point 
and what was in existence at the later point, i.e. 18 March 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 68 of 255 
 
2014, was the fact that the report was compiled or the 
analysis 
had 
been 
done 
in 
a 
handwritten 
form 
and 
subsequently it was done through a typed document.  Do I 
understand that correctly? 
MR JULY:   No. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay. 
MR JULY:   Mosing does not talk about even during our 
interview, he does not talk about the handwritten and the 
typed version.  Mosing, during our interview, says they had 
the phone unlisted which says Mr Sibiya – General Sibiya 
10 
was not in Diepsloot but there is this evidence by these 
witnesses which say he was there.  As we understand, 
when we spoke to him, that issue is an issue that can still 
be dealt with at a later stage and even – I was about to 
talk about Baloyi, Baloyi and Mzinyathi, they say the same 
thing, they say when they realised that there are witnesses 
that have seen Sibiya but the cell phone record places 
them somewhere.  They said it is in the nature of the 
prosecution that you will never – but until you go to court 
be in a position conclusively say the investigation is 
20 
completed because they will always be that information 
which would be required.  So the point that I am trying to 
make is, although there was this contradiction, if that 
contradiction is not resolved at some point, that they will 
have to decide what they do with that. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 69 of 255 
 
ADV 
HULLEY 
SC: 
 
 
Yes. 
 
Now, 
if 
I 
understand 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think the answer to your question 
because, I mean, Mr July did answer it but I think partly 
because he – you asked him whether Mr Mosing said a 
certain thing to him during interview, he said no, that is not 
what he said and I think that is correct.  But I think what he 
made clear earlier on, Mr July, was that the context was 
different when they had a discussion, it was not a question 
of asking him directly, how do you – why do you say there 
10 
is analysis then outstanding because here is the analysis, 
he did not ask him directly but they were focusing on the 
fact that there were certain witnesses who said they had 
seen Mr Sibiya there and yet the cell phone records 
suggestion something else.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  Now in this 
particular memorandum of the 13 February 2014, he 
speaks of – on paragraph 2, the paragraph that you 
referred to on page 322, there Mr Mosing’s or Advocate 
Mosing, I believe it is, speaks to the cellular phone data 
20 
and evidence obtained from a computer so he seems to be 
speaking there of data as opposed to which implies that it 
may be raw data, as opposed to an analysis of that data.  
Do I understand that – do I misunderstand that? 
MR JULY:   No, no, I think you understand it very well but I 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 70 of 255 
 
do not know what is it that you want me to answer, but you 
understand it very well, it is a phone, cell phone data. 
This is what I meant, Chair.  Khuba asked for all 
your telecommunications – your cell phone companies, Cell 
C, Vodacom, MTN, took provide with information, he has 
got the information.  He takes the information to people to 
analyse that information.  They look at the cell phones who 
called who and who SMSed who.  They finalised that.  That 
issue is finalised.  That there is a number of SMSes on the 
5 November 2010 that were from Maluleke to Sibiya, from 
10 
Sibiya to Dramat and Lebeya, right?  That is a data.  That 
is one form of analysis.  The other analysis was to locate 
the people who are implicated.   
Where was Sibiya at the time precisely on the 6 
November 2010?  Where was Sibiya?  That is the 
information I am saying was in handwritten, it was present, 
it was known to anybody, to everybody, and was put in the 
list by Mosing in the document and listed the documents 
that are submitted as handwritten, I do not know which 
paragraph. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Are you referring to specific document 
now? 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are looking for the handwritten…? 
MR JULY:   Where it says handwritten, where Mosing 
…[intervenes] 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 71 of 255 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh where it says draft? 
MR JULY:   Where is listing, yes, where is listing the 
document that is …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is attaching, is enclosing. 
MR JULY:   There is no attachment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR JULY:   But is listing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MR JULY:   It could be that, yes.  But that document was 
attached, that that document – that is why he comes to the 
10 
conclusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR JULY:   That we know now that Sibiya was not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR JULY:   And you cannot do that by analysing SMSes, 
no, you cannot.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR JULY:   You have to do another analysis. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR JULY:   For you to be able to say there was Sibiya at 
20 
the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR JULY:   So that was done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Yes, okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  I think just 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 72 of 255 
 
moving ahead.  So you have got the 22 January report, 
here are in fact three 22 January reports, as you are aware 
of. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   The one has got the word draft on it, 
one was in fact emailed by Mr Khuba to Mr Sesoko. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And the third one is the one that you 
say was …[intervenes] 
MR JULY:   Signed, yes. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Delivered to Adv Mosing. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   On the 24 January. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now, the first one which has the word 
draft on it, the word draft is inscribed there by Adv Mosing. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And that is because, according to Adv 
Mosing, according to the interview that you had with 
Advocate Mosing, he says he wrote draft there because the 
20 
statement of Mr Khuba had not been – as the investigator, 
had not been included. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now at that stage, i.e. on the 22 
January when it seems everybody, it is common cause, as 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 73 of 255 
 
between Mr Mosing and – or Adv Mosing and Mr Khuba that 
he delivered the 22 January report, you are saying that 
that report was not a final report, if I understood you 
correctly in your discussion with the Chairperson. 
MR JULY:   Which one is that? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   The one that had draft on it. 
MR JULY:    The one that had draft on it, yes, that is what 
I am saying, that is the version of Mosing and I think it 
does say that even in his affidavit. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Sure. 
10 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So – but I am trying to understand 
what you are saying, you are saying that it was not a final 
report. 
MR JULY:   Can I explain this?  That report was not final 
because, as we have read, Chair, the final report requires 
recommendations, so there were not recommendations, so 
Khuba was asked to go and add recommendations so that 
is 
why 
it 
took 
him 
just 
two 
days 
to 
go 
and 
add 
recommendations, 
comes 
back 
with 
recommendations 
20 
which 
is 
the 
same 
report 
but 
it 
did 
not 
have 
recommendations, then it became a final report because it 
has the same date. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Sure. 
MR JULY:   Of the 22 n d. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 74 of 255 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:   I think, least we be confused, perhaps 
we should turn to the document of the bundle which is 
marked LAE2.  That is correct? 
MR JULY:   Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And you have attached several 
documents to your affidavit.  It is part of your affidavit. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Which is EXHIBIT Y8B.  If you could 
turn with me to page 645. 
MR JULY:   645?  I am there. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Is that the document that you are 
referring to? 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And you would see the word draft 
inscribed in manuscript. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And the top of that page.  Now if you 
would turn with me to page 670 of the same bundle.  Have 
you got it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   600 and…? 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:   670, Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, at the end. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   That is right.  Do you see that, sir? 
MR JULY:   670? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes, have you got the page? 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 75 of 255 
 
MR JULY:   Oh, yes, yes, yes.  And if you look at the 
heading which is on the preceding page, which is at page 
669, can you read that heading to us? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, what did you say he must 
look at? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   There is a heading at the foot of the 
page. 
CHAIRPERSON:   670? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   On the preceding page, which on  page 
669.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR JULY:   Recommendations? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   That is right.  And if you could go over 
to page 670? 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Can you read that into the record? 
MR JULY:   “Based on the available evidence the  
independent 
Investigative 
Directorate, 
comments that Lieutenant General Dramat, 
Major Sibiya, Maluleke, Constable Radebe, 
20 
Captain S Nkosi, Warrant Officer Makoe be 
charged criminally of kidnapping, defeating 
the ends of justice, assault and theft only 
applicable 
to 
Captain 
Maluleke, 
Warrant 
Officer Makoe, Constable P M Radebe and 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 76 of 255 
 
Captain S Nkosi.” 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And it is signed, is it not? 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So this document was in fact signed 
and it had a recommendation.   
MR JULY:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   The only point I am making is that you 
nevertheless regarded this as an interim report.  Or do I 
misunderstand you? 
MR JULY:   I think you are missing the [indistinct – 
10 
dropping voice] 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Was this a final – I asked you if this 
was final report. 
MR JULY:   It was a final report. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Oh. 
MR JULY:   Because it had recommendation according to 
Khuba.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe let us get this – there may be a I 
misunderstanding. 
MR JULY:   Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Khuba gave Mr Mosing a report. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which, as you understand the position, 
Mr Khuba, regarded as final. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 77 of 255 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And there was nothing further to be done 
by him, as you understand the position. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Khuba – no, Mr Mosing identified that 
the report did not include Mr Khuba’s statement as the 
investigator. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then asked Mr Khuba to submit his 
statement and he wrote on the report “Draft.” 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say, as I understand the 
position, the reason, the only reason why Mr Mosing wrote 
or could have written “Draft” …[intervenes] 
MR JULY:   It is Mr Mosing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was because of Mr Khuba’s outstanding 
statement. 
MR JULY:   Statement, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the next question must therefore be 
at the time that Mr Mosing asked Mr Khuba to submit his 
statement, was this report that he marked “Draft”, did it 
20 
have a recommendation? 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It did, ja. 
MR JULY:   It did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, so …[intervenes] 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 78 of 255 
 
MR JULY:   These are recommendations [inaudible – 
speaking simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it …[intervenes] 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   This report that we are looking at now is 
exactly the report that Mr Mosing wrote “Draft” on. 
MR JULY:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It had a recommendation already, the 
only thing that was outstanding as far as Mr Mosing was 
concerned was Mr …[intervenes] 
10 
MR JULY:   Khuba’s statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Khuba’s statement. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And, as you understand the position, did 
Mr Khuba in two days submit their statement and that 
statement would have been made part of the report? 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you.  Sorry, I was actually 
asking you from your perspective because I understood, 
20 
correct me, of course, if I am wrong, I understood you to 
be saying this was not a final report and I was trying to 
understand that response.  Now I might have of course – I 
might have interpreted what you were saying to me that it 
was an interim report but I am asking you again, was this a 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 79 of 255 
 
final report, not from Mr Khuba’s perspective, from your 
perspective, that is what I am asking. 
MR JULY:   Chair… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR JULY:   We have defined what the final report is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR JULY:   The final report with recommendations. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR JULY:   It is a final report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR JULY:   But what was missing with this final report is 
Mr Khuba’s statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR JULY:   So it was a final report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR JULY:   But what was missing was Khuba’s statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think what you want to say is, 
from your point of view it met the requirements of the 
definition of a final report in the standard operating 
procedures. 
20 
MR JULY:   It did, it did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that is right? 
MR JULY:   I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is what you are saying.  So from 
that point of view it was final. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 80 of 255 
 
MR JULY:   It was final. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you accept that according to Mr 
Mosing Mr Khuba’s statement was not there. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you are saying if you look at the 
definition of a final report in the standard operating 
procedures it met those requirements, that definition. 
MR JULY:   Yes.  Because, you see, what I can understand 
was missing to Mr Mosing is that you come to this 
conclusion but you do not tell us, give us your statement.  
10 
Give us your statement, tell us what did you do.  Who did 
you consult with? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR JULY:   Who did you take statements, that is what 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   What may be – and Mr Hulley might be 
intending to deal with that, to the extent that the definition 
of final – I think it is called Final Case Investigative Report 
to the extent that it says such a report must document the 
entire investigation.  I think the question might be whether 
20 
as long as the investigator ’s statement is not there. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Whether that part is met.  What would 
you say on that? 
MR JULY:   Chair, it would see that …[intervenes] 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 81 of 255 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course it would have become 
complete. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    In two day’s time. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It might not have been …[intervenes] 
MR JULY:   It seemed that is a question of practice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR JULY:   Practice as compared to what constitute a final 
report. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
MR 
JULY: 
 
 
What 
constitute 
a 
final 
report 
are 
recommendations. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR JULY:   But the people who read recommendations, 
they are saying no, no, no, no, for practice purposes we 
want to know from you how did you go about doing the 
report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But just to go back on our 
understanding because I do not want to confuse you in 
20 
terms of what you are saying.   
 
On the definition of final case investigate report as 
it appears in the standard operating procedures, would you 
say that if this investigator ’s statement is not there, the 
report is complete, is final and meets the requirements or 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 82 of 255 
 
would you say no, it does not meet the requirements but 
when Mr Khuba submitted his statement then that report 
met all the requirements or the definition of final case 
investigate report, that is when it became final. 
MR JULY:   Chair, it says if you want to deal with issues of 
recommendation, because it has recommendations and it 
has got all the information that is required then it becomes 
a final report.  Khuba makes the analysis, he comes to the 
conclusion and he makes recommendations.  So it is a final 
report. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Even 
without 
the 
investigator ’s 
statement? 
MR JULY:   Even without the investigator ’s statement in 
terms of the definition. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.   
MR JULY:   But it would seem they have got a practice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR 
JULY: 
 
 
That 
the 
report, 
which 
has 
got 
a 
recommendation, must have your own statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Mr Hulley? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  Now insofar as 
the investigation was concerned, the – we had three 
reports which were dated the 22  January.  There was a 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 83 of 255 
 
report that had been emailed to Mr Sesoko, which had also 
been – was also dated the 22 January of 2014 and that had 
been emailed to him on the 23 January of 2014, according 
to the investigations you had done, is that correct? 
MR JULY:   I know of that report that Khuba says he 
referred the report to Sesoko but the report that was 
signed is the report which was signed on the [indistinct – 
dropping voice] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do not speak away from mic. 
MR JULY:   Oh, Chair, I am saying I am aware of Khuba 
10 
saying he emailed a report on the 23 r d to Sesoko for the 
purposes of the secretariat because they are required to 
give to the secretariat and as we can know, I think I would 
take 
it 
as 
common 
cause 
that 
we 
know 
that 
this 
investigation was conducted in terms of Section 28H and 
the 28H makes a reference to that it is a kind of a report 
which investigation must happen as a result of a referral 
either by the Executive Director, initiated by the Executive 
Director or is initiated by the MEC or the Minister or the 
Secretary and the Secretary is the Secretary of the 
20 
Secretariat for the Police and this was referred to IPID 
already with a case number.   
 
So Khuba was obliged in terms of the law to give 
that report to the Secretariat.  So Khuba does say, of 
course, in his affidavit that he filed, something that he did 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 84 of 255 
 
not mention to us when we interviewed Khuba, you can go 
through the interview that we had with Khuba, we had three 
interviews with him.  We only pick up the issue of the 
report which was emailed to Sesoko which is dated the 
23 r d, which we will talk about that another time, whether 
Sesoko knew about the report, whether he knew or he did 
not know about the first report. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Very well.  Now at the time of the – 
when the first report is complete – I am talking now about 
the 22 January report. 
10 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And we know that there are three 
reports, two of which are signed, one of which is emailed.  
You say it was emailed on – sorry, it was emailed on the 
23 r d and you say the second 22 January report which 
contains the investigator ’s statement is in fact given to Adv 
Mosing on the 24 January. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So it should probably be referred to as 
the 24 January report but we have referred to it throughout 
20 
as the first report.  
MR JULY:   Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So when you refer in your affidavit to 
the first report you are referring to the second signed 
report …[intervenes] 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 85 of 255 
 
MR JULY:   The signed – the one with the statement, yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Correct.  Now at that stage, of course, 
the – quite apart from the issue relating to the data 
analysis or it is the cell phone  data analysis, quite apart 
from that issue, there are several statements that are 
outstanding, warning statements that are outstanding, is 
that correct? 
MR JULY:   When? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   As at the 22 January, whether it be on 
the 22 January or the 24 January, as you say. 
10 
MR JULY:   Yes.  To the warning statements,  Chair, I do 
not want to deal with – there were several warning 
statements. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just say that again.  Come closer? 
MR JULY:   I am saying, chair, I do not want to deal with 
several warning statements, I want to deal with what Khuba 
said was missing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR JULY:   The statements that were missing, not several. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
20 
MR JULY:   He says – Khuba – what was missing was the 
warning statement of Sibiya, was the warning statement of 
Maluleke, was the warning statement of Leon Verster.  It 
was the warning statement which is not the warning 
statement 
at 
the 
same 
time 
of 
Qoboshiyane 
and 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 86 of 255 
 
Qoboshiyane, I must remind you, Chair, is the secretary of 
the Secretariat.   
 
So Khuba says these are the warning statements 
that were missing.  Let us deal with the warning statement 
of Sibiya.  The warning statement of Sibiya, after the 
submission of the report on the 22 n d, somewhere on the 13  
February, out of the blue, Khuba writes a letter to Sibiya.  
He says to Sibiya, based on your conversations that you 
had with Sesoko, I am writing to you to provide me with a 
warning statement and here are the questions.   
10 
 
The warning statement comes back, it is now the 
28 February.   
CHAIRPERSON:   What date?  28 February? 
MR JULY:   28 Feb. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR JULY:   Yes.  That one, that is the first warning 
statement.  What we do know …[intervenes] 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Sorry, just to be clear, we are talking 
about 28 February 2014. 
MR JULY:   Ja, 2014.  That is the first warning statement.  
20 
The 
second 
warning 
statement, 
I 
do 
not 
know 
the 
circumstances on which it was obtained but what we know 
is that it says nothing, it is silent.  Maybe I should go back 
to Sibiya as to what does it say. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Whose one is that one? 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 87 of 255 
 
MR JULY:   That this one is Maluleka. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
MR JULY:   Yes, Maluleka says nothing, he says, I 
exercise my right to remain silent.  Then Sibiya, what does 
Sibiya say, Sibiya says exactly what he said in 2011 in a 
nutshell.  You will recall, Chair – maybe you will not recall 
because there are certain things that were not told which is 
2011, there’s an internal process by the SAP to know about 
this rendition who exactly was involved in this unlawful 
rendition and that investigation, as a result of the Sunday 
10 
Times report of October.  Sunday Times, around October 
publishes an article, an article which says, people have 
been killed…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on Mr July I’m not sure whether we 
need to go too far on that because of the question.  I think 
you wanted to simply say you’d like to focus on the specific 
warning statements.   
MR JULY:   The importance, Chair, the problem – I may 
sometimes come across as a person who – because there 
are certain questions, I mean answers that would want you 
20 
to go back …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no I understand that, no, no I 
understand that. 
MR JULY:   So, now you have these four warning 
statements the other witness statement, I’m not sure if the 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 88 of 255 
 
Leon one was obtained then there’s the Ncubshiane one, 
and if you read the Ncubshiane statement, all what 
Ncubshiane says, she says this thing, after 2011 I was 
asked by the Minister to determine what are the legal 
implications for South Africa, both internationally and 
locally for this rendition, what – the reason why – what are 
the implications of this unlawful of this rendition.  So 
Ncubshiane – that’s the statement of Ncubshiane.  So, you 
tell me, Ncubshiane’s statement, what has that have to do 
with the conclusion whether Sibiya, Dramat must be 
10 
charged?  A person who decides to remain silent, how can 
that 
have 
an 
impact 
on 
the 
recommendation. 
 
The 
statement by Sibiya, it’s confirming what he’s already been 
saying, which is, I did not get myself, I was never involved 
in the rendition but what Sibiya is accepting though is 
accepting that he provided personnel to undergo the 
operations.  Sibiya accepts that he was being briefed and 
that statement – that’s the one that I emailed to Mr Galli 
last night because I looked for it in the docket that was 
provided, I couldn’t find it and you will see in the report it’s 
20 
summarised, it’s a one-liner or two sentences which says, 
Sibiya denies having been involved but Sibiya writes a 
statement through the lawyers and then through the 
lawyers and then he sends another statement which is 
written, conclusion.  So, all the – all of that, when you read 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 89 of 255 
 
it, they don’t have impact on the recommendation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hmmm, Mr Hulley? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair.  Now, you make 
the point that these statements and the – or rather the 
activity on the part of Mr Khuba, by writing to Ms 
Ncubshiane by writing to Sibiya, you make the point that, 
that is out of the blue.  I just want to understand what you 
were referring to, what the implication was, as far as that’s 
concerned? 
MR JULY:   For me, Chair, I start my affidavit by 
10 
saying…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Remember 
not 
to 
move 
away…[intervenes]. 
MR JULY:   Oh, I started my affidavit by saying I’m not a 
truther and I explain what a truther is and a truther is a 
person who is a conspiracy theory, right but I’ve got my 
own reservation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hmm. 
MR JULY:   The out of the blue, is the reservations that I 
have about, around the 13 t h – there’s now an issue about 
20 
the warning statement because McBride is coming, they 
know that McBride is coming on the 3 r d so McBride will 
come on the 3 r d and say, the investigation was still 
outstanding. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hmm, hmm. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 90 of 255 
 
MR JULY:   That’s the whole reason why …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But what is the factual basis for you to 
say that they knew that he would come and say that? 
MR JULY:   Chair this is informed by what, then happens, 
when McBride starts on the 3 r d of March, what does he do, 
when he start on the 3 r d of March…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no as I understand the statement 
you just – you made it is that prior to Mr McBride starting 
at IPID, they knew that he would come and take this 
position.  So, my question is, what is the factual basis for 
10 
you to say that? 
MR JULY:   They knew, that they knew that he was coming. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Before 
he 
came, 
ja 
remember…[intervenes]. 
MR JULY:   Remember the appointment, Chair, was already 
confirmed somewhere in December 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no I understand that, but the part 
that I’m interested in is, if I understood you correctly, is – 
suggests that they knew what position he would take on 
this case once he arrived. 
20 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, I’m asking what is the factual basis 
for saying that? 
MR JULY:   Chair, I’m saying if you look at what, then 
happens when Mr McBride get to IPID you cannot ignore 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 91 of 255 
 
the activities of what happened after the report was 
already considered by the person who was submitting it, 
considered to be final. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hmm, maybe let’s go back, when you 
say, 
they 
knew, 
who 
are 
you 
talking 
about 
before…[intervenes]? 
MR JULY:   I’m talking about Sesoko. 
CHAIRPERSON:   About Sesoko? 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Khuba yes. 
10 
MR JULY:   Yes, I’m talking about the two of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay no, I just wanted us to clear 
that. 
MR JULY:   Oh yes, sorry Chair that’s what I meant. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But what is it that you can tell me that 
informs your statement that before Mr McBride arrived at 
IPID, they knew that, upon his arrival he would take a 
particular position on this case? 
MR JULY:   Chair, you have to read and understand what 
happened when he came in.  He’s on record, Mr McBride 
20 
and all of them, saying, when McBride arrived at IPID, he 
asked for high profile matters.  There were three high 
profile matters at that time, it was Marikina, it was Cato 
Manor, it was this rendition.  What happens, these people 
were called to a meeting to say we want you to give me the 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 92 of 255 
 
update but you won’t hear anything, no update about the 
other two.  Not even to the person who was called to come 
to give evidence – I mean to give update about Cato 
Manor, that person, when we interviewed him, nothing did 
he say, according to Mr Angus about Cato Manor.  All what 
he talked about, he was asked to take over this rendition 
because McBride suspect that there was something, not 
right which was done by Khuba at the time.  That’s what he 
says, right.  When you look at Anna’s and say, what is it 
then that the update we were supposed to give, there is no 
10 
update.  Mr Kgamanyane who was doing Marikina and other 
investigators, we know now, that those reports were filed 
with IPID, I mean with NPA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but you see Mr July, I would have a 
certain understanding if you say to me, it’s interesting 
then, upon arrival at IPID, Mr McBride behaved in the 
following way, that’s one way but it’s different when you 
say Sesoko and Khuba knew, before Mr McBride arrived at 
IPID that when he arrived at IPID he would take a 
particular position on the matter. So that’s the part I was 
20 
actually listening to say, what’s the factual…[intervenes]. 
MR JULY:   I hear you, there might be a disjuncture, 
maybe I should not approach it in that way then. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR 
JULY: 
 
 
Maybe 
I 
should 
then 
stick 
on 
it 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 93 of 255 
 
was…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the factors you said earlier on. 
MR JULY:   Let me address then, why, the out of the blue, 
on the 13 t h of…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry, just say that again you looked 
at him and I didn’t hear. 
MR JULY:   Oh, I was saying, let me then address the, out 
of the blue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry, what is the out of the blue 
part. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   I’d asked earlier on why the witness 
had indicated previously that the letters…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, the warning statement? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   That had been written to Ms 
Ncubshiane to Mr Sibiya – General Sibiya, why did he 
consider that to be, out of the blue and…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes but let’s get – let’s move out of 
this area in a proper way.  Can I accept that you don’t have 
a factual basis to say, Mr Sesoko and Mr Khuba knew 
before Mr McBride came what position…[intervenes]. 
20 
MR JULY:   What position he was going to take. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MR JULY:   That is very interesting to note that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, Mr Hulley? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So to take that to its logical 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 94 of 255 
 
conclusion, the fact that a – or specifically that Mr Khuba 
had attempted to get these additional statements from 
General Sibiya – from Ms Ncubshiane, that you’re not 
suggesting and you can’t suggest, as a fact that Mr 
McBride had factually got involved in the investigation 
before the 3 r d of March, in other words before his arrival? 
MR JULY:   I can’t say as a matter of fact but whether it 
happened – ja can’t say as a matter of fact. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And you have no evidence, as I 
understand it from your affidavit, you have no evidence – 
10 
there’s nobody’s that’s told you that, that happened, you’ve 
not seen an email to that effect? 
MR JULY:   we are not even dealing with that in my 
affidavit. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes, yes. 
MR JULY:   I’m not even dealing with that but I’m raising it 
here because we are talking and people have been 
allowed, like McBride to say things that were not in the 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I must say that I do wish us to go to the 
20 
question of the actual findings at some stage. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Pardon me, Mr Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I would like us to go to the findings of 
the Werksmans report as soon as you are able to in terms 
of – because as I see it, I mean, the one point is that this 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 95 of 255 
 
Commission is not looking at whether his findings were 
correct or not correct, that’s not what we are doing and it 
may well be that they may be unjustified and – or justified, 
that might still not, you know take us anywhere but one is 
looking at whether there’s anything that shows anything 
beyond that but it’s just that, in order to get there, 
sometimes you have to look at…[intervenes]. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Preceding events? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair.  Remember my 
10 
initial question to you was, how you came to the conclusion 
that you did, you’ve explained quite a bit. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   What I was really interested in was 
actually how you came to that conclusion with reference to 
your report, if you could take us through that process, that 
was the question I was very interested in. 
MR JULY:   Okay, the conclusion – there are a number of 
conclusions that we are making, Chair, in the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I think we won’t be interested in all 
20 
of them, we’ll only be interested in some. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:   I’ll refer the witness specifically to a 
conclusion in relation to the, defeating the ends of justice. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 96 of 255 
 
MR 
JULY: 
 
 
Yes, 
Chair, 
how 
we 
come 
to 
that 
conclusion…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry which one is that?  
ADV HULLEY SC:   So, Mr Chair, if we can turn to page 
186 of bundle LEA1 it’s Exhibit Y8(A) and it’s the 
Werksmans report and specifically at page 186 of that 
bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay I am at the – on the last page 
of the report you want me to go to page? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Mr July if you look at the spine, you’ll 
10 
see Y8, you’re looking specifically for LEA1. 
MR JULY:   I don’t seem to have…[intervenes]. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Remember that’s the Bundle that has 
the affidavit of Mr Nhleko in it. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   I believe you had it previously when I 
referred to it. 
MR JULY:  I’ve got it in the small Bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would somebody help Mr July please. 
MR JULY:   Oh, hears it and you said page? 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Page 186. 
MR JULY:   1-8-6. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now we’ve read the conclusion, we 
don’t have to repeat it and I was specifically concerned 
with how you came to the conclusion that one of the three 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 97 of 255 
 
of them, in terms of your recommendation might be guilty 
of 
the 
charge 
of 
defeating 
the 
ends 
of 
justice 
or 
obstructing the administration of justice. 
MR JULY:   Yes, Chair, you would recall the evidences – 
we interviewed Mr Khuba and we interviewed Mr Khuba 
three times then we interviewed Mr Sesoko and we 
interviewed Mr McBride.  When we came to the issue of the 
deletion of information in the report, in particular, with Mr 
Khuba, Mr Khuba understood his analysis and say, I had to 
change my analysis of the report because I was convinced 
10 
otherwise, right.  Then Mr Sesoko says, I have never seen 
the report.  Mr McBride adopts the same attitude that, I’ve 
never seen the report.  So, there’s the denial of the 
existence of the first report, there is denial by all of them, 
even here they came to this Commission, not even a single 
one of them said, we deleted the information. What you 
going to be – are told is that the analysis was changed 
because 
we 
reconsidered 
the 
evidence 
because 
the 
evidence was unsustainable, that’s what you are told but 
that part cannot be divorced to the fact that the report that 
20 
was filed on the 22 n d, if you accept that the one that was 
filed on the 22 n d was final, you will make that conclusion, 
Chair, having read the statutes and everything.  If it was 
final, now the question should be, why was it retrieved, to 
do what?  Now when you look at the conduct of what 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 98 of 255 
 
happened when it is retrieved, not only is the analysis that 
is being changed.  I have no issue when a person changing 
his mind because he has been influenced or convinced, 
genuinely so, otherwise but I’ve got an issue with a person 
that’s going to delete evidence in order to justify the 
analysis.  Let me give you an example of the deletion of 
evidence, Matalonge is dead, nobody doesn’t know that 
he’s a dead man.  You can’t go and delete information that 
was said by Matalonge without Matalonge’s permission and 
you can’t get it because he’s dead.  So that information will 
10 
sit 
there 
but 
you 
may 
have 
a 
different 
view 
and 
understanding and analysis when you look at Matalonge’s 
statement, leave it the way it is, don’t tamper with that 
evidence because it is evidence.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I’m happy that we have got to this 
point, it’s one of the important points about this matter. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
My 
understanding 
when 
the 
IPID 
witnesses gave evidence and my understanding up to now, 
and I raised it with Mr Nhleko a few days ago was that 
20 
when you talk about alteration and changing of the report, 
the discussion about alteration or changing of the report 
does not include interfering or changing anything in the 
statements of witnesses and I just want to check whether 
that’s your understanding as well or you have a different 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 99 of 255 
 
understanding? 
MR JULY:   I listened to them misleading you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:   I listened to that, misleading you that all what 
they changed was their analysis. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:   They were lying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What they did, they went to the statement 
of Matalonge, Matalonge said, I pick up a phone, I phoned 
my bosses to say, here are the Zimbabwean Police, they 
10 
want to get into the country, do I allow them, they’re saying 
they want to go to Dramat.  These bosses, they say, no, 
no, speak to – please call him, they give him permission, 
he calls Dramat and he says, there are people who want to 
come and see you in the country, that on its own is a 
problem because if you are coming to the country you must 
produce documents not a call, you don’t call people right.  
You come with the valid documents you must go through 
the police.  Now, there’s a call, that information, Mr Chair, 
is deleted and it’s said by Matalonge it’s not an analysis. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well when we go in the bundles to the 
see that part – but maybe before you go to bundle, Mr 
Matalonge’s statement that you say they changed, was it 
handwritten or was it typed? 
MR JULY:   Matalonge had three statements, the one 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 100 of 255 
 
statement Matalonge made, when in 2011, during the 
internal disciplinary hearing and that statement is the 
statement that Khuba says, I called Matalonge I said, 
Matalonge you’re lying, this information that is contained in 
this statement is a lie.  I’ve got a warrant of arrest, I’m 
going to arrest you for lies, Matalonge says, no you can 
come let’s talks, Matalonge goes and speaks with Khuba.  
The statement that was taken by Khuba now, it’s the typed 
one, 
that 
second 
one. 
 
So, 
you 
have 
a 
2011 
statement…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which is handwritten. 
MR JULY:   Which is handwritten. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR JULY:   Then you have a 2011 which is typed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:   And then you have another one, where 
Matalonge says I am confirming that the landline that you 
mentioned – that’s towards the end, the landline that you 
mentioned in this – in the – I think during – the number 
that was used that, that landline is the landline that he 
20 
used to call Dramat, so you’ve got three. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the one that is typed, which is, I think 
you say that’s the one that was changed. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did Mr Matalonge sign that one as well? 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 101 of 255 
 
MR JULY:   He signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He signed it? 
MR JULY:   He signed all the statements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, were they – that particular one, 
because you say that’s the one that was changed, did he 
initial every page or only sign the last page? 
MR JULY:   Chair this happens, the statement, it’s written, 
it’s copied because that’s what they do, they copy the 
statements to the report right.  So, you copy the statement 
to the report and then when the new – the second report 
10 
was written you go to the statement that has been copied 
to the report – remember now you don’t have to go to the 
statement itself and delete the statement.  You now go to 
the report and in your report where you mention that this is 
what Matalonge said, he said 1, 2, 3, 4 you then say in the 
second report he said 1, 2, 4, 5 you leave out 3, right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but – I understand that but I’m still at 
the point of saying, the typed statement for Mr Matalonge 
did he sign every page or you don’t remember whether he 
did or not? 
20 
MR JULY:   I think he did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You think he did, okay we can check in 
due course. 
MR JULY:    I think he did. 
CHAIRPERSON: And if he did the only way in which 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 102 of 255 
 
anybody could change that statement, I guess, would have 
to be by hand. 
MR JULY:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By hand, that’s now what happened. 
MR JULY:   No, no, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That’s not what happened? 
MR JULY:   No, no, no, Chair, that’s why I was saying 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR JULY:   I write a statement, I type it, whether it’s 
10 
handwritten or it’s typed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR JULY:   I give it to whoever. That person copies the 
statement to the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR JULY:   He writes the report and says, Sandile says he 
was at the State Commission on the 31 s t of March. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:   I mean of July – 31 s t of July 2020. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR JULY:   Right, you write that in the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:   Because there’s a statement which says that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:   But now – because the 31 s t of July I’ve done 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 103 of 255 
 
something somewhere, you want to remove the 31 s t in the 
report now, not I the statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR JULY:   You remove it in the report and you write 29. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay, no, no I think we are getting too 
the important part.  So, it looks like we are moving back to 
what I thought, what I understood to be the position.  So 
physically the typed statement of Mr Matalonge is not 
interfered with. 
MR JULY:   It’s not, no, no it’s not interfered. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but has happened is that there’s a 
change of what Mr Khuba says in his report. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About what the statement says. 
MR JULY:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you say, he stops referring to certain 
parts of the statement. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, no that’s fine so as I see it, tell me 
what you say to this.  So, the objectionable conduct, from 
20 
your point of view is actually that in his report Mr Khuba 
doesn’t give what you consider a fair summary of Mr 
Matalonge’s statement. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That’s it, yes. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 104 of 255 
 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that’s where the issue is? 
MR JULY:    That’s where the issue is Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, Mr Hulley? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair.  So, if I 
understand correctly, your true complaint, relates, not to 
the fact that the docket was in any way tampered with or 
any statement within the docket was tampered with.  Your 
true complaint relates to the fact that the two IPID reports, 
what we’ve referred to as the first report and the second 
10 
report that insofar as the first report was concerned the 
information capturing or summarising what was contained 
in the docket was not – had been removed and was not 
accurately reflected in the second report. 
MR JULY:  Chair I will respond by saying you know when 
you read the documents you will realise how Khuba used to 
write his reports.  He would put the statement the way it 
was said to him.  And the way you know read what is the 
statement says.  He would write exactly what that person 
says.  It may be in a summary form but it contains exactly 
20 
what that person says.  Now the complaint is that Khuba – 
they – although they did not touch the docket and I will tell 
you why they could not touch the docket.  They could not 
touch the docket because it would seem that they were 
running out of time.   
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 105 of 255 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  They were running? 
MR JULY:  Running out of time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR JULY:  This issue was being outstanding Chair this 
issue comes from 2010. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JULY:  Even long before Minister – the former Minister.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Minister Nhleko. 
MR JULY:  Mr Nhleko. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR JULY:  2010. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JULY:  That is when this whole thing started.  And 
Parliament raising issues.  What happened to the killing of 
the people of Zimbabwe? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JULY:  Right.  Then what then happened is Khuba 
changes the statement in his report because they could not 
be able to remove the information.  Why I am saying they 
were running out of time. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JULY:  On the 7 March the docket is collected. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JULY:  From Van Zyl. In fact let me say Van Zyl 
because it was sent to Advocate Chauke.  Advocate Chauke 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 106 of 255 
 
give the docket to Van Zyl who happens to be his junior. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JULY:  Van Zyl is looking – before he looked at the 
document the document the docket has been collected.  
Remember Chair you asked a question to Mr McBride. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JULY:  When you were briefed McBride were you 
briefed verbally?  There was no information that was given 
to him.  McBride said, I cannot remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR JULY:  When I have got opportunity, I will deal with that 
issue.  Now talking back to the docket.  You asked a 
question when the docket comes back to you did it have the 
report?  He says, I cannot remember.  You persist with the 
question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JULY:  No.  The docket – the report when it goes to the 
NPA – when the docket goes to the NPA has the report.  You 
asked that question.  And you said but when it comes back 
is it not that the report must be there?  He says no it was 
20 
not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JULY:  That is the vision that – so – the – on the 
number – from the 7 t h March then you have an information 
note on the 10 t h March, 3 days after the docket has been 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 107 of 255 
 
received.  It is an information note to Minister Mthethwa 
saying Minister the investigation is complete. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would – it would have been Minister 
Nhleko at that time. 
MR JULY:  No Mthethwa.  Nhleko started May. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it not 2014?  Is it not in 2014?  Oh in 
March. 
MR JULY:  March. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Okay. 
MR JULY:  Minister Mthethwa.  March it is still Mthethwa.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay yes ja. 
MR JULY:  Yes.  He writes to Minister Mthethwa to say the 
investigation is now complete.  All what we are busy doing 
we are analysing the evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Analysing? 
MR JULY:  The evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The evidence yes. 
MR JULY:  So meaning that we are still going to submit the 
report now the investigation is complete. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR JULY:  This is the person who said I ordered Khuba and 
Sesoko to do further investigations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JULY:  He says that to you in the 17/18 – I mean when 
he was here in April.  I think he was here in April 11/12 – 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 108 of 255 
 
13t h April.  He says to you, I ordered Khuba and Sesoko to 
do further investigations. So that further investigation Chair 
would have happened in the 18t h and the 19t h because on the 
10t h 
McBride 
unequivocally 
says 
the 
investigation 
is 
complete. McBride does not show you anything which says 
this is what we investigated during the time alright.  It is the 
same docket.  Now it goes to the importance of the report.  
Because you are told these reports are being ignored.  But 
these 
reports 
are 
informational 
Chair. 
 
They 
are 
informational in a number of reasons.  Because the person 
10 
even if you read the docket you decide to read the docket 
you cannot avoid to say what is IPID saying?  What is IPID 
saying?  So if the NPA can take a decision with – and that 
decision is not because they are bound by the docket – I 
mean by the report they can take a different decision 
because the recommendations are not binding.  Why not 
leaving – why do you not leave that docket and the report of 
the 22 n d January?  Because NPA is going to be able to 
determine that this evidence is unsustainable.  NPA can 
reach that conclusion that the report that is submitted by 
20 
Khuba 
which 
say 
we 
must 
charge 
these 
people 
is 
unsustainable.  Why does it take you to go and take the 
docket to analyse when that very analysis that you are doing 
is going to be done again by the NPA?   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well… 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 109 of 255 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I have – I actually asked a much simpler 
question I am not sure that my question was in fact 
answered.  I was trying to summarise what I understood to 
be your case insofar as the defeating the ends of the justice 
was concerned.  My question was specifically if I understand 
correctly you are not making the point that anything in the 
docket itself had been deleted or tampered with.  That is 
point number.  Correct? 
10 
MR JULY:  That is the … 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Your assessment of the situation as 
outlined in your report is that the defeating of the ends of 
justice stems from the fact that the two reports – the first 
report accurately captures the docket whereas the second 
report has information that has been taken out and does not 
accurately capture the docket.  Is that correct? 
MR JULY:  Yup. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now on your understanding of course it 
would be – if that amounted to defeating the ends of justice 
20 
and we will get to how you get there in a moment but if that 
were accurate it would mean that if an investigator were to 
give an inaccurate account of what is contained in the docket 
– forget about – I am talking generally – he gives a final 
report but it is not – it is not an accurate reflection.  It is not 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 110 of 255 
 
a fair reflection of what is contained in the docket and he 
comes to the conclusion that there is no case to be met or 
no charges to be brought against the person who is being 
investigated. 
MR JULY:  Hm. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  On the argument that you now presenting 
it seems to suggest that that would amount to defeating the 
ends of justice as well.  Is that correct? 
MR JULY:  Then you deliberately intentionally remove 
information which would assist the person who has to make a 
10 
decision.  That is misleading.  There is an intention and that 
– what is the justice that is supposed to happen?  The 
justice that is supposed to happen is that people who are 
involved in the rendition must be brought to book.  That is 
the justice.  Now when you want – you do something to 
defeat that end of justice to happen you write a report much 
as the report is a recommendation but you deliberately write 
information which seeks to mislead the person who is going 
to make a decision.  That Chair it is a problem.  Remember I 
started by saying this was Section 28 investigations.  They 
20 
are not just any type of reports.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let me put to you what I put to Mr 
Nhleko.  Where the investigator places before the NPA his 
report part of which seeks to summarise, what is in the 
statements of the witnesses and the docket but places – but 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 111 of 255 
 
has in part at least wrongly or inaccurately or inadequately 
summarised the contents of statements in the docket.  But 
he makes available to the NPA those statements as well. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which have got the information that he has 
not correctly or adequately captured in the report and he 
knows because I take it they know that the decision maker at 
the NPA is going to read the statements in the docket which 
have – which has got the information that he might not have 
correctly captured in his report.  And therefore, the decision 
10 
maker will still have a complete picture. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How do you say that person intends to 
defeat the ends of justice? 
MR JULY:  No Chair you started by saying a person 
inaccurately summarises the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR JULY:  But I am saying that was not an accurate 
recording of the summary of the statements.  It was an 
intentional deletion of information with the intention to 
20 
mislead. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  That is the conclusion that we came to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  We said this was done intentionally.  It is not a 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 112 of 255 
 
person who is writing the report because it happens.  We do 
record things sometimes not accurately.  I have no problem – 
I have no qualms with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR JULY:  But if you look at the pattern. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  How it was done the intention was to mislead. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JULY:  Now here is the part.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR JULY:  Do you do that successfully? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JULY:  You cannot say when you are found to have been 
misled you say now simply because there were statements 
that were included.  You did not succeed to mislead.  But you 
were misleading in your report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JULY:  Chair we came to the conclusion – another 
person can come to a different conclusion.  We came to the 
conclusion starting from why was it in the first place 
20 
retrieved – the docket?  Why was it retrieved?  And not be 
left with the NPA to make their own decision and read the 
very information and come to a conclusion.  You decide to 
take it in order to sanitise the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see you may be right in how you view 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 113 of 255 
 
it. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You might not be right. 
MR JULY:  Yup. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If the decision maker if to the knowledge of 
the investigator the decision maker at NPA was going to rely 
only on the report and the statements would not be there I 
think there would be quite a strong case.  Now I am not 
saying there is no case for what you are saying but I am 
exploring. 
10 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How as I understand the position at the – 
the decision maker at the NPA would not be expected to 
make a decision without reading the statements. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He may read – he or she may read both 
the report and the statements but I do not believe they would 
read the report without the statements.  I think they would 
rather read the statements. 
MR JULY:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Without the report. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If they were pressed for time or anything 
like that. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 114 of 255 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because their decision must be – must 
take into account the statements. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now what I am saying is when you know 
that the decision maker will see all the information that is in 
the statements how can we intend whatever you do in your 
report because you know he will read the statements how 
can you be intending to make him arrive at a wrong decision 
by not telling him information that he will see anyway in the 
statements.  That is what I would like you to deal with. 
10 
MR JULY:  I know Chair that is problematic. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  But the question could be as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  What could be the reason then for a person to 
delete that information?  You already have it in the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  What you need to do is to analyse. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  Your report and change your analysis. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  But leave the information.  The question should 
be why deleting it in the first place? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I accept that one may have to look 
at why was it deleted?  But I think you must tell me if I 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 115 of 255 
 
misunderstand you.  I think you and I are – are quite close in 
terms of saying on the face of it at least if he knows that the 
decision maker will read the statements therefore the 
decision maker will see all the information that he might not 
have included in the – in the report. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the face of it one would expect that he 
would say but there is no point in deleting this information in 
order to influence him to arrive at a certain decision when he 
is going to see this information in the statements anyway.  
10 
You know.  Of course, if you deal with somebody that you 
know he is not going to read the statements. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He is just going to read your report that 
might be different. 
MR JULY:  I was going there Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR JULY:  To say we do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  We do not know. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  Anything is possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  Anything is possible because there is no reason 
why I would want to delete information if I do not think that 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 116 of 255 
 
at some point this person may decide to read only my report.  
Because my report summarises the statements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JULY:  Of these people.  Otherwise there is no reason 
why I should delete this information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JULY:  If I do not think that my report is going to 
influence you, I would not even delete it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. Ja. 
MR JULY:  But if I believe that at some – you may look at my 
10 
report and be convinced by my report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
MR JULY:  I came to the conclusion another person can 
come to a different conclusion.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  How did the conclusion based on the facts that 
were before me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well of course whether that – 
whether the – the reason for changing the relevant – that 
part of the report or deleting certain information in the 
20 
report.   Well the reason was the one that you concluded was 
the reason or is another one that one might involve looking 
at the actual information deleted and hearing what the 
reason is that was advanced.  But I think through this 
discussion 
we 
– 
I 
certainly 
understand 
I 
think 
you 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 117 of 255 
 
understand. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where I was coming from. 
MR JULY:  I do. I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you.  Mr Hulley we –  
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see we are at one.  I am not always very 
good with estimating time about how long anything would 
take. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the one thing I think has happened is 
that we certainly have covered quite important parts as far 
as I am concerned. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I think so as well Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It might not be it is everything but certainly 
quite some part.  We – I think we should take the lunch 
adjournment.  Mr July and Mr Ngcukaitobi there is a matter 
coming up at two. It is an application – it is a certain 
application.  When we come back maybe I could just deal 
with that because I do not think it should take long and then 
20 
we continue.  But I might be told something that might 
suggest that we should finish first and they – they should 
argue that application after.  Is that fine with you? 
MR JULY:  Not a problem Mr Chair. 
ADV NGCUKAITOBI:  It would be fine for us Chair.  
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 118 of 255 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NGCUKAITOBI:  Is their intention to finish Mr July’s 
evidence this afternoon? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes certainly from my side but having 
said that you know what I have just said about my poor 
estimation skills. 
ADV NGCUKAITOBI:  No the only reason I ask is whether 
we should make a provision to be… 
CHAIRPERSON:  For tomorrow? 
ADV NGCUKAITOBI:  Well for Monday. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh no – oh today is Friday. 
ADV NGCUKAITOBI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I do not think you should. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Monday is out of the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I do not think so.  I do not think you 
should.  If you ask me and again, I warn that my – sometime 
my estimation is bad.  I do not see that we should take after 
– take an hour after – well I – with him after lunch.  I am 
looking at Mr Hulley. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I am keenly aware of your stare Mr 
20 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  It is difficult to estimate because I would 
thought that we would take no more than two and a half 
hours at most. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 119 of 255 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Possibly even including with the potential 
re-examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  But that clearly has not happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I had a number of questions that I wish to 
ask. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  We have begun to delve into matters 
10 
relating to the content of the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That were not necessarily part of my 
initial questioning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course, as I said the commission is not 
here to determine whether he is conclusions and findings are 
right or wrong.  That kind of thing so that ought to shorten 
the proceedings but we do need to look at what needs to be 
looked at properly. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I – I certainly think we will finish today.  
I hope we do not have to go up to four o’clock to finish.  So 
ja 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Okay let us take the lunch 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 120 of 255 
 
adjournment now and then we will resume at two and then I 
will then indicate whether I will hear the argument in that 
matter or whether we complete and finish first with this one.  
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are interrupting the hearing of Mr 
July’s evidence to enable me to deal with an application that 
10 
is... that was set down for two o’clock that was brought by 
Judge 
Makhubele 
for 
me 
to 
consider 
or 
reconsider... 
consider amending a directive that I issued on Friday last 
week for her to file certain affidavits by Wednesday this 
week and to appear in person before me on Monday at ten 
o’clock.  Mr Soni?  Yes, switch on your mic. 
ADV SONI SC:  Chairperson, you will... as you have 
indicated on Friday, last week, that is the 24t h of July.  You 
issued a directive and the effect of the directive was that in 
respect of the affidavits filed by Ms Ngoye, Mr Dingiswayo, 
20 
Mr Makaswa and Mr Achmat.   
 
Judge Makhubele was to have filed her answer, her 
response by Wednesday, the 29t h of July.  DCJ, what 
happened thereafter is, we have received nothing on the 29t h 
but in the early hours of Thursday morning, that is the 30t h, 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 121 of 255 
 
we received an affidavit together with annexures from Judge 
Makhubele but not from her attorneys, and that affidavit has 
been placed before you. 
 
Subsequently, we also received a notice of motion.  The 
effect of that application read together with the notice of 
motion is that Judge Makhubele requires that... or requests 
that the directive be varied amended, effectively not be in 
the terms that it is. 
 
And she asks that she be given until the 3 rd of August to 
file her responding affidavit and that she only appears on the 
10 
8t h of August before you Chairperson. 
 
That is the application that she filed.  The Commission 
filed 
a 
responding 
affidavit 
in 
which 
we 
oppose 
the 
application.  I just want to point out ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us call it the Legal Team of the 
Commission filed ...[intervenes]  
ADV SONI SC:  I beg your pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  It was the Legal Team.  Basically... may I 
just point out the... just for record purposes?  Judge 
20 
Makhubele’s affidavit was 77 pages long.   
 
Our affidavit is five pages long and we say that she did 
not really address the issue before... that she should have, 
this issue, namely, on what basis is seeking a variation of 
the order or the directive that was granted last week.  And so 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 122 of 255 
 
we persist in our opposition to the relief that she seeks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The appearance for her or is she here? 
ADV SONI SC:  DCJ, what happened... Chairperson, what 
happened next is that after we filed our affidavit, after the 
Legal Team filed its affidavit, it was served on the attorney 
and Judge Makhubele. 
 
We did not hear anything from them until about ten 
o’clock this morning when we received an email from the 
attorneys, saying that they are withdrawing as attorneys of 
record for Judge Makhubele. 
10 
 
We then communicated with them telephonically to say 
that they should, given the lateness of the hour, they should 
formally seek your leave before they withdrew. 
 
They phoned about 15-minutes ago to say that their 
counsel is otherwise engaged.  Their junior counsel is not 
available and they are unable to attend.  So that is the 
position. 
 
The secretariat also phoned Judge Makhubele about 
half-an-hour ago, informing her of the fact that the... her 
attorneys had withdrawn and her approach was that she 
20 
could not be expected to be here. 
 
So effectively in answer to your question DCJ, there is 
no appearance in support of the application and what you 
have is 
simple an 
application on 
paper 
with nobody 
motivating why the relief she seeks, which is quite far-
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 123 of 255 
 
reaching, to be granted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  Well, I did read Judge Makhubele’s 
affidavit.  You said it was 77 pages. 
ADV SONI SC:  It is, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you meant with the annexures. 
ADV SONI SC:  Without the annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV SONI SC:  The affidavit itself is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  The affidavit without the annexure is 47 
pages. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  I beg your pardon.  It is 47 pages. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADV SONI SC:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then there are annexures.  By this 
stage, we do not know whether she... whether she could be 
available at any stage later this afternoon assuming that she 
could not be here because she was involved in some matter 
in court or because she had expected her lawyers to be 
here.  One does not know when she might have got to know 
that the lawyers withdrew. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We do not know that, hey? 
ADV SONI SC:  No, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  In court what one would do is strike 
the matter off the roll. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 124 of 255 
 
ADV SONI SC:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think that what we will do is that, I am... I 
propose not to... I propose to deal with this matter in this 
way.  One, not to change anything in the directive.   
 
I do not... Ja, not to change anything in the directive at 
this stage and unless I decide otherwise, the position would 
remain being that the directive issued on Friday stands 
which means, on Monday Judge Makhubele must appear 
here. 
 
Now when I read her affidavit, she makes it clear that on 
10 
Monday, the judge president has released her from her work 
commitments and actually for the rest of the week. 
 
So she is available on Monday but she was asking that 
she be given a chance to file the affidavits that she should 
have filed on Wednesday to get a chance to file them on 
Monday and she wanted that we move the date for her 
appearance to Friday.   
 
But in the affidavits, she does not give any reason why if 
she files the... her affidavits on Monday, why the... her 
evidence should only be heard on Friday. 
20 
 
If I recall correctly, her counsel had indicated last Friday 
that she was undertaking to file her affidavits by end of this 
week. 
ADV SONI SC:  By today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 125 of 255 
 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The directive said she must file on 
Wednesday.  So one would have expected that she would 
have been able to meet her own deadline that she had 
undertaken. 
 
It seems to me that if one has regard to the fact that she 
has had these affidavits on the basis of which she will be 
asked questions, she has had some of them for the past six 
months and the last batch of only two that she has had for 
two months. 
10 
 
She would have had enough time to familiarise herself 
with all the issues.  I think that the position that will remain 
will be that she must come on Monday. 
 
Then if she has got her affidavits when she comes, then 
the question of whether or not she had sufficient cause or a 
proper explanation for not having filed them on Wednesday, 
is a matter that can be dealt with then or thereafter, 
depending on what I direct. 
 
So the affidavit that she has filed can still be used by 
her to seek to justify why she was not able to file the 
20 
affidavits on Wednesday but she will have been prepared by 
then. 
 
And if she does not have the affidavits by ten o’clock, 
that does not mean her evidence cannot be heard.  She can 
give her evidence.  She can be questioned. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 126 of 255 
 
 
It may well be that when she delivers... when she makes 
her affidavits available, whether before Monday or on 
Monday morning, it may be that the Legal Team of the 
Commission might take a view that they need time before the 
matter can proceed. 
 
But it may well be that the Legal Team would be able to 
proceed, maybe needing an hour or even two hours to look 
at those affidavits and then we can proceed. 
 
So I think what we will do is postpone this application to 
Monday but the directive issued in terms of Regulation 10.6 
10 
of the Regulations of the Commission issued last Friday will 
stand in the meantime. 
 
If on Monday we are able to proceed, we should 
proceed.  So briefly then, this application is postponed for 
Monday.  That is number one. 
 
Number two.  In the interim and unless I decide 
otherwise between now and Monday, the directive issued in 
terms 
of 
Regulation 
10.6 
of 
the 
Regulations 
of 
the 
Commission 
on 
Friday, 
last 
week, 
stand 
and 
Judge 
Makhubele must appear in person before the Commission at 
20 
ten o’clock. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I think it will be important that this be 
communicated to her. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 127 of 255 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV 
SONI 
SC: 
 
As 
it 
please 
the 
Chairperson 
and 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV SONI SC:  ...we appreciate being accommodated in the 
middle of the evidence of Mr July. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  No.  No, thank you.  You are 
excused. 
ADV SONI SC:  As it pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then we can continue with Mr July’s 
10 
evidence.   
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, are we ready? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  We were still 
discussing the question of the defeating the ends of 
justice, now you had come there, you dealt with that, Mr 
July, and what we were examining was towards the tail end 
of that, we were examining the question of what you 
regarded what they had done wrong. 
20 
 
If I understood your evidence correctly and please, 
do correct me if I am wrong, but if I understood your 
evidence correctly, what you in essence say is that if they 
did not express their honest opinion on the content of the 
docket.  In other words, they did not capture the content of 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 128 of 255 
 
the docket accurately.  In order to absolve somebody, that 
would amount to defeating the ends of justice.   
So, if I understand your argument correctly, there is 
two elements to it, the one is the failure to capture the 
content of the docket accurately and the second is an 
intention to do so in order to absolve somebody from 
liability.  
MR JULY:   Yes, that is my... 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And if I understand your argument 
correctly, what you are saying is that in the present case, 
10 
in relation to Mr McBride, Sesoko and Khuba, that is 
precisely what they appear to have done and that is why 
you recommended that they should be charged. 
MR JULY:   Yes, prima facie that is what we found and 
then we found prima facie that they have committed the – 
defeated the ends of justice.  And, of course, when we do 
so, Chair, the NPA will have to take over from there and 
the report was to the Minister, it was not to the NPA.  So 
once the NPA decides that no, this guy is  - there is this 
prima facie view, then they must do their own investigation.  
20 
That is it, ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   No, fair enough.  So just to understand 
correctly, what – insofar as the present case is concerned 
the report that they had compiled, they had obviously come 
to the conclusion, at least in your mind, as expressed in 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 129 of 255 
 
the second report, which was the report of the 18 March of 
2014.  That report differed with the report of the 22 
January 2014 and it was not the fact that they had a 
different opinion, it was a fact that they had a different 
opinion because, in your view, they dishonestly removed 
information from what was contained in the first report. 
MR JULY:   Of course, it was not just a matter of opinion 
but the opinion is to be taken into account what informed 
the changing of the opinion, not just the changing but what 
informed the changing of the opinion. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes. 
MR JULY:   If you were to change …[intervenes]3 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the reason for changing is what 
you are [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
MR JULY:   Yes, the reason for changing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR JULY:   That is practically... 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And of course you are not suggesting 
that only Mr Khuba was guilty because he held one view, 
one in respect of the first opinion but a different view in 
20 
respect of the second, you are suggesting that any person, 
including Mr McBride and Mr Sesoko, if they had expressed 
the opinion that is contained in the second report, that in 
itself was sufficient to make them liable for defeating the 
ends of justice. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 130 of 255 
 
MR JULY:   Yes.  We say so, Chair, because if you look at 
if we are right that the information is deleted and we want 
to know who deleted the information, Khuba does not know.  
He says I do not know, what I do know is that I worked on 
my analysis.  You ask Sesoko, Sesoko said I have never 
seen that kind of a report.  You go to McBride, McBride 
says I have never seen that report.  That there is a 
common factor which is, all of them, they have looked in 
the information analysis of the evidence and they come to 
the conclusion.   
10 
So if three people were in possession – which, 
Chair, maybe it will be easier if I can explain whether 
indeed McBride was right to say he has never seen the 
report.  It is not true that he did not see the report.  We 
came to the conclusion that he saw the report.   
Sesoko, it is not true that he did not see the report.  
We came to that conclusion that he saw it, McBride, why 
we came to that conclusion.  You will note that on the 3 r d 
when McBride started, the evidence is that McBride asks 
Sesoko that he wants the update and in fact when we 
20 
questioned Mr Khuba, it is very specific, he wanted the 
report, not the update.   
And then Khuba emailed the report to Sesoko.  
Sesoko prints the report and gives it to McBride.  It is on 
record that Sesoko printed the report.  But you will see 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 131 of 255 
 
somewhere the version changes again and say no, no, no, 
I have never seen the first report, but he forgets that, 
Sesoko, that when Khuba emailed the report, he emailed to 
Sesoko, Sesoko printed it, it is on the record, when we 
interviewed him and he gave it to McBride and when Khuba 
came the following day, because there was a meeting - that 
was suggested, that there must be a meeting the following 
day, Khuba says when I met McBride it was a person who 
knew what was in the report and we ask a specific 
question, the report that you gave to McBride, is the same 
10 
report that you filed with the NPA because you filed a hard 
copy?  He said yes.  Unequivocally, yes, it was the same 
report but it was a soft copy.  Right?   
So even the questions that he was asking, you 
could tell, that is what Khuba now says, that is the person 
who read the report.  So one of the issues, for instance, 
was the involvement of Crime Intelligence.  You will get 
conflicting version as to who raised that issue.   
Khuba says McBride asked me why did we involve 
Crime Intelligence?  But Khuba says here, he comes here, 
20 
he says no, no, no, no, when I got there I told McBride, 
when I was briefing him, that Crime Intelligence was 
involved.  Then McBride got concerned.  But that is not 
what he told us.  There is a difference in most issues that 
Khuba said here and what he said to us in preparation of 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 132 of 255 
 
the report.  Depending on finding out whether how much do 
you know, then Khuba will tell you what he thinks you must 
know.  So that is the problem that we are faced with. 
So you have, in our conclusion, three people who 
were in possession of the report, who do not want to 
acknowledge the existence of the report, two of them.  
Then three of them, all of them, they do not want to 
acknowledge the deletion.  If that deletion was innocent, 
why can you not?   Why can you not say yes, we deleted, it 
is because you cannot delete evidence. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you are right in saying when asked 
if they had seen the report, that is Mr Sesoko and Mr 
McBride, if in fact they had seen the report but they deny 
having seen the report, you have to enquire why are they 
denying …[intervenes] 
MR JULY:   They are denying it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   …having seen the report when in fact 
they have seen the report.  Now I am just coming – looking 
at it from your angle. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   To say it is legitimate to ask that 
question.   
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If, as a matter of fact, you are convinced 
that they saw the report… 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 133 of 255 
 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But they are denying that. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because the denial could throw light on 
something. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To say if the – leaving aside whether or 
not, the question of whether or not, putting their summary 
or analysis the way they did in the second report whether it 
amounts to defeating the ends of justice or anything like 
10 
that, what would be legitimate as to say if they had seen 
the report one would expect them to acknowledge that they 
had seen the report and if they had changed the analysis 
or summary because of an acceptable reason one would 
expect that they would give that reason openly. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that part, I think it is legitimate to 
look at it that way.  But, of course, a very important part is 
the one about whether when they said they had not seen 
the report, that is Mr Sesoko and Mr McBride, whether that 
20 
was actually true.   
MR JULY:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  Now just to clear 
up 
one 
issue, 
you 
have 
referred 
interchangeably 
to 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 134 of 255 
 
deleting information and deleting evidence.  To be fair 
there was no evidence that was delete3d. 
MR JULY:   Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   There was information or rather, a 
recordal of what was in the docket that was removed. 
MR JULY:   Yes.  That is semantics, Chair, because if I say 
to you – like I said, I was here on the 31 July 2020 and 
that 31 July 2020 is not recorded in your report because it 
is an important date for you to come to a particular 
conclusion that Sandile indeed on that day, then there is a 
10 
deletion of the evidence which was already in the report.  
You remember the evidence is what you have been told.  It 
can be verbal, it can be in writing, and when you take that 
evidence, you put in your report, it does not change its 
nature, it is just that it is in another form, in the form of a 
report.  
 
So I am not suggesting that they erased what was 
the psychical statement.  No, I am not saying that but that 
evidence was imported to the report and now it is deleted.  
That is what I am saying. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I think what Mr Hulley raises is 
something that also I was looking at when they were giving 
evidence and I just think it is important particularly 
because the charge, as I recall, said they altered and I 
think your report was also based on saying the whole issue 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 135 of 255 
 
is about the alteration of the report. 
MR JULY:   Of the report, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Now if two people are given the 
same material, let us say statements in a docket, and they 
asked separately and not in collaboration with each other 
to prepare a report based on those statements, they are 
likely to come up with two different reports. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That might have the same substance. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the wording obviously would be 
different, you know, how each one is not going to be 
identical because then once it is identical they must have 
copied, one must have copied from the other.  Or maybe 
through some technology it might be done without copying.   
 
But you might have this one person whose report 
you look at and say but this is not an accurate summary of 
these statements.  I have looked at the statements, I have 
read them, this leaves out some important facts, so I am 
unhappy about it because of that.   
20 
And then there is this other one, you have read the 
statement, you say this is the one that really accurately 
summarises what is in the statements.  Okay.    
Now if the first one, whose report you find not to be 
satisfactory, did not see the other report, I expect that all 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 136 of 255 
 
you would say is, he is not good at summarising things, or 
something like that, you know?  But you might not think of 
anything else, you know?   And this one whose report you 
are happy with, you might say he is good at making sure 
that his summary contains all the important information. 
So, therefore, one asks one the question whether 
the moment we all accept that they did not – this alteration 
did 
not 
entail 
physically 
changing 
anything 
in 
the 
statements, whether we are not dealing with a situation 
where 
while 
Mr 
Khuba 
was 
without 
Mr 
Sesoko’s 
10 
contribution and Mr McBride’s contribution to the first 
report and with the contribution with whoever may have 
contributed to the first report, he summarised and analysed 
the statements in a certain way but once there were three 
people now, working on the second report, they are bound 
to have different views and they are bound to attach 
different amounts of weight on different aspects.  Whether 
you are not dealing of that kind of situation because now 
there are three people who are all going to sign this report 
whereas the other one, only one person is going to sign it 
20 
even though he was contributions Mr Mosing and somebody 
else, so that there is that.  What do you say? 
MR JULY:   You know, if – ja, if under ordinary 
circumstances, Chair, I will agree with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 137 of 255 
 
MR JULY:   But here you have a situation first whether 
there is a denial of even having seen the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
MR JULY:   But that report looks exactly, they were the 
same report that was not seen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR JULY:   That creates a problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So would I be right in saying what really 
changes or changed or influenced the way you say the 
matter was that you believed that they – Sesoko and 
10 
McBride 
had 
seen 
the 
first 
report. 
 
That 
is 
what 
…[intervenes] 
MR JULY:   Ja, that is exactly what, Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  Now, of course 
you had consulted, interviewed Mr Sesoko, you had 
interviewed Mr Khuba, you had interviewed Mr McBride, is 
that correct? 
MR JULY:   Yes, I interviewed all.   
ADV HULLEY SC:   Would it be fair to say that Mr Khuba 
20 
informed 
you 
that 
he 
had 
never 
been 
instructed 
to 
exonerate anybody, he had never been instructed by Mr 
McBride to exonerate anybody.  Would that be fair to say? 
MR JULY:   Mr Chair, he says McBride did not expressly 
said I must change the report but he says, in the same 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 138 of 255 
 
breath, it was due to the influence of McBride, he would 
not have changed the report.  He says that.  He says I told 
Sesoko I said all what I needed to do was just to go and 
attach the information that I received, there is no need for 
picking up the docket.  That is what he says and we come 
then to the conclusion that you would think that McBride is 
going to expressly say that.  He does not have to.  He does 
not have to.  It is the conduct that speaks for itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, there is nothing – there would 
ordinarily be nothing wrong with Mr McBride influencing Mr 
10 
Khuba as to certain part of the report. 
MR JULY:   Yes, yes, that is true. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is – as long as he was not forcing him 
to do something dishonest or something like that, as long 
as it was within legitimate bounds.  But I guess that what 
you – your view was that it was not within legitimate 
bounds. 
MR JULY:   It was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR JULY:   It was not. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are saying that he wanted to – he 
wanted the report to exonerate General Dramat. 
MR JULY:   Yes and Sibiya. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR JULY:   He even goes further, Chair, and say I became 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 139 of 255 
 
happy when my boss was happy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR JULY:   He says that, it is on record, saying I became 
happy when my boss was happy because this report was 
making me sleepless nights, it was to and fro, until Sesoko 
said to me the boss is happy, then I became happy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But, of course, does Mr Khuba not 
somewhere say that he was not aware of the so-called 
deletions?  Does Mr Khuba not – did he not at some stage 
say to you during the interviews that you had with him, did 
10 
he not at some stage deny having been aware of some of 
the changes? 
MR JULY:   Yes, he did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR JULY:   The only thing that he touched on was the 
analysis.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR JULY:   He said having been influenced, Sesoko being 
a lawyer and Sesoko who did law, I must now influence Mr 
Sesoko.  But that also is problematic because that very 
20 
debate with Sesoko, he told us that it took place before 
McBride came into the picture.  But he was never 
convinced by Sesoko, he was never convinced because he 
believed that General Dramat went to Zimbabwe on the 5 
August 2010 to attend a meeting of the region.  Then on 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 140 of 255 
 
the 6 t h had a side meeting with the Zimbabwean police and 
the issue of the fugitives was discussed in that meeting. 
 
After that, they agreed to meet after three months.  
Now in three months, if you count three months from 
August to November, I mean to November the 5 t h, they 
meet of 5 August, 6 August, it is exactly three months when 
they come here on the 4 November.  And so, Chair, when 
you come here on the 4 November, it is what happens then. 
 
Now, when they were at Beitbridge, that information 
is critical.  If you remove that information where Madilonga 
10 
says I then called – you then say it does not matter even if 
he called, but we do not know what he was talking about.  
That is fine, that is what he merely says, but do not put it 
as if that call did not happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, what is the factual basis for you 
not 
accepting 
that 
in 
summarising 
the 
evidence 
or 
summarising the statements or analysing the statements in 
the way in which they did in the second report reflected 
their honest opinion because – I may be asking you in a 
different way what Mr Hulley might have asked earlier on. 
20 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because I take it that you would accept 
that provided in making the changes they were acting 
honestly, even if wrongly, if they were acting honestly then 
there would be no defeating – they would not be said to be 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 141 of 255 
 
guilty of defeating the ends of justice.  So what is the 
factual basis for you not to accept that these changes they 
put in, in the second report, were put in honestly even if, in 
your view, wrongly? 
MR JULY:   Yes.  The one, Chair, starts with the retrieval.  
It starts with the retrieval of the docket itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR JULY:   Right, that is where it starts. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR JULY:   Then now you have the report, you deny that 
10 
you have seen this report, but this report has been 
changed.  You do not want to accept that you have 
changed the report, say what was change was the analysis.  
Nobody owns up in the deletion.  Nobody owns up in the 
deletion of the other particular party, everybody talks 
about the analysis, when we realise that the evidence was 
unsustainable.  The unsustainable evidence must be left 
there.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would this not have been a situation 
where if you are convinced that the recommendation that 
20 
General Dramat should be charged is correct, you need to 
have this information because then it will link. 
MR JULY:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the moment you are convinced that 
that conclusion, that recommendation is wrong, it is not 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 142 of 255 
 
justified, then that information does not make much sense 
because 
now 
it 
was 
there 
to 
show 
that 
this 
recommendation is justified. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
But 
if 
you 
have 
changed 
the 
recommendation that information does not make sense. 
MR JULY:   You must deal with the information. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Is it not that situation? 
MR JULY:   No, no, the situation, Chair – I hear what you 
are talking. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR JULY:   You are talking about an ordinary situation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I am – yes, yes. 
MR JULY:   You are being general. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MR JULY:   I am saying we took a lot of things into 
account. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Into account. 
MR JULY:   To come to that conclusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
20 
MR JULY:   It was not just a question of deletion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR JULY:   We started from the fact that McBride had no 
reason to ask for the docket or even for the docket to be 
collected in the first place. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 143 of 255 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR JULY:   The second one is that there is no reason for 
McBride to sign the docket.   Nothing in law.  Yes, he is 
not breaching the law by doing that.  But he takes it and 
comes and say to you it is because the law requires him to 
sign.  That docket, that report was irregularly given to NPA 
because it let signatures of two people, the head of 
investigations and him, being the Executive Director.   
 
He then justified that by saying in Section 7.4 of the 
IPID, the Executive Director has got powers to sign, is 
10 
required to sign the report, which is the reason why that 
report of Khuba was not a report in accordance to the 
prescripts of the NPA. 
 
So we took all those things into account to say why 
should we be lied to, because he had no reason, he had no 
business with this report.  And again, this is the person 
who said he has never seen the report.  So I am trying to 
also demonstrate the inconsistencies in the evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There was – I do not know whether it is 
Regulation 5, there seems to be reference to a report 
20 
being approved by the Executive Director but I think I got 
that from your report. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If I am not mistaken.  And it did not 
seem to be complete.  In terms of the Act and the 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 144 of 255 
 
Regulations, is such a report not required to be approved 
by the Executive Director? 
MR JULY:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the reference to approval, as 
you understand it?  What does it refer to, that I am talking 
about. 
MR JULY:   Okay.  Where we need to start then, Chair, we 
need to start what was the nature of this investigation 
because all of them are categorised in terms of Section 28.  
It says – even Khuba in his report does say it is 28F and 
10 
H, right?  The H part is the part which says it was referred, 
but the question is, who referred it?  Khuba tells us in his 
report that it was referred by the Secretariat to do what, to 
investigate be Qoboshiyane made a report in June 2012 
where the investigation was done on this issue.  But he 
said this is bigger than us, we do not have investigative 
capacity.  So we proposed two things.   
One, we propose that Judge Pillay, who at one 
stage sat as a – I do not to do what at the DPCI – must sit 
and look at the matter and come to a conclusion on this 
20 
matter. 
Alternatively, let us take this matter to IPID to 
investigate criminal – to do criminal investigation because 
what has been told to parliament, it is lies.  He concludes 
that.   
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 145 of 255 
 
Then this report is then take on the basis of 
Qoboshiyane, which is the Secretariat, is given to IPID.  
That is 28H.  But what does the 28H say?  When you 
receive a report that has been referred by either the 
Secretariat, you then use Regulation 7, right?  When you 
go to Regulation 7, Regulation 7 says for you to be able to 
deal with this investigation you must first determine the 
nature of the offence committed, offences contained in 
Regulation 4 and 5.  In fact, those regulations in 4 and 5 
are the same offences that are in Section 28A to 28G.   
10 
Then 28 of the Act, 28A and B, deals with a murder, 
the killing of people as a result of the action by the Police, 
right?  So both A and B cover the murder.  So what then 
happened is that when you look at 4, within 4 you find two 
scenarios.  When the commission of murder happens 
immediately, 
where 
IPID 
can 
go 
and 
do 
the 
same 
inspection.  That is 4. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But remember, just look at approval, 
when – what is your understanding of whether approval is 
required at any stage? 
20 
MR JULY:   No, it is not required, nowhere. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that reference to approval that I am 
talking about, you know what I am talking about in 
Regulation 5? 
MR JULY:   Regulation 5?  I do not know …[intervenes] 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 146 of 255 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Regulation 5, I thought I got it from the 
Werksmans’ report but it was not quoted …[intervenes] 
MR JULY:   I know we do make reference to Section 5. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, well this – because I have got the 
report in front of me, if I am right in saying I must have 
seen it – yes, it is at page 127 of the bundle.  You say, 
that is paragraph 14 of the report itself, Regulation 5(i) to 
the Act states: 
“After 
collecting 
all 
evidence, 
statements 
and 
technical or expert reports, if applicable, submit a 
10 
report on the investigation of the offence to the 
Executive Director or the relevant provincial head, 
as the case may be, containing recommendations 
regarding 
further 
action 
which 
may 
include 
disciplinary measures to be taken against a member 
of the South African Police Service or the Municipal 
Police Service for criminal prosecution of such 
member.” 
It says – so maybe there is no approval as such here, but 
it says: 
20 
“Submit the report on the investigation of the 
offence to the Executive Director.” 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 147 of 255 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would that apply to this report? 
MR JULY:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or, if not, why would it not apply? 
MR JULY:   No, it does not apply to this offence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, why not? 
MR JULY:   It does not apply, Chair, because Regulation 5 
deals with issues of assault. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR JULY:   Yes, Regulation is strictly …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But was there not assault in this 
10 
rendition thing? 
MR JULY:   There was an assault, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR JULY:   But the issues of assault – when they dealt 
with it, it was - the emphasis was on the murder part. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR JULY:   So because you have two, you have the 
assault, you have murder.  Of course, murder comes 
number one.  And when McBride was asked here by 
Advocate Paul Pretorius, you can look at the record, it 
20 
starts from the investigation that was done, was about 
murder because that was the issue.  It was even the issue 
that was raised by parliament that why were those people 
killed?  And the specific question was asked, was Dramat 
of Sibiya involved in this rendition?  So the real section, 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 148 of 255 
 
which was used, on the fact that it was murder. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Hulley? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  Just to get back 
to what I was asking you about previously and what you 
testified on, you were testifying that Mr McBride had put 
pressure on or had influenced Mr Khuba to change the 
report.  I was just trying to listen and you were looking in 
the direction of the Chairperson but I did not catch what 
10 
was the influence – I know said that at one stage he was 
very happy. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   But what was the influence by Mr 
McBride? 
MR JULY:   No, Khuba says I took the docket, then after 
taking the docket I went straight to McBride, right?   And 
then from McBride I want to the office. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes. 
MR JULY:   With Sesoko.  Then he says we opened the 
20 
report, then the three of them worked on the report, right?  
So he then says – he says that I was influenced that the 
report was influenced – I asked the question would this 
report have changed if Mr McBride was not – did not 
require you to relook at the report?  Khuba’s statement is 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 149 of 255 
 
no, it would not have changed. And I asked a question, this 
information that you say was outstanding, these warning 
statements that you are talking about, what impact did they 
have in the report?  He says none. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   No, but I think we might be talking at 
cross-purposes.  Tell me, what is it that Mr McBride did, 
did he put an iron on his hand? 
MR JULY:   No. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Did he threaten you with a gun?   
MR JULY:   No. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   What was that act that he did? 
MR JULY:   This is what Khuba says, that he was 
influenced by McBride.  What would …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You never got to know he influenced 
him, ja. 
MR JULY:   We did not know, we did not.  You remember, 
Chair, what we ask, we look at the totality of this.  Why 
Khuba started saying he wants now to go and comment at 
the docket.  That he comes back with the docket, right?  
And then they look at the evidence, the same evidence that 
20 
he looked at, when he submitted that, the same arguments 
that were raised by Sesoko because this issue of the 
analysis was there even before the existence of the 
docket.  Suddenly that evidence, that analysis, becomes 
critical.   
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 150 of 255 
 
 
And can I say this, Chair – and I am saying this in 
my affidavit, we had a number, if not about three off-record 
talks with Khuba, and one of the things – and he even 
mentioned it himself in the transcript.  He says you 
remember what I said to you off the record?  If you were to 
ask me, is this person suitable for this position, I reserve 
my comments for that.  
 
But the other things that he said off the record was 
that he was scared of McBride and he was scared of 
McBride and he – he said many things, Chair, some of 
10 
them I do not even remember, but he does – he did say 
that he was scared of McBride.  Then he talks about the 
political history, his history and all of that and says afraid 
of him. 
 
So when he says do not take it lightly when a 
person says – when he says he is happy, I was happy.  So 
the influence sometimes, you do not have to tell a person.  
A persona formulate a view, whether that, him being scared 
of McBride was justified, we do not know, but he said that.  
But, of course, he did not say those things on record.  And 
20 
we do say that in our affidavit. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Oh, you have said that in your 
affidavit. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   What I want to understand, so 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 151 of 255 
 
according to him, he was afraid of McBride. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   This is off the record discussion, 
according to him he was afraid of McBride.  As I 
understand correctly reading your affidavit, he was afraid 
of him because of his struggle credentials. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now he did not say that he was afraid 
physically for his physical wellbeing, if I understand 
correctly. 
10 
MR JULY:   No, no, no, you cannot just be afraid of a 
person of – you will be afraid of Nelson Mandela then. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Pardon me? 
MR JULY:   I am saying struggle credentials only, that is 
not what was communicated to us, Chair, it was a person 
who is scared.  Scared, scared of this person.  We do not 
know what he said to him, we did not bother because that 
is not what we were there for but we could take that 
evidence what he said off the record because what he said 
off the record.   
20 
Chair, I would request yourself time, you read how 
Khuba, how his evidence – I mean, when we interviewed, 
his narration keeps on changing.  You will see that at some 
point he was to tell the truth, at some point he remembers 
that my boss told me the following, right?  Because there 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 152 of 255 
 
is no doubt, you can tell that they must have met 
somewhere and the issue of the docket or the report, 
McBride not having seen, was discussed.   
You know, we are dealing with 2015, we are dealing 
with this thing in 2015 when the changes have already 
occurred.  The changes have already occurred in 2014, 
now they must come and explain why the changes.  The 
first thing would be, from McBride’s side, I have never 
seen the report.  As a result, during the interview, we did 
not even discuss the second report – the first report with 
10 
McBride.   
So Khuba’s being scared of McBride, we spoke to 
Khuba, we had the benefit of looking at Khuba and we 
believed him.  We believed him, that he was scared of him. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now just to round off that particular 
theme, you spoke to Mr Sesoko as well. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And Mr Sesoko, he said that Mr 
McBride had not instructed them or had not given them any 
indication that they are to amend the report in any way. 
20 
MR JULY:   No. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Would that be fair? 
MR JULY:   No, no, no, you see, Sesoko – I hope you have 
gone through Sesoko’s …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have lowered your voice. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 153 of 255 
 
MR JULY:   Oh, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you are away from the mic. 
MR JULY:   I hope you have gone Sesoko’s transcript.  
Sesoko was a very difficult person to – of all the people 
that we interview.  Difficult, he was – even where he 
agrees with you, the difficulty that we also we had, you will 
see where Sesoko is caught up.  He will use “H’m” so you 
do not know whether he is agreeing or he is acknowledging 
what you are saying and I ended up even saying you are 
not going to waste our time, to Sesoko, so we need to 
10 
proceed. 
 
So anybody who thinks that McBride would have 
told them that let us change the report, that is not what is 
going to happen, let us change the report because I want 
to achieve a particular goal.  It is the conduct, you look at 
the conduct and what has happened and we came to the 
conclusion.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But, of course, I go back to what we 
discussed earlier and I raised it with the Minister as well, 
all of these three IPID persons, as I understand the 
20 
position, were people with quite some experience in 
investigation, is that not so? 
MR JULY:   I am not sure about that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR JULY:   I am not sure about that. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 154 of 255 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Well, that is my understanding, not 
that I know anything.  Yes.  You are not sure about that? 
MR JULY:   I am not sure about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
MR JULY:   I am not sure about this experience of an 
investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR JULY:   But whether Khuba was an investigator, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR JULY:   Remember the history of IPID is ICD. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR JULY:   There was not investigation at ICD. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR JULY:   Because ICD was housed within the police, so 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so what I am looking at is certainly 
Khuba gave in his statements talked about the history of 
the two organisations. 
MR JULY:   Yes, yes, 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, he talked about that and then of 
20 
course he was in charge of Limpopo, is that right under 
IPID. 
MR JULY:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He was in charge of Limpopo, my 
understanding is that, being in charge of Limpopo would 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 155 of 255 
 
mean 
that 
he 
was 
in 
charge 
of, 
also 
Provincial 
investigations with Limpopo falling under IPID would that 
not be correct? 
MR JULY:   No, Chair, that is another issue about – I’m 
saying Chair the issue of Khuba and the position that he 
was holding as a Provincial Head. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR JULY:   Before IPID. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no I’m talking about…[intervenes]. 
MR JULY:   Of course, he had some experience but I 
10 
dispute this thing because I heard you Chair, that same 
comment, when Nhleko – Mr Nhleko was here.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR JULY:   You made that comment and said, those guys 
are very experienced…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no I take it that they are 
experienced but you have to say, look, on  what you know, 
you don’t think that they all have that experience or 
whatever. 
MR 
JULY: 
 
 
No, 
they 
don’t, 
Khuba 
might 
20 
have…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What’s your understanding about their 
investigative experience? 
MR JULY:   Khuba…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let’s talk one by one ja. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 156 of 255 
 
MR JULY:   Khuba was an investigator. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR JULY:   Sesoko was not an investigator and he was 
never 
head 
of 
investigations, 
if 
you 
look, 
Chair…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well there’s a question of acting Head or 
what? 
MR JULY:   Chair there are four units. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR JULY:   That fall – at the head office, four, one of them 
10 
is the office of the Executive Director, the other one is 
Corporate Services Unit, the third one is Investigations and 
Information Management Unit, the last one is the Legal 
Services Unit.  Sesoko was made – was appointed to act 
as a Head of Investigations and Information Unit.  That 
unit, all what it does is administrative.  You come up with 
all things that have to do with investigation and if the 
investigation is completed you take the report which comes 
from the Provinces, you summarise it for the Executive 
Director for the Executive Director to go to the Minister.  
20 
He was never the Head, if you look at the SOP’s the Head 
of Investigations reside at the Provinces…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I thought there was a Head of – as I 
understood it, National Investigations. 
MR JULY:   No, no that’s a unit. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 157 of 255 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s a unit? 
MR JULY:   Which is purely administrative. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but there is a unit called that? 
MR JULY:   There is a unit call Investigations because 
your SOP’s will also come from that unit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR JULY:   Right and how do we conduct investigations 
and all those things but the report, the person who has the 
final say on the report, there are two people in terms of the 
Act, now I’m talking the Act, it’s Provincial Head or the 
10 
Director Investigations those are the only two. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, now who was the Director 
Investigations at the time when this second report was 
done, as you understood, then the position if you do? 
MR JULY:   Yes, the Investigating Director – the Director 
Investigation was Khuba. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR JULY:   He was also a Provincial Head. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR JULY:   He was wearing two hats. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR JULY:   This is what happened, Chair, the complaint 
comes to the head office, in terms of Section – I think it’s 
Section 2 – ja I think Section 2 or 5, I think it’s 2, which 
says, once you receive at the head office, you receive this 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 158 of 255 
 
complaint, then you must determine which Province, the 
relevant Province.  The reason why it was given to Mr 
Khuba 
is 
because 
Mr 
Khuba, 
the 
issue 
was 
about 
Beitbridge because the rendition, the handing over of the 
Zimbabweans happened in Limpopo, that is the reason but 
there is a question there of appointment and who appoints 
the investigator.  The investigator is appointed by the 
Executive Director, in this case, Khuba would have been 
appointed by Mr Beekman who was there in 2012 right but 
that’s 
the 
first 
appointment, 
appointing 
him 
as 
an 
10 
investigator. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, but going back to the issue I 
raised.  So, what you are saying is, you are saying Mr 
Sesoko may have been Executive – may have been 
Director Investigations but that doesn’t necessarily mean 
that he had investigative experience? 
MR JULY:   Yes, let me tell you why…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or a lot of it. 
MR JULY:   Yes, how Sesoko becomes, as I understand, 
Koeki Mbeki would come and testify, I don’t know why he 
20 
has not been here yet because all this things could have 
been sorted out.  how, I understand is that, the position of 
Provincial Head, under ICD when they did whatever they 
did in terms of evaluations and the changing of the Act, 
that position was higher than the position that Khuba and 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 159 of 255 
 
Sesoko used to occupy and then because of the Act they 
had to take the positions that are immediately below the 
provincial heads because they did not qualify, I’m told, for 
the position of Provincial Heads.  They then got appointed, 
not even appointed they were confirmed because they were 
already in the system as Director Investigations right.  So, 
the position of Sesoko, without even having investigated 
anything was then that of Director Investigations but 
appointed to act in the position of – in the unit which is 
called Investigations and Information Unit but he’s not 
10 
called a Head he’s called Programme Manager. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR JULY:   I think we need to get that terminology clear 
he’s not a Head, there’s no such things as Head of 
Investigations 
and 
Information 
Unit, 
you’ve 
got 
a 
Programme Manager. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But in their evidence didn’t they refer to 
Head of National Investigations. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They did. 
20 
MR JULY:   They called him a Head. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR JULY:   They said he was a Head. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When people who come from that 
organisation, use that terminology, you understand, ja. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 160 of 255 
 
MR JULY:   No, they did, they did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you let’s proceed. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We are at ten past three on my watch. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   We’re making very slow progress Mr 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Huh? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   I say, we’re making very slow 
progress. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I can tell you that in terms of what I 
10 
am interested in, we’ve made a lot of progress. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes, but the – in terms of the two and 
a half hours that I’d estimated we way beyond that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well we may be, we certainly are way 
beyond that but what Mr July has dealt with, since this 
morning, covers quite a substantial part of the matters that 
I have identified as matters that I’m really interested in but 
there may be others that you have picked up which I might 
not have picked up. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   What – I’ve dealt with Mr Khuba, I’ve 
20 
dealt with Mr Sesoko, as I understand correctly, Mr Khuba 
felt that he was pressurised into changing the report, he 
hasn’t identified specifically but you know that he was 
approached, so that deals with Mr Khuba, insofar as Mr 
Sesoko is concerned, he too indicated that he had not 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 161 of 255 
 
been pressurised or that there was no instruction from Mr 
McBride to change the report but you’re not satisfied you 
dismiss what Sesoko says, sorry. 
MR 
JULY: 
 
 
I 
think 
you 
think 
that 
I 
made 
that 
recommendation because they were influenced by McBride, 
no.  I’m not saying Sesoko should have been influenced by 
McBride I’m saying they were all participants, whether 
influenced or not at the end of the day you take a decision 
to be party to that. So, Sesoko does not need to be 
influence, nor Khuba does have to be influenced. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Ja but the only point I’m making is that 
between the two of them, and I’ve dealt with two people.  
I’ve dealt with Mr Khuba, we’ve parked him, I’m dealing 
now with Mr Sesoko, I understand that in your interview 
with 
him, 
he 
had 
indicated 
that 
he 
had 
not 
been 
pressurised there had been no pressure brought to bear 
upon him to change the report in any way by Mr McBride. 
MR JULY:   You remember Sesoko denied even having 
seen the report so he can’t go – he can’t even say, I was 
not influenced by McBride to change the report, because 
20 
he denies the existence of the report, he said he has never 
seen it. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay let’s do it slightly different. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Would it be fair to say, from your 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 162 of 255 
 
interview with Mr Sesoko that he denied that Mr McBride 
had brought pressure to bear upon him or upon Mr Khuba 
to exonerate anybody, would that be fair? 
MR JULY:   No, no, no I don’t remember anything which 
has to do with influence because we could not ask such a 
question because Sesoko – although at first he said he 
received a report from Khuba and made a copy and gave it 
to McBride, he later denied the existence of the report and 
from there he was consistent even the papers that he filed 
in Court, he denied but he contradict himself because he 
10 
also accept that on the 23 r d of January 2014  he was given 
a report to prepare it for the secretariat.  So, I don’t recall 
anywhere where Sesoko will have to deny having been 
influenced 
by 
McBride 
because 
he 
didn’t 
know…[intervenes]. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Not to change the report, I’ve changed 
that because of your statement to exonerate anybody, 
that’s my question. 
MR JULY:   No even that one. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just put the full question. 
MR JULY:   Even that one. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So the proposition – the question at 
least is, was it discussed with Mr Sesoko whether Mr 
McBride had put pressure on, either him or Mr Khuba to 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 163 of 255 
 
exonerate anybody for that – for him to – or to answer that 
question does it require him to acknowledge that the pre-
existence of another report, it simply deals with whether 
he’s required to exonerate somebody in this report? 
MR JULY:   No, you see, on what basis would w have 
asked that question if he says he doesn’t know anything 
about the first report. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now, if I understand your testimony, 
and I am touching on something that I’ve dealt with before, 
the essence of your complaint and why it amounts to – why 
10 
the conduct might amount to defeating the ends of justice, 
relates to the importance of this report and the fact that it’s 
so important that it has to be taken seriously in terms of 
the IPID Act, in terms of the regulations and in terms of the 
standard operating procedures. 
MR JULY:   Not only that, it’s because that report is in 
terms of the act.  Section 28, that’s the core of IPID the 
core mandate of IPID is to produce the reports.  The do the 
investigation they don’t just investigate and say, okay we 
have investigated, they investigate and then they must 
20 
make reports and those reports will say, prosecute and if 
you say a person must not be prosecuted you are defeating 
the ends of justice if I were to find that you did something 
to influence that decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just remember, Mr Hulley what I said 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 164 of 255 
 
earlier on, that the Commission is not to assess the 
correctness or otherwise…[intervenes]. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Indeed, Mr Chair, and I’m mindful of 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  … of these conclusions, actually if you 
like you can ask questions that are based on assuming that 
his report – his conclusions were wrong and …[intervenes]. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   We’re not entirely concerned with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So if you want to approach – you can 
approach it that way but you know the Commission is not 
10 
about whether his conclusions are wrong but it’s looking to 
see whether there is any evidence suggesting that there 
was some other agenda about the investigation and the 
report and whether they improperly enabled the – maybe 
for lack of a better word, harassment of persons who stood 
– who were against corruption and who wanted to do the 
right thing. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Chair. 
MR JULY:   Could I – on that comment Chair, I know it’s 
not a question, rather a comment. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR JULY:   And you’re making a comment, that whether 
our report would have been used for – or we assisted in 
our report to fulfil the ulterior motives of other people. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 165 of 255 
 
MR JULY:   Chair, if our report, which is based on facts is 
then 
used 
by 
somebody 
who 
has 
an 
ulterior 
motive…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There’s nothing you can do about that. 
MR JULY:   That has nothing to do with us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MR JULY:   That has nothing to do with us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Of course, the argument or the answer 
that you’ve given in relation to the importance of the 
10 
report, it certain is, of course it is a very important 
argument that is raised in your affidavit but I must confess 
I’ve searched through your report to look for that argument 
and I don’t see it in the report.  That it was because of the 
importance as a – from a legal perspective.  Now I might 
be wrong but if you’d like to refer to – well deal with that 
issue. 
MR JULY:   The fact that I don’t mention it, it doesn’t mean 
that we didn’t consider it. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Sure. 
20 
MR JULY:   We may not have mentioned Section 28 but we 
knew what was the common link and existence of IPID. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Do you agree with me, though, that it’s 
not in the report itself? 
MR JULY:   But it doesn’t change then even if you were to 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 166 of 255 
 
mention it now, it’s not going to change. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   In fact, what you say, if you’ll look at 
…[intervenes]. 
ADV TEMBEKA NGCUKAITOBE:   Ja I just want to ask 
what the imputation is that is not contained in the report, I 
just want to make sure I understand? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hmm, just repeat the question Mr Hulley 
because I’m also – I’m not sure if I understood the 
question. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   The argument, as I understand it, and 
10 
it’s an argument that is dealt with in the affidavit.  I 
understand what Mr July is saying, is that the, defeating 
the ends of justice emanates from the fact that the IPID 
officials – official or officials have amended a report in 
circumstances where it doesn’t express their honest belief 
and what he said is, that is – constitutes defeating the 
ends of justice because that report is so important and it’s 
important as a matter of law.  It’s important because of the 
provisions of Section 28 of the IPID Act, it’s important 
because of the regulations and it’s important because of 
20 
the standard operating procedure.  Those factors are all 
legal factors which demonstrate why that report is so 
important.  The proposition that I’m putting is, that when I 
go through the Werksmans report I don’t see that argument 
being raised here in fact there’s a different reason being 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 167 of 255 
 
given as to why it constitutes defeating the ends of justice, 
so that’s the proposition.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Now that may be an important issue to 
raise, maybe with regard to whether the conclusions, 
recommendation they reached were correct or justified isn’t 
it but the question is whether it takes us to the kind of 
issues we are looking at. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Well I want to get onto the reasons 
that are given over here I just wanted to confirm that I 
understand correctly that it’s not in the report because I 
10 
don’t want to be unfair to the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr July is it in the report irrespective of 
whether it should have been or shouldn’t have been? 
MR JULY:   No, Chair we would not have said, because of 
the importance of Section 28, no we would not have said 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, it is not? 
MR JULY:   Yes, we would not have said that.  We would 
20 
have said, of course that there is an illegal rendition, the 
question is, who is responsible for that illegal rendition 
which is an unlawful act.  So, if you protect those people, 
whether it’s because of 28 or whatever but you are 
defeating the ends of justice, ends of justice meaning that 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 168 of 255 
 
people who commit unlawful act must be arrested it has 
nothing to do with Section 28. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well you said something much earlier 
about – you said something that I believed to be that you 
were saying your investigation would – was looking at 
whether prime facie people – somebody might be guilty of 
criminal offence or misconduct. 
MR JULY:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which suggests to me that if what you 
are saying is reflected in your report and I don’t know if it 
10 
is but if it is, it would suggest to me that you were not 
saying, conclusively, they are guilty that would be left to 
another process.  You are saying on the basis of what you 
have found during the investigation there seemed to be a 
case to answer, is that correct? 
MR JULY:   That’s exactly…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON: You were not going beyond that.   
MR JULY:   And in addition to that Chair, this is a 
recommendation to the Minister of Police there should be 
no confusion here, it’s the Minister of Police, not NPA. 
20 
What NPA does with the report, they must do their own 
investigation and decide whether they want to prosecute or 
not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, am I right to say, you are, therefore 
saying, 
whatever 
we 
make 
of 
your 
report 
and 
your 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 169 of 255 
 
investigation we mustn’t judge it and we mustn’t judge you 
on a wrong basis and the wrong basis being as if you were 
required to establish conclusively whether somebody was 
guilty or not guilty.  You say we must remember that you 
were required to form a prime facie view whether there 
seemed to be a case for somebody to answer, either 
criminally or in terms of disciplinary matters, that’s what 
you are saying? 
MR JULY:   And in both instances Chair it was the case, 
whether 
misconduct, 
people 
must 
go 
to 
disciplinary 
10 
hearing, nobody was dismissed based on the report no.  
Nobody can be charged on the report and say, here’s the 
evidence it’s this report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR JULY:   You can’t do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but you – the point that I’m 
clarifying with you is that, in effect, you’re reminding 
everybody that you were not the forum that would make 
findings. 
MR JULY:   Decisions. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   The decision, you were seeking – you 
were looking at everything on a prime facie basis. 
MR JULY:   Prime facie basis yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, which could mean, once there was 
proper evidence or evidence led, the situation could 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 170 of 255 
 
change. 
MR JULY:   It could change Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the people could be found not guilty.  
MR JULY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now you, in fact, had access to several 
prosecutors, amongst which were Advocate George Baloyi, 
Advocate Mzinyathi if I recall correctly. 
MR JULY:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Advocate Chauke, Advocate Mosing, 
10 
Advocate Jiba…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry Mr Hulley, let’s – I just want us 
to have an idea of how far we might be going.  Is it fine if I 
give you 15 minutes to try and wrap up? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  A minimum of 30 minutes if I can just 
some propositions to the witness.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, try 15 if not I’ll give you a little 
bit…[intervenes]. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you.  Would it be fair to say 
that, of those Advocates, those Prosecutors who expressed 
20 
an opinion on this issue, each of them made it clear that 
they have no regard at all to the reports insofar as they 
assess whether a crime has been committed or not? 
MR JULY:   Not even a single one of them.  All what I 
know,  I spoke to Baloyi and Baloyi makes a comment and 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 171 of 255 
 
say, what I did, when I looked at the docket when it was 
sent to me, I started by just looking at the evidence and 
from the evidence I looked at the report and then, I was 
then, while looking at the report, I was then provided with 
another report because it would seem the second report 
came after and then he looked at the two reports but he 
says, I’ve already formulated a view but to say there was 
not a single Prosecutor who said to me, we don’t even look 
at the reports. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   No, not misunderstanding, my question 
10 
is, would it be correct to say that not a single Prosecutor 
indicated that they look at the report to determine whether 
a crime has been committed? 
MR JULY:   No, I didn’t ask, I didn’t ask that question. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   No, I think maybe we’re speaking at 
cross-purposes I’m not asking you whether you had asked, 
what I’m asking you is a slightly different question.  I’m 
asking you whether anyone had indicated to you that they 
considered the report in order to arrive at their conclusion 
that a crime had been committed and I’m referring now – 
20 
when I refer to the report, I refer, of course to the IPID 
report. 
MR JULY:   You must remember Chair, we were asking – 
different procedures does different questions for instance 
when we went to Chauke – we’re starting with Mosing, 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 172 of 255 
 
Mosing is because he was involved in the investigation so 
he would tell us everything about the investigation, that is 
one.  So, when we go to Chauke, it’s because there is a 
memo by Mosing to Chauke right, when we spoke – we 
spoke about the memo to Chauke, when we asked Chauke, 
now that you’ve received the docket, what happened with 
the docket.  He says, I looked at the docket but I must be 
honest, I didn’t even read it, I hand it over to Mr van Zyl 
and Mr van Zyl – we spoke to Mr van Zyl over the phone, 
Mr van Zyl explained to us that, even before I look at the 
10 
docket these two guys came and say they want  the docket 
and they will bring it back, I then, gave them the docket.  
So those are the kinds of question in those procedures 
does. Nomgcobo Jiba, all what we asked was to confirm, 
did you receive the memo from Mosing, she confirmed the 
meeting with Nomgcobo did not even take five minutes, not 
even an hour with all these procedures that we are talking 
about except of course Mosing.  So, we then went to 
Pretoria to meet with Mzinyathi and Baloyi.  In that meeting 
the issue of looking and not looking, only in the meeting 
20 
where the issue of looking at the report was said but 
there’s a context in that, he was saying, I did not look at 
the report first I first looked at the evidence, that’s what he 
said. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Can I ask you to turn with me to Bundle 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 173 of 255 
 
LEA3, Chair this is part of the – this is attached to the 
affidavit of Mr July, if you would turn with me to page 1052. 
Now this is an interview or this is a transcript of an 
interview between yourself and Mr George Baloyi and Mr 
Sibongile Mzinyathi and there are a number of people that 
are present from Werksmans including you, including Ms 
Kerry Biddell, Mr Zandile Thom and Mr Kwazi Buthelezi, is 
that correct? 
MR JULY:  Yip. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now if you’ll turn with me to page 1074, 
10 
I’d like you read from line 15 of that particular page. 
MR JULY:  The one that starts with, I must say? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Yes. 
MR JULY: “I must say from the beginning, when I received  
the docket as the DPP mentioned  it had this email 
report – no it has the email report, the second 
report but I never had a look at the report and I 
mentioned to the DPP that I might be taking a 
radical view, there is so much made about the first 
and the second report but I did not look at the 
20 
reports, that’s not evidence.  When I read the 
docket, 
I’m 
looking 
for 
admissible 
evidence…[intervenes]”. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now, sorry let me just change that, he 
says, “when I read the docket, I’m looking for admissible 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 174 of 255 
 
evidence, these reports are not evidence”, he says. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So, he’s talking about, generally he 
says, when I read reports I do not look at – sorry when I 
read dockets, I do not look at reports, he goes on to say 
that the report itself is not evidence.  Now, what you refer 
to as the semantic argument is actually not a semantic 
argument 
because 
the 
report 
itself 
is 
not 
evidence…[intervenes]. 
MR JULY:  I don’t dispute that, I’ve never said a report is 
10 
evidence all that I’ve said is that the report is produced in 
terms of Section 28 and it cannot be ignored. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And the – so if you would turn with me 
to 
page 
170 
Bundle 
LEA1, 
this 
is 
where 
the 
Werksmans…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, please don’t forget your 
question Mr Hulley. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Don’t forget your question, I’m just 
picking up on this, don’t forget what you were looking for, 
20 
also, Mr July, don’t forget what you were looking for. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I’m interrupting you 
MR JULY:  Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see the report is there but the – Mr 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 175 of 255 
 
Baloyi must be right that you can’t say as a prosecutor, 
I’ve made my decision on the basis of this report for – so 
for 
purposes 
of 
Court 
proceedings 
it 
doesn’t 
mean 
anything, the report what matters is the evidence.  The 
report may be convenient to the prosecutors in that before, 
maybe, you go to the statement it gives you an idea of 
what to except in the statements but in the end you will go 
to the statements and your decision will be based on that, I 
think we are together on that. 
MR JULY:  No, there we are together. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  But this specific docket and report, it has got a 
history. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  When you receive this document, you are asked 
by the NDPP to look from the document which a history of 
it, it has gone to Gauteng, it comes back – it goes back to 
IPID, when it goes back to IPID it doesn’t go back to 
Gauteng it goes back to the National office and then the 
National office takes it to where it does not belong, in the 
20 
first place, but is asking for recommendations.  So, that is 
the history, so ordinarily I don’t know how he operates but 
he says this one he looked – because he knows the history, 
he looked at it there’s a specific reason why it’s given to 
them and there’s a reason why they don’t make a decision 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 176 of 255 
 
they make recommendation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  Yes, but in principle I agree with you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR JULY:  In general, what you are saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And maybe Mr Hulley was going to that 
point as well. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Namely, if one accepts that it’s that the 
prosecutor will base his decision or her decision on the 
10 
statements then it seems to me that the idea of the IPID 
investigator defeating the ends of justice by how he or she 
summarises her report or analyses, looses more force. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  In fact, as I was 
referring you to sir at page 170 of Bundle LEA1 this, Mr 
Chair is…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry I think Mr July is looking for 
something. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Yes, I think he’s trying to find LEA1, it’s 
the same bundle as Mr…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Somebody must help Mr July. 
MR JULY:  Oh, I’ve got it, I found it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You found it? 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 177 of 255 
 
MR JULY:  I found it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.   If you would turn 
with me, sir to page 170 of that Bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1-7-0? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That is correct Mr Chair, this is Exhibit 
Y8(A) and it’s your Werksmans report.  Now paragraph 
5.1.7 – sorry have you got it sir? 
MR JULY:  Yip. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  You say, 
10 
“Each of the co-signatories to the second report 
deny effecting the deletions, we are of the view that 
deletion of material evidence which is likely to 
affect the decision of the NPA in determining or not 
certain 
individuals 
should 
be 
prosecuted 
is 
a 
criminal offence and specifically defeating the ends 
of 
justice 
or 
obstructing 
the 
administrating 
of 
justice”.  
 
Now you’ve been told by Mr Baloyi that this is not 
evidence, we, generally speaking I don’t look at the report 
20 
in order to decide whether a crime has been committed, I 
look at the report afterwards. In fact, what you convey in 
5.7 is exactly the opposite of what Mr Baloyi has told you. 
MR JULY:  Can I explain that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hmm hmm. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 178 of 255 
 
MR JULY:  The same reason why that report had to be 
collected otherwise if those report had no influence nobody 
could have just left that report there because they are 
going to read the evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it might not be – it might be a 
question of how we put it.  I think we are all agreed that – 
we are agreed about certain things, one, is that it would 
not be proper for a prosecutor to base his or her decision, 
simply on a report, that’s point one.  Point two there would 
be nothing wrong if a prosecutor based his or her decision 
10 
on the statements without reading the report, there’d be 
nothing wrong with that either. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Three, but a prosecutor may – we would 
be agreed also about this, may, in addition to studying the 
statements also study the report okay.  What I’m not sure 
about, and this is where you might come in, is whether one 
can go – okay let me put it this way.  I’m not sure what 
else one could put in this equation, the context of this 
remark I’m making is your statement earlier, that the NPA 
20 
can’t – I think as I understood you, you must tell me if I’m 
wrong, can’t just ignore the report. Now – but of course if 
we say, as I think we have all agreed, a prosecutor who 
makes his or her decision on the basis of the statements 
without reading the report would not be doing anything 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 179 of 255 
 
wrong.  If we accept that, that necessarily means he or she 
can ignore the report. 
MR JULY:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, I’m saying I’m not sure that one can 
say it’s – there’s nothing wrong if he looks at the 
statements only and still be able to say, but he must look 
at the report the two are in conflict. 
MR JULY:  But Chair – yes, they sound mutually exclusive 
but they’re not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
10 
MR JULY:  They’re not mutually exclusive, you’re not 
looking at the report, as I understand, is not ignoring it at 
all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry? 
MR JULY:  By not looking at the report I don’t mean that 
you just don’t even look at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  You may look at it for the purposes of 
confirming whether your view is correct and in the same 
breath, that report, what he has just read, Mr Hulley, the 
20 
evidence, the report itself it’s not evidence but what is 
contained in the report might be material evidence, what 
you are saying.  For instance, I put a statement which is 
said by Matalongwe, that report is not material evidence 
but what I’m saying about Matalongwe is material. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 180 of 255 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let’s look at what the report is 
supposed to contain. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the extent that the report seeks to 
summarise the evidence in the statements, to the extent 
that the report seeks to analyse that evidence and it seeks 
to make a recommendation based on the summary of the 
statements and the analysis of the statements, it seems to 
me, that you would lose nothing as a prosecutor if you 
studied the statements thoroughly and arrived at your 
10 
decision, okay.  It may be that when you’ve arrived at your 
decision and you have more time, you take the report, you 
say, oh, it was also making – it arrived at the same 
conclusion as me, so it’s fine you know but if, in the report, 
you have something that doesn’t seek to summarise or 
analyse the contents of statements but seeks to tell the 
NPA something else that, that might be different but then 
that something else, I would imagine, would not be of any 
legal importance if it is not evidence but if it is evidence, 
even if it’s evidence by the investigator, then it would be.  
20 
So, it seems to me that we might be able to agree that 
insofar as the report seeks only to summarise the contents 
of statements and to analyse the contents of those 
statements 
and 
come 
up 
with 
a 
recommendation, 
a 
prosecutor 
who 
doesn’t 
look 
at 
it 
but 
studies 
the 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 181 of 255 
 
statements properly and thoroughly and makes a decision 
is likely to do his or her job properly but it may be that it’s 
advisable to have a look at the report. 
MR JULY:  But how would the prosecutor then, Chair, 
comes to the conclusion that I agree or I do not agree with 
the report, I know that the decision is theirs but that 
person must be in a position to say, I don’t agree with the 
report, how do you do that? 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
But 
is 
there 
a 
law 
– 
is 
there 
a 
requirement that the prosecutor must indicate whether he 
10 
or she agrees with the report. 
MR JULY:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because if there is no requirement, that 
nobody – she’s not required to do that and it would seem to 
me, subject to what you might have to say, it would seem 
that the report might be helpful…. 
 
 
[your last paragraph below so you type up to 1.30.00] 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...the report might be helpful and maybe 
20 
very useful to a prosecutor who decides to read it, but if a 
prosecutor says look I have a lot of cases, I don’t have 
time, I will look at what really matters, I will look at the 
statements, and I will apply my mind properly and make my 
decision.  As long as I make my decisions on the basis of 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 182 of 255 
 
the statements I will be fine. 
MR JULY:  Yes.  That Chair I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  But now what do you do with the intention of the 
person who is preparing that report?  They also know what 
you are saying.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR JULY:  But if my intention of changing the report is to 
influence you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR JULY:  The fact that I did not succeed to influence you 
you decided to ignore the report.  Does the intention go 
away? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I think you are now on another – on 
another issue.  I am not – I am on a different one.  I am 
looking at – I am looking simple at the question of the value, 
the legal value of the report. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it – that is what I am looking at to say 
what is the legal significance or the significance in law of 
20 
this report?  And particularly in the light of the fact that we 
all agree that the prosecutor needs to base his or her 
decision on the statement. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If he or she has had the benefit of the 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 183 of 255 
 
report before making the decision that is fine.  But as long 
as her decision or his decision is based on the statements 
nobody could you know have a problem with that. 
MR JULY:  Yes.  Chair you must also bear in mind that when 
we look at it we are looking at it not from the end of that it is 
not going to be read. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JULY:  We are looking at it from the intention of the 
person who is drafting the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
10 
MR JULY:  And I am not going to accept that a person who 
does not succeed in his attempts to make that influence 
simply because the prosecutor failed to read the report and 
therefore that person had no intention to defeat the ends of 
justice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the – Mr Hulley you might wish to look 
at this and take this further.  But there is the question which 
I raised in the morning. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To say it seems difficult to accept that if I 
20 
know that before you make your decision you will look at this 
file – File A.  Because you must make your decision on the 
basis of – of what is in File A. 
MR JULY:  Yes.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If I give you File B that is supposed to be a 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 184 of 255 
 
summary or analysis of the contents of File A and I change 
certain things not to be consistent with what is in File A if I 
know that you will start at File A it seems difficult to – to 
think that I would think that I will successfully influence you. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I know you are going to look at 
this and when you look this you will see that I have – I have 
not given – I have not dealt with certain information. 
MR JULY:  We have not looked from that angle of success. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR JULY:  Whether they will succeed or not.  We looked at 
the whole conduct and the intention and we found the 
intention there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JULY:  Whether what they did they believed in their 
minds that they were going to succeed and whether indeed 
they succeeded that is another issue.  But at the time of 
changing the report otherwise there is no reason.  No reason 
for it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I understand what you are saying but 
20 
do you not say when you look at his or her – his intention 
that is now the investigator who does this.  Do you not 
accept that the fact that he knows you will – before you 
make a decision you will look at File A and you will see 
exactly everything that including whatever he might not have 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 185 of 255 
 
included in File B does seem to weaken the force of the 
argument that says, he had an intention to influence. 
MR JULY:  I accept that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR JULY:  Because people who go and steal even if they 
know that to get access, they might be difficult. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  But they would go there in any event. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  With the hope that they are going to succeed it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR JULY:  So if they do not succeed it does not change the 
crime. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in other words, you are saying… 
MR JULY:  That was the intention. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That they might be taking their chances. 
MR JULY:  They were taking chances. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In case the decision does not… 
MR JULY:  What if the other – Chairperson ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Read the statements. 
20 
MR JULY:  What if the other prosecutor did not look at the 
report? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  If I can move on? 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 186 of 255 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Because we have spent much time on 
this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I see we are at six minutes to but I 
know Mr July – I have occupied Mr July for quite some time. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  If I can… 
CHAIRPERSON:  How much time do you think you need?  I 
… 
ADV HULLEY SC:  If I can just go through and put a series 
propositions to Mr July? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  He can deal with the propositions and 
then we could wrap up Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV HULLEY SC:  As I look your report and I know that you 
have spent quite a bit of time analysing the first report, 
analysing the second report and you have almost done – you 
have done a table where you have mirrored the two reports 
against each other in order to – to demonstrate how the two 
reports differ from each other. 
20 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  In deciding which of the two reports is 
the correct report – which other report.  Two reports has 
come to the correct conclusion understand that you – you 
come to the conclusion that the first report comes to the 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 187 of 255 
 
correct conclusion on the basis of the available information, 
is that correct? 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And if I understand correctly when doing 
that exercise you went through – you simply looked at the 
summary or the report itself you were not investigating or 
looking at that report and comparing it to what was contained 
in the docket. 
MR JULY:  Where? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Were you? 
10 
MR JULY:  We also looked at the docket. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did? 
MR JULY:  We had to look at the docket. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR JULY:  Chair.  We were provided with the docket. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR JULY:  So we had to look at the docket which is why we 
also came to the conclusion in other respects to confirm.  
For instance, when you delete whether the Success Report 
where they – we will look – we will go and look that no these 
20 
reports are here why is it reported that there was no Success 
Report?  When there is physically there is a report.  You go 
and delete where it says Success Report was sent to so and 
so and then you delete that part.  But the Success Report 
when you look at them there are emails they are sent to so 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 188 of 255 
 
and so but that part is deleted. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now what I – when I went through your – 
through your report one thing that struck me about the report 
is that the report appears to summarise you – and I am 
talking 
now 
about 
the 
Werksmans 
Report 
appears 
to 
summarise the first report in explaining why it is that the 
conclusion is correct.  It does not appear to summarise the 
docket. 
MR JULY:  No, no. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Am I – do I misunderstand that? 
10 
MR JULY:  No, no you misunderstanding it.  You need to go 
through the whole report. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay. 
MR JULY:  You need to go through the whole report.  That 
report summarises – we first start with what the report says.  
You should also remember Chair the first report and the 
second report that is why we come to the conclusion that 
there is no second report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JULY:  In fact, what happened is the people amended 
20 
the first report which they deny that it existed.  Right that is 
what we are saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR JULY:  So we looked at it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 189 of 255 
 
MR JULY:  And we say what he says because remember 
some of the things that are in Khuba’s report he repeated 
them when we interviewed Chairperson yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Yes well it is – it is interesting that 
you just use the word amended. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because earlier on I wanted to put to you 
that maybe what happened was effectively that the first 
report was effectively amended. 
MR JULY:  Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So which sounds more acceptable to me 
than the alteration and so on but you must remember that in 
a way when you amend you alter.   
MR JULY:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But somehow it seems to – to sound less 
strange than the idea of alteration. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because alteration just seems to give me 
this physical alteration. 
MR JULY:  Two things. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR JULY:  In fact I am using amendment in relation to the 
recommendations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  Yes. But in terms of deletion of information. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 190 of 255 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR JULY:  That is another issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  When you talking about the amendment… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do not speak too far from the microphone. 
MR JULY:  No, no when I talk about the amendment Chair I 
am making reference to the recommendations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Yes. 
10 
MR JULY:  But in fact the – they were deletions to justify the 
amendment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  You know sometimes how these 
things sound in ones ear and in one’s mind is very strange 
because in the end when you look at – when you amend – 
when you amend you – you change and when you delete 
something in a document you effectively change in the sense 
that the document no longer has the same things that it had 
before. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so… 
MR JULY:  But you would also want to know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now I understand you. 
MR JULY:  You will also want to know what is the 
justification for that deletion. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 191 of 255 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now just with so far as the – if I can 
move over to the offences that General Dramat and General 
Sibiya. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Because obviously the allegations also 
that the Minister was and that is the allegation that has been 
made by Mr McBride, Mr Sesoko and Mr Khuba. 
10 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That in fact there was no wrongdoing on 
the part of Mr Dramat – sorry General Dramat. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And General Sibiya and there was – the 
evidence did not support such a finding.  And the suggestion 
is that by using Werksmans the Minister had in fact sought 
an opportunity to reinvent a case against the General Dramat 
and General Sibiya one that had already found by IPID to be 
– to have been without merit.  You familiar with the – with 
20 
the argument?  I am talking about the argument of Mr 
McBride, Sesoko and Khuba. 
MR JULY:  Oh that – that Minister wanted to use the 
Werksmans Report. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Well wanted to Werksmans he had 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 192 of 255 
 
appointed Werksmans in order to come up with a report that 
would have the effect of reinstituting – if I can take you back 
just to give you some context.  So there is this report which 
is dated the 22 January which makes a finding. 
MR JULY:  Yes, yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And as the – as the theory goes and I am 
putting just theory – the theory goes that report would be 
sufficient if relied upon. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  To get rid of General Dramat and General 
10 
Sibiya because it comes to the conclusion they would be 
suspended and of course pursuant to their suspension the 
argument is that Mr or rather that General Ntlemeza then can 
then move into General Dramat’s position. 
MR JULY:  Oh. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  You follow? 
MR JULY:  That – that we were not even interested in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you would not know anything about 
that. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  No, I am not saying that you are part of 
20 
that. 
MR JULY:  No, no I am saying when we were given two 
reports we were not interested. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR JULY:  What it is intended for. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 193 of 255 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you will not have been told. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If there was such a purpose you would not 
have been told about it anyway. 
MR JULY:  Yes.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I do not want to touch upon that 
necessarily but the point is I am trying to give you context as 
to why the case against General Dramat and General Sibiya 
was so important. And of course you come to the conclusion 
10 
that there was sufficient information in the docket to show 
prima facie that they had committed the crime. 
MR JULY:  That? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That they had committed several crimes.  
I am talking of General Dramat and General Sibiya. 
MR JULY:  That they did not? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  They had.  You came to the conclusion. 
MR JULY:  Yes.  That they had committed. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Correct. 
MR JULY:  Oh yes. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And that there was sufficient information 
prima facie. 
MR JULY:  Yes. Yes.  No that is true.  That is true Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR JULY:  That is what the conclusion that we reached. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 194 of 255 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  And you want to know why we reached that 
conclusion? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Well I do not want to necessarily go 
through all of these things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I want to just take you through otherwise 
if we were to do that we would be here for another day. 
MR JULY:  No but I think – no, no, no I am not talking about 
telling you blow by blow I am saying why having said after 
10 
the analysis said Sibiya was not at Diepsloot.  We did not 
instead what we did we agreed with the analysis.  We said 
we are not going to say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  Anything about the analysis. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR JULY:  Let us accept the analysis. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR JULY:  These two guys – three guys who said they saw 
Sibiya is their own problem. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR JULY:  But what we then say there is a responsibility 
here.  There is no way that Sibiya being a head of TOMS and 
having agreed to provide the personnel and we have already 
had an evidence which is contained in the docket by Mr Leon 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 195 of 255 
 
Verster – Ms Verster – I think it is Verster saying… 
ADV HULLEY SC:  It is Verster. 
MR JULY:  She – this Maluleke was no longer reporting to 
me.  She – he is my subordinate but he was taking 
instructions from Sibiya. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JULY:  Right and we also took into account Chair the 
fact that they went to Zimbabwe.  They come to South Africa.  
The evidence by Madilonga is still there.  We then say but 
the conclusion cannot be right because these people have to 
10 
be held accountable.  Whether they were physically that is 
not our issue.  We said they should be accountable.  Chair 
just to remind you rendition has been declared one of the 
crime against humanity.  It is an international thing.  We are 
part of the Human Rights – Declaration of Human Rights.  
Para declaration and all these other declarations we are part 
of that.  And now what happened is that in terms of rendition 
you may not pinpoint this – they were soldiers, people who 
commit that.  Sometimes do that because of the instructions.  
Now how do you hold people up there who are accountable?  
20 
You look at their knowledge before and after.  What we know 
is that before it is not a coincidence that the people – the 
police officers now that came into the country it is because 
there was an understanding that there would be that 
assistance.  Right.  The second thing is now the sending of 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 196 of 255 
 
the photos that were sent to Sibiya and they were also sent 
to Dramat.  Right.  Now we concluded that – and there is an 
evidence which says Dramat came to a meeting where these 
people were co-regulated.  We considered all of that and we 
said because of that responsibility the position that they 
occupy there is no way that they did not know about this 
rendition.  Then that is how we came to the conclusion that 
they should be accountable. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  You see the – as far as the photographs 
are concerned the photographs were never sent just to 
10 
answer a few questions that you have raised or issues that 
you have raised.  Photographs were never actually sent to 
General Dramat as I understand it. 
MR JULY:  To the PA. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  They were in fact sent to his PA. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And as I understand it it was sent to his 
PA  
MR JULY:  Not for his purpose. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  For the purpose of printing it and to give 
20 
it back to … 
MR JULY:  No, no. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Do I misunderstand? 
MR JULY:  Because look now we understood it.  Not – that is 
not how we understood it.  It was not for the printing.  Even 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 197 of 255 
 
if it was for the printing why could they not print themselves?  
Maluleke and them.  The fact of the matter we had evidence 
that indeed he came to the meeting but what was in dispute 
is what he said when he left the meeting.  Whether indeed he 
said that meeting must not be talked about that he was 
there.  Because there were conflicting versions there.  There 
is one who said yes he was there but I do not know about 
this part where he said we must not talk about him having 
attended a meeting. That is the only thing.  But insofar as us 
being told not differently that he was in that meeting he knew 
10 
about the presence and not only that there was a meeting of 
the 5 t h November when the operation took place on the 5t h in 
the early hours of the morning of the 6 t h.  So that meeting is 
also not disputed.  What is being disputed is to analyse – the 
analysis then says, you do not know what was discussed in 
that meeting. But nobody say the Zimbabweans were not 
there.  There is ample evidence that the Zimbabweans that 
operated there – they were Zimbabweans who met with 
Dramat in the office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Tell me Mr July maybe as a matter of 
20 
interest did you ever look into the question of why people in 
the position of General Dramat and Sibiya would have 
wanted to be party to an illegal extradition of Zimbabweans 
when otherwise they could get Home Affairs to deal with 
them and then they could be extradited in – in a lawful way. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 198 of 255 
 
MR JULY:  Yes in fact Chair this issue is raised by the 
Zimbabweans in a meeting that they had on the 6t h.  They 
raised the issue that we have a problem with South African 
government. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JULY:  People who commit crime in Zimbabwe when they 
run to South Africa, we do not get them easy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Get them back. 
MR JULY:  They claim political asylum.  That is one.  Right.  
So we have a problem with that.  Not only that Chair you will 
10 
remember I am not sure with the cases that we have quoted 
where you were part of those judgments that we cannot even 
when we use extradition extradite people of Zimbabwe or 
Botswana to those countries if the punishment is going to be 
capital punishment.  We would seek undertakings as this 
country that those people will not be sentenced to death. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JULY:  So we will never as this country extradite a 
person who is going to be sentenced to death that side.  But 
in this case it was an agreement to hand them over.  Here is 
20 
the thing what happened.  Coincidentally after that meeting 
in September a superintendent was killed.  They desperately 
wanted to get the superintendent.  And it is stated that much 
in the Success Report.  It is not something that we dream 
up.  Maluleke says that in the report. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 199 of 255 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR JULY:  It is not what we think.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Mr Hulley. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now – thank you Mr Chair.  The important 
thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are at ten past four. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  If I can just have a few more minutes just 
to wrap up Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Just quickly to deal with some of the 
10 
things. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And to correct some of the propositions 
that you might have made earlier on.  It is important that you 
make the point now that in September of 2010 that is when 
the Zimbabwean superintendent was apparently killed. 
MR JULY:  Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  This operation in fact took place in 
November and possibly in the following year of 2010 into 
2011, correct? 
20 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  But the meeting between Mr Dramat or 
General Dramat and the Zimbabwean officials was on the 6 
August. 
MR JULY:  Was on the 6t h yes. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 200 of 255 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:  The 6t h August the proposition that you 
have advanced is that the purpose of that meeting. 
MR JULY:  No. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  If I understood correctly you were – you 
were accepting the proposition that the purpose of that 
meeting was to get hold of Zimbabwean criminals in relation 
to that crime. 
MR JULY:  You got me wrong. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Did I misunderstand you? 
MR JULY:  No you misunderstood me.  I am saying they 
10 
were talking about fugitives in general in that meeting of the 
6t h.  It was about fugitives in general coincidentally which it 
so 
happened 
that 
the 
superintendent 
was 
killed 
in 
September.  And in that meeting they agreed that in three 
months they must get together and that the person who was 
took from both sides two people who had appointed to 
coordinate this issue.  So when they came here it was 
exactly three months based on the meeting that at the same 
time, they have got this superintendent who was killed. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That is all you got to say? 
20 
MR JULY:  No I am finished. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Are you complete? 
MR JULY:  No I am finished. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Sorry the – as I understand it the 
Success Report if you would turn with me to bundle LEA14. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 201 of 255 
 
MR JULY:  Yup. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  The Success Report as I understand it 
was sent to several people, is that correct? 
MR JULY:  Ja it was sent to several people including Dramat 
that is how they do it. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Yes and do you recall who the other 
people were that it was sent to? 
MR JULY:  I cannot remember. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay. 
MR JULY:  I cannot recall.  I cannot recall.  We can go 
10 
there. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  If you would turn with me to page – I 
have got it down over here as 1320. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At twenty five past I will stop you. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.   
MR JULY:  Yup page? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Just bear with me I seem to have the 
wrong – the wrong document.  The – if you just bear with me.  
It is in fact in Bundle LEA13 Mr Chair.   
MR JULY:  13? 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That is right my apologies.  If I called – 
recall correctly that Success Report had been sent to 
amongst others to General Lebeya as well. 
MR JULY:  Hm. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  You recall that? 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 202 of 255 
 
MR JULY:  Page – what page are you in? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I am looking for page 1329. 
MR JULY:  Okay we can talk about this I know.  I looked at 
the documents. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  But my pagination system seems to have 
gone.  Do not worry about that.  But you will recall that it 
was sent to General Lebeya as well.  Now my recollection is 
that you did not make a recommendation that General 
Lebeya should be charged. 
MR JULY:  Are you sure? 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And we tried to  
MR JULY:  Are you sure about that? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That is my recollection but you correct 
me if I am wrong. 
MR JULY:  No you can yourself and read the reports that say 
that.  Notwithstanding that Lebeya says this is how we 
receive – I would have written noted because that is what I 
do.  But it does not mean that but we said he must be 
charged. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay. 
20 
MR JULY:  And that is a prima facie view that we have.  
Whether NPA charges or not. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  It is up to them.  And if they charge they must 
know their story. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 203 of 255 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay.  Then – and for the sake of – for 
the sake of speeding up this thing I am not going to go 
through that for the present purposes.  If you – if you 
consider the different – the different reports for instance the 
photographs there was no evidence that as a fact General 
Lebeya – sorry General Dramat received the document and if 
I recall correctly there is no recommendation at all that the – 
that the secretary or the PA should be – should be 
investigated and a statement obtained further or anything to 
that effect. 
10 
MR JULY:  We can for the purposes of that document we can 
just remove the issue of the photographs there without 
recommendations stand yes.  Knowledge – because all what 
we are saying knowledge and we state out why we said he 
was aware of this.  That is all you had to say.  We might 
have been wrong.  That meeting which was held on the 5t h 
and on that very same day and Leon Verster has also made 
an affidavit which is in the docket where he says, I came 
back with other people from an ATM bombing somewhere 
around twelve midnight.  When I get to the office there were 
20 
cars, a lot of cars. That office that he is talking about is the 
office of General Dramat.  So … 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Sorry so what is your point? 
MR JULY:  So the point that I am trying to make I am 
answering the issue of knowledge.  Knowledge is not about 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 204 of 255 
 
photographs – not about photos.   
ADV HULLEY SC:  Yes.  But what we are concerned with is 
not knowledge that an operation had been conducted. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  But rather knowledge that the operation 
was an unlawful one. 
MR JULY:  No it was unlawful.  It starts… 
ADV HULLEY SC:  No we are not asking whether it was 
unlawful.  If you do not mind.  We talking about whether 
there was knowledge that it was unlawful. 
10 
MR JULY:  No. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That is the point I am referring to. 
MR JULY:  No.  Chair if the operation was a lawful operation 
because you need first for you to be able to implicate Dramat 
and them you need to give the legal status of the rendition.  
It was unlawful.  If you leave the statement of Madilonga how 
does Zimbabwean police get into the country was unlawful to 
the fold.  You allow the police of Zimbabwe that you – were 
met – you seemed to be in a meeting on the 5t h to do the 
policing in the country in South Africa.  And people get 
20 
arrested and some of those people who got arrested are 
handed over and again the handing over happens – there is 
an allegation because it is confirmed by Home Affairs from 
Orlando Police Station that these people were moved direct 
from Orlando straight to Beit Bridge.  Right.  So all what I am 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 205 of 255 
 
saying is the whole transaction – the whole operation was 
unlawful starting from the call that was made. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  Insofar as the 
unlawfulness of the entry into South Africa is concerned I 
must confess I have never seen anybody say that before. 
MR JULY:  No. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  You seem to – and it seems to be the first 
time that it is being said now that there was a breach of the 
law just entering into the country.  Just explain that to us? 
MR JULY:  So it is a mind-bending logic to say a person can 
10 
come into the country through the call.  When a person 
comes to this country you produce documents that I am 
getting in here.  I have got – we are using I do not know 
what they use – is a passport.  Yes that is all what you need.  
That your papers are in order.  The reason why they had to 
enter into the manner in which they did because they did not 
know they must be in – they are in the country.  That can be 
the only logical conclusion. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And I must confess I do not recall seeing 
a recommendation that that crime had been committed. 
20 
MR JULY:  No, no. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Of allowing people to unlawfully enter the 
country.  I understand about unlawfully leaving the country. 
MR JULY:  No. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  As part of the rendition. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 206 of 255 
 
MR JULY:  Sir we did not have to say that.  But we knew that 
you cannot get into the country by a phone call. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so – so in effect on the – on the 
information that you gathered during the investigation. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was clear to you is that what you are 
saying? 
MR JULY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That the entry into South Africa. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  By the Zimbabweans. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was illegal. 
MR JULY:  Was illegal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then – and I guess once the entry was 
illegal the – maybe that also influenced the illegality of 
leaving the country. 
MR JULY:  That is exactly the case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because if you are going to make your 
departure from South Africa. 
20 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Lawful you have got to report yourself to 
the authorities. 
MR JULY:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 207 of 255 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now of course there is and I say this 
respectfully.  There is nothing in the – in any of the 
information – any of the statements that demonstrates that 
the sole basis on which they obtained entry into the country 
was on the basis of the phone call.  The various statements 
as I understand it correct me if I am wrong – the various 
statements as I understand it are dealing with the question 
not of whether the person has committed the crime of 
unlawfully entering into the country but rather with the 
question of the rendition and what happened – and the 
10 
assaults and so forth.  So what happens here and what 
happens going out?  Nobody actually makes the point that 
they did not present their passports. 
MR JULY:  They may – the fact that we do not make that 
point does not mean that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry the fact that? 
MR JULY:  The fact that we do not make that point does not 
mean that we did not consider the fact that you cannot get 
into another country by making a phone call. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but I…… 
20 
MR JULY:  We considered that issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think maybe Mr Hulley’s point is a slightly 
different one namely you were informed that they – a call 
was made to General Dramat, is that right? 
MR JULY:  Yes it is in the report. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 208 of 255 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that after that call they were allowed 
to get in. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the question to put it differently is do 
you know as a matter of fact that those Zimbabweans were 
not in possession of the necessary documentation to enter 
the country lawfully? 
MR JULY:  The logical conclusion Chair is based that I do 
not know as a matter of fact that they did not have but what I 
do know for them to get into the country it was because of a 
10 
call.  And I do not understand people getting into a country 
because they phoned someone else. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that I understand.  You see it is 
important to make a distinction if you do not know as a 
matter of fact. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether they did have the necessary 
papers.  Because of course you – you might recall the 
evidence – the details of the evidence better because it may 
well be that entry into the country was not on the basis of 
20 
the call but they did have the documentation.  I am just 
saying it could be.  But for them to make arrangements – 
certain arrangements it might have been necessary to phone 
a particular person.  So – but once you say as you have said 
that you do not know as a matter of fact whether they had 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 209 of 255 
 
the documentation that makes the distinction it could be that 
they did not have but it could be that they had or some of 
them had. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR JULY:  Chair Madilonga even goes further and talk about 
when they returned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR JULY:  On the 8 November. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR JULY:  It is not just the entry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  When they returned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR JULY:  When they – they called him Madilonga so he 
says.  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR JULY:  So he assisted them and also he assisted 
Maluleke to hand over these people to the Zimbabweans 
when they were out the sight of the border. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JULY:  So it is not just a question of… 
CHAIRPERSON:  In that event if they did not have the 
documentation it would not mean that the border authorities 
actually colluded with…  
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 210 of 255 
 
MR JULY:  No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With either the Zimbabweans or General 
Dramat to achieve the crossing of these people from South 
Africa to Zimbabwe without the documentation the necessary 
documentation. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If they did not have the documentation. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You agree? 
MR JULY:  That is… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words the border authorities. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They were required to say produce the 
necessary documents. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And these people if they nevertheless 
crossed the – into South Africa without such documents and 
out of South Africa into Zimbabwe without such documents 
there would have had to be some cooperation of some kind 
from the border authorities. 
20 
MR JULY:  I agree with that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR JULY:  Because Madilonga remember is from that 
border. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 211 of 255 
 
MR JULY:  He was sort of the guy who assisted them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I know I took some minutes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But we are at an end.  I give you one 
minute to wrap up 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  So effectively the – 
and the reference to the email with the photographs Mr Chair 
is at Y14[A] that is Exhibit Y14[A] it is part of Bundle LEA11. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And it is at page 439. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  We can consider it separately.  The – 
what is clear having regard to – to the different statements 
that were in the docket it is clear that and I am talking now 
about 
the 
rendition 
docket 
that 
the 
people 
who 
had 
implicated General Dramat and General Sibiya were 
a. Where not in agreement even although they were – 
they were speaking about in some instances the same 
20 
event it was clear they were speaking about the same 
event and at the same time they were present at the 
same time and yet some mentioned that there was 
apparently that General Sibiya was present and a 
participant in the assault. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 212 of 255 
 
MR JULY:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Others mention that he was present. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  But did not mention that he participated 
in the assault and others did not even mention that he was 
present at all. 
MR JULY:  Yes.  Which is the reason why Chair then we did 
not even entertain the issue of assault.  Because we 
concluded that no, no we do not think that we can agree with 
anything here let us not – let us leave as if Mr – General 
10 
Sibiya was not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay. 
MR JULY:  So the assault thing is not – he was not charged 
for assault. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay  
ADV HULLEY SC:  And insofar as the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was the last question. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you.  Mr Ngcukaitobi do you 
have re-examination? 
20 
ADV NGCUKAITOBI:  Yes Chair I wonder. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you have an idea how much time you 
need? 
ADV NGCUKAITOBI:  How much you would be willing to give 
me? 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 213 of 255 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The – the re-examination is meant to be 
for clarification. 
ADV NGCUKAITOBI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NGCUKAITOBI:  I intend only to clarify Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NGCUKAITOBI:  I am not going to waste time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright. 
ADV NGCUKAITOBI:  But I just want to know the maximum 
end time. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am hoping that you will not go 
beyond five. 
ADV NGCUKAITOBI:  Yes indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that fine? 
ADV NGCUKAITOBI:  I definitely will not go beyond five. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No that is fine. 
ADV NGCUKAITOBI:  Thank you.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You – you can do it from there I 
understand it is not comfortable when you are there. 
ADV NGCUKAITOBI:  Yes I – it is definitely not comfortable 
20 
where I am standing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NGCUKAITOBI:  So perhaps I should then move 
across. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes they will sanitise.   
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 214 of 255 
 
ADV NGCUKAITOBI:  Mr July I want to start by – there has 
been a debate between you and the Chair around whether or 
not the finding that you came to about the defeating or 
obstructing the ends of justice was a legitimate or not 
legitimate finding.  I know the commission does not have to 
make a decision on that but we have to test your own 
assessment.  The definition according to Batchel [?] and 
Milton of the crime of defeating the ends of justice is the 
following.  It say: 
“Defeating or obstructing the course of justice consists in 
10 
unlawfully doing an act which is intended to defeat or 
obstruct 
and 
which 
does 
defeat 
or 
obstruct 
the 
due 
administration of justice.” 
And then it continues: 
“It is immaterial whether the allege conduct has merely a 
tendency to defeat or obstruct the course of justice or is 
even capable of defeating or obstructing the course of 
justice.” 
Do you have any comment on that particularly on the last 
past that the onus does not have to – the result does not 
20 
even have to be capable. 
MR JULY:  Exactly.  Yes.  I agree – I agree with that.  No I 
think that is exactly what I have been saying that you look at 
the intention. 
ADV NGCUKAITOBI:  Yes. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 215 of 255 
 
MR JULY:  Of the person – the outcome is something else. 
ADV NGCUKAITOBI:  But also, the question of whether you 
are even capable. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGCUKAITOBI:  Thank you.  Now I want to then go 
back to the nature of your evidence.  I only have five topics 
Chair.  The first one is on the illegality of the rendition. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NGCUKAITOBI:  Now my understanding of the issue of 
the illegality is that if you look at both reports both the 
10 
January and the March reports of Mr Khuba.  In both of those 
reports he came to the conclusion that the rendition was 
illegal. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGCUKAITOBI:  Even in the final report of March he 
still came to the conclusion that rendition was illegal. 
MR JULY:  Yes.  Except that he says only one person. 
ADV NGCUKAITOBI:  No, no I understand that but the 
rendition itself as a practice. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
20 
ADV NGCUKAITOBI:  That was undertaken was found to be 
illegal. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGCUKAITOBI:  The difference was whether or not Mr 
Dramat and Mr Sibiya should be held liable. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 216 of 255 
 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGCUKAITOBI:  Your analysis was that on the 
evidence that was before him he should have concluded that 
they were also liable. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGCUKAITOBI:  On his version certainly the second 
version he found that they were not liable. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGCUKAITOBI:  Yes.  Now the reasons that he has 
cited why the rendition was an unlawful rendition.  I just want 
10 
to summarise them.  They are contained if you want to have 
a look at them at page – in the first report at page 477 to 
482 and in the second report at page 522 to 5 – sorry to 553 
to 560.  Now I want to summarise those reasons and see if 
you agree with them.  The reason he said those were 
unlawful  
1. Is because this was not an extradition. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGCUKAITOBI:   
2. South African had an agreement with the Zimbabwean 
20 
government in relation to illegal immigrants in this 
country. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGCUKAITOBI:   
3. The officials of Home Affairs were not involved. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 217 of 255 
 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGCUKAITOBI:   
4. This amounted to kidnapping. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGCUKAITOBI:   
5. There was an attempt to hide what happened. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Yes.  Now in the first report, he 
found that the people involved in these activities included Mr 
Dramat and Mr Sibiya. 
10 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  In the second report, he found it 
was only Mr Maluleka.   
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Now this is really the point of your 
criticisms.  It is, who was involved? 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Now, if you look then at your 
report.  The reasons why you said Mr Dramat was involved is 
contained at page 172.  You can look at your own report. 
20 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  At 172, 173, 174 and 175. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  It is... ja, I am just... it is called 
Exhibit Y8, Nkosinathi Phiwayinkosi Nhleko. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 218 of 255 
 
MR JULY:  Ja. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  So the reasons why you came to 
the conclusions that Mr Dramat was also involved, starts at 
172, 173, 174 and 175, correct? 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  First reason, and this was debated 
with the evidence leader.  The first reason that you give is 
his knowledge of the presence, in other words, the entry into 
the country. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
10 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  And that is what you gave at 
531511 of your report. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  It is the phone call. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  That is the first reason.  So when 
it is put to you that the phone call issue makes no 
appearance in your report that in fact is not accurate? 
MR JULY:  H’m. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  The second reason is the 531512.  
20 
There you refer to the success report. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  So he knows of their presence. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Because that is the phone call but 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 219 of 255 
 
he also knows of the success report. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Both of those two, you then 
summarise at 173. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  And you say that if he knows of the 
presence and he knows of the report, he must take liability. 
MR JULY:  H’m. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  And then, at the following page at 
173, you explain again that he received communication 
10 
during and after the commission of the rendition. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  So it is not only the entry, it is also 
as and when the rendition is occurring which we have now 
established, on their own version, it was an unlawful 
rendition. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  And then the last... not, the last.  
The second last reason, is when he said he congratulated 
the members of Crime Intelligence. 
20 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Yes.  And then the last one is 
the... at 174, where you say he wrote a statement to the 
acting National Commissioner of the Police. 
MR JULY:  H’m. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 220 of 255 
 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  And in that statement, he also 
confirmed his knowledge. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Now, these five elements, they all 
appear on objective documentation, not necessarily on word 
of mouth, these are objective documents presented to you.  
In relation to Mr Sibiya, the difference between you and the 
second report is that you say Mr Sibiya should held liable. 
MR JULY:  Ja. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Now here is where the distinction 
10 
is which sometimes it felt as if it was being overlooked in 
your cross-examination/evidence-in-chief.   
MR JULY:  [No audible reply]  
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  It is put to you that there is no 
evidence that Mr Sibiya was present at the crime scene.   
MR JULY:  [No audible reply]  
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  You accept that there is no such 
evidence or at least even if it exist, you did not take it into 
account.  Your reason ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Mr July, I think you are not but 
20 
there will be no record if you are nodding.  
MR JULY:  [laughs] 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  [laughs]  In fact, Chair.  Mr July 
complains that Mr Sesoko tended to nod. [laughs] 
MR JULY:  [laughs] 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 221 of 255 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughs]  So is he following suit now? 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  [laughs] 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You want to repeat your answer to the 
question. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Now let me repeat the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or repeat the question. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Yes.  Remember that what... there 
was a debate about where exactly does the liability from 
Sibiya come in? 
10 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  One point that was put to you is 
about his presence at the crime scene. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV 
NGUCKAITOBI 
SC: 
 
In 
other 
words, 
when 
the 
kidnapping is happening, right? 
MR JULY:  H’m. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Now your case is, you do not know 
whether he was present or not because the evidence on that 
score is contradictory. 
20 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  But you did not take that into 
account. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  What you did take into account is 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 222 of 255 
 
at 175.  These are the reasons you gave. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  You looked at the reports to 
establish a prima facie case.  And then you said he was head 
of TOMS Unit.  
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  And that... this is where... it 
says... Sibiya stated as follows: 
“The reality of the matter is that the operation in 
question was conducted under the auspices of the 
10 
DPCI national head office and they requested the 
services of my team because of the training and 
capacity...” 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  He himself acknowledges his 
knowledge. 
MR JULY:  Yes, yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  And then he says... this revelation 
by Sibiya confirms his knowledge of the operation that led to 
the rendition of Zimbabwean nationals. 
20 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  He provided Tom’s Personnel to 
assist the DPCI to carry out the rendition. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Now, did you need anything more 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 223 of 255 
 
than his own acknowledgement of his knowledge and the fact 
that he seconded employees? 
MR JULY:  No. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Yes.  Now if we sum-up where we 
are on this evidence is that you are faced with objective 
evidence of the involvement of Mr Dramat.  Objective 
evidence of the involvement of Mr Sibiya.  And that is why 
you have come to the conclusion that they should face the 
wrap. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
10 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  And none of these are actually 
disputed, even in your evidence-in-chief of what has been 
put to you.  Now, in your report, how is this issue then dealt 
with?  I want to move then Mr Chair to the second element of 
my re-examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Which is how the writers of the 
second report deal with these key elements of the liability 
and this again is contained in your report from page 147. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
20 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  So the first thing they do, which is 
on page 147 at the top ...[intervenes]  
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  ...page 34 at the bottom.  The first 
thing they do is tampering with their recorder of the 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 224 of 255 
 
statement of Mr Mahlongwa.   
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Remember that they first recorded 
the statement in full? 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  And the next thing they do, they 
cut out, that clumsy cutting out of passages from that 
statement. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  And that you say at 147 and 148.  
10 
So the portions that are cut out are the portions that 
implicate Mr Sibiya and Mr Dramat. 
MR JULY:  And Dramat.  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Which we have shown on the 
objective evidence, that is how you concluded. 
MR JULY:  H’m. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  And the next is at 149.  If you 
compare on the left and the right ...[intervenes]  
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  ...you will see precisely what has 
20 
been cut out. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  The next is at 150 on the right.  
You see there, when it comes to the issue of the emails, it 
says on the left, which is the original report, it says: 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 225 of 255 
 
“The emails were sent to the PA of Dramat, Phumla, 
Zimbabwe 
Police 
and 
members 
of 
Crime 
Intelligence...” 
MR JULY:  H’m. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  But in the portion that has now 
been cut out, the clumsy cutting out ...[intervenes]  
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  What they say is he sent the email 
to the Zimbabwean Police.  The person that is omitted there 
is the PA of Mr Dramat. 
10 
MR JULY:  The PA, yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  But as an objective fact, that email 
was sent to the PA of Mr Dramat. 
MR JULY:  The PA, yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  And then the same appears in the 
following section where under the underlined portions, you 
say: 
“The letter was generated the same day indicating in 
August 2013.  General Sibiya and General Dramat 
went to Zimbabwe...” 
20 
 
If you compare that with the clumsy cutting out, the 
cutting out.  It says: 
“This letter was generated the same day, indicating 
the 
trip 
to 
Zimbabwe, 
to 
discuss 
matters 
of 
cooperation...” 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 226 of 255 
 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  You see there the cutting out is 
Sibiya and Mr Dramat. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I am so sorry Mr Chair. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Alright.  Sorry.  [laughs] 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Obviously... sorry, I just want to raise, 
not an objection per se but as I understand it, my learned 
friend ought to be re-examine, it should be to seek clarity.  I 
am not sure if he is seeking clarity or merely reading and 
10 
summarising what is contained in the report of Werksmans. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  Okay.  Well ...[intervenes]  
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Thank you.  I will take that up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  No, I will take the statement 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, the report. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  ...into account.  Now the same 
appears at page 151, 152, 153, 154.  It goes on and on until 
the last is at 158.  But the theme is the same, is it not? 
20 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  It is taking out the evidence in the 
statement and then putting the evidence that removes those 
references.  So that is what you have said in your report? 
MR JULY:  Yes, that is exactly right. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 227 of 255 
 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Now ...[intervenes]  
MR JULY:  Chair, can I just add? 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Yes, please. 
MR JULY:  And say, before we were instructed in the main 
instruction in the legal sense not being taint ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja... but, ja. 
MR JULY:  Not being told what to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  That has to be very clear. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were given the brief. 
MR JULY:  Because what happened is that, there were... not 
known to us.  It is something that we picked up now.  
Shuman... 
Hermann(?) 
Suzman(?) 
from 
...[indistinct] 
produced a similar report.   
 
We do not know for what purpose but it is an article 
which was written on the 26t h of February 2015.  We were 
instructed on the 23rd of April.   
 
If you look Chair in that report, it does exactly the same 
thing that we did but at the time we did not know that there 
20 
was such an article. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that report in the bundle or is it 
...[intervenes]  
MR JULY:  It is not in the bundle Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 228 of 255 
 
MR JULY:  It is not in the bundle Chair.  It is something 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Some ...[intervenes]  
MR JULY:  ...that we just in due course got. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR JULY:  And it is a link and it talks exactly about the two 
reports. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If it is something you would like to make 
10 
available to the Commission, you may do so, either now 
through your counsel or later on if you can send it to the 
evidence leader. 
MR JULY:  Yes, we will do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Yes.  Thank you, Mr Chair.  If we 
can further go to my third topic.  We have now seen the 
illegality of the rendition and the cutting out of names in the 
so-called second report. 
MR JULY:  H’m. 
20 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  We then come to the issue.  
Remember there was a discussion that you had with the 
Chair and the evidence leader about whether or not this was 
consequential at all, the fact that the second report removed 
information from the first report.  There was even a 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 229 of 255 
 
suggestion that the report itself is not evidence. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Of course, we need to clarify this a 
little bit.  My understanding is that a report may be evidence 
if it records the observations of the writer from his own 
personal interactions. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  But it may also contain secondary 
evidence, which is sometimes called hearsay. 
MR JULY:  Hearsay. 
10 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  When they recording something 
else that was said to this. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  So it is not as if a piece of paper 
that contains the report is always not evidence. 
MR JULY:  H’m. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Good. 
MR JULY:  I agree. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Now on... in relation to this 
particular report, its significance is in fact... you remember 
20 
that it was put to you that you were told by Mr Baloyi or 
Advocate Baloyi that in general we do not look into these 
IPID reports. 
MR JULY:  H’m. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  But what I want you to explain to 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 230 of 255 
 
the Chair is the specificity of this particular report how it 
happened.  Now I want to show you where it is dealt with.  It 
is in the evidence of Mr Mosing ...[intervenes]  
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  ...who testified before you. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  At... the particular paragraphs are 
at page 982.  They start at 982, 983, 984.  I want to go 
through those paragraphs about what he said in relation to 
this report and why on these facts this was a consequential 
10 
report. 
MR JULY:  Yes.  982... 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  982.  It is marked as Volume 2.  
So I do not know if that makes any difference to you?  But it 
is the transcript of your meeting with Mr Mosing. 
MR JULY:  Mr Mosing.  H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it on the same bundle? 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Yes, it is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  In the same bundle? 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  ...the same bundle Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then if you tell me the right number.  Right 
at the top of that page.  
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Yes, the number at the top is 
Y8NPN0982. 
CHAIRPERSON:  0982? 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 231 of 255 
 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  82.  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, that means it is page 982. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, it will not be in the same bundle that I 
am having.  Pardon me.  Do you think by listening and just 
noting where it is in the bundle, I should be able to find it? 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  And I also hope to do this part 
quite quickly. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  Proceed, ja. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Yes, thank you.  Now the first thing 
that Ms Mosing says because he, in this portion, he asked 
specifically why was this report important and why were the 
alterations consequential.  That was your question. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  But for him, why was this 
important, this report important.  He says: 
“Yes, they recommend...” 
 
Now he is talking about the recommendation of the 
20 
January 2014 report. 
MR JULY:  Yes, yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:   
“...but I am saying our role in the matter... we made it 
clear to them...” 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 232 of 255 
 
 
In other words, they made... Mosing from the NPA side, 
they made it clear to Khuba from IPID side. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:   
“...that this report is not given to me so that I can 
make a decision.  We have submitted it to the 
relevant DPP office who took it and we were merely 
guiding that investigation and assisting them.  As I 
said, 
we 
had 
continuous 
discussions 
with 
the 
investigation team...” 
10 
 
So at no stage did he disagree, really, as to what was 
happening.  So the first thing I want to put to you there for 
your comment is that Mr Khuba knows that this report is 
being prepared for submission to the DPP. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  It is not a report that is being 
prepared in order to be by the way. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  What did the DPP do about it?  
This is... and then he continues.  He says: 
20 
“I think there was a lot of pressure as well as to 
terminate the investigation to move over to arrest.  
We basically had to say make your investigation 
complete first.  Make sure you have got all the 
evidence which, at least, indicates a prima facie case 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 233 of 255 
 
so that a prosecutor can take it forward and at least 
is assured of getting a conviction...” 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Do you want to comment on this? 
MR JULY:  Chair, what is important about that is.  Khuba 
claims that the first report was not the final report.   
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  But he was there in February to 
demand the arrest. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
10 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  On the basis of that report.  So 
that is very critical because you cannot demand arrest on the 
basis of the so-called provision.   
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  And or/or preliminary report or a 
drafted report. 
MR JULY:  Yes, yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Good.  Now if you look at the 
following page, at 984.  [Indistinct] continues given you the 
evidence.  He says: 
20 
“Based on this report which we understood to be the 
final report with the investigation being final.   
As far as we were concerned, the matter was now 
ready to be submitted to a prosecutor to make a 
decision on whether to a prosecutor anyone or not...” 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 234 of 255 
 
 
Billy Moeletsi and myself drafted a memorandum to the 
Deputy National Director of Public Prosecutions, Advocate 
Jiba, attaching... let me just say, get to that report first of 
all. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  And then you ask: 
“You 
prepared 
the 
memorandum 
to 
the 
Deputy 
National Director?  And I think you were looking for 
it...” 
 
And then he continues. 
10 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  So we know two things about what 
Mr Mosing told you.  One is that Mr Khuba was told that we 
need this report so that we can act on it.   
 
Number two.  Mr Khuba also knows that once I submit 
my report, a decision would be made based on it.  As a fact, 
what we know is that the NPA prepared a memorandum 
based on the recommendations and the findings and the 
assessments of the evidence of the report. 
 
So the idea, somehow, that this report can just be 
20 
prepared for fun is not found in relation to what happened 
here and Mr Khuba is put directly ...[indistinct] as knowing 
full well what will happen to his report. 
MR JULY:  Yes, yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Now... 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 235 of 255 
 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  So now that is in relation to Mr 
Khuba.  I want to move on Mr Chair to the fourth topic.  Now 
we have dealt with the rendition and the reasons you came 
to the conclusion that Mr Sibiya and Mr Dramat were 
involved. 
 
And the reason you criticised, it comes the cutting out 
and the fact that, in fact, the first report was regarded, even 
by Mr Khuba in discussion with Mr Mosing as final.  In fact, 
they acted upon it. 
10 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  So we have covered that part.  But 
you then continue to say that Mr McBride, Mr Sesoko and Mr 
Khuba should also take responsibility for that. 
 
Now their responsibility, as I understand it, is not in 
relation to the rendition per se.  But it is in relation to the 
IPID report. 
MR JULY:  The IPID, yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  So first point... we have already 
made that point, is that the IPID report was consequential 
20 
because it was the basis on which a prosecutorial decision 
was taken.  
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  It is not as if the prosecutors 
ignored it.  As a fact, they looked at it and they based their 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 236 of 255 
 
memorandum on it. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  The seventh thing is, Mr Sesoko... 
I remember that there is this whole thing about what exactly 
was Mr Sesoko’s role. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Now I want to take you to evidence 
in relation to Mr Khuba.  What Mr Khuba told you.  You 
remember that question that Mr Khuba... I want to find the 
Khuba testimony about how he put this whole thing to you. 
10 
 
Yes, I have got this.  So it is... it is called here Volume 
3. 
MR JULY:  What is the number there?  What...? 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  It is 2291, the portion I want to 
refer you to. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Now look at the explanation that is 
given to you by Mr Khuba.  And I know that your evidence is 
that his explanation subsequently changes et cetera but let 
us look at what he said at the interview. 
20 
 
So we know that Mosing has told you this is a very 
important report.  In fact, we took a prosecutorial decision 
based on it. 
MR JULY:  Yes, yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  2291, in the middle at 15.  15 is on 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 237 of 255 
 
the right.  It is line 15 and it has got McBride.  He says... 
this is where he summarises.  You have asked him a 
question: 
“If Mr McBride had not arrived, would you have 
changed it?” 
 
He says: 
“If Mr McBride did not join, would it have been 
changed?  My view without even being convinced by 
Sesoko, I would not have changed it...” 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
10 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  This is Khuba telling you that his 
view would not have changed it.  Mr McBride’s presence had 
influenced the change.  And then he continues: 
“Because my understanding is that when we deal with 
such people, they are very senior and to get a little 
thing where you can point fingers at them, is not... 
because it means you will not get anything...” 
 
Now the senior people he is talking about here is Mr 
Dramat and Mr Sibiya.  He said I cannot accuse senior 
people without evidence but here I was so confident that I 
20 
could accuse them. 
 
At page 2292...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:  Mr Chair, sorry.  I think we have 
actually... it has got to the point where I need to now object. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 238 of 255 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:  What simple been put is a series of... not 
only 
of 
what 
the 
information 
actually 
contained, 
the 
document is, but also my learned friend’s interpretation 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, I was going to say Mr 
Nguckaitobi, put questions to the witness to clarify. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair.  Let us go 
back to the last question because that seems to be the one 
that is causing the concern. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Let us reply that question.  So I 
have pointed out to you the portion where Mr Khuba 
answers.  The question is:  “What would have happened if it 
was not for Mr McBride?”  And bearing in mind this answer, 
what is your answer? 
MR JULY:  H’m. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Yes, you can put in your own 
words, not in mine. 
MR JULY:  Chair, you will recall I did say this without even 
20 
looking at the record that I did ask Mr Khuba would he have 
changed the report and he said no he would not have 
changed it.   
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  And was that evidence that he 
gave you at the interview? 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 239 of 255 
 
MR JULY:  Yes, it was the evidence that he gave at the 
interview of the 13 t h of April 2015. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Now, do you remember also that 
there was the question as to how, in fact, the changes were 
made? 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Now this is dealt with at 2294.   
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  At 2294, after line 15, this is where 
he explains how the changes happened.  He says: 
10 
“The relevant ...[indistinct]  
 
He is talking about Mr McBride: 
“Then the progress which I was doing on the report 
itself, I was only adding stuff.  He was sitting next to 
me.  I was adding things.  I was doing thing but 
whether that part was cut out by him or by me, I will 
not say but I do not remember removing it...” 
 
And he says, “deleting it”.  And then he says: 
“No, no, no.  I do not remember thinking to say I am 
deleting this part because I had nothing to benefit by 
20 
it.  In fact, it is something that would have made me 
feel bad to have investigation and to make me have 
sleepless nights, and yet, not all the things are going 
into that.  But the way we worked on that report, I 
emailed it to Mr Sesoko.  I do not know how Mr 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 240 of 255 
 
Sesoko dispatched it to him...” 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  You remember? 
MR JULY:  Yes, Mr Sesoko then confirms that in date, on the 
4t h of March 2014, he received the email from Khuba, he 
made a copy and then he gave it to McBride. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Yes, but in relation to the... where 
in the changes were made... remember, that the answer you 
had given in your evidence earlier was that Mr Khuba himself 
told 
you 
that 
he 
did 
not 
know 
these 
changes 
were 
10 
...[intervenes]  
MR JULY:  No, no, no.  He did.  He said he did not know.  
The only part that he made mention of ...[indistinct] deletion, 
he does not know about that. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Yes, alright.  But... Chair, thank 
you.  I am now into my last topic.  You will be very pleased. 
[laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  I am pleased.  [laughs] 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  [laughs]  Now ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  It has been a long day. 
20 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Thank you.  Thank you, Chair.  
Now, you remember that... I want to come back now to the 
summary of how you concluded that a case had been made 
for defeating the end of justice.  Now we know as a fact what 
the NPA did with your report because we know that from Mr 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 241 of 255 
 
Mosing. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Yes.  Now, my understanding of 
this... what was... what you were criticised about is that in 
your report you did not mention the regulations, the act and 
the Standard Operating Procedures.  Can I ask you to look at 
your own terms of reference?  I mean, because my 
understanding is that you appointed under specific terms of 
reference. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
10 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Which is at page 11... sorry.  I 
think it is 118 if I am not mistaken.  No, one, one... yes, 118 
at the top.   
MR JULY:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  And there are five items. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  And were you asked anything there 
to look at regulations, standard operating procedures? 
MR JULY:  No. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  And did you answer those terms of 
20 
reference? 
MR JULY:  Yes, we did.  In fact, we did look at all these 
issues. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Yes, yes, yes. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 242 of 255 
 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  So the mere fact that they are not 
expressly referenced, does not mean that you did not look at 
it? 
MR JULY:  No, no, no. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  And then in sum, what were the 
reasons why you believed that a prima facie, on the basis of 
what we have looked at the definition under... in Milton and 
...[indistinct] , what were the reasons for the conclusions you 
came to? 
MR JULY:  Yes.  Chair, like it was indicated.  It stands with 
10 
the... what Mr Nguckaitobi referred to as the clumsy deletion 
of the information.   
 
The second one is, it stands with the various reasons, 
excuses that are been given as to why the report was 
changed. 
 
One.  Mr McBride start by saying he does not know 
anything about the report but there is ample evidence to 
demonstrate that he knows about the report. 
 
So his denial of knowledge of the report... he says, “All 
what I did was to do grammatical errors.  I changed 
20 
grammatical mistakes from the report”.   
 
But we know, Khuba does say, when we met with him.  
“If there is any person who read that report extensively is Mr 
McBride.   
 
And we know that that report was made to him.  It is 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 243 of 255 
 
confirmed by Sesoko.  It is confirmed by Khuba that he did 
email.  He did email. 
 
And so there is also another issue.  That you ignore, 
deliberately ignored the regulations.  You ignored the SOP 
which is the Standard Operating Procedure.  Because it is 
very clear Chair, the head of investigations is director 
investigations. 
 
The only people, two people who signed the report... in 
the absence of the director investigations, it would be the 
provincial head.  Khuba signed as the provincial head on the 
10 
report. 
 
But if you look at the witness statements that he took 
and he signed... or he commissioned, he signs as a Director 
Investigations, right. 
 
So there was no role for Sesoko at all.  It is a lie.  And 
they come here.  They tell you that Sesoko was Head of 
Investigation when Sesoko was a Program Manager. 
 
If you go to SOP’s, it sets out what are the functions of 
the executive director.  What are the functions of the 
programme manager.  You will not see any approval of the 
20 
report. 
 
The legislator decided to create independence within the 
IPID.  They are protecting... they were protective of the 
investigation in so... such that, they exclude the executive 
director because they do not want the executive director to 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 244 of 255 
 
influence the decision. 
 
On what basis do you sign an investigative report when 
you do not even conduct the investigation?  It does not make 
sense.  And so ...[intervenes]  
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Ja.  Third last question.  You 
remember that one of the criticisms against the firm, 
Werksmans, is, according to Mr McBride that you cannot as 
a minister ask a private law firm to investigate independent 
organ of state.  What is your comment? 
MR JULY:  You see, Chair.  I forgive Mr McBride.  He is not 
10 
a lawyer.  But I have a problem with when those things have 
been said, led by a lawyer, then they are not challenged. 
 
Because there are two branches of law.  You have got 
the public law.  You have got the private law.  Both laws, the 
branches of law, they have got sub-branches. 
 
Those sub-branches would be, you have got civil and 
criminal.  And employment issues falls under civil.  So when 
the minister comes to me... I am a labour lawyer and that is 
all that I know is labour law. 
 
So when he comes to me and say, “Here is my 
20 
employee...”  You must recall Chair that McBride was an 
employee of IPID and accountable to the minister. 
 
And the constitutional court does actually say that, that 
he is accountable to the minister and accountability should 
not be equated to interference. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 245 of 255 
 
 
When he has to account to the minister, how does the 
minister take a decision to discipline McBride without 
satisfying himself as to what is happening with the two 
reports? 
 
The worse that he could have done was just to take two 
reports and say, “I am dismissing you on the basis of the 
existence of the two reports”.  He would have been 
criticised.   
 
Now he comes to the law firm, which is Werksmans, and 
it happened to be me at Werksmans, who does that and he 
10 
then act on the basis of the advice given to him. 
 
I 
never 
heard 
anything... 
because 
there 
was 
a 
suggestion here which I heard that we were doing criminal 
investigation.  We cannot even if we like to do that. 
 
There is no private law firm that can conduct a criminal 
investigation.  For all that we did is an employer/employee 
relation that we were dealing with. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Second last question.  We have 
debated the issue of the status of the IPID report.  We know 
what Mr Mosing said but Mr Khuba also did not say these 
20 
reports were inconsequential.  
 
In the affidavit which is from page... it starts at page... I 
will refer you to the relevant portion.  It starts at page 1499.  
Sorry, Mr Sesoko, not Mr Khuba.   
 
Mr Sesoko... his affidavit starts at 1499 but at 1520, he 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 246 of 255 
 
deals with the status of the IPID reports.   
MR JULY:  It is 1499? 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Yes, from... yes, that is where it 
starts but the relevant portion is 1520. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  And particularly at 1521.  Now 
here it says that the IPID reports have got two types of 
relevance. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  One is relevant to NPA.  NPA is 
10 
not bound, right?  Nowhere does he say that NPA can 
disregard in the sense that they can simple not read it. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  And we know that in this particular 
instance the NPA wanted it. 
MR JULY:  H’m. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  But I want to take you to the 
second relevance which is at page fourteen point... sorry, 
paragraph 14.6.  He says: 
“From the above, it is clear that the legislator 
20 
intended that the disciplinary recommendations of 
IPID 
to 
SAPS 
are 
enforceable 
and 
cannot 
be 
ignored...” 
MR JULY:  Ja. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Now, what do you say to this?  
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 247 of 255 
 
Because your recommendation, if we look at your terms of 
reference ...[intervenes]  
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  ...was to make disciplinary 
recommendations ...[intervenes]  
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  ...which are employment related, 
as well as, civil or criminal recommendations. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  But on the disciplinary side, what 
10 
do you say to this? 
MR JULY:  Chair, that is exactly what we did. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  We made recommendations and it was up to the 
minister, even from us, to say, “What do I do with these 
recommendations?” 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Yes.  No, Mr July, ...[intervenes]  
MR JULY:  [Indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  ... I am trying to ask you about the 
binding nature of the IPID report to SAPS for disciplinary 
20 
purposes. 
MR JULY:  No, the binding nature, it is binding. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  It is binding.  When they sent a report to SAPS 
and a report which is signed by IPID, they have to act on 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 248 of 255 
 
that.  So if ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:  Mr Chair, if I could be of some assistance 
as well?  I think, if I understand the evidence of Mr Sesoko 
correctly, what he is saying is that that first report never 
went to the minister.   
 
So there was no recommendation insofar as the first 
report is concerned in respect of disciplinary proceedings 
and once can consider them.  
MR JULY:  H’m. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Thank you.  That is appreciated.  
10 
Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think the question is about the binding 
nature.  Whether it is binding or not, hey?   
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Yes, precisely.  Thank you, Chair.  
You have got the point exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  H’m. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  I want to move on Mr July.  There 
is no need to respond to the evidence leader.  But if it is 
binding 
and 
there 
has 
been 
tampering 
and 
deletion 
...[intervenes]  
20 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  ...in the sense that you have 
recommended or the report has made findings against Mr 
Sibiya 
and 
has 
made 
findings 
against 
Mr 
Dramat 
...[intervenes]  
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 249 of 255 
 
MR JULY:  Findings against... 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  ...what are the consequences? 
MR JULY:  The consequence, if you...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:  Mr Chair, if I might?  And I really do hate 
to interject.  The point is that... which is what my fear was in 
the first place.  The point is that the first report was never 
sent to the minister.   
 
It was sent to the Deputy National Director of Public, or 
rather, to the NPA and it did not have a disciplinary 
recommendation.  That is the only point I wish to make.  That 
10 
is the point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  It is a wholly irrelevant point. 
MR JULY:  H’m. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  And please answer Mr July.  What 
are the consequences of removing information which makes 
findings against a particular employee? 
MR JULY:  It is a misconduct. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Ja. 
MR JULY:  And it is a misconduct for which a person must be 
20 
disciplined for.  There must be consequences. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Final question.  In the same 
affidavit of Mr Sesoko, he summarises why he believes that 
Werksmans is involved in state capture at page 1536 at... 
and it goes on to 1539. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 250 of 255 
 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  It starts with paragraph 17.1.  
There he talks about what Minister Nhleko wanted to 
achieve. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Correct? 
MR JULY:  [No audible reply]  
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Did you have any meeting 
whatsoever with Mr Nhleko to discuss anything of the sort? 
MR JULY:  I have never met Mr Nhleko.  Never met.  Never 
10 
spoken to him.  I do not know.  I know of him.  We have 
never met with Mr Nhleko. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you just get a letter or did you get a 
call from his staff to appoint you? 
MR JULY:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or did you get the ...[intervenes]  
MR JULY:  I got the instruction that was in an envelope. 
CHAIRPERSON:  An envelope? 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
MR JULY:  But I have never had a talk to mister 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  You have not even spoken to him? 
MR JULY:  Never spoken to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 251 of 255 
 
MR JULY:  But I must indicate Chair.  Even if I spoke to 
Nhleko... because when you get instructions from client, you 
must speak to client.  There is nothing wrong in speaking to 
client. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no.  There is nothing wrong about 
speaking ...[intervenes]  
MR JULY:  But what I am not going to do is to change to 
facts to suit the outcome of there.  What you must do when 
you criticise my report, you must look at the facts, not on the 
motive of Nhleko.  Assuming he had his own motive. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR JULY:  I was dealing with the facts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
MR JULY:  So it is neither here nor there, whether I have 
met with him but I can categorically say I have never met 
him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR JULY:  There was no reason in this case to even met 
with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, you ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR JULY:  They have provided us ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  A clear brief. 
MR JULY:  ...with a whole report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR JULY:  The docket, the two reports.  It was up to us to 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 252 of 255 
 
deal with that thing.  If there was a need for anything that we 
wanted from Nhleko, we would have consulted with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Yes, yes.  Now the criticism there 
is, Mr Nhleko had certain ulterior goals that he wanted to 
achieve.  You have explained what your answer is.  Now the 
time where your name features is at 1539, paragraph 17.7.  
Now this is the bullet thing why Werksmans is being accused 
of being involved in state capture. 
MR JULY:  One, five...? 
10 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  1539.  That is paragraph 17.7.  
You are looking for the basis for why they say that 
Werksmans has done something wrong? 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  This is what they say: 
“The Werksmans report authored by July was used as 
a catalyse to achieve Minister Nhleko’s goal of 
getting 
rid 
of 
us 
and 
replacing 
us 
with 
more 
complying individuals.  This is the ultimate end-point 
of state capture against Werksmans...” 
20 
 
What is your comment? 
MR JULY:  [laughs[ But Chair, if Nhleko use my report or 
Werksmans report for his... I have been saying this thing 
throughout the day.  For his ulterior motive that has nothing 
...[intervenes]  
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 253 of 255 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have nothing to do with those motives. 
MR JULY:  ...to do with us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, you did what you were asked to do and 
you ...[intervenes]  
MR JULY:  Yes.  And again... not that I am not... I am not 
Nhleko’s 
spokesperson 
but 
again 
if 
Nhleko 
looks 
for 
information to get rid of people and he finds it, what must he 
do with it? 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m? 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Now Mr July, my only concern is, 
10 
factually, whether or not you had anything to do with the 
usage of your report subsequent to its production. 
MR JULY:  No, all that we did.  We have prepared the report 
for the purposes of the minister.  What he does with it, it is 
his ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, that was none of your business. 
MR JULY:  We were never involved after the submission of 
the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  Chair, I want to thank you for the 
20 
patience.  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughs].  No, thank you Mr Nguckaitobi.  
You took a reasonable amount of time. 
ADV NGUCKAITOBI SC:  [laughs]  Thank you, Chair.  That 
will be the end of my re-examination. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 254 of 255 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.  I have got only one 
question arising out of this Mr July. 
MR JULY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought that during your evidence earlier, 
I 
thought 
had 
understood 
you 
to 
say 
to 
accept 
the 
proposition that the NPA is not bound by the IPID report such 
as this one but when your counsel asked you a question on 
the binding nature of such a report, I understood you to say 
it is binding.  Did I understand your correctly? 
MR JULY:  The IPID.  I am not sure if the question was in 
10 
relation to the IPID or the SAPS 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, well ...[intervenes]  
MR JULY:  It was binding ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, you can clarify.  I thought he was 
talking about ...[intervenes]  
MR JULY:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...about an IPID report be binding. 
MR JULY:  It is a SAPS.  It is a SAPS. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JULY:  The binding effect is in relation to the 
20 
misconduct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, in relation to the misconduct. 
MR JULY:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not in relation to the criminal part. 
MR JULY:  Not the criminal part, no. 
31 JULY 2020 – DAY 242 
 
Page 255 of 255 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Okay thank you.  Thank you 
very much Mr July for coming to give evidence.  And thank 
you very much to your counsel and everybody.  We have 
come to the end.  It is quarter past five but I think we are 
done. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  On Monday, the Commission 
will hear evidence relating to PRASA and Judge Makhubele 
will be giving evidence with regard to the time she was 
chairperson of board of PRASA.  
10 
 
And then for the rest of the week, I will be hearing 
evidence relating to... or the Free State, Tuesday up to 
Friday.   
 
So I make this announcement for the public and the 
media 
about 
what 
is 
happening 
next 
week 
in 
the 
Commission.  We adjourn. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 3 AUGUST 2020
