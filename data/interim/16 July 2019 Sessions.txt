PROCEEDINGS ON 16 JULY 2019 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning Mr Zuma. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Good morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning everybody. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we ready? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes we are. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Just… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I need to report back Chair in 
relation to documents.  I understand that there is no substantial issue 
10 
in relation to documents any longer.  It is acknowledged that all but two 
documents were received last year.  The two documents in question are 
the statement of Mr Mbalula.  No 3.3 was issued in relation to that 
document and therefore it was not sent last year but was sent this year.  
I will delay questioning on that until the end in order to accommodate 
my learned friends and Mr Zuma in relation to possible preparation. 
 
The second document is the second statement of Mr Agrizzi 
which was also not sent by way of a 3.3 Notice because of the 
consideration that it failed to implicate the President certainly directly 
and I do not intend to ask any questions about that statement as at 
20 
present advised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  I think Mr Zuma wishes to say something. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Thank you, thank you.  
Chairperson I just thought I should put on record something. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 3 of 107 
 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  For us to know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yesterday night between seven 
and eight my PA that from the ANC side was phoned by a person she 
does not know and this person said you must tell Zuma that we are 
going to kill him.  We will also kill his children as well as some people 
around him.  So she informed me this morning and I am sure Chair you 
will recall that I said a lot about how my life has been attempted.  But 
also my senior counsel Advocates Sikhakhane this follows threats that 
had been made to him, very serious ones as will and the – in the short 
10 
while about a week or so ago we received that.  I am putting this on 
record because later at some point after the questions I would like to 
come back to this issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Because I have lost a child and 
I now know what happened.  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  So the threat I can say it has 
been implemented already. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  But I would like to come back to 
that.  I just thought for record this commission must know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  That my life and my children, 
my lawyers are now under threat. 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 4 of 107 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Before I say anything I wonder whether 
Mr Sikhakhane wants to say anything, nothing.  Okay, okay alright.  
Ordinarily in response to what you have just told me Mr Zuma with 
regard to other witnesses I would urge the commission to take 
necessary steps to ensure that a witness who is giving evidence before 
the commission gets all the protection that they can give.   
What I do not know is whether by virtue of your position you do 
not already have maximum protection.  So I do not know whether there 
10 
is anything beyond what you – the protection you get that the 
commission can add.  I think maybe your legal team could be in touch 
with the commission’s legal team because if there is anything that the 
commission can do it should be done.   
I was simply saying it may well be that the protection that you 
have is far greater than whatever protection the commission could hope 
to provide.  But having said that I just want to say this that it is totally 
unacceptable for anybody in our society to want to use violence, 
intimidation and all kinds of illegal means when they are unhappy about 
anybody because our legal system is such that people can go to courts, 
20 
can go to the police if they have complaints against other people.  It is 
totally unacceptable that any threats should be made to anybody and 
more so when those threats are made to or concerning a person who is 
giving evidence before this commission.  
I said similar things some time ago when certain threats were 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 5 of 107 
 
made against a certain witness who gave evidence here.  I say the 
same thing today.  It is unacceptable.   
People who come to the commission to give evidence and help 
the commission to understand matters that it is investigating should not 
be threatened, should not be intimidated.  Their families should not be 
threatened or intimidated or harmed in any way and all good people in 
this country must take a stand against the use of violence and 
intimidation.   
I am happy that whatever threats have been made have not 
made Mr Zuma to change his mind about giving evidence.  He is still 
10 
going to continue and give evidence before this commission but it will 
be important that all steps be taken by relevant authorities to make 
sure that the threats he has reported are properly investigated and that 
they are not carried out.   
I also want to address the threat against his counsel.  One of 
the traditions of the bar is that Advocates represent anyone and 
everyone who needs legal representation and when lawyers represent 
their clients they are just doing their job.  And they should not in any 
way be threatened or intimidated or be discouraged from representing 
whoever they choose to represent.  Everybody deserves to be 
20 
represented by a lawyer when they are in proceedings, in legal 
proceedings and it is important that as far as possible everyone should 
get the lawyer of their choice. 
So any threats that have been made against Mr Zuma’s 
counsel or any lawyer is totally unacceptable because in this 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 6 of 107 
 
commission I want every lawyer to feel free to come and represent their 
clients. 
I would ask that whatever assistance the legal team of the 
commission can provide if Mr Zuma’s counsel needs any arrangements 
to be made for his protection that everything be done to assist in that 
regard. 
I do not want a situation where a lawyer is supposed to come 
and represent somebody in this commission is no longer able to come 
and represent them because of threats. 
So I thought I would just make those remarks and I hope 
10 
everything will be taken care of. 
But before we proceed I had meant to just make one remark 
and that is that I thought that the proceedings yesterday were 
characterised by respect, courtesy and cooperation from all sides.  
From the commission’s legal team, the former President’s legal team, 
the former President as well as everybody who was attending and I 
thought I must just acknowledge that.  Indeed even with regard to those 
who were outside the venue I did not get any reports of incidents.  The 
reports I got seemed to suggest that there was a high level of discipline 
and I hope that today and in the days to come this week everything can 
20 
proceed in that way. 
Thank you.  Mr Zuma I thought I must also say should a need 
arise as it happened yesterday to wash hands please feel free to 
indicate. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Thank you. 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 7 of 107 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Otherwise the next break will be quarter past eleven 
for tea.  Yes Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In relation to what has been said 
this morning may we just add that the secretariat has an investigative 
capacity.  The issues raised by former President Zuma are a matter of 
regret firstly and concern secondly and we will ensure that as 
previously where it has happened before in this commission the matter 
is fully investigated and insofar as we can assist in any way whatsoever 
10 
at least with advice around our experience in the commission in regard 
to protection or protection itself both in relation to Mr Sikhakhane and 
former President Zuma it will be done and we will report back to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Mr Zuma we will with your leave 
still be dealing this morning for a while at least with the evidence of Mr 
Maseko and your response or version in respect of the issues that he 
raises and we were on page 7 of the bundle FPJGZ7. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are still using Exhibit GG[a]? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Bundle A. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Exhibit.. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  GG[a]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Exhibit GG[a]. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Exhibit GG[a]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did we enter these exhibits into the record yesterday? 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 8 of 107 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I am sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did we enter these exhibits into the record yesterday? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes we did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But there is no harm in repeating 
for the sake of efficiency particularly in relation to documentation Chair 
that we dealing with two bundles. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the extent that we might not have done so.  The 
lever arch file which contains Mr Zuma’s statement is to be marked 
Exhibit GG[a] and the other lever arch file which has got certain 
10 
annexures in addition to the annexures that are in Exhibit GG[a] will be 
marked Exhibit GG[b].  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes they do not just a minor 
point contain any statement of the former President but they do contain 
statements relevant to the questioning this week. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No actually I think what I said was wrong.  Because it 
does not contain his statement. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am going to correct what I said in regard to the lever 
arch file that will marked Exhibit GG[a].  It does not contain any 
20 
statement by Mr Zuma but it contains statements of certain witnesses 
and the first statement on the top is that of Mr Themba Mveli James 
Maseko and the other lever arch file Exhibit GG[b] contains other 
statements including that of Ms Barbara Hogan.  That one of Ms 
Barbara Hogan is one on top on the other lever arch file.  Thank you. 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 9 of 107 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That by way of introduction Mr 
Zuma may we go to page 7 and paragraph 32.  The next… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Pretorius before we do that.  Mr Zuma I 
just want to clarify something that your counsel mentioned yesterday.  
In terms of your ability to read the words in the documents I think he 
was expressing a concern that they may be too small. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you able to read it is fine? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  It is very difficult.  It is too 
small. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  They are small. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  I tried to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Strain my eyes but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  They are small. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Very small. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe – maybe you might as far as you can Mr 
Pretorius read to him what needs to – what is necessary for your 
question and if that is not enough for him to get the context we can 
take it from there. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In the meanwhile I will try and 
arrange from the secretariat for large copies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Bigger – ja okay, alright, thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  By way of background to the 
next section of the evidence of Mr Maseko Mr Zuma.  Mr Maseko 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 10 of 107 
 
testified that around the end of November 2010 he was driving to the 
North West on a personal journey and he received a phone call from an 
unknown person who said he worked for the Gupta Media Company and 
that gentleman requested a meeting with Maseko the following Monday 
in order to discuss government advertising and the soon to be launched 
New Age Newspaper.  By way of introduction it seems that what follows 
was a second attempt to persuade Mr Maseko to divert or cause 
business to be given to the New Age Newspaper by way of government 
advertising.  But that by way of background – was any report against 
the background that the Gupta’s would have known that you had an 
10 
interest in this project.  In fact it was initiated by yourself as I 
understand from what you said yesterday.  The financing of the project 
clearly would have been a concern to the Gupta’s.  Did they report to 
you any concerns about their inability to persuade Mr Maseko to assist 
them? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No he never. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right. Then if we look further 
down on page 7 in short what happened was that Mr Maseko put the 
caller off.  He said look we will discuss it on Monday.  But then an hour 
later and I am at paragraph 35 on page 7 the phone rang again that is 
20 
Mr Maseko’s phone this time it was Mr Ajay Gupta.  He sounded very 
agitated and he started the conversation with an aggressive tone. He 
said and I am now over the page on page 8.  He said his people told 
him that I was being difficult.  I told him what happened in the 
conversation with his staff member.  Paragraph 37 reads: 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 11 of 107 
 
“He that is Mr Ajay Gupta then responded by saying 
something to the effect that he will not tolerate any 
nonsense and that I did not understand what was 
going on.  He said the meeting must happen on 
Monday morning.” 
It seems that from what Mr Maseko said the response was equally 
forceful.  Mr Maseko says in paragraph 38. 
“I was extremely offended by what was going on and 
the manner in which he spoke to me.  It hold him that 
he had no right to give me instructions as he was not 
10 
my employer.  His response was that the meeting 
must no longer take place on the Monday morning as 
they had initially demanded but should happen the 
following morning which was a Saturday.  I told him 
how ridiculous his demand was and that I was out of 
town for the weekend.  He insisted that the meeting 
will take place on the Saturday morning.” 
The evidence of Mr Maseko continues then in paragraph 39.  Mr 
Maseko says: 
“I told him in no uncertain tems that I will not be 
20 
spoken to in that manner nor dictated as he was 
attempting to do.  In the process and reflective of my 
annoyance at an attempt to improperly bully me as a 
government official I also used an expletive.” 
And then Mr Maseko reports a further statement by Mr Gupta to him. 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 12 of 107 
 
“At this point he told me that I was being 
uncooperative and that he was going to speak to my 
seniors in government who would sort me out and 
replace me with people who would cooperate with 
him.  I cannot recall whether he or I dropped the call.  
The call ended abruptly.” 
He says in paragraph 42. 
“On my return to Johanneburg the following week, I 
briefed Minister Chabane about the developments.” 
At that stage let us remind the Chair who was Mr – Minister Chabane? 
10 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Sorry? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Who was Minister Chabane at 
that stage, what post did he hold? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  He was a Minister. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In you… 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  In the Presidency. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In the Presidency 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And Mr Maseko says he reported 
it to him.  Now Minister Chabane would have known surely that you 
20 
were in favour of the progress of the New Age project, would he? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No I had not discussed that with 
the Ministers.  As I say the – I discussed this with the Secretary 
General and Deputy.  It was not a matter of government. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 13 of 107 
 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  He might have known he might 
not have known I do not know.  I had never – I had not discussed with 
Chabane. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So as I understand your 
evidence then Mr Zuma you say that you saw a need for fair and 
objective and comprehensive publicity and newspaper reporting and as 
part of that you discussed with the Gupta’s at least the New Age project 
for now the ANN7 project came later and that you did not discuss that 
with the Minister in the Presidency? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No I had not discussed that. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Would it not be something that 
you would discuss and – ordinarily? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Sorry? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Would it not be something that 
one would have expected such a thing to be discussed with the Minister 
and the Presidency if it was a matter that concerned you as President? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No this was not government 
thing.  This was done by business people out there. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Was it a private arrangement not 
government? 
20 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No, no I never said government 
was involved here. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  I think I made the point very 
clear I informed the Secretary General and Deputy Secretary General 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 14 of 107 
 
because they are ANC.  This had nothing to do with the government 
insofar as that discussions were concerned. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright so if I may understand 
then your interactions with the Gupta family certainly insofar as the 
New Age Newspaper and its establishment were concerned was done in 
a capacity other than a government capacity not as President? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  I cannot – I am not sure 
whether I hear… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well not as head of the 
executive you say it had nothing to do with government? 
10 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No why I am saying so because 
you are asking a question as if I should have discussed it. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  With the Minister. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No so I am saying the Minister 
would – that did not feature in my activities as I say. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Because this was not a 
government project. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes that is how I understand it. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So how would you categorise the 
project then?  Private, party political? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No this – this was a private. 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 15 of 107 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  A private? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Project. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  By a business – by business 
people. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I think what he may be seeking Mr Zuma is to 
establish whether from your side when you were speaking to the 
Gupta’s about this project you were speaking to them just as a private 
citizen or as President of the ANC because I think it is clear from what 
10 
you have said you were not speaking as President of the country? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  You mean when I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you spoke to the Gupta’s. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About the New Age Project. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Oh yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I think what Mr Pretorius is trying to establish is 
whether from your side you were speaking to the Gupta’s about this 
project in your personal capacity. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes, yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or in your capacity as President of the ANC because 
you have made it clear it was not in your capacity as President of the 
country.  Is that correct? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  I discussed with them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 16 of 107 
 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  From a personal capacity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From a personal capacity. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  We may come back to that issue 
in relation to another matter arising in the statement of Mr Maseko but 
for the moment what is apparent from the statement of Mr Maseko just 
read to you is that the Gupta’s were to put it mildly quite forceful in 
their request or demand to Mr Maseko.  That so much is apparent.  Do 
you agree? 
10 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Well if you read what is here. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  I think that is what it shows. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
And 
it 
seems 
too 
that 
Mr Ajay Gupta 
at 
least 
was 
very 
confident 
of 
support 
within 
Government.  What he says is – and this is what Mr Maseko’s version 
is: 
“At this point he Mr Ajay Gupta told me I was being 
uncooperative and that he was going to speak to my 
seniors in Government who would sort me out.  He 
20 
appeared to be confident that he had the support of 
his seniors in Government who would “sort me out” 
and replace me with people who would cooperate 
with him.” 
That much is also apparent from what Mr Maseko said.  Now 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 17 of 107 
 
would - as far as you are aware insofar as the project is concerned do 
you know whether Mr Gupta was justified in saying that he had 
Government support? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  I am – I am not sure.  Whether I 
should really interpret peoples mood and how they – they address one 
another because it is here from the – from Mr Maseko who discusses 
with Gupta. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No how do I interpret them?  I 
think the trend has been that we actually saying I should be saying 
10 
something on interactions that I was not part of. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC: No I understand that and you – 
you make a good point. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  My question though had a 
different object and let me … 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Rephrase it.  The factual 
question that I ask is did Mr Gupta enjoy - as he appears to have said 
he did - Government support in the New Age Project. 
20 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  I do not know really. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You do not know? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Because I – I have never 
participated in a discussion that discussed that much with Government 
people. 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 18 of 107 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe one could – could put it this way. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From what has been – from what Mr Maseko has said 
in his statement if what he says is true it appears that Mr Ajay Gupta 
believed that if Mr Maseko did not cooperate he could get Mr – 
Mr Maseko’s seniors to “sort him out” to use that word.  Maybe let us 
look at – let us start with who Mr Maseko’s seniors would have been in 
– in Government.  Would it – would it have been the Minister in the 
Presidency?  Is – is – would I be correct? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Ja, definitely. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  It would be correct? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  That would be correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And above the Minister it would be the President? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Is there anything you know which would have 
made Mr Ajay Gupta if what Mr Maseko is saying is true which would 
have made him believe that if Mr Maseko did not do what he wanted 
him to do he could talk to Mr Maseko’s seniors to “sort him out”?  Is 
there anything you know on the basis of which Mr Ajay Gupta could 
really say that? 
20 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No I do not know. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  He goes on Mr Zuma on 
page 9 paragraph 43 to say: 
“This matter was of great concern to me especially 
when I started receiving complaints from Heads of 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 19 of 107 
 
Communication from other departments complaining 
that they were being harassed by people from the 
New Age Newspaper who were demanding either 
meetings or advertising budgets.” 
Do you know anything about complaints of Head of 
Communication from other departments complaining of harassment at 
the hands of the New Age Newspaper? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No I did not.  Did not get that. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right but again it is evident that 
the New Age Project under the Guptas if Mr Maseko’s evidence is 
10 
accepted was being vigorously pursued. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Did they ever report back to you 
on this?  Did you have meetings with the Guptas about the progress of 
the New Age Project? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Well from time to time they 
briefed me. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right and would they have … 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Briefed you about how the 
20 
financing of the project was to be achieved?  It would seem  
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  A maybe reasonable assumption 
to make. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No. 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 20 of 107 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What – what did they brief you 
on? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  They were just briefing me on 
the progress they were making. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Oh and what type of progress 
would that have been then? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Establishing that business – the 
newspaper as it were.

ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But you say not the financing? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No not the financing. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  The next section of the 
evidence that we would like your comment on Mr Zuma is under the 
heading: 
“My Exit from the Public Service”. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Maybe 
before 
that 
if 
what 
Mr Maseko 
says 
Mr Ajay Gupta said to him … 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Namely I will speak to your seniors to “sort you out” 
20 
and bearing in mind that you have indicated that Mr Maseko’s seniors 
would have been the Minister in the Presidency and above the Minister 
it would be the President? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If what Mr Maseko says Mr Ajay said is true would 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 21 of 107 
 
you agree that then Mr Ajay Gupta would have been abusing whatever 
relationship or friendship he may have had with Mr Maseko’s seniors in 
order to try and get Government work? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Well I would not be able to 
answer the question correctly because I really do not know what made 
Mr Gupta – Mr Ajay to say that.  The senior that on operational matters 
the immediate senior and who deals with all of these things would be 
the Minister not the President.  It would be the Minister.  That is why 
Maseko would go to the Minister and report the kind of treatment that 
he has got from an individual and it ends there. 
10 
I am just making a point that you cannot have the President 
participating in those kinds of discussions in all departments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But are you not able to say we do not know 
Mr Ajay Gupta’s version.  It might be different from Mr Maseko’s version 
… 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that is why I say if what Mr Maseko is true. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you not able to say if what Mr Maseko says was 
said by Mr Ajay Gupta is true that would have been improper? 
20 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you able to say that? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No I am able to say so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Absolutely. 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 22 of 107 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You did say Mr Zuma that these 
sorts of matters would not be discussed with a President but you have 
also said the matters were indeed discussed privately? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Some matters were discussed 
privately? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So – so … 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  I said so. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The Guptas might have felt free 
to discuss these issues with you in your private capacity as you have 
already said? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  If they discuss anything with – 
we did not discuss the operational things. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Paragraph 47 if I may read it to 
Mr Zuma says: 
“Towards the end of January 2011, I received a call 
from the Minister Chabane asking me to meet him at 
his office urgently.  I met him at his office the 
20 
following morning.  At the meeting, he advised me 
that he had been instructed by the President to 
redeploy me or terminate my contract henceforth.” 
If I may ask we know that at around this time Mr Maseko did 
actually leave certainly the post that he held at the time as CEO of 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 23 of 107 
 
GCIS.  We know that as a fact.  Is that agreed? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes.  I think he left around that 
time. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC: And I do not want to go into the 
detail of the law with you but as I understand it if Mr Maseko was 
transferred as he was to another department the law says that would be 
your decision.  Do I understand correctly? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  It would – yes.  It would be the 
decision taken in the main between - what – what would have 
happened.  The Minister would have briefed the President because the 
10 
DGs are actually deployed by the Cabinet – by the Cabinet.  That type 
of report will therefore be given to or reflected in the Government but 
Ministers would have discussed that with the President. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  They come because of whatever 
to say Mr President this is what I am doing and if the President thinks 
that this is unfair whatever will say but why.  They will have to explain.  
If the explanation – at times the explanation might not even be 
satisfying but if the Minister says look I just cannot work with this DG. 
It happens all the time.  You cannot force the Minister.  So I 
20 
will say okay proceed and then follow the process. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So in the ordinary course as 
required by law you would have participated in any decision regarding a 
DG in the Department of the Presidency? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  In the? 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 24 of 107 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In the Presidency. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Just repeat.  I do not know 
whether I am getting you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat the question I think. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  We dealt with this matter 
yesterday but it is well to clarify Mr Zuma.  As the Head of GCIS 
Mr Maseko worked in the Department of the Presidency. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Correct? 
10 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Which fell under yourself at the 
time? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And the Minister then was 
Minister Chabane? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So in any decision about the 
termination of service of Mr Maseko or relation to his transfer you 
would have been consulted? 
20 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Definitely. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Not just by the Minister in the 
Presidency only - all Ministers. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right, okay. 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 25 of 107 
 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  All Ministers. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  Well Mr Maseko’s 
evidence is that Mr Chabane told him that he had been instructed by 
the President to redeploy me or terminate my contract henceforth.  
What do you say about that statement?  If you can help us. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No.  I never – I never instructed 
the Minister to do so. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Did you discuss the issue with 
the Minister? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No the Minister discussed the 
10 
fact that he would like to transfer Mr Maseko. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Did he say why? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Well I think there was an issue 
between the two of them.  I cannot remember the details.  I cannot 
remember the details.  Like all Ministers he would come for us to be 
able to either agree so that an action is taken not to discuss - and if at 
all there were issues which were necessary to be said because it is a 
big decision he will indicate that.  That is because of this and that 
because … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, huh-uh.  Just finish before I say something. 
20 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Ja, because either we – we can 
no longer work together or because we do not agree or because I think 
I do not need him anymore whatever.  The discussion would – because 
he cannot take a decision to change the DG without – because that is 
not his decision. 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 26 of 107 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I think we – the – the time that we are talking 
about when Mr Maseko was moved from the position of CEO of GCIS … 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he was moved to be Director General of the 
Department of Public Service and Administration … 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was around 2011 end of January or thereabout. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you got a recollection of how that happened?  
Have you got - have you got the picture of how that happened? 
10 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  That specific …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  That specific incident of his whether one can call it 
removal from … 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  GCIS to Public Service and Administration or a 
transfer from GCIS to Public Service Administration – Public Service 
and Administration.  Do you – do you recall how that occurred?  
Obviously having read Mr Maseko’s statement and understanding what 
his version is. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Well I do not remember exactly 
20 
but I know that there was a bit of shifting of the DGs around that time 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA: 
 
And 
the 
department 
that 
handles that is Public Administration. 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 27 of 107 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Who will then discuss with the 
Ministers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  On whatever reasons … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  And then once that happens and 
that would then be reported. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Once it becomes a decision to 
10 
the Cabinet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  I might not remember the 
details why this happened but I know there was a movement … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  That was done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  But I cannot remember the 
exactly what was the course.  At times the changes come because other 
– a DG could perform badly in one place and therefore he must go help 
20 
there and another one is replaced but I cannot remember exactly what - 
on this particular DG - what was the problem but that matter would 
have been discussed more in some details at a level of the Minister and 
the Minister of Public – Public Administration. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Public Service and Administration. 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 28 of 107 
 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Once they have agreed they will 
then come with a recommendation.  They generally come with a 
recommendation unless if there is a problem.  For example if they 
cannot work together or if they think this particular DG would perform 
better there and once they report and say we have discussed the 
matter.  We have agreed … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  And then the Cabinet will – we 
take a decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  When you read Mr Maseko’s statement did you 
10 
see what he says happened with regard to that – with regard to his 
removal?  He says he was told by Minister Chabane … 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you had called from outside of the country 
because you were outside of the country at the time. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He says he was told by Minister Chabane that you 
had called and you had said that he must be redeployed.  That is 
Mr Maseko or his services must be terminated and he says Mr Chabane 
was not happy with this but he had to carry it out and he said to him 
20 
because I know you are a good – I think civil servant he said – I will try 
and make a plan for you and Mr Maseko says he – he did not want – 
Mr Chabane did not want to so to speak throw him into the street. 
So I think what Mr Pretorius is asking is that context – I am 
just providing a fuller context. 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 29 of 107 
 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is whether you have any recollection of you having 
asked Mr Chabane to redeploy him.  In other words according to 
Mr Maseko from what he was told by Mr Chabane the idea that he 
should be moved from GCIS came from the President and not from 
Minister Chabane.  Are you able to throw any light? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No.  I – I think I have a 
difficulty with that.  If – let - let us assume I wanted Maseko out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  I will wait until I leave the 
10 
country and when I am very far away then call.  It is quite funny.  I am 
not running a department.  Why would I have not talked to 
Minister Chabane when I was here?  Why should I wait until I go?  It is 
a little fishy.  Now I do not want to make a point but I can make a point 
because this Commission has experience with this. 
At time people use the names of the President.  I am sure 
you had a witness here … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes last week. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Which said – he was lying.  He 
had never – he had never had any instructions from the President.  I 
20 
am sure that could happen with the Ministers as well if the Minister is 
finding it difficult to say to the DG I am now saying go and use the 
name of the President because I do not see why I should leave the 
country. 
Only when I am abroad then I must attend to this issue.  It 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 30 of 107 
 
definitely – it is very strange and funny and I – I never phoned 
Chabane about the – this DG when I was abroad.  Not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair there is a request to 
address you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you.  Mr (intervenes). 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  No, I am Mr Thabani (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I am sorry. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  However – however … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I am sorry. 
10 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  Yes.  Chair – Chair, we together with just the 
legal team we have a duty to raise concerns … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  When we see a development … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  In the manner in which our client is being 
cross-examined.  Essentially what is going on now … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  Is that Mr Pretorius is cross-examining 
Mr Zuma. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  He is cross-examining about issues we are 
not clear about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  Insofar as the terms of reference are 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 31 of 107 
 
concerned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  We – as you – as you recall Mr Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  The – Mr Zuma has read this affidavit.  We 
have read it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  We took the view that it does not implicate 
the President in any of the terms of reference that this Commission is 
about.  That is the attitude we took. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  Now of course in your – in your discretion 
you decided the President should come … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  And – and take – and give his version of – of 
events. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  What is going on now … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  Is not Mr Pretorius assisting Mr Zuma to give 
20 
his version. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  What he is doing he is cross-examining him 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 32 of 107 
 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  But which is not a problem if Mr Zuma’s 
attitude had been that there are aspects in the statement of Mr Maseko 
that implicates him fraud, corruption and this State Capture. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  We – we are not able to follow … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  How to fit this cross-examination in which he 
seeks Mr Zuma to recall meetings where he was not present.  In which 
he seeks Mr Zuma to – to interpret what those meetings meant or even 
to give a view of whether those meetings were appropriate or not.  It is 
10 
not fair if this – if the legal team of the Commission wishes to 
cross-examine Mr Zuma it is important that the – Mr Zuma is in fact 
given an opportunity to then reflect with a view that he is going to be 
cross-examined, to reflect on all these things because you said the 
rules of the Commission say you look at an affidavit that implicates you 
or that mentions your name. 
You make a judgment call on whether or not that the 
allegations made in that affidavit are of a nature that fit within the 
investigative powers of the – of the Commission fraud, corruption and 
State Capture.  Now he is being asked to recall phone calls and 
20 
meetings where he was not present and to interpret what those 
meetings would mean. 
We think it is unfair because what essentially it means is this 
if he cannot say for example that he thinks that the meeting between 
Mr Gupta – Ajay Gupta and Mr Maseko was inappropriate.  Then you 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 33 of 107 
 
must read something into it.  It is not right.  If the – if the Commission 
rules for example that this line of questioning is the correct line of 
questioning that must be adopted. 
It is no longer a – a – it is cross-examination.  You are trying 
to prove that Mr Zuma’s private conversation had a – had – were 
somehow relevant to his – the public – to his public interaction or his 
interaction with the Guptas in – in public.  Give him an opportunity to 
then look at this with a view that he is going to be cross-examined and 
then he can prepare adequately for cross-examination. 
Not what – not this – this would say in our – in our view – in 
10 
our assessment as lawyers it is cross-examination for which a witness 
ought to have been given a fair opportunity be told that if you are not 
going to – if you are not going to for example respond to Mr Maseko 
you may then - let us be called and be cross-examined or not 
Mr Maseko’s case. 
He is being cross-examined on what Mr Maseko said.  How 
can the President be expected to remember meetings where he was not 
there, phone calls that occurred years ago.  I do not recall phone calls 
that happened last week. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV THABANI MASUKU: 
 
Now 
- 
now 
Mr Zuma 
must 
recall 
conversations that he had with Mr Maseko years ago and what he may 
have meant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  I think let us be fair and stick to what this 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 34 of 107 
 
Commission is about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  The terms of reference bearing in – in mind 
that Mr Zuma’s assessment of this affidavit is that it does not implicate 
him in fraud and corruption.  If the Commission’s view is that it does let 
them put those questions to him.  Not ask him to remember meetings 
and – and – if this affidavit anywhere says that Mr Zuma is corrupt in A, 
B, C and D then he must put that to Mr Zuma because that is – that is 
exactly within the terms of reference that this Commission is about. 
This line of – we do this often but we do it to opponents – I 
10 
mean to witnesses who we are cross-examining.  Not witnesses we are 
supposed to just inquire about information because we expected that 
the Commission will be asking for clarity on certain things not pose 
questions that amount to cross-examination. That is what we – we – 
that is what we – we thought we would bring to the attention of the – of 
the – of the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  Of the Committee.  Mr Chair we wanted to do 
that in Chambers … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  But we thought no actually it is probably up 
to - to bring it to your attention now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  So that – so that if there is a need for us to 
then regroup and determine how – how we deal with it. 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 35 of 107 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  Then we deal with it because if Mr Pretorius 
wants to continue with cross-examination … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  We – we waited yesterday because we 
realised it was actually cross-examination … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  But we said no maybe later on we will see a 
– an approach that seeks to establish facts.  If Mr Zuma says I do not 
remember that meeting that should be the end of the matter.  Why 
10 
should it then be asked oh but you would have discussed this privately?  
What – where is he taking this to?  Terms of reference in the terms of 
reference.  Let us be loyal to the terms of reference. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  That is – that is what we – we … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  We want to put. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I will hear what Mr Pretorius has to say.  I had a little 
bit of concern in relation to questions that related to the meeting that 
Mr Maseko had with the Guptas which obviously Mr Zuma did not attend 
20 
but with regard to the removal or transfer of – of Mr Maseko from GCIS 
to – to the Department of Public Service and Administration my 
recollection is that his statement and/or evidence suggested that he 
was removed from his position as CEO of GCIS because he did not 
cooperate with the Guptas and that he was told that by the Minister – 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 36 of 107 
 
Minister Chabane that that was at the instance of the former President. 
That is my – my recollection of what he said.  Of course if 
one talks about a phone call that happened many years ago some calls 
one might recall because of their distinct nature or significance but 
someone would not recall.  Sometimes one might not even recall a call 
that happened a few months ago but my understanding of Mr Maseko’s 
evidence suggested that the Guptas were unhappy that he did not 
cooperate with them and that he was removed when there were no 
grounds to remove him and that that was at the instance based on what 
he was told he said by Minister Chabane of the former President but let 
10 
me hear what Mr … 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  Sorry, sorry, perhaps before you take 
...(intervention) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes? 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  Firstly in relation to what the Chairperson 
has just sketched out the first point would be this, Mr Pretorius must 
say that they are going to bring the Guptas or whoever they allege in 
the Guptas placed – I mean the witness from the Guptas are going to 
say that they – who is going to confirm this interaction that Maseko is 
talking about, because it is not, you see Chair what you said in terms 
20 
of your – in terms of reference, was that if you are implicated on the 
issues that are within the terms of reference then you are going to be 
given an opportunity to put your version and then put your – and then 
of course you will be, somebody might ask to cross-examine you, 
someone might ask to cross-examine you.   
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 37 of 107 
 
 
We didn’t get the impression that the evidence leaders here 
job would be to cross-examine witnesses, but even on the issue that Mr 
Maseko complains about that he was fired or he was transferred 
because of some intervention that came from the Presidency, that’s an 
issue that he says we are assess it, we say in terms of the terms of 
reference there are no allegations he’s making on corruption, if you 
bring Mr Ajay or Mr – or any of the Guptas here in the Commission and 
they say to you we did speak to Mr Maseko, we in fact told him that we 
are the ear of the President and that if he is not cooperating on this 
business we will certain invoke, we will use that relationship and get 
10 
him removed.  We think it is highly unfair if the Guptas are not going to 
be here to testify and to corroborate what Mr Maseko has said here it is 
just unfair to ask the President to recall or to interpret what role he 
may have played in the removal of Mr Maseko, but the other thing that 
reason why we did not think that falls within your terms of reference is 
because it is something that has to do with how government decides to 
remove people who are employed there or deploy them or transfer them 
into different units. 
 
It is not within – if Mr Maseko’s allegation is that there was 
corruption he must say so in unequivocal terms, or that his removal – 
20 
his transfer was in pursuance of a corrupt deal, he must say so, it 
cannot be read through cross-examination, which cross-examination we 
are not prepared for, because what we were prepared for when we were 
invited by the Commission was for Mr Zuma to be asked clarity 
questions, clarification questions, not going through pages and 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 38 of 107 
 
paragraphs and cross-examining him on issues that he has elected to 
take a position, a legal position which is that he is not going to get 
involved in Maseko’s speculation about what his meeting with the 
Guptas, who authorised it what else.  If Maseko is bold enough to say I 
was removed because the President was unhappy that I was not doing 
the right thing he must say so, and that this right thing that I was being 
asked to – this right thing that I was doing was in accordance with the 
law but the President wanted me to do something corrupt, then we are 
in the terms of reference, then we would have said to the President Mr 
President Mr Maseko says you are corrupt and this is how he says you 
10 
are corrupt, and then Mr President would have said okay let me 
respond, this is my statement.   
 
The Commission would have a statement answering allegation 
of corruption or State Capture or whatever it is that – and fraud.  If Mr 
Maseko’s accusations of Mr Zuma amounted to that he was corrupt, 
there was a fraudulent conduct on his behalf or that there was 
something about State Capture that one must read in it.  You can’t – it 
is not fair to call a former President to come and talk about how an 
official of government was removed, when you are not alleging that 
there was corruption.  Please make the allegation that there was 
20 
corruption and then let the President deal with that, or that there was 
fraud. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you see when you deal with a case in litigation 
in court it is easy to say when you are for one side the other side must 
make out its case, because that is litigation.  Where it is an inquiry a 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 39 of 107 
 
person make come and say this is what I know, I am placing before the 
Commission what I know and what happened and the Commission must 
inquire whether that may have anything to do with any impropriety, so 
while on the one hand there must be fairness, there can be no doubt 
about that, but one also needs to understand that unlike in litigation 
where one is able to say well that party must make its case clear in the 
pleadings and in the affidavits, in an inquiry you have a situation where 
people say I am only here to say what I know, what you make of that in 
terms of your inquiry whether you think it is relevant or irrelevant but 
this is what I am here to say, so one has got to look at all of that. 
10 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  With respect I understand that Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  But even within the Commission of Inquiry 
firstly it would be a misunderstanding if you understood Mr Chair that I 
was invoking a litigation strategy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  All I am saying is this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  That in the statements that you get, even if a 
complainant comes here before the Commission and complains, the 
20 
complaint must be investigated if the allegations that that complainant 
makes fall within the terms of reference of the Commission.  I am 
saying we advised Mr Zuma that Mr Maseko’s statement did not accuse 
him of any corruption or any fraud, or any State Capture, he is unhappy 
with some things and all that.  What is happening here, and so we said 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 40 of 107 
 
to Mr Zuma so we do not think that you should put a statement, so that 
is why you do not have a statement.  In terms of the rules you are 
allowed not to put a statement to explain what Mr Maseko says, 
because he does not implicate you in what the Commission is about.   
 
So Mr Zuma decides he is not going to put a statement, that is 
what he has done, but what has happened here is that having taken 
advantage and used the full right he has in terms of the Commission 
rules, not to respond to a litigant or to a witness who says, who makes 
allegations that do not amount to corruption.  What is happening here 
is just not what we think should be happening and that is why as they 
10 
say Chair we sit there and we thought no, actually let – because he is a 
guest of the Commission, let us see how – what they really want from 
him, what information are they looking from him in relation to Mr 
Maseko.  Does he make the allegation of corruption, fraud and State 
Capture against him for which he should be called to answer?   
 
And that is why we are anxious with these kind of questions in 
this kind of forum a lot can be read from the questions that he reads 
and from the answers they get, and we do not want this Commission to 
end up in a situation where it is unfair to Mr Zuma because it is said to 
Mr Zuma if no one makes allegations of corruption or fraud or State 
20 
Capture you do not have to put a statement, you do not need to ask Mr 
Maseko – to cross-examination Mr Maseko on it, and he has done that.   
 
We accept that you can call him to ask clarity questions.  
Please ask clarity questions and not questions that amount to cross-
examining because we go into credibility when we cross-examine a 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 41 of 107 
 
witness, we go into credibility so Mr Maseko is being measured against 
– his allegations are being measured against Mr Zuma, and we want to 
be sure that that is not something that you are trying to invoke, the 
credibility of the witness and whether he can be trusted for his 
recollection of what Mr Maseko says, so we are asking the Commission 
to be fair to the extent that it accepts that Mr Zuma has been called at 
its instance to seek clarity questions, not to ask questions that amount 
to 
cross-examination 
on 
what 
has 
been 
happening 
as 
cross-
examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me hear Mr Pretorius. 
10 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  I do not want 
to enter into a long debate as to what questioning is and what cross-
examination is, save to say that there is no pleaded case or charge 
sheet which we are seeking to validate or sections of which we are 
seeking to prove through our questioning.  So insofar as it may be 
alleged that we are seeking to question, to prove a particular pleaded 
case in a civil matter or a particular criminal case as represented by a 
charge sheet that is simply not correct.   
20 
 
What we are doing is affording Mr Zuma a full opportunity to 
deal with all the factual evidence that Mr Maseko led, and indeed the 
implications of that evidence, and it would be grossly unfair to Mr Zuma 
not to allow him that full opportunity to deal with what might have been 
said by Mr Maseko and also what might have been intended by him to 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 42 of 107 
 
have been conveyed, and once Mr Zuma has dealt with it, as he is 
dealing with it, I really don’t see that we are traversing any  rules, but 
insofar as we are Chair you will no doubt pull me up and guide me 
accordingly, and I am quite willing to accept such – obviously such 
intervention by yourself. 
 
The second point is in relation to assumed obligation to call 
the Guptas to corroborate Mr Maseko before questions can be asked, I 
am not sure that it is correct at all to say that you cannot ask questions 
about the evidence of one witness until it has been corroborated by 
another witness.  One need not deal with that issue any further. 
 
10 
 
Thirdly in terms of reference, I understand the argument to be 
that unless there is a direct allegation of fraud and corruption against 
Mr Zuma we are precluded from entering into this arena. 
 
May I just highlight paragraph 1.1 of our terms of reference, 
which just says whether and to what extent and by whom attempts were 
made through any form of inducement or for any gain whatsoever 
nature to influence the improper influence of members of the National 
Executive and the improper influence of Mr Maseko falls squarely within 
our terms of reference and it is only fair to Mr Zuma in these 
circumstances to ask him what  he knew, if anything, about him, to 
20 
enable him either to distance himself as he has to date completely from 
that undue influence or to admit that I did have because I was in 
support of the project.  It’s not unfair to ask Mr Zuma those questions 
so he can give his version as to what the import of the evidence of Mr 
Maseko might be and Mr Maseko’s evidence which we were dealing with 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 43 of 107 
 
now which gave rise to the objection, at least the timing of the 
objection, is particular in that what Mr Maseko says is that following in 
the context of Mr Maseko’s failure to accede to what may well be 
argued improper influence he was fired and it would be grossly unfair to 
Mr Zuma if the leading team were to ask you to make findings in that 
regard because the evidence was unchallenged and Mr Zuma hasn’t 
had an opportunity to deal with it. 
 
Let me deal with another term of reference, 1.6, it says 
whether our mandate is to investigate whether there were any 
irregularities, undue enrichment, corruption and undue influence in the 
10 
awarding 
of contracts, 
government 
advertising 
in 
a 
New Age 
newspaper, so 
this 
whole 
issue of 
government 
advertising is 
particularly highlighted in the terms of reference in relation not only to 
fraud and corruption, but in relation to any influence that might be 
argued to be undue and quite fairly to Mr Zuma he commented on that 
yesterday, saying that the influence sought to be exercised was not 
entirely proper, he used his own words, I cannot recall them at the 
moment. 
 
So basically all one needs to do for the moment and going 
forward is in fairness to Mr Zuma put to Mr Zuma the import of what Mr 
20 
Maseko has done, I do not have far to go at all, and I submit the line of 
questioning has been not only proper but necessary in order to ensure 
that in relation to all the evidence its import Mr Zuma has a fair 
opportunity to deal with it.   
 
I have never said to Mr Zuma I put it to you as cross-
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 44 of 107 
 
examiners who featured prominently on TV in the past have done, that 
you are wrong and this is the version that we seek to prove. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you would like to respond? 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  Yes, in the tradition of audi I like Mr 
Pretorius respond to some of the things that he says. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  Firstly Chair what is astonishing for us is 
that this Commission clearly was created around the work that the 
President had done.  We have not received a single invitation from the 
evidence leaders for them to interview Mr Zuma, privately, as they have 
10 
done with the other witnesses, to say to Mr Zuma we would like you to 
give us a view of what is going on here, and to explain certain things, 
which is what they have done.  Mr Zuma has not been treated the same 
way that other Ministers who have appeared here, who are – appear to 
be witnesses of the Commission.  
 
A decent way of dealing with this, and I don’t mean disrespect 
to the Commissioner or to the evidence leaders, would have been to 
say he is a major witness of what they are investigating, let us talk to 
him first, let us understand what statement we can get form him, 
because then it is easier to lead him as they have led other witnesses, 
20 
other ministers they have led here in the Commission.  They have led 
them because they have been able to put together a statement from 
them with evidence and therefore they can take the Minister through 
the aspects.  Why has Mr Zuma been brought in this manner, if it was 
not cross-examine him, so I am saying in respect – this – this – he says 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 45 of 107 
 
well you know this is not a criminal charge, we are not proving a 
charge, we are not in a civil trial.  He is simplifying the issues, he 
knows that what is going on here is of interest to the criminal law 
enforcement processes, he knows that.  Why is he diminishing the 
value of this process by saying nothing, we’re not – we don’t have a 
charge sheet, we are not trying to prove a civil claim. 
 
In fact it is not right, now that I know what his views are on 
this issue it is not right the way he wants to carry on with this.  The 
decent thing to have done if this was a Commission witness, as others 
have been Commission witnesses the decent way to have done it is to 
10 
say you have the helm of the executive that we are looking at, we 
would like to talk to you about it.  We – they addressed a letter to Mr 
Mantsha, Mr Mantsha will say okay guys we will talk to the President, 
you come and see him at Nkandla, he will tell you exactly what you 
want, they then create a statement as they have done with other 
ministers.  Why have they done it this way?   
 
So I am saying ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  So I am saying let us be fair, in fact when he 
says it will be unfair to Mr Zuma, he is not being – that is really a 
20 
statement that I shouldn’t – I think should not be dignified, because 
what is fair to Mr Zuma is to be treated in accordance with the spirit 
and the purpose of this Commission.  It is not in the spirit of this 
Commission to come here and say well it is in the terms of reference 
that we can investigate anything.  What he has just read specifically 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 46 of 107 
 
says it – it is specific, it requires that a witness makes an allegation 
that there is fraud and corruption, he is not left to speculation, and in 
fact they could have sorted out most of these things that they are 
asking now if they had done what they had done with the ministers.  If 
they had gone to him and said look I mean we’re now in the middle of a 
Commission you established, we would like to hear what you say about 
some of the things that have come up.  We will then do a statement and 
then we are going to bring it to the Commission and then we are going 
to lead the evidence, lead the evidence not cross-examine you.  So 
what are we meant to do with this?   
10 
 
It is not right, we would suggest that you seriously consider 
that proposal of asking them to talk to him about the things that they 
want; to then make a statement if they want to make a statement and 
then to lead him properly.  This is cross-examination and as his legal 
team we cannot sit there and – he can say whatever he wants to say, 
you do not, a cross-examination question is not – it is not practice, and 
he is more senior than I am, it is not practice that you say I put it to 
you, that is not how we identify whether this is a cross-examination or 
not.  The fact that he does not say I put it to you does not mean that 
the question is not a cross-examination question. 
20 
 
There is serious credibility issues that he is pursuing here, 
that we are concerned about.  This is not how we envisaged that this 
Commission intends to pursue this issue.  We would seriously urge 
Chair that you consider asking them to see if they cannot have a 
conversation with the President about these issues so they have a 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 47 of 107 
 
statement from him, not to simply spring things from him that the way in 
which they are conducting themselves, that is why I asked the question 
why has he been brought here in this manner.  Why has he not been 
firstly invited to bring a statement, because they can do that, they 
cannot tell us that the Ministers that they brought here were firstly 
implicated on paper and then of course they must have consulted with 
them, I don’t – he can correct me if I’m wrong, a statement was created 
and then of course you have got their statements here.  Mr Zuma does 
not have a statement created by the evidence leaders.  Why is that so? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you.  I think what I would like to do is 
10 
that we take the tea break and at the end of the tea break may I see 
counsel on both sides in my temporary chambers here, can I see both 
counsel on both sides and just to try and see if we may at least achieve 
a common understanding as to where the concerns are and whether 
there is a way of resolving them in terms of the way forward without me 
having to make any ruling. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  We will take the tea adjournment now, it is 
about twenty two minutes past eleven, I think let us aim to resume at 
twelve to give ourselves time for tea and time for the meeting that I 
20 
must have with counsel on both sides.   
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 48 of 107 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  My meeting with counsel on both sides took longer 
than I had anticipated that is why we were not able to resume at twelve.  
However I am happy to say that the meeting that I have had with both – 
with counsel from both sides has been a very constructive and fruitful 
meeting.  
The discussion that I had with counsel from both sides has 
resulted in an agreement that I do not need to make any ruling on the 
concerns or objections that had been raised.   
A way has been found to try and minimise any prospects of any 
feeling of unfairness.  Counsel for the former President have indicated 
10 
that they do not wish to be seen as if they are obstructive by rising all 
the – very often and raising objections whenever there might be 
something that they are concerned about.   
They have said that they wish Mr Pretorius to be able to ask 
questions without having to look over his shoulders whether they are 
rising to object or not.  It has been agreed that because they do not 
intend to do that I will try and be more ready to intervene in case I 
think there is unfairness in any question.  But it has been agreed that 
we can proceed we do not – I do not need to make a ruling. 
Mr Pretorius from his side will try and find a way to put 
20 
questions in a manner that will take account of any concerns that he 
may think may create unfairness.   
So we are going to proceed and Mr Zuma’s counsel have 
indicated that they will really raise an objection if it is something that is 
quite serious but otherwise they intend to try and allow the proceedings 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 49 of 107 
 
to flow as much as possible.  So we will proceed on that basis and I 
just wish to thank counsel from both sides for their constructive 
approach to resolving the issue that we have resolved.  Thank you very 
much. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Mr Zuma may we proceed then?  
Thank you.  You have before you copies of the statements that have 
been enlarged.  I hope that is more convenient for you and that we may 
continue our engagement.  Thank you.  What I would like to put to you 
10 
in relation to the evidence of Mr Maseko is simply what he told the 
Chair in his evidence so that you have an opportunity to respond to it.  
And the import of what his evidence is so that you also have an 
opportunity to respond to that.  And if I may ask you to look at 
paragraph 47 and 48 on page 9.  What Mr Maseko says is that he was 
told by Mr Chabane that he had been instructed by the President that is 
yourself to redeploy me or terminate my contract henceforth.  You have 
already told the Chair I understand that you gave no such instruction 
and you explained how it would come about in the ordinary course that 
Director General may have his employment terminated at the hands of 
20 
the reporting Minister.  Do you recall that? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Right.  He then says in paragraph 
48: 
“He told me that is Minister Chabane told Mr Maseko 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 50 of 107 
 
that although he no choice but to implement the 
instruction 
from 
the 
President, 
he 
made 
a 
commitment not to throw me in the street because he 
knew that I was a committed civil servant who had 
not done anything wrong.” 
The essence of that statement by Mr Maseko is that he was told by 
Minister Chabane that he had been a committed civil servant who had 
not done anything wrong.  Do you have any response or comment about 
that? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No I do not know the – that 
10 
message.  I never gave any instruction to that effect. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Yes.  Yes.  What – what is being 
said I think by Mr Maseko is that as far as Minister Chabane was 
concerned he had not done anything wrong, do you know anything 
about that statement and Mr Chabane’s attitude? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No.  I think as I said earlier at 
that time there was shifting of the DG’s between the departments for a 
variety of reasons so I never issued any instruction. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Then over the page on page 10 
there is reference to a cabinet meeting and what Mr Maseko says in 
20 
paragraph 49 is: 
“During the course of the cabinet meeting I was 
informed that ETV News channel was running with a 
new story that I was fired.” 
Paragraph 50: 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 51 of 107 
 
“During the tea break I brought this to the attention 
of Minister Chabane who was shocked that the mater 
of my imminent exit was somehow leaked to the 
media.” 
Then 51: 
“Minister Chabane consulted with the President 
during the break and an impromptu announcement 
had to be made to Cabinet that I had been 
terminated 
as 
GCIS 
CEO 
and 
Government 
Spokesperson.” 
10 
That is evidence which relates to a direct consultation or evidence of a 
direct consultation between Minister Chabane and yourself during a 
cabinet meeting relating to an announcement that in effect that Mr 
Maseko had been fired.  Do you recall anything about that incident or 
that alleged incident? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No I recall that the Minister 
coming to me reporting this and as always then they were going to 
respond to the newspaper.  It was just informing me. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Did Minister Chabane give you any 
background to the – and I use the word firing advisedly because it is 
20 
used in the statement of Mr Maseko? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No he did not give me – I mean 
he did not discuss the matter in terms of the background.  He was just 
saying they have got to deal with this matter because at that time there 
was a shifting of the DG’s but he did not discuss the causes as to why 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 52 of 107 
 
the other DG was going this way.  What he was concerned with at the 
time was to correct the impression that was being given by the media 
that he has been sacked.  That no he has been shifted to another 
department. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Did you know of the transfer then 
because that is dealt with in the remainder of page 10 of Mr Maseko to 
the post of Director General at the Department of Public Service and 
Administration? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes, yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Was that part of any decision that 
10 
you made? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No the decision was made by 
the cabinet. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  By the cabinet.  Let me just give you 
an opportunity to comment Mr Zuma on the import of the statement of 
Mr Maseko. Mr Maseko his evidence is that an improper approach was 
made to him to ensure that the full budget of the various departments 
for Government advertising was allocated in favour of the New Age 
Newspaper.  That is his evidence.  And what he at least seeks to 
conclude from his statement is that t the very least he was punished for 
20 
not cooperating as he was requested to do by Mr Ajay Gupta and in 
quoting the Minister Chabane as he does in his statement he attributes 
the decision to dismiss or transfer whatever that decision was to 
yourself.  Do you have any comment on that? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No.  I was not the cause of his 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 53 of 107 
 
being shifted. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Right 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  If we may move on… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And maybe – maybe before that.  And is it something 
you have quite a clear recollection of that you – you did not cause him 
to be shifted.  It would have been a request from his Minister? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  I would like to go to page 17 if I may 
10 
and that was the statement of Ms Mentor.  Now I am mindful of certain 
comments made Chair yesterday about the evidence of Ms Mentor 
whether it was reliable or credible in any sense and whether it would in 
those circumstances be fair to Mr Zuma to put anything about what Ms 
Mentor said.  From the legal team’s point of view firstly that is what 
was presaged in the correspondence but that is a formality.  It needs to 
be emphasised that no finding has yet been made about the credibility 
and reliability of her testimony.  That is a matter for later consideration 
and decision by yourself Chair.   
 
Having heard all the evidence and having given everybody who 
20 
is concerned an opportunity to talk.  So whatever may be said about 
her evidence it is cogency or otherwise it is incumbent upon us  I 
understand nevertheless to put her version to Mr Zuma for his 
comment. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes. 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 54 of 107 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  In summary Mr Zuma what Ms 
Mentor testified to was that a member of the Gupta family “offered” and 
I use that word advisedly in inverted commas because whether it was 
an offer or not I will deal with in a moment.  A Ministerial position in 
exchange for favouring the commercial interests of the Gupta’s and that 
she goes further – she says that that offer insofar as it was an offer 
was made with the knowledge and approval of yourself.  Now we can go 
through it bit by bit.  There are other surrounding aspects of her 
evidence that I can put to you – I should put to you briefly in fairness 
but that is the essence of her evidence.  Do you want to answer it at a 
10 
general level or shall we go into the detail? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No I had no interaction with this 
witness, nothing. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Right.  She says in paragraph 16 to 
21 of her evidence or of her statement rather that she occupied the 
position as Chair of a Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises.  She 
said she was and she uses the word elected as Chairperson of the 
Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises in 2004 and that in 2010 she 
was removed from this position.  And again what she says is that in her 
opinion the reasons for her removal were twofold that she refused to 
20 
meet with yourself on that China state visit which I think you would 
recall because it is central to her evidence.  Let us just place that 
evidence properly in its context.   
 
There was a visit to China at a stage at which you were 
present.  She says that there was a request that she meet with you and 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 55 of 107 
 
that she refused.  Do you recall anything about that? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  I know nothing about it. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Right.  She says that another 
reason for her removal as Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee was 
that she refused to assist in the closure of the SAA, South African 
Airways route to India. Do you know anything about that issue? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No I know nothing about that. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Right.  She does say that she was 
taken to task in relation to the China trip because Transnet actually 
paid for that visit and she was taken to task for that? 
10 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Who paid for? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Transnet. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Transnet? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Yes.  Paid – do you know anything 
about that issue? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No I know nothing about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well would that not be a Parliamentary issue in the 
National Assembly? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Yes well it may be put that that was 
the real reason and that is why I am … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no what I am saying is the action… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  It is a Parliamentary issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja which would not involve the Presidency. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  No, no but in fairness to the 
President I felt it in order to remind him that many people say that that 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 56 of 107 
 
was the reason and not the other reasons.  Then she talks at paragraph 
26 and following Mr Zuma of the visit to China.  And she said that she 
travelled to China in her capacity as Portfolio Committee Chair of 
Public Enterprises.  Do you yourself recall that visit to China?  It was in 
and about August 2010 I know there may have been plenty of visits and 
it is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well should you not just give him more details.  I 
think it was said it was a state visit but the way you put it it is like 
whether he recalls Ms Mentor’s visit to China. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Yes it was a state visit and in fact 
10 
there was a state banquet according to her evidence in China in August 
2010.  A large contingent of South African officials, Parliamentarians, 
government 
officials, 
executive 
members 
apparently intended 
– 
attended including she says the Gupta’s. And she said at that visit the 
Gupta’s played a prominent role or an organisational role in the visit.  
Do you recall anything of that nature? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No I do not. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Okay. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  I do not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe let us say – I am sorry – do you recall a 
20 
state visit that may have made to China was it 2011? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  2010. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2010. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  In or about August 2010. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 57 of 107 
 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Well I have gone to China 
several times. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  I might have to look at my 
records. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You might not recall that in that year. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Ja I am not recalling it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You had one or not but you have had a few of them. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A few state visits? 
10 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Ja because I have gone to 
China a number of times. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  If I do not check my records. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  I will not be able to be exact 
and give the exact answer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would be able to say.  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Would you recall any state visit at 
which the Gupta’s were present and played any role whatsoever? 
20 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No I do not.  Though never – I 
do not remember them in any state visit. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Would that have happened to your 
knowledge given your knowledge of the Gupta’s and state visits and the 
like? 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 58 of 107 
 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No I say – no I have just 
answered to say I do not remember.  Them being a part of our visit at 
being taken prominent role, what would they be doing because they 
have got nothing to do with the visit? 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you have a state visit would the President not 
normally invite South African business people to join for purposes of 
promoting trade with the country to which the visit is intended? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes that happens but… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That happens. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No one of those business 
10 
people would play a prominent role in the visit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  They meet other business 
people.  In fact if you go like that only once you go to address them 
together with the President of that country. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  You come in, you address, you 
go away. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  You do not participate in the 
20 
activities. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the state visit. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  All the state visits. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Ja. 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 59 of 107 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So they meet their counterparts’. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And discuss business but they do not become part of 
the state activities. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Not at all.  Not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Alright.  She also said in her 
statement Mr Zuma that on the evening of the state banquet in China 
she was approached by a gentleman who told her that you wished to 
meet with her at the Chinese Presidential Guest house.  Do you have 
10 
any comment or recollection in regard to that? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No.  Nothing of that nature. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  She of course assumed that the man 
who spoke to her was one of the Gupta brothers. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  She assumes that well it is her 
who saw the person. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  She assumed that. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  I know nothing about it. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Then in paragraph 59 if you would 
turn to that please Mr Zuma. 
20 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Page 59? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  59 – paragraph 59 I am sorry. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Paragraph 59.  The first thing 
she says there is that she had been trying for some time to meet with 
you regarding the Pebble Bed Modular Reaction amongst other things.  
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 60 of 107 
 
Do you know anything about her attempts to meet with you about that 
issue? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  No.  Nothing. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  She says too that she communicate 
with Ms Lakela Kaunda who at the time she thought was your personal 
assistant in order to secure such a meeting.  If we could take that step 
by step.  Did Ms Kaunda – Ms Kaunda work in your office? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Ja Ms Kaunda worked in my 
office. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Yes.  And who – whose 
10 
responsibility would it have been to make arrangements to meet with 
you? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Not Kaunda.  Kaunda had 
nothing to do with that. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Not Kaunda. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  There are other officials who 
were dealing with those kind of arrangements not Kaunda. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Right.  She says that one evening 
on a Sunday in or around October 2010 and in fairness to that version 
changed to September I think or times other than October 2010 she 
20 
said she received a telephone from Ms Kaunda to say that you could 
see her the following day.  Do you recall anything of that? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Right.   
CHAIRPERSON:  On second Mr Pretorius.  Lerato.  Thank you.   
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 61 of 107 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  In any event what she then said in 
her evidence and I am moving to paragraph 63.  She said that she 
would be met at the airport in Johannesburg and taken to a place where 
she would meet with you.  I understand from what you have said is that 
you do not recall any interaction with Ms Kaunda at all. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  So the details of that interaction is 
not necessary to deal with. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Not at all. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Yes – and sorry I might have made 
10 
an error.  No interaction with Ms Mentor. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  No not at all. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Yes.  She then says that she was 
picked up at the airport, taken to a certain business premises Sahara 
Computers and then taken to what has become known at the Saxonwold 
compound.  She says there that in the course of events that morning 
Ajay Gupta told her that you knew of this meeting but I take it that 
consistent with your previous answers that is not a matter that you can 
comment on. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  I know nothing. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Various issues then were discussed 
in that meeting but at a stage she says firstly that there would be a 
cabinet reshuffle in the next week or so.  Do you know of a cabinet 
reshuffle in October 2010 for example and if I could help you there the 
cabinet reshuffle where Minister Gigaba was appointed to replace 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 62 of 107 
 
Minister Hogan.  That happened around October 2010 as we understand 
it.   
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Ja there was a reshuffle I think.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  In terms of reshuffle that 
happens regularly when it is to happen. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  If she is to believe – be believed at 
all and I qualify that what I am to put to you on that basis.  It appears 
that Ajay Gupta would have known of a cabinet reshuffle to occur at the 
end of October.  Now in that regard you did say earlier that there is a 
10 
consultation process that happens before a cabinet reshuffle. Could 
someone like Ajay Gupta have known of such a reshuffle? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  From your own knowledge. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No.  Ajay Gupta was not part of 
Government. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  No I understand. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Was not even part of the people 
who normally get consulted. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  So your response to that evidence is 
20 
not that he might have known but that simply the probabilities are that 
he did not know?  As I understand. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  He should not have known. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I – I guess maybe let us ask it this way.  Before a 
reshuffle would happen would there be people with whom you would 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 63 of 107 
 
have consultation that would know before it happens? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes definitely.  I consult … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Very selected a few people. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  I always consult. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  At no stage I could do the 
reshuffle without people knowing who are supposed to know.  For 
example it would be the top six for example would have to know what I 
10 
am doing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the top six of ANC? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Top six of the ANC, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  As well as if it is – all of it as 
well as the alliance top six or five. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Those are the people we 
consult with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA: 
 
So 
it 
would 
not 
be 
the 
knowledge that is on me only. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  There would be those kind of 
individuals who would know. 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 64 of 107 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I guess that the best you can say it that you did 
not tell him or you would not have told him but you cannot know what 
anyone else who might have known might have done? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes definitely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS: 
 
Ajay Gupta 
according 
to 
the 
10 
statement at least – the written statement that you have before you – 
said to her two things and I am referring to paragraph 91 if you want to 
go there Mr Zuma. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Paragraph 91. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  He said: 
“He would put in a word with the President for me.” 
And then he said: 
“We usually do.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  What page?  What paragraph? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Paragraph 91. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Huh-uh. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  So what she said that Ms Mentor … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Is and perhaps for the sake of 
accuracy I should read paragraph 90 … 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 65 of 107 
 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Because the status of the offer 
maybe debated.  Paragraph 90 she said: 
“Immediately after …” 
And she is now referring to the discussion between herself 
and Mr Ajay Gupta. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  “Immediately after his 
statements about SAA’s India route Ajay Gupta then 
very casually and much to my astonishment, 
10 
proceeded to offer me the position of Minister of 
Public Enterprises if I would agree to facilitate the 
closure of SAA’s India route when I became 
Minister.  Ajay Gupta said there would be a cabinet 
reshuffle in the next week or so and he said he had 
an offer for me.  He said that I could be the next 
Minister of Public Enterprises if I agree to facilitate 
the closure of the route.” 
But the import of her statement is qualified and in fairness 
that qualification should be put to you.  She goes on in paragraph 91 to 
20 
say: 
“It is an understatement to say that I was shocked 
by the offer.  I was stunned and wondered how 
Ajay Gupta had so much power.  I responded firstly 
by informing him that the SAA statistic showed that 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 66 of 107 
 
the flight to India was doing very well.  Secondly I 
asked how he could be in a position to offer me a 
position as a Minister.  Ajay Gupta said he would 
put in a word for the President for me.  After the 
statement there was silence in the room after which 
Ajay stated:  “We usually do”.  I perceived his tone 
to be boastful.  I then asked him who “we” was but 
he did not respond.” 
So although she concludes that an offer was made it seems 
that what she does say is that Ajay Gupta said he would put in a word 
10 
with the President for me.  I am not sure whether that was a firm offer 
or not but the question then arises about what she says.  Is that 
Ajay Gupta informed her that he had communications with you in which 
he would suggest who should be appointed as a Minister.  So that is the 
import of her evidence.  Rather … 
(Background noise) 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I pressed the wrong one. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  May I conclude the question or do 
you want to interrupt Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I wanted to say I think your – what you put to 
20 
Mr Zuma as the essence of what Ms Mentor is saying might not be 
accurate.  My understanding is that what you read says Ms Mentor says 
Mr Gupta said to her he would put in a word for her to the President for 
her to get the ministerial position but you said he – she said there was 
communication 
which 
might 
suggest 
there 
had 
been 
prior 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 67 of 107 
 
communication. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know if that is there but that is what I heard. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  No.  Let me make it clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  In fairness to all concerned she 
says two things.  In paragraph 90 she said he made me an offer.  
Ajay Gupta made me an offer of a presidential position.  She qualifies 
this somewhat in her next paragraph to say: 
“He would put in a word with the President for me.” 
10 
So her evidence is to the effect that Ajay Gupta said that he 
would suggest to you or advice or try to persuade or however 
communicate with you in relation to her future appointment as a 
Minister of Public Enterprises.  So what I am attempting to put to you is 
the import of the statement that Ajay Gupta said he would put in a word 
with yourself in her favour.  Any response to that?  Is that clear? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  I do not know what could my 
response – because they were discussing two of them. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  I had nothing to do with it. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  No I understand. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Absolutely nothing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I – I think maybe the question should be was your 
relationship with Mr Ajay Gupta to your knowledge such that he could 
make such suggestions to you as to who should be appointed Minister? 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 68 of 107 
 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No not at all.  He had nothing to 
do with what happens in the – in – in Government. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  So for – for clarity sake … 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  The question put to you is not to 
comment on what was said between them and to interpret the 
conversation that happened between them … 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  But merely to raise the factual 
question arising out of that. 
10 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  That Mr Gupta appeared according 
to Ms Mentor to be of the opinion that he could talk to you about 
ministerial appointments.  That is the question that has been rephrased 
by the Chair and is that correct or not correct?  You have an 
opportunity to deal with that allegation. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No.  That is why I am saying 
discussing two of them about either offering whatever.  Other one is 
being surprised.  I am not there.  I do not know why they reached that 
kind of a discussion. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Then I have not made myself clear 
and perhaps the Chair needs to rephrase his question as well. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  The question is not what happened 
… 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 69 of 107 
 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Or what is interpreted about a 
conversation at which you were not … 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Present.  The question is did 
Mr Gupta ever speak to you about an appointment into a ministerial 
position. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No never. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  She then continues in her statement 
to say that at that stage she became angry, began to speak very loudly 
10 
and she had become what she refers to as confrontational and I am 
referring to paragraph 92 and it was at that moment she says that you 
entered the room and that she immediately informed you of the “offer” 
that had been made and that you did not react to that communication 
but tried to calm her down. 
That is the essence of what she says in the remaining 
paragraphs.  I am not sure … 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No there is nothing of that 
nature.  I know nothing of – of entering some room. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you ever been at the Gupta residence at the 
20 
same time as her? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Never. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do – do you recall who Ms Mentor is? 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 70 of 107 
 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do recall her? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes I do recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I am asking … 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes I recall her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I am asking because I think at a certain stage 
there was – seems to have be something from the Presidency that 
suggested that at that time you did not recall who she was.  So that is 
why I am asking but you say you do recall her? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No I do recall her. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  I do recall her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Well perhaps again to afford you an 
opportunity to respond on page 54 and Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you moving away from that incident? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  No I am going exactly to that point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Again MPM5 on page 54 is illegible.  
So it is not of any use to anybody but I do want to refer to a better 
20 
version of that document.  A more direct route this time Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you got a clearer copy for counsel for Mr Zuma? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say that is a better version of the document at 
page 54? 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 71 of 107 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  It maybe that I should afford time to 
consult.  It is 1 o’ clock.  I do not know when you intend taking the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  We can take the adjournment now. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Long adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let – let us take the lunch adjournment now. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  And then the matter can be 
discussed in the meanwhile. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can – you can discuss the matter ja.  We will take 
the short – the lunch adjournment now and resume at 2 o’ clock.  We 
adjourn. 
10 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair. Mr Zuma 
before the long adjournment you and your representatives were handed 
a copy of a media statement in more legible form that appeared in the 
bundle, it’s apparent from the document at least, that a media 
statement was issued by the Presidency on the 15 t h of Mach 2016 and 
may I ask who is Bongani Majola or who was he? 
20 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  He was one of the staff in the 
Presidency dealing with communications. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The statement reads, and it’s at 
page 55 – sorry page 54, this document which is at page 54 which is 
illegible Chair will be replaced by the document now handed to you, 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 72 of 107 
 
headed, social media comment by former member of Parliament, if I 
may read it to you sir, it reads, 
 
“The Presidency has received media enquiries about a 
 
reported comment on social media by former ANC member of 
 
Parliament Ms Vytjie Mentor, the second paragraph reads, 
 
President Jacob Zuma has no recollection of Ms Mentor, he is 
 
therefore unable to comment on any alleged incident in her 
 
career”, 
 
Do you know anything about this statement being issued on 
your behalf? 
10 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes I do, my office came to 
check after getting the information from the communications whether I 
know anything, at that time I must be honest, I had no recollection of 
this name, totally I gave a very honest answer I’ve never – I don’t know 
who is this, only after some time when I saw her picture I realised it is 
a person I know, I couldn’t put the name to the face. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the face? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So do I have it correct, you do, 
having been reminded of how – what she looked like have a recollection 
20 
of Ms Mentor? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes absolutely. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And insofar as this particular 
suggests, otherwise the statement is incorrect? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes. 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 73 of 107 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry I didn’t hear, was the question whether the 
statement at page 54 is incorrect, was that the question? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Aren’t the two of you speaking at cross-purposes, the 
statement says- doesn’t the statement say that he had no recollection 
of who Ms Mentor was? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair the statement says 
President Jacob Zuma has no recollection of Ms Mentor, the 
explanation I understand it to be, is that at that time he had no 
10 
recollection but later on recognising her face, he did have a 
recollection and that’s why I qualified the question in the manner I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well  might not have understood but I understood 
your question to be asking him whether, the statement at page 54 or 
suggesting that the statement at page 54 is incorrect and with him 
agreeing whereas my understanding is that the statement at page 54 is 
correct, according to what he is saying insofar as he had no 
recollection of who Ms Mentor was but when he subsequently saw the 
picture, he realised that it was somebody that he knew, that’s my 
understanding, I may be wrong. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It’s equally correct, I hear what 
you’re saying that’s what I understood the position to be and I think 
what Mr Zuma understands the position to be, I think we’re all in 
agreement, but the point is that insofar as the statement which seeked 
to suggest that he never has had any recollection of her, it would be 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 74 of 107 
 
incorrect, but it doesn’t suggest that, if the tense is correct, President 
Jacob Zuma has no recollection on the 15 t h of March 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes as at that time? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes so I don’t think there’s 
any…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Zuma you understand? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   For completeness of the record 
Ms Mentor did respond to that Presidential statement or statement 
10 
issued on behalf of or by the Presidency in NPM6 which is at page 55. 
Have you a clearer copy of NPM6 Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I have a very unclear copy. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Do you have a copy of a clear 
NPM6, the re-typed note 6? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are talking about …(intervention). 
MR 
PAUL JOSEPH 
PRETORIUS 
SC:  
It 
was given 
to your 
representatives. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no Mr Pretorius I think you are talking about page 
20 
55 and he’s says page 55, you are on the same page.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Literally thank you Chair. I 
thought he said NPM5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I think he said page 55. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Oh in the – oh its page 55, the 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 75 of 107 
 
red? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes the red one ja, I think you have got the right one. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Now that is in very small print it 
being an extract from social media, have you been given by your legal 
representatives, a clearer copy, it was given to them before the long 
adjournment, has it been given to you? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The one in front of you…(intervention). 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  The small one? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no the one at page 55 is it legible, can you read 
10 
it? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No this one is small. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It’s small? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, have you got a copy…(intervention). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair it’s after lunch, it’s been a 
long day, let’s take it slowly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you got a copy? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What we have done is we’ve 
made a clearer copy of page 55 in a text that is legible, it was handed 
20 
to my learned friends before the long adjournment and I had hoped that 
he would have been given a copy, but I’m now asking whether he’s had 
an opportunity to read it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you got a spare copy, I think just – have you got 
another spare copy or can you defer the question? 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 76 of 107 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No look, Chair, if I may just stay 
in control of this process, all I’m asking Mr Zuma is, did your legal 
representatives give you a clearer copy of page 55 in the long 
adjournment? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No, the one…(intervention). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright so we must give it to you 
now? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes because the print is smaller 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair I would have hoped that 
the document that I gave to Mr Zuma’s representatives would have 
been discussed with him, that was the purpose of giving it, it seems it 
wasn’t so let’s start again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, hang on, I think Mr Masuku wants to say 
something. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  Thank you Chair, my learned friend for the 
evidence leaders, Ms September, during lunch gave me a single copy 
which is a copy that we put in the file together, I did not understand it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes there’s no indication that…(intervention. 
20 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  That we needed to give it to…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Give it to the witness. 
MR ZUMA’S REPRESENTATIVE:  The witness for purposes of what my 
learned friend suggests we should do.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no I understand. 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 77 of 107 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It was clear Chair, I don’t want 
there to be any argument about trivialities or these arguments to be 
blown up, everybody knew we were going to deal with it…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  There are two ways of dealing with this, one is for 
you to ask someone to get another copy or…(intervention). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  We’ve got copies Chair, I can 
hand them…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  You’ve got copies, okay the witness must be given the 
copy, Loratto. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And do you have a copy Chair? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I don’t have – thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Just for the record if a copy is 
given to my learned friend during the course of evidence the clear 
intention is that the copy is given so that the witness can be given an 
opportunity to be recognised in relation to it, as I understand it, you 
have it – no that’s what I said before the long adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No Mr Pretorius I don’t think that’s fair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I said it before the long 
adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, Mr Masuku has said he was given a copy, not 
20 
by you, but by Ms September…(intervention). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes on my instruction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You don’t know what transpired between the two of 
them, Mr Masuku has said that there was no indication that, that was 
meant for the witness, it’s fair for – it would have been fair for them to 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 78 of 107 
 
think you might have made other provisions for the witness. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Be that as it may Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let’s move on. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Let’s move one, let’s 
not…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’ve got – the one I have here that I’ve been given 
now is a page that has got two paragraphs but the one that it is 
supposed to be a replacement of or a clearer version of has got one 
large paragraph and about three lines before.  Does the one, the 
clearer version, is the clearer version exactly the same as the illegible 
10 
version.  So in other words I want to know when I look at the clearer 
version I may be reading something that is not in the illegible version 
or not? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No Chair, let me explain, if one 
goes to the original NPM6. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that’s page 55. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes the original page 55, you 
will see – if I may explain Chair, Chair if I may explain it will – you 
needn’t read it, the first three lines, the first paragraph…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the illegible version? 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No is cut off, it’s not complete. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    The complete version appears 
on the clearer version. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 79 of 107 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right but I’m not going to deal 
with that, I’m going to deal with the second paragraph on both pages 
and the second paragraph is the same on both pages. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It seems that shortly after 
reading the Presidential statement, Ms Mentor posted on social media 
her response to what appeared in the press release, that you had no 
recollection of Ms Mentor and she said, 
 
“I Chaired the ANC National Parliamentary Caucus when 
 
President Zuma was he deputy President, he sat next to me 
10 
 
and spoke through me and with me in Caucus each Thursday 
 
when Parliament was in session.  I sat with him in the ANC’s 
 
political committee each month too, he is the one – it says 
 
WHI but it should be who was sent by the top six then to tell 
 
me that the ANC has deployed me to the Chair of Caucus then.  
 
He is the one who introduced me to the ANC Caucus then as 
 
the new Chair of Caucus.  I had a bi-monthly with him in his 
 
Tuinhuis offices then, he knew me right from when he arrived 
 
from exile, he met me frequently on the ground in the Northern 
 
Cape on many occasions.  I know President Mbeki and 
20 
 
Kgalema 
Motlanthe 
will 
never 
ever 
say 
they 
had 
no 
 
recollection of me. As for the Gupta’s I’m not there yet a lot 
 
still need to be told, will leave this here for now”, 
 
And the rest is not relevant to the identification issue. Do you 
have any comment in regard to that, she says, in effect, that she knew 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 80 of 107 
 
you well from a number of interactions over the years and that by 
inference you knew her well? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Well I thought we had clarified 
the point, that when I was asked about her from the beginning I 
couldn’t have any recollection, so I gave that answer, that I have no 
recollection.  Then when I saw her, afterwards, I remembered and 
therefore she was responding to the statement made by the Presidency 
at the beginning.  What I – I think also what she has written here that I 
introduced her to the Caucus, I think she’s very much mistaken.   In the 
Caucus, the Chief Whip introduces whatever changes that are there, 
10 
certainly in Parliament, I’m not sure she was sitting next to me, I’m not 
sure we need to get to those details really because, in Parliament it’s 
me, a person who sits next to me is the deputy President, next to the 
deputy President is the speaker, next to the speaker is the deputy 
speaker so I don’t think we need to get into that really. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well that may be there’s some importance in it 
because I think she gives these details, as I understand what she’s 
saying in order to suggest that it can’t be that you did not recall her, 
that’s why she gives these details because if all of these things that 
she says are true, then one might say, but then in that event Mr Zuma 
20 
must have known her very well.  So I think that is what she is saying, 
so if the position is that, for example, with regard to her saying the two 
of you used to sit next to each other, if the position is that, no, no that 
could not have – that wasn’t there  it’s important to say, no, no that’s 
not the case because this creates the impression that the two of you 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 81 of 107 
 
had interacted so closely in terms of work that she’s suggesting this 
idea that you couldn’t recall her is not true and therefore it is important 
to say, well did you know each other as well as she’s suggesting and so 
on in terms of the things that she is mentioning? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No I hear you Chair, all I’m 
saying when I was asked first, I couldn’t remember the name, only later 
when I saw her and I remembered, oh this is the person.  So at the time 
that I did not remember her, that’s when I said, no I don’t know this 
person, that’s when she responded but if later I recognise and I 
remembered her then I remembered her.  All I’m saying with these 
10 
details which have – that objective to say is impossible but I’m saying 
she’s as well exaggerating because she never sat next to me.  I’m just 
explaining that one without wanting to talk about it, whether it’s 
important point or what but it’s not true that she was sitting next to me 
always, I introduced her to the Caucus it’s not the job of the President 
it’s the job of the Chief Whip or the Chairperson of Caucus. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would the President be involved in Caucuses and so 
on in Parliament? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  President attends the Caucus 
meeting, if he’s there. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  As a member. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As a member, not as President? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:    No as a member of the ANC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you, Mr Pretorius?   
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 82 of 107 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  Was the 
statement ever corrected? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Sorry? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Was the Presidential statement 
that you had no recollection of Ms Mentor, ever corrected? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No I don’t remember, I don’t 
remember it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No Mr Pretorius, if it was correct, that he didn’t 
recollect who Ms Mentor was would there be a need to correct that? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes because it gives an 
10 
incorrect impression. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well base on what he explained, his – I understand 
him to say, I may have known the face but I didn’t put the name to the 
particular face or is your understanding…(intervention). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair that’s  matter for 
submissions later but clearly the impression gained from the  
Presidential statement is an impression that turns out, it appears, to be 
certainly capable of qualification and I’m simply asking was it every 
qualified or corrected, I don’t want to make a big song and dance about 
it Chair, really. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Can we move on Mr Zuma to 
paragraph 118. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:    Paragraph 118? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, what happened thereafter is 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 83 of 107 
 
that Ms Mentor wanted to lay charges and she says in paragraph 118 
on page 50. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Page 50 – page hundred and? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Paragraph 118 page 50. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It seems you and I are the only 
ones that get on very well in this role Mr Zuma, she wanted to lay 
charges, do you see that, against you and some others. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:    Hm-mmm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  She says she made a statement 
10 
and then at a later stage she requested her statement from the police 
but said that it had been – she was told that it had been sent to 
Pretoria and then they were asked – she was asked to meet with 
representatives of the police.  Let me just get my note, if we could go 
to paragraph 119, I’m afraid Chair there’s a page missing, I don’t know 
how that happened but I worked off a copy where the page was not 
missing so I have my notes, and can we take a short adjournment so I 
can get the page? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, five minutes? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Five minutes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay we’ll just take a five minutes adjournment for 
the page to be found, thank you, we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we able to proceed? 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 84 of 107 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  The pages were all there in the first 
place they were just misplaced. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  So if one looks at the typed page on 
the original – typed number on the original page one will see page 50 
and page 33.  Do you see that Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Then the next page is page 34 but 
10 
page 49 read. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  And then the next page is page 51 
paragraph 35 typed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So is the – is the red numbering that is wrong? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Red numbering is wrong but the 
page numbering typed on the original page is correct.  Are you with us 
Mr Zuma? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Just [microphone off]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At page 50, can you see page 50 the red 50. 
20 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  The red 50 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja below it you have got a black 33 – the red 50 
below it there is a black 33.  Can you see the number in the middle of 
the page 33? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Ja 33. 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 85 of 107 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  On page 50. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  I have got there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  And then 50. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja if you go to the next page. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The red page number says 49 instead of 51. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It should say 51 but it says 49. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if you look at the black number in the middle of 
the page it is 34. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  34 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the black numbers are correct but the red ones 
there seems to have been a problem. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay.  Thank you. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  So Mr Zuma all we need for now if 
you would look at the black numbering is pages 33 and34 we need not 
20 
worry for the moment about the rest. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  So basically if one looks at 
paragraph 118 on page red 50.  You have that? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Hm. 159? 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 86 of 107 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  18. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  118? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  118. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  118 yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Do you have that? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  On that page and in that paragraph 
Ms Mentor says or said that she went to lay charges against yourself 
and some ministers of cabinet and certain board members of certain 
state owned enterprises.  She did that in Cape Town.  Then in 
10 
paragraph 119 she says she subsequently requested the statement from 
the police but was told it was with the Hawks.  And that was in Pretoria.  
In paragraph 120 she said and I will read it: 
“A member of the Hawks Advocate Mtolo along with 
another member of the Hawks whose name I do not 
recall then came to my house with a typed version of 
the statement.  Advocate Mtolo advised me that the 
reason for the delay was that I had complained about 
President 
Zuma 
and 
that 
their 
hands 
were 
consequently tied.  They could not proceed with my 
20 
complaint while the President was names in my 
complaint.” 
She continues to say Mr Zuma: 
“After much deliberation I agreed to remove Mr 
Zuma’s name from the affidavit in the hopes that the 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 87 of 107 
 
Hawks would investigate my complaints.  As far as I 
am aware the Hawks do not seem to be actively 
investigating the matter and there does not seem to 
have been any progress in this regard.” 
A few matters arising from that paragraph against that background Mr 
Zuma was it ever reported to you by anyone that a complaint had been 
laid against you and a charge had been raised by Ms Mentor? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Nothing. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Never com. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Nothing yes.   
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  The conduct reported here that a 
complainant had been advised by a member of the Hawks to exclude 
the President’s name – any President for that matter.  How do you 
regard such conduct? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Well I know nothing about this 
matter. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Is such conduct acceptable though, 
that is what I am saying?  Had you known about it or had you been told 
about it would you have responded in any way? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I think I missed the question.  Just repeat 
20 
the question. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Ja I am just asking if he has any 
view of the allegation made by Ms Mentor.  You are free to comment. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  No I… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  I am inviting a comment or you need 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 88 of 107 
 
not comment if you wish. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No I have got no idea what is 
happening here. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Right.  Well if I can just clarify.  
What the Hawks said was that they could not proceed with the 
complaint – they do not say they were told or given orders by anyone.  
They simply say that as long as your name appeared in the charge 
sheet or in the charge laid rather they could not proceed with it.  That 
is what they say.  Do you have any comment on what they said? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Well it is difficult to have a 
10 
comment because I do not know why even that statement was made. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Right. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  I do not know what caused them 
to make such a statement whatever. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Well clearly they believed that they 
could not proceed with the complaint. If this is to be believed and I 
qualify on that basis.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me just hear the full question first. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think Mr Masuku wants to say something but let me 
20 
hear the full question first. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  The question is simply do you have 
the – I am inviting you to make a comment if you wish to make a 
comment on the allegation that a member of the Hawks told a 
complainant that because your name appeared in the complaint they 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 89 of 107 
 
could not proceed with the complaint.  That is all I am saying and I am 
inviting you to comment if you wish. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No let me not comment because 
I do not know what was the cause of that. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  The matter proceeded at – not in 
any respect that needs to be dealt with … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I think Mr Masuku wants to either give you 
something or address me. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  Chair the  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  I understand the question to be that the 
Hawks said something about this matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  But this is not an affidavit from the Hawks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  This is Mr – this is an affidavit from Ms 
Mentor. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Mentor. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  Ms Mentor.  It must be made clear that it is 
Ms Mentor who says this is what they said.  Not – the impression must 
20 
not be given that the Hawks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU:  Are themselves saying this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  I thought I had made that clear but I 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 90 of 107 
 
hear what my learned friend says. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  But I am… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well do you want to just put that beyond doubt?  I am 
not sure … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Well Chair I recall saying at a stage 
if the statement of Ms Mentor is to be believed at all.  She alleges that 
Advocate Mtolo advised me that the reason for the delay was that I had 
complained 
about 
President 
Zuma 
and 
that 
their hands were 
consequently tied.  So if there has been mis – any misunderstanding it 
10 
can be clarified on that basis.  I am not sure if affects the gravamen of 
the question but the point as Ms Mentor said and if she is to be 
believed I repeat she says that Advocate Mtolo of the Hawks advised 
that the reason for the delay in processing the complaint was that you 
had been mentioned.  I invited you to comment and you have given your 
answer.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I think the answer was that you could not comment Mr 
Zuma is that correct? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.   
20 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  As I understand it you have had an 
opportunity to examine the statement.   
ADV DANIEL MANTSHA:  Sorry Chairperson I just want to put certain 
point here.   
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 91 of 107 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
ADV DANIEL MANTSHA:  I was before the commission… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Mantsha.  Can I ask the leader of the 
legal team to assist?  Normally you have the leader of the team 
addressing the Chair and if she – if he is going to arrange for 
somebody else to address then it is – arrangements are made.  I do not 
know – Mr Sikhakhane are you able to?  Okay thank you.   
ADV DANIEL MANTSHA:  I think it will be fair to put to the witness that 
Mr Mtolo has applied to cross-examine that witness.  Meaning that the 
statement which is attributed to him are in dispute by him.  So it is not 
10 
fair if there is a version already of Mr Mtolo that it is also not put to the 
witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well.. 
ADV MUZI SIKHAKHANE:  That is the point I want to make. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Mantsha we cannot allow … – Mr Sikhakhane can 
you address me?  Thank you Mr Mantsha.   
ADV MUZI SIKHAKHANE:  Chair I think – I think he should proceed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MUZI SIKHAKHANE:  And I will deal with … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay you will – you will – okay thank you. 
20 
ADV MUZI SIKHAKHANE:  I think the point is made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.  Proceed Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Yes.  Mr Zuma in fairness to 
yourself once again we can open a channel of communication of some 
order here.  Your legal representative and I stress the singular will 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 92 of 107 
 
have an opportunity to re-examine you as a matter of right.  And if 
anything needs to be clarified or if you ever think of anything by way of 
explanation that opportunity will be available.  But for the moment if 
you want to take a moment to read you have been informed that 
Advocate Mtolo has a different version but what I am putting to you 
here is the statement of Ms Mentor not Advocate Mtolo that is what she 
says.  And you have given your answer. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  So at least we are on the same page 
I think.   
10 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Thank you.  The matter then came 
before the Public Protector and I know in your opening you have made 
some submissions or statements concerning the Public Protector 
process and so if you wish to comment on any of the paragraphs 
following paragraph 124 on page red 51 please feel free to do so.  If 
you need time to look at them that is in order. I know it is a matter of 
some – that to which you paid some attention thus far in these 
proceedings.  I do not intend to ask you any questions in relation to the 
latter part of the statement.   
20 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  But if you wish to comment you free 
to do so. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  May we then… 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 93 of 107 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if you are moving away from that statement Mr 
Pretorius I have got some questions.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With regard to Ms Mentor’s statement – evidence that 
she was at one stage in – at the residence of the Gupta’s when either 
Mr Ajay Gupta or one of the Gupta brothers offered her the job of 
Minister of Public Enterprises and she says you entered the room when 
she was getting I think she says confrontational because she took 
objection to somebody other than the President offering her the job of a 
Minister.  She says that when you entered the room she rose – she 
10 
stood up and she says as is customary as is protocol when the 
President comes in she says Mr Gupta just continued sitting down.  She 
says you spoke to her, asked her to come down because she was 
agitated because of this offer that was made to her by somebody other 
than the President and she says you asked her to come down and when 
she indicated that she wanted to leave because she did not want to 
miss her flight she says you walked her to the car outside and you even 
carried her bag and walked with her. She says when you came to the 
car you said your goodbyes and – and I think you said something like 
we will see each other Ntombazane I think she says you used that 
20 
word, Zulu word Ntombazane and she said you were – you were calm, 
you tried to calm her. She says she told you about what Mr Gupta had 
said to her but she says you were concerned about calming her down 
and you walked her to the car and you helped her with her bag.  You 
have no recollection whatsoever of any incident like that? 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 94 of 107 
 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No recollection at all.  Nothing 
absolutely nothing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and is it – it is not possible that it could have 
happened?  It is not a question of you do not remember but maybe did 
happen.  Are you positive it never happened? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Never, never. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. And – and you said you have – you also do not 
remember that she had been trying to meet with you for some time on 
10 
some issue that related to the Portfolio Committee in which she was 
involved before – before this incident? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  I do not remember that either. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Members of Parliament there is 
a person in Parliament who is responsible for the matters of the 
President and Deputy President.  Anyone if you have difficulties to find 
the President or the Deputy President will go to that person who works 
with the President and that is the person who arranges meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And that is the person through whom she would 
20 
have had to go 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To go in order to arrange for a meeting? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 95 of 107 
 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Absolutely that what – would 
have happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  You – you  might not be able to say but do you 
by any chance know why if indeed this did not happen why Ms Mentor 
would say it happened and gave – and give the kinds of details that she 
has given? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  I do not know why. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not know? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course in this commission the investigation has not 
been finalised as far as I know to establish whether the airlines have 
got a record of her flying to Johannesburg on the dates that she had 
given.  So we are waiting to see whether there is such a record of her 
having come to Johannesburg then. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I just thought it is important that I get a 
categorical answer. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Okay. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  And then I would like to take you back to Mr 
Maseko.  You do not have to go to the statement.  When everything is 
done I have to make certain findings on evidence that I have heard.  
And it is important therefore that I should get clarification and get 
perspectives from different people.  Mr Maseko has come to the 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 96 of 107 
 
commission and said he had been CEO of GCIS and he had performed 
his duties very well.  No-one in terms of his seniors had complained 
about him not doing his work properly and he says – he said Minister 
Chabane actually said that he was a very good I think civil servant 
might be the name – the word that was used – the term that was used.  
He said he was very happy with his work and he says he never asked to 
be removed from the position of CEO of GCIS and to be transferred to 
Director 
General 
of 
the 
Department 
of 
Public 
Services 
and 
Administration.  And he says the only reason why he was – as far as he 
knows he was removed is what he was told by Minister Chabane.  
10 
Namely that you had called and said Mr Maseko needed to be 
redeployed or his services terminated.  And actually if I recall correctly 
he said Minister Chabane told him that by the time you arrived back in 
the country Ms Maseko should no longer be at GCIS.  And he says he 
believes that he was removed from this position at GCIS of CEO 
because he did not cooperate with the Gupta’s.  Now part of this has 
been – you have been given a chance to comment of [indistinct] but I 
think I wanted to give you a full picture and enable you to see whether 
you have anything to add to what you had said. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No I have nothing to add. 
20 
Absolutely nothing.  Because DG’s deal with Ministers not the 
President.  There is no President who can say I do not like this DG.  
Not working with me.   Unless you talk about the DG at the President – 
at the President’s office.  No reason why I should look at the DG down 
there and say I do not want - take it – take him out.  It can never 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 97 of 107 
 
happen.  It is Ministers who deal with the DG”s.  If there would have 
been any discussion there will be discussion if the Minister is reporting 
to the President and says this is what I wish should happen.  In other 
words presenting the matter so that the matter is going to be 
discussed.  It never goes this way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But is your evidence that this is what normally 
happens – this is what normally happens in terms of the removal of 
DG’s and you cannot specifically remember the circumstances under 
which Mr Maseko was removed or is the position that you have a clear 
recollection that the circumstances under which he was removed 
10 
involved Minister Chabane asking you if you could transfer him to the 
Department of Public Services and Administration. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No that is what happens.  
Ministers if they have got whatever view about their accounting officers 
they make – they have the case whatever it is they then consult with 
the President.  It has never started from the President because the 
President is not working with the person. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He said also that as I understand his evidence I hope 
I am not misrepresenting him.  As I understood his evidence he said – 
or suggested that his removal was done very urgently.  Was effected 
20 
very urgently, very quickly because of what he said Minister Chabane 
told him that you – by the time you arrive back he should not be in that 
position.  And he says it was so urgent that Minister Baloyi who was 
Minister of Public Service and Administration at the time had not been 
consulted about him – that is Ms Maseko being taken to his department 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 98 of 107 
 
to be DG.  He says Minister Baloyi had for the first time from him that 
he was going to be his new DG.  You do not know anything about that? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No nothing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  It does not work like that really. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  I do not think you could have a 
Minister of Public Administration not knowing and then just people 
saying here is a person.  Because Ministers if for an example there is 
to be a shift Ministers discuss among themselves. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Because… 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  And they come to say when the 
– they have got an agreement to say no this is what we are doing.  
Seeking endorsement therefore from the cabinet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he said that as a result of the way in which he 
had been placed in the Department of Public Service and Administration 
Minister Baloyi was not happy and their relationship did not become 
good and he resigned before his term could come to an end.  So I am 
just giving you the full picture.  That is the – that is what he say – he is 
saying – he says I had no reason to leave GCIS I did not ask to be 
20 
transferred to the Department of Public Service and Administration.  My 
Minister was happy with my performance and I was transferred to the 
Department of Public Services and Administration in circumstances 
where the Minister of that department was not consulted.  He was not 
happy that I had been imposed on him.  Our relationship was not good.  
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 99 of 107 
 
I resigned before the expiry of my term.  You might not have anything 
further to add but I am just giving you a full picture of what his 
evidence is. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No I have nothing to add really. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  I have nothing to add. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Zuma you did 
10 
mention that you were suffering from the flu is it okay to continue still? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Ja we can continue. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:    Good.  May we go to bundle B I 
would like to deal with the statement of Barbara Hogan.  It is in bundle 
B. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Bundle B. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  GG[b] Exhibit GG[b].  You will find 
the statement at the beginning of that bundle under Tab 5.   
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Hm. It is there okay.  I thought 
it was called bundle B.  Oh ja.  Here it is.   
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Do you have that bundle before you 
and that statement? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  And can I take you please to the 
second statement because there is short statement which I am not 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 100 of 107 
 
going to deal with but a longer statement which forms the subject 
matter of evidence.  It appears at page 399 in the red markings.   
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  399. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Yes.   
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the actual statement starts at 400 is it not? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Ja it starts at 400. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The actual statement Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Yes the contents page is page 399 
and the substantive part of the statement is at page 400.  If I am – in 
10 
the – I will come back to the paragraph headed the Purpose of the 
Statement at the end. These are really conclusions that we may deal 
with at the end of the statement. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But for the moment can we turn 
to page 403?  One of the topics that has been dealt with by a number of 
witnesses Mr Zuma in this Commission thus far is the manner in which 
State Owned Entities Board Members are appointed and the manner in 
which Chief Executive Officers, Chief Financial Officers and perhaps 
other Senior Executives are appointed and perhaps you can help us 
20 
with the knowledge and experience you have in regard to appointments 
of SOE Board Members and SOE Senior Executives and the 
relationship between the manner in which those appointments take 
place and what we have learnt is the policy of deployment and if I may I 
would like to ask you some questions about that in relation to what 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 101 of 107 
 
Ms Hogan says in particular.  If I can read paragraph 18 of her 
statement.  She says: 
“A general illustration of the appointment process of 
a CEO and/or a Board Member during my tenure as 
Minister of the DPE …” 
That is the Department of Public Enterprises. 
“…was that, under the direction of the Director 
General 
of 
DPE, 
the 
DPE 
would 
conduct 
professional searches, head hunt candidates, follow 
up on recommendations by industry experts or, in 
10 
some cases, recommendations by the Board.” 
A Deputy Minister at the time Mr Zuma as you would know 
was Mr Godongwana.  She says that: 
“Mr Godongwana and I would constantly engage on 
these issues and the DG would draw on the skills 
and expertise of specialist sectoral units within the 
DPE with respect to suitable candidates.” 
She then goes on before I ask you to comment please 
Mr Zuma in paragraph 19 to say: 
“Once I had approved of the compilation of a Board, 
20 
I would send a Cabinet decision memorandum to the 
Economic Sub-Committee of Cabinet for approval, 
and then to the Cabinet for final approval.  A 
Minister may make a special appeal to the 
President to bypass the Sub-Committee process 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 102 of 107 
 
and proceed straight to Cabinet for final approval of 
matters that are urgent.” 
She goes into more detail later which we can do before you 
answer if you wish but do you have any comment on the general 
process that Ms Hogan says was followed under her tenure as Minister? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No.  I think the – the process as 
described here that is how it is. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That is how it is? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And when you say how it is, is 
10 
that for the time during which you were President or including before 
and after? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Even before and there is one – 
there is one system that works. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  One system? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In paragraph 20 she says: 
“Sub-Committees of Cabinet meet every second 
week and Cabinet meets in the week following the 
Sub-Committee meeting.  The President chairs 
20 
Cabinet meetings and approves the agenda drawn 
up by the Cabinet Secretariat, so he has a decisive 
role on what goes onto the agenda.” 
That mentions the President in particular.  Do you have any comment 
about the process there outlined? 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 103 of 107 
 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  It is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It is correct.  Then she continues 
again in paragraph 20: 
“As part of the Cabinet collective, Ministers do, 
however, tend to involve Cabinet in the exercise of 
their powers to appoint the CEO, both as the 
Executive Authority in terms of the Public Finance 
Management 
Act 
and 
as 
the 
shareholder 
representative on behalf of the State.” 
And do you have any comment in regard to that qualification 
10 
to the procedure that she raises? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  No comment. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  She then says in paragraph 21: 
“The Department of Public Enterprises conducted 
an 
assessment 
of 
the 
extent 
of 
Cabinet’s 
involvement in order to establish the trend and the 
nature of its involvement.” 
She then speaks of a review.  She says: 
“To this end, a review was conducted of previous 
decisions of Cabinet spanning from April 2002 to 
20 
February 2009 relating to appointments of CEOs of 
a variety of SOEs.  The results showed that 
Cabinet’s involvement varied between approval (ten 
times), concurrence (six times) and noting (twice) 
of the relevant Minister’s decision, indicating that 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 104 of 107 
 
every CEO appointment is dealt with on a case by 
case basis having considered the size, importance 
and circumstances facing the SOE at the time of 
making the appointment.” 
 
Perhaps in fairness to you I should ask an introductory 
question.  Do you know anything of that survey? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Which survey? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  She refers to a survey or a 
review more accurately.  She said: 
“There 
was 
a 
review 
conducted 
of 
previous 
10 
decisions of Cabinet spanning the period April 2002 
to February 2009.” 
Do you know anything of such a review? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Review of the SOEs? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Appointment – well it is a 
review of previous decisions of Cabinet.  In other words what was 
reviewed were the decisions of Cabinet relating to the appointment of 
CEOs of a variety of State Owned Entities.  So it is a review of Cabinet 
decisions but those decisions of Cabinet related to appointments of 
CEOs of SOEs. 
20 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  They would – I mean the review 
of decisions not a particular decision. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No not of a particular decision. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It just – it appears that the 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 105 of 107 
 
review was (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  May – maybe Mr Pretorius – maybe – maybe let me 
put it this way.  I think I understand what you – you want to put to him.  
It looks like what Ms Hogan is talking about is that there was a review 
of how decisions to appoint CEOs of SOES had been taken by Cabinet 
over a certain period of years and it looks like she is saying that was a 
review of how those decisions were taken during the period April 2002 
to February 2009. 
Do you know anything about such a review to see how 
Cabinet had been making those decisions between that period – 2002 
10 
to 2009? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  I – I do not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not know anything about it? 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  I do not recall it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  For now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR JACOB GEDLEYIHLEKISA ZUMA:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It might have been a departmental review that might 
not have involved maybe the Cabinet Mr Pretorius. 
20 
ADV MUZI SIKHAKANE:  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MUZI SIKHAKANE:  I am about to overrule my own client.  I think 
it is – I would like us to adjourn for the day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 106 of 107 
 
ADV MUZI SIKHAKANE:  It is with your … 
CHAIRPERSON:  How much time? 
ADV MUZI SIKHAKANE:  If he is not – no for the day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh for the day? 
ADV MUZI SIKHAKANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MUZI SIKHAKANE:  If it is fine with the Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No. 
ADV MUZI SIKHAKANE:  I am overruling the former President. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We can adjourn.  You overruling the former 
10 
President? 
ADV MUZI SIKHAKANE:  It is the only time I will ever have to do this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius any problem? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I have no objection.  It has been 
a strenuous day … 
CHAIRPERSON:  A long day, yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Far from me to judge it seems 
that … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It would be appropriate … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  To take a break. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Well I must also say earlier on I had given 
16 JULY 2019 – DAY 134 
 
Page 107 of 107 
 
instructions that the air conditioner should be put on.  It was quite hot.  
I do not feel like it is on now.  I do not know whether that instruction 
was not carried out or whether it is just that the house if fuller than 
normal.  Alright.  We – we will adjourn for the day and we will start at 
10 tomorrow morning.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.
