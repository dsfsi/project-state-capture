PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 25 AUGUST 2020 
CHAIRPERSON: Good morning Mr Myburgh, good morning 
everybody. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Good morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Chairperson the purpose of todays’ 
sitting at least originally in relation to CRRC was to hear 
evidence from them pursuant to you having granted their 
Rule 3.4 application. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  There has since been… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think your voice is soft or low. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I will speak up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is much better ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  There has since been an exchange of 
correspondence between the commission and CRRC.  I will 
take you through that if necessary.  But it has culminated 
that correspondence in CRRC confirming yesterday that 
20 
they are not in a position to attend the proceedings today 
but that in any event they do not intend to adduce oral 
evidence and that they will stand by the statement that 
they submitted in support of their Rule 3.3.6 and 3.4 
Application. 
 
Perhaps 
I 
could 
just 
hand 
up 
the 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 4 of 76 
 
correspondence to you? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  They sought – they had applied for 
Leave to Adduce Evidence in relation to the Transnet 
matters relating to the locomotives hey? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You will see that I have flagged with 
a yellow flag where the correspondence starts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Initially on the 28 July they advised 
10 
that because of the Covid-19 pandemic their senior people 
would not be able to travel from China. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then they went on in paragraph 4 
to say they want to avail themselves of their rights in terms 
of Rule 3.9 to apply for leave to make legal submissions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And they said they would do that 
before the 25 August.  If you go to the next letter on the 7 
August, they then reaffirm their position. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And what then happened on the 18 
August the Chairperson you will see the next letter this 
essentially purports to be a set of Rule 3.9 submissions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 5 of 76 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  In support of the statement and 
annexures that had already been filed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You will see if you go to the next 
letter that yesterday the – under the hand of the Acting 
Secretary of the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  They were advised that they would 
still be required to appear today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And they would be required  
1. To place on record that they no longer intend to 
adduce oral evidence at the commission pursuant to 
their Rule 3.3.6 read with 3.4 application granted on 
the 25 March and 
2. That they would seek leave from you Chairperson to 
no longer adduce oral evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  That then takes us to the last letter 
that 
we 
received 
in 
response 
where 
they 
record 
in 
20 
paragraph 1 at the end that they no longer wish to adduce 
oral evidence at the commission.  At paragraph 2 they say 
that they not in a position to arrange a legal representation 
today at short notice.  But it is really paragraphing 3, 4 and 
5 Chairperson that are important and I will read them into 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 6 of 76 
 
the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Paragraph 3: 
“As regards the matter of adducing oral 
evidence 
before 
– 
at 
commission 
we 
reiterate 
that 
based 
on 
the 
advice 
of 
counsel sought earlier in this regard we 
have come to the considered decision not to 
adduce evidence orally over and above the 
statement dated 12 July 2019 and related 
10 
annexures filed with the commission and 
resubmitted with a covering letter dated 18 
August 2020 to the commission. 
4. 
“Accordingly, 
we 
humbly 
request 
the 
Chairperson to record this accordingly.” 
5. 
“We trust that the Chairperson will grant our 
request accordingly at tomorrow’s hearing.” 
So what seems clear then is that they have abandoned the 
20 
application to adduce oral evidence.  What they seem to 
want to do is to rely on the statement and the Rule 3.9 
submissions.  That is something I suppose the status of 
those things would have to be dealt with and grappled with 
in time.  But as of now it seems clear that their request is 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 7 of 76 
 
to no longer adduce oral evidence and for you to permit 
that Chairperson.   
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine.  I see that they make 
their approach much earlier than I thought they had 
sometime – oh 28 July.  I think that – that is fine.  I grant 
them leave not to adduce evidence – oral evidence but the 
proviso that I would make is that that would not preclude 
the commission should the commission consider that there 
are aspects in respect of which it might wish to have oral 
evidence from one or more of – of their personnel to 
10 
approach them for that purpose.  Obviously to the extent 
that such people might be out of our jurisdiction that would 
be one thing but it may well be that their attitude might be 
that they would cooperate if the commission would like to 
question some of their personnel.  But for now, I grant the 
leave requested on that understanding. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  And you are excused. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chairperson we were scheduled to hear 
evidence of four witnesses.  The witnesses are coming 
under a subpoena and one of the witness’ is Mr Fuzile 
Thomas Jotina.  He is represented by Mr Kevin Hyde and 
Mr Kevin Hyde would like to make some presentations and 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 8 of 76 
 
bring some – something to the attention of the commission.  
Mr Hyde is here too. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Well somebody must just sanitise 
before Mr Hyde comes to the podium.  Good morning.   
ADV HYDE:  On behalf – sorry on behalf of Mr Thomas 
Jotina. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HYDE:  He has indicated that if he was to give 
evidence, he would prefer to actually give evidence in 
Sotho. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HYDE:  Unfortunately, it appears that there is no 
Sotho interpreter available today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HYDE:  However as discussed in order to move the 
process forward my client is happy to provide a statement 
in response. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HYDE:  To the allegations made by the witness Dube. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV HYDE:  And that I will work with him to prepare that 
statement and make it available to the commission by close 
of business this Friday which is I think the 28 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HYDE:  In addition he will then be available on short 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 9 of 76 
 
notice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HYDE:  By arrangement with my colleagues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HYDE:  To appear to answer any specific… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HYDE:  Questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HYDE:  Should that prove necessary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay no that is fine.  So what we 
10 
will do then is we will adjourn the hearing of his evidence 
and I approve the arrangement you have made with Mr 
Notshe namely that by close of business on Friday this 
week he will furnish the commission with his statement or 
affidavit preferably an affidavit or affirm declaration and 
after that depending on the content of the affidavit or 
declaration then it may be necessary for him to come and 
give oral evidence.  So he is excused today on that 
understanding on the understanding that he will be notified 
as to the date when he should come back. 
20 
ADV HYDE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair the next witness to testify is Ms 
Bongiwe Eves Dube and Ms Dube gave her statement and 
she is here. 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 10 of 76 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe you should first just give for 
the 
benefit 
of 
those 
who 
are 
watching 
or 
listening 
announce what todays’ evidence – to which work stream it 
relates and what it is about and its connection with other 
witness’ evidence. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  Chair the evidence today is the 
evidence of – relating to BOSASA – BOSASA activities.  
And the evidence of Mr Agrizzi was to the effect that 
BOSASA gave some presents in the form of meat, drinks 
and – to one of the people Ms Mokonyane and other 
10 
people.  And one of the people who were involved in the 
BOSASA who was responsible to arrange that was Ms 
Dube.  And Ms Dube was arranging those deliveries and 
you have just heard the evidence of a witness Mr Jotina 
who was – who has been excused from testifying. Mr Jotina 
is one of the drivers that Ms Dube says he did deliveries.  
So the evidence of Ms Dube is in relation to the deliveries 
that were made by BOSASA to people including Ms 
Mokonyane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You witnesses for today are Ms Dube, Mr 
20 
Coetzee, Ms S Thomas an F T Jotina is it not? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  The evidence that will be led 
today relates to BOSASA. Ms Dube will give evidence that 
will relate to allegations made by Mr Agrizzi in his 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 11 of 76 
 
evidence to the effect that certain items including grocery 
items were delivered to Ms Nomvula Mokonyane.  She will 
give evidence of what she knows about that.  The – Mr 
Jotina who was going to give evidence is said to have been 
a driver at BOSASA and according to Ms Dube he made 
some deliveries – he is not going to testify today.  His 
statement will be filed on Friday and arrangements will be 
made for him to testify in due course.  Mr F H Coetzee will 
be called today.  He is the owner of a certain guest house.  
His evidence will relate to the evidence given by Mr 
10 
Agrizzi.  Mr Agrizzi testified that – or deposed to an 
affidavit and testified – or deposed to an affidavit that 
BOSASA organised and paid for the 50 t h birthday party for 
Ms Nomvula Mokonyane at the particular guest house and 
he 
said 
that 
he 
attended 
that 
party 
and 
he 
was 
coordinating arrangements for that party.  Since then the 
commission’s investigators have been able to speak to – or 
interview and obtain an affidavit from the owner of the 
guest house Mr Coetzee.  He will give evidence with regard 
to what party if any was held in that guest house relating 
20 
to Ms Nomvula Mokonyane.  The other witness is Ms S 
Thomas.  She used to be the PA to Ms Nomvula Mokonyane 
and she will give evidence with regard to what she may 
know about interactions between BOSASA and Ms Nomvula 
Mokonyane.  Ja.

CHAIRPERSON:  Ja well do not say Bundle 1 because I am 
sure there is Bundle 1 somewhere.  I think you – it is

me and asked me there is such a delivery which is here but 
I – we understand you are closed so where is it going?

institutions. 
MS DUBE:    Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How – how were orders treated?  Were 
they labelled and given names or the people working in the 
kitchen always knew that this order is for Ms Nomvula 
Mokonyane, this one is for Baragwaneth, this one is for 
another institution? 
MS DUBE:  No they were not labelled. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They were not labelled? 
MS DUBE:  Huh-ah it was just like if she know that there 
10 
will be such a thing that will happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS DUBE:  In such a place that is when you know that this 
is going there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  Continue Mr Notshe. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now just going back to the delivery.  
The incident in 2016 when you say you were phoned by the 
Food Boys and you were closed.  Did you call Ms Matabata 
about the – the order that you – you were asked about but 
the Food Boys? 
20 
MS DUBE:  She did – yes I did call and she said it is 
organised. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I see.  And then in the – in your 
statement you also say there was a large order of meat and 
then you give an estimation.  How did you arrive at the 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 24 of 76 
 
estimation of the amount? 
MS DUBE:  It is according to the people from Food Boys 
when they call me to ask… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let us deal with it this way.  Did you 
ever see the order for Ms Nomvula Mokonyane? 
MS DUBE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You never saw it? 
MS DUBE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You only heard about it and from whom 
did you hear about it? 
10 
MS DUBE:  I heard it from when the Food Boys people 
called me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who are Food Boys? 
MS DUBE:  It was the company for meat. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that what it was called?  Is that what 
the company was called Food Boys? 
MS DUBE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that is the name of the company? 
MS DUBE:  The Company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What were – what was – what – were 
20 
they providing meat to BOSASA or what was the… 
MS DUBE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What were they doing? 
MS DUBE:  Yes that is where I was ordering my meat from. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So part of your job was to order meat 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 25 of 76 
 
from Food Boys – part of your job? 
MS DUBE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was to order meat from the Food Boys? 
MS DUBE:  Yes to order meat and everything almost to 
what we were using for catering. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS DUBE:  Yes even though it was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But Food Boys only provided meat or 
they also provided other things – other items? 
MS DUBE:  No they were only – they were only providing 
10 
meat. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so your duties included ordering 
whatever the kitchen needed? 
MS DUBE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Including meat?  Do you order meat only 
from Food Boys or did you also order it from some other 
place? 
MS DUBE:   There were some other places which we were 
ordering from. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So just go back to how you came to 
20 
hear about an order for Ms Nomvula Mokonyane.  Just tell 
me the story as it happened. 
MS DUBE:   How I find out about it, is the time when I was 
asking 
that 
in 
such 
a 
delivery 
like 
we 
are 
closed 
...[intervenes]  
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 26 of 76 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m? 
MS DUBE:   ...there is a delivery which is supposed to come 
here and these people were asking:  What is it for?  And 
what must I do about it?  And then that is where I found out 
it is for Ms Nomvula Mokonyane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I am sorry.   
MS DUBE:   I must not worry about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Did you call the Food Boys for some 
reason and then they told about this order? 
MS DUBE:   The Food Boys called me. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  They called you? 
MS DUBE:   Because they wanted to know since I am closed 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Since you are? 
MS DUBE:   I am... the head office was closed by that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, was closed? 
MS DUBE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For the Christmas break? 
MS DUBE:   For the Christmas break. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MS DUBE:   So they called me to ask me:  There is such a 
big order here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They said there is a big order? 
MS DUBE:   There is such a big order here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 27 of 76 
 
MS DUBE:   Done by Catherine Mathabathe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS DUBE:   But you are closed.  Where is it going to? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS DUBE:   Then I said to them:  I have got no clue but I 
know we are closed.  Let me confirm.  And that is when I find 
out is:  No, I must not worry about it.  It is for Nomvula 
Mokonyane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you did not ask whose order it was? 
MS DUBE:   They told me the order is for Catherine 
10 
Mathabathe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS DUBE:   But for BOSASA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS DUBE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But then they told you:  Do not worry.  It is 
from Ms Nomvula Mokonyane. 
MS DUBE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair, can I...? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Can we come and just clarify before we 
get there? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  H’m. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   You say the Food Boys said there is a 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 28 of 76 
 
big order there for Catherine, alright? 
MS DUBE:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then you phoned Catherine to ask:  
What is going on about the order? 
MS DUBE:   And then Catherine explained to me that I must 
not worry about it. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Just hold on. 
MS DUBE:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes.  Just... just. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the Food Boys are not the ones who 
10 
told you that the order was for Ms Nomvula Mokonyane? 
MS DUBE:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They told you there was a big order 
...[intervenes]  
MS DUBE:   There is a big order for me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they wanted to find out what should be 
done with it because the office was closed? 
MS DUBE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you phoned Ms Mathabathe and 
she said:  Do not worry.  It is for Ms Nomvula Mokonyane. 
20 
MS DUBE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And... okay take it from there. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then you... you then say Ms 
Mathabathe said you should not worry about it.  She will deal 
with it. 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 29 of 76 
 
MS DUBE:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now in your statement you say the same 
occurred the following year in December 2017.  What... when 
you say that what do you mean?  You say the same occurred 
in 2017.  What occurred in December 2017? 
MS DUBE:   The 2017... like, 2016 I was new. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
MS DUBE:   2017, it did not come straight to me again 
because like I was, you know, if you deal with something 
from before, it was not easy that I have been jumped and 
10 
take over the order. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Look this side Ms Dube. 
MS DUBE:   It was not easy to take over the order for that or 
say okay that next year the next 2017, still the order was not 
done by me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, let us... the evidence you gave 
earlier on when you say the Food Boys called you, which 
year was that? 
MS DUBE:   It was 2017.   
CHAIRPERSON:  It was 2017? 
20 
MS DUBE:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And after Ms Mathabathe had 
spoken to you and said:  Do not worry.  That order is for Ms 
Nomvula Mokonyane.  Do you know what happened about 
that order? 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 30 of 76 
 
MS DUBE:   Obviously, it was delivered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m? 
MS DUBE:   It was delivered to her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why do you say obviously? 
MS DUBE:   Because if it was ordered it has to go for 
delivery. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you do not know that, is it?  Do you 
know that? 
MS DUBE:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not know that? 
10 
MS DUBE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You just assume it was delivered? 
MS DUBE:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that correct? 
MS DUBE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  But you never had anything to do 
with it after Ms Mathabathe had spoken to you? 
MS DUBE:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you did not see it... you did not see 
the actual parcel?  You did not see anybody delivering it?  Is 
20 
that right? 
MS DUBE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Do you have any understanding as 
to who would normally make deliveries to people of orders 
for meat and other things? 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 31 of 76 
 
MS DUBE:   As I say that we are having the drivers at head 
office which were doing the deliveries. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m? 
MS DUBE:   As I was saying that the deliveries were done by 
our drivers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Were there a number of drivers? 
MS DUBE:   For head office the driver we had was Thomas 
Jotina. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
MS DUBE:   Thomas Jotina. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was the only one driver? 
MS DUBE:   There were some but the one that was working 
for head office was him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who was working for? 
MS DUBE:   For head office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For head office? 
MS DUBE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was only one? 
MS DUBE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For head office? 
20 
MS DUBE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That Mr Jotina? 
MS DUBE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Sorry, Chair.  Can I just ask...? 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 32 of 76 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Ms Dube, just settled.  Do not move up 
and down. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, do not move.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Your voice is moving up and down. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, sit still.  Ja.  Sit still.  Okay Mr Notshe. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now when did you start at the head 
office? 
MS DUBE:   2013. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   2013.  And then when did you start 
10 
dealing with all the Food Boys? 
MS DUBE:   I started when I was at head office. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   In 2013? 
MS DUBE:   No, in 2016 when I joined head office. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see.  Now after the incident wherein 
the Food Boys called you about the large parcel, did you 
ever call you again? 
MS DUBE:   No. 
ADV 
NOTSHE 
SC:   
So 
you do 
not 
know whether 
...[intervenes]  
20 
MS DUBE:   This... it was 2017/2017, I did not finish up... I 
did not... there was no more Christmas there.  There was 
nothing like that. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see.  So the only incident that they call 
you was that one incident when they said there was a large 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 33 of 76 
 
order. 
MS DUBE:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And it is for Ms Catherine. 
MS DUBE:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now did you... were you ever involved in 
other issues like birthdays of people? 
MS DUBE:   We only attended the... we only did the birthday 
once for Jacob Zuma. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Who gave you instructions to do that? 
MS DUBE:   We were instructed by Alice ...[indistinct] 
10 
[00:07:57] 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   What did you do as the stuff for that 
birthday? 
MS DUBE:   We just ordered the cake.  Then we arranged 
some simple things like snacks and all those things. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see.  Now in your statement, you also 
deal with the politicians who attended the BOSASA Head 
Office. 
MS DUBE:   Yes, when they were having their own meetings.  
When they were having meetings, we were catering for them. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And did you delivering... what did you 
cater for them? 
MS DUBE:   No, like we were cooking food.  Like, there is a 
big meeting, then we do food for them, offering them drinks 
and all those things. 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 34 of 76 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Can you remember which politicians you 
saw? 
MS DUBE:   I saw Fikile Mbalula.  I saw Gwede Mantashe.  I 
saw different people. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
You 
say 
that 
was 
during 
election 
campaigns? 
MS DUBE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then you also mention in your 
statement the destruction of documents.  What were... what 
10 
were the documents that were destroyed? 
MS DUBE:   Those documents were just documents.  I 
cannot explain what was it but it was just time of cleaning.  
After Angelo Agrizzi left, there was cleaning of changing(?) 
of things. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see.  And then lastly, you say in your 
statement that you were in the end dismissed by BOSASA. 
MS DUBE:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   So this is the evidence of the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know how... what the monetary 
20 
value was of the order for Ms Nomvula Mokonyane that the 
Food Boys called you about?  Or the price, do you know 
what it was or do you not know? 
MS DUBE:   The price?  They just explained something like 
there is a big order for about 17 000 which we have here. 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 35 of 76 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what they said 
MS DUBE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So it was they said.  You do not know 
about it but that is what they told you? 
MS DUBE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay alright.  The Food Boys, when 
you left BOSASA was that company still there or you do not 
know? 
MS DUBE:   Ja, ja.  I think it is still.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know if it is still there now? 
10 
MS DUBE:   Yes, I hope(?) it is still available(?). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know or you do not know? 
MS DUBE:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:  When last did you...? 
MS DUBE:   If it is belong(?), I will have to speak to them 
because I never ordered from them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS DUBE:   But I know they are still available. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, in 2019, were they still there?  Do you 
know? 
20 
MS DUBE:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you sure? 
MS DUBE:   I am positive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay alright.  Thank you.  Thank you 
for coming to give evidence.  You are excused.   
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 36 of 76 
 
MS DUBE:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may go. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Chair, the next 
witness is Mr Frederick Hendrick Coetzee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [No audible reply]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair, is... as you... as we have 
indicated in the opening address indeed that Mr Coetzee is 
the owner of the guesthouse. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let him get seated first.  Let them finish 
what they are doing.   
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, Mr Notshe. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Mr Coetzee, Chair is the owner of the 
Victorian Guest House and Chair will remember that there 
was the evidence of Mr Agrizzi that there was a party, a 
birthday party held at the Victorian Guest House for the 50t h 
birthday of Ms Mokonyane.   
 
And Chair will remember that Ms Mokonyane testified 
the fact that no birthday party was ever had at that 
guesthouse, neither her 40t h or her 50t h or any other birthday 
20 
party was held at that place. 
 
And now Chair the statement has been obtained from Mr 
Coetzee ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Did she go that far? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes, she went that far Chair. 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 37 of 76 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  To say, no birthday party was held at the 
Victorian Guest House for her? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes, she went that far.  We clarified 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You clarified that? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   We clarified that.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   That it is no 40 t h no 50t h and no birthday 
party. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Mr Coetzee is here to testify. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Please administer the oath or 
affirmation.  Just press it so that... ja. 
REGISTRAR:   Please state your full names for the record. 
WITNESS:   Frederick Hendrick Coetzee. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you have any objection in taking the 
prescribed oath? 
WITNESS:   No, I do not. 
20 
REGISTRAR:   Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
WITNESS:   Yes, I do. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you swear that the evidence you will give, 
will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing else but the 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 38 of 76 
 
truth?  If so, please raise up your right-hand and say, so 
help me God. 
WITNESS:   So help me God. 
FREDERICK HENDRICK COETZEE:  (d.s.s.) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  You may be seated Mr 
Coetzee. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now Mr Coetzee, can you... there is a 
bundle in front of you. 
MR COETZEE:   Ja? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   It is written BOSASA Bundle 1. 
10 
MR COETZEE:   Yes? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Can I ask you to turn to Exhibit 26?  You 
will see there is a tag 26 and then below that, you will see 
underneath that there is Exhibit T26. 
MR COETZEE:   Yes? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   It is written Mr Frederick Hendrick 
Coetzee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Notshe, you forgot to ask me to admit 
Mr Bongiwe Dube’s statement as an exhibit. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes, Chair.  I beg your pardon.  May it 
20 
be permitted as Exhibit T25? 
CHAIRPERSON:  What exhibit? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   T25 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Bongiwe Dube’s affidavit is admitted 
and will be marked EXHIBIT T25. 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 39 of 76 
 
AFFIDAVIT OF MS BONGIWE DUBE IS ADMITTED AND 
MARKED AS EXHIBIT T25 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   In BOSASA Bundle 1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [No audible reply]  
EXAMINATION BY ADV NOTSHE SC:    
Now Mr Coetzee, can you look at the... there is a document, 
an affidavit that appears on... when I talk pages... when I 
refer to pages, I am referring to red pages at the right-hand 
10 
top corner of... it appears on page 1 and up to... the affidavit 
itself, it goes from page 1 to... I just want to... to page 4 of 
that document. 
MR COETZEE:   Yes? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then there is also a signature there.  
Is that your signature? 
MR COETZEE:   Yes, it is. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then that affidavit is accompanied 
by a number of annexures.  The last annexures is at page 
16. 
20 
MR COETZEE:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   You go to this.  Do you confirm that this 
affidavit is your affidavit? 
MR COETZEE:   It is mine. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Together with annexures? 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 40 of 76 
 
MR COETZEE:   It is mine indeed, yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Mr Coetzee, can you just tell the Court 
the... your history as the owner of the Victorian Guest 
House?  When did you become the owner? 
MR COETZEE:   I have been involved with the guest house 
since 2000... early 2000 as co-owner with my mother which 
unfortunately 
and 
subsequently 
passed 
away 
in 
November 2018.  Since then I have been the sole owner up 
to currently. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Can you confirm the address of the... is 
10 
the name, is it Victoria Guest House. 
MR COETZEE:   It is Victoria Guest House. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Can you confirm the address? 
MR COETZEE:   It is A1 Tom Muller Street, West village, 
Krugersdorp.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes.  Now there is evidence of Mr 
Agrizzi that he coordinated a birthday party, the 50t h birthday 
party “Break the Leg” at the Victoria Guest House situated at 
that address. 
MR COETZEE:   H’m. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Do you remember a birthday party 
coordinated by Mr Agrizzi. 
MR COETZEE:   I do but not the original as I was initially 
enquired about.  Ms Mokonyane had a 40t h in 2003 and 
which was arranged by Mr Agrizzi himself and my... between 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 41 of 76 
 
Mr Agrizzi and myself. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see.  Now, and what did the...  was 
the... who paid for the birthday party? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, maybe before that.  Maybe Mr 
Coetzee can just tell me how it came about because from 
reading his affidavit, I think he has a fair recollection of how 
it came about.  How did it come about that you hosted Ms 
Mokonyane’s 40t h birthday party? 
MR COETZEE:   BOSASA as one of or was one of my 
corporate lines and have been so for many years.  We are 
10 
just down the road from one another. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR COETZEE:   Up until that point, they have used my guest 
house as venue.  I then got a call from Mr Agrizzi himself 
asking me, you know, for a quick meeting.  He and somebody 
else from BOSASA, which I cannot recall her name, then 
came to the guest house itself enquiring to do this function. 
 
Also informing me who the function would be for, as well 
as, Chair to answer your questions that BOSASA will be 
paying for the entire event. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And who did he say the function was going 
to be for? 
MR COETZEE:   It was for the then Minister Safety and 
Security, Nomvula Mokonyane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So at that time she was MEC for Safety 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 42 of 76 
 
and Security in Gauteng? 
MR COETZEE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So and... and so Mr Agrizzi was the 
one who called you and he said they were looking to do a 
function for... a birthday function for Ms Mokonyane? 
MR COETZEE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that they will be responsible as 
BOSASA for paying ...[intervenes]  
MR COETZEE:   For the account, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...for that function. 
10 
MR COETZEE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  At that stage, did he tell you how 
many guests they were looking at having? 
MR COETZEE:   Initially it was for 80. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For 80.  Eight zero? 
MR COETZEE:   Eight zero. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR COETZEE:   Which then subsequently went up to 120.  
That was the final confirmed number for the event. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR COETZEE:   At the day of the event when the guests 
started arriving that exponentially grew to 174. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So it started being a function that 
was meant for 80 people? 
MR COETZEE:   Yes. 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 43 of 76 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then the numbers went up to 120? 
MR COETZEE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But on the day of the function the numbers 
went up to 174? 
MR COETZEE:   174.  That is correct, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Do you remember the date when the 
function was held?  Or you can look in your affidavit. 
MR COETZEE:   I think it was the end of June 2003. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think your... 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   There is an invoice on page 6.  Will that 
10 
help Mr Coetzee? 
MR COETZEE:   Just quickly...  That was when the invoice 
was originally submitted for the 80 guests. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR COETZEE:   The final one was submitted only later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see on the invoice is written 
“attention”.  Attention for Angelo Agrizzi for even and then 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Was the invoice on page 6? 
20 
MR COETZEE:   The 28t h of June.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  We are looking... are we 
looking at the invoice on page 6? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes, Chair. 
MR COETZEE:   Ja. 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 44 of 76 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay under tab 26.  Mr Notshe, are you... 
should we not be using the black numbers? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No, we are using the red numbers Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, I think you... I think you may have 
forgotten.  You see, if you use the... if you use these red 
numbers, are you not going to run into... yes, you will run 
into the problem that... under different tags you start afresh.  
I think the... it is  black numbers that are used because they 
start from page 1 and go up to the last page.  I think we 
should use the black numbers. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No, that is fine Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the invoice we are talking about 
appears at page 14 if you look at the top left corner, the 
black numbers. 
MR COETZEE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it says:  “Attention Mr Angelo Agrizzi”. 
MR COETZEE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
And 
then 
it 
says: 
 
“For 
event 
28 June 2003”. 
MR COETZEE:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would that then be the date when the 
event was held? 
MR COETZEE:   Being when it was actually held itself, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR COETZEE:   The event took place. 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 45 of 76 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay continue Mr Notshe.  But I 
would like him to just tell me ...[intervenes]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
...how 
everything 
unfolded 
as 
he 
remembers it. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now you have just told the Chair that 
the even for was 80 people and then it increased to 120 
people.  How did you manage to then cater for this increased 
numbers? 
MR COETZEE:   Normally as a venue when we do events you 
10 
cater for 10, 15 people extra.  Luckily for us for that evening 
their speeches were quite long which then... we and the 
kitchen managed to get enough food.  We changed the menu 
slightly to accommodate everybody.  And as I said, luckily for 
the speeches being so long, we managed to actually 
produced food for all the people attending the event. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now the... can you just tell the 
Commission about the arrangement?  Who provided food and 
who provided the drinks? 
MR COETZEE:   This was part of the agreement in our initial 
20 
contract with Mr Agrizzi that BOSASA would be bringing in 
all the beverages.  Let me rephrase.  Not all the beverages, 
the majority of the beverages.  We will do arrival drinks, 
wine and sparkling wine for the speeches.  The rest was all 
brought in and sponsored by BOSASA. 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 46 of 76 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   In paragraph 14 on page 10 you deal 
with... you mention there a liquor store which sponsored this.  
Can you explain that to the Commission? 
MR COETZEE:   How I know which store it was.  The next 
day whatever was left over a few crates of mixes, like we 
call it in our industry, I personally delivered it back to this 
liquor store ...[intervenes]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Coetzee, I do not know.  It is like 
everybody... every witness today, their voices are very soft. 
10 
MR COETZEE:   Sorry, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please try and raise your voice and do not 
be too far from the mic. 
MR COETZEE:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Just repeat what you said just 
before I interrupted you. 
MR COETZEE:   I personally... whatever was left over from 
the event, the next morning I personally took back to the 
liquor store.  It was I think two or three crates of mixes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m, h’m, h’m. 
20 
MR COETZEE:   Initially when it was delivered, it was quite a 
substantial amount of boxes which is unusual for the size of 
the event as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR COETZEE:   Ja. 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 47 of 76 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now how much liquor?  Do you know?  
Can you estimate?  Where did you have to put the liquor? 
MR COETZEE:   It was delivered actually in one of my 
garages which was one side.  I had to remove a car.  It was, 
as I said, it was quite a substantial amount of alcohol 
delivered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR COETZEE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now what type of liquor was this?  Can 
10 
you remember? 
MR COETZEE:   It was also the upper range of brandies, 
KWV, Johnny Walker Blacks and Reds.  It was the normal 
malt whiskeys or anything like that but it was the upper 
range of each brand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was a long time ago. 
MR COETZEE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Close to... it is about what?  Eighteen 
years. 
MR COETZEE:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is about eighteen years now.  How is 
that you seem to remember this function so well? 
MR COETZEE:   Chair, there is... in our industry you can 
almost speak to anybody that has been in it for a long time.  
There are certain events that do just stuck in your head of 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 48 of 76 
 
which this event is one of them.   
 
One, because we had to scramble behind doors to get 
extra food done and to get extra seating done.  The 
procedure of event.   
 
Although, I personally and the guest house has catered 
for truly grateful(?) people, it is sometimes just small things 
that just gets stuck in your head.   
 
And when the day I did my affidavit, you know collected 
that, I spoke to one of my staff members and even they said:  
Oh, well.  Ja, this one was in 2003.  So there are certain 
10 
events that just get stuck in your head for quite a long time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m, h’m.  In terms of the profile of the 
function, was it quite usual for your guest house to host 
functions of that profile at that time? 
MR COETZEE:   Not for us personally. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR COETZEE:   I have done quite a number of events 
personally. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR COETZEE:   I have done quite high profile celebrates, 
20 
both local and international, as well as, for my mother. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR COETZEE:   For the guest house itself, that was the first 
high-profile event we did for the government. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 49 of 76 
 
MR COETZEE:   But I had a prior and post that event 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR COETZEE:   ...I have done quite a significant number of 
high-profile events for people, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So why you and your mom may have 
been involved in high-profile functions, this was the first 
high-profile function for this guest house. 
MR COETZEE:   For Victoria Guest House itself, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  Okay alright.  Thank you.  And 
10 
are you able to say Ms Mokonyane was there at the 
function? 
MR COETZEE:   I was personally introduced to her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR COETZEE:   I ran the function function-wise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR COETZEE:   The event went on for quite a while that 
evening as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR COETZEE:   Of which, at a certain point, I sent all the 
20 
staff home. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR COETZEE:   So, ja I was there up until the last guest 
left. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 50 of 76 
 
MR COETZEE:   And as I said, during the course of the 
evening, I was introduced to her personally as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And was Mr Agrizzi at the function as 
well? 
MR COETZEE:   Yes, they were.  He was there as well, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Are there any other persons of high-
profile that you can remember that were also there or not 
really? 
MR COETZEE:   Exactly name-wise, I cannot. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
10 
MR COETZEE:   But I can you there were. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR COETZEE:   As that is the reason why the speeches 
went on for three and a half hours. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR COETZEE:   A few minutes made some speeches. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR COETZEE:   Other than just a normal raise the glass and 
go. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Notshe 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  After you had been contacted by the 
investigators of the Commission did you go to archives to 
look for documents, invoices relating to this? 
MR COETZEE:   Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Can you turn to page 14, the black 14, 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 51 of 76 
 
that is an invoice. 
MR COETZEE:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Is this the invoice for the event? 
MR COETZEE:   Yes, it is. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And we see the invoice is invoice to 
BOSASA, it is from Victoria Guesthouse to BOSASA. 
MR COETZEE:   Yes it is. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And it is for attention of Mr Agrizzi. 
MR COETZEE:   Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then it lists the items that would be 
10 
paid for. 
MR COETZEE:   Yes, it is. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now in …(intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, would you ask him to just 
read those items? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  He can go to those items that were 
invoiced for. 
MR COETZEE:   And read it? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes please. 
MR COETZEE:   It was for 174 people for catering, flowers, 
20 
some venue hire – because of the function going on quite 
late that evening, for chair covers hired in for the event, 
setting layout, pre-drinks prior to the event, wine, both red 
and white for the event, J C Le Roux for the speeches and 
then a bar corkage fee. 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 52 of 76 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then there is also a thank you 
payment for R25 080.  
MR COETZEE:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   What was that? 
MR COETZEE:   Yes, that was on the initial invoice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
CHAIRPERSON:   For the 80 people then obviously 
subsequent to the numbers increasing so drastically, the 
final invoice was submitted. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   So this 16 was for the people you said 
10 
were not catered for in the beginning? 
MR COETZEE:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I see. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the invoice, you had to add 
R16 757.50? 
MR COETZEE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As a result of the …[intervenes] 
MR COETZEE:   The increasing numbers.  
CHAIRPERSON:   The increasing numbers.  
MR COETZEE:   Yes, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so the total function cost you – 
cost how much?   That is R25 080 plus R16 757,50, is that 
right?   
MR COETZEE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is adding the two, they have not been 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 53 of 76 
 
added here or are they added somewhere else? 
MR COETZEE:   No, it is roughly about 41 000, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, well that would be 35, 40 – it 
looks like 41 000 something. 
MR COETZEE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  I think it would be 41 000 and some 
change.  
MR COETZEE:   That sounds more or less correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  So that was more or less 
what 
you 
charged 
for 
doing 
that 
function 
for 
Ms 
10 
Mokanyane’s 40 t h birthday party in 2003. 
MR COETZEE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then there was also a garage full 
of liquor. 
MR COETZEE:   Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  That had been obtained from the – in 
this bottle store. 
MR COETZEE:   Yes, that is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the liquor that had been provided by 
20 
BOSASA 
is 
not 
included 
here 
obviously 
because 
…[intervenes] 
MR COETZEE:   That is not included. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR COETZEE:   That was why the corkage fee at the 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 54 of 76 
 
bottom of the invoice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR COETZEE:   Or the last item listed on the invoice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you …[intervenes] 
MR COETZEE:   It was for them to allow to bring it in. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So if one includes that, then BOSASA 
must have paid quite a substantial amount, much more 
substantially than 41 000. 
MR COETZEE:   You can almost easily the amount of 
alcohol that was – I would even estimate almost double 
10 
this invoice, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What – well, you deal with function 
regularly. 
MR COETZEE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you able to give an estimate of what 
the function must have cost BOSASA when you include the 
liquor?  Obviously, you do not have an itemised bill 
relating to liquor but you saw how much it was, you say it 
was – it took quite a substantial part of your garage. 
MR COETZEE:   If I have to – my good guess, not even a 
20 
quarter of that which would be sufficient for about 250 
guests and that would have cost you about anything 
between R7’ to R10 000 on that stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:   About how much? 
MR COETZEE:   R7 000 to R10 000. 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 55 of 76 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR COETZEE:   And that was about three times more, 
delivered for this event. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So your estimate would be? 
MR COETZEE:   I would give a rough estimate between 
R30’ to R40 000. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just for the liquor? 
MR COETZEE:   Just for liquor, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so if you add what you charged that 
could come to about R80 000 or thereabout. 
10 
MR COETZEE:   Ja, definitely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  and you have also attached to your 
affidavit exhibit – page 16 and 17.  There seems to be 
some fancy …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said exhibit, you mean pages 16 
and 17? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I beg your pardon, pages 16 and 17, 
the black 16 and 17. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, what is on page 16 there, Mr 
20 
Coetzee? 
MR COETZEE:   This is basically décor of the tables itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR 
COETZEE: 
 
 
In 
the 
background 
you 
will 
see 
photographs as gifts for Mrs Mokanyane. 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 56 of 76 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR COETZEE:   Which you will also see on page 17. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR COETZEE:   That was gifted by BOSASA that I know 
of. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR COETZEE:   And this is just of individual place settings 
and chair covers, etcetera, as well as flower arrangements. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR COETZEE:   For the event. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And then, of course, page 18 is 
also – does it also reflect what was on a certain table, I 
guess the décor and the glasses and the cutlery. 
MR COETZEE:   Ja, ja, just – or, you know, close, close up 
of an individual place setting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Yes, Mr Notshe. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then on page 20 to 24, this looks 
like the invoices that were invoiced to you for what you had 
supplied, is that correct? 
MR COETZEE:   Yes, it is. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, what is it, page 20? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  From page 20 to 24, Chair, the invoices 
that were issued to the guesthouse. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MR COETZEE:   For extra décor that we hired in for this 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 57 of 76 
 
event. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, let us take it one at a time. 
What invoices are these? 
MR COETZEE:   The first one on page 20 is for the wine 
that 
we 
obtained 
and 
we 
had 
serve. 
 
Page 
22 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the one at page 20, the total is 
R1 860.10, is that right? 
MR COETZEE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it is written exactly what wine you 
10 
bought. 
MR COETZEE:   For the event itself, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  And then page 22, what invoice is 
that?  From whom to whom? 
MR COETZEE:   It is from Classic Function Hire to Victoria 
Guesthouse. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR COETZEE:   For chair covers and gold tieback tussles 
which …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the amount is R1 320? 
20 
MR COETZEE:   Ja, 1 320. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR COETZEE:   And then a local hiring company in 
Krugersdorp as well, in Rant en Dal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 58 of 76 
 
MR COETZEE:   For extra tables and some cutlery. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay and 23?   
MR COETZEE:   Sorry, that is 23 and 24. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is 23 and 24? 
MR COETZEE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that is for, among others, the 
furniture, tables and other things that you needed for the 
function, is that right? 
MR COETZEE:   Say again, sir? 
CHAIRPERSON:   23 and 24, that is for the furniture, 
10 
tables as well as other items that you needed for the 
function. 
MR COETZEE:   For the function itself, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, table cloths and black napkins that 
appears at page 24.  At page 23, what is the total that 
appears on the invoice? 
MR COETZEE:   Was 836 for the two invoices together. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see R615,96.  Are we on the same 
page? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Look on page, Mr… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 23, black 23. 
MR COETZEE:   Yes, 615. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have 615,96, is that right? 
MR COETZEE:   Yes, it is, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 59 of 76 
 
MR COETZEE:   And then the second one from the same 
company is for R221. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, when you add them together that is 
how you come to 8, ja.  Okay.  Yes, Mr Notshe. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair, that is the evidence of Mr 
Coetzee.  Can that be – the affidavit can then be admitted 
as EXHIBIT T26 together with the annexures that... 
CHAIRPERSON:   T...? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  T26, EXHIBIT T26. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Frederick Henry Coetzee’s affidavit is 
10 
admitted and will be marked as EXHIBIT T26. 
FREDERICK HENRY COETZEE’S AFFIDAVIT HANDED IN 
AS EXHIBIT T26 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now how long did the function take, do 
you remember? 
MR COETZEE:   It went on – I think it was half past three, 
quarter to four in the morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In the morning? 
MR COETZEE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And this was the only function 
20 
relating to Ms Mokonyane’s birthday party that you hosted. 
MR COETZEE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Yes.  No, thank you very much 
…[intervenes] 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Just one question to the witness? 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 60 of 76 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Mr Agrizzi said the party was supposed 
to be Break a Leg, did anyone break a leg? 
MR COETZEE:   No, hopefully not. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you remember if there was a theme 
for the party? 
MR COETZEE:   Not – no, there was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  I see that there is no where written 
Ms Nomvula Mokonyane on the invoices, that must be 
10 
because she was not going to pay. 
MR COETZEE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because BOSASA was going to pay.  
That is why you have got BOSASA and Mr Agrizzi’s name 
on the invoices. 
MR COETZEE:   Exactly, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, but you are quite clear that 
this function was for Ms Mokonyane’s 40 t h birthday party. 
MR COETZEE:   I can …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are not mistaken about that. 
20 
MR COETZEE:   I can definitely that it was definitely. 
MR COETZEE:   Yes and you say it was organised by Mr 
Agrizzi. 
MR COETZEE:   Agrizzi, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And BOSASA paid. 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 61 of 76 
 
MR COETZEE:   Definitely, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Thank you very much, Mr Coetzee, 
for coming to assist the Commission, we appreciate it very 
much.  Thank you very much, you are excused. 
MR COETZEE:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  The next witness who is supposed is 
Ms Sandy Thomas and I have not seen her, I have not been 
contacted by her and, Chair, her – the summons calling her 
to testify appears in EXHIBIT T27 and can I take you, 
10 
Chair, to page 57 of this bundle where we have return of 
serve in respect thereof in that she was …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Has 
she 
made 
contact 
with 
the 
Commission at all or through herself or through attorneys. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No, not – I have not received anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not all since the summons was served? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  What I – I had received a call from the 
attorneys, Madlanga Attorneys. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  To say they will represent her as well. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And they indicated that they might ask 
for time but I had said then that if they want to do that, 
one, they must write to the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 62 of 76 
 
ADV 
NOTSHE 
SC: 
 
Then 
they 
will 
be 
told 
– 
the 
Commission will respond. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  But I told them that my view is that 
they will have to appear. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  She will have to appear and then apply 
here for a postponement or for whatever. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  As Mr [indistinct] 14.16 did. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  When he appeared and then applied for 
a postponement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And I have heard nothing from that 
end, I have not seen any correspondence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, how long ago was it when they 
called you? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  It was last week, I think about 
Thursday. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I am going to adjourn, I suggest 
that contact be made with them or Ms Thomas if there is 
contact 
but 
certainly 
with 
the 
attorneys 
to 
say 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 63 of 76 
 
…[intervenes] 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No, I will definitely call the attorneys.  
Unfortunately, I have …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   To say she is not here and they are not 
here, what is going on, simply because that firm seems to 
cooperate 
with 
the 
Commission 
quite 
well 
when 
Ms 
Mokonyane was going to give evidence, if I recall correctly. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just in case there is something. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think I will adjourn and then when I 
come back you can then tell me what is going on. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I will do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So we will adjourn for twenty minutes 
just to give you a little of more time. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So we will resume at twenty to twelve. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then you can give me a report of what is 
going on. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  The witness, Ms Thomas, Mr Madlanga, 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 64 of 76 
 
he informs that he had briefed counsel to appear but I told 
him that no one appeared and he is on his way to the 
Commission and he indicated that he is going to apply for 
a postponement of the evidence of the witness.  And he 
said he estimates that he will be here at about ten past 
twelve. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  I think we are going to adjourn.  I 
think you must inform him.  I will adjourn until two.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:  That is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let him be here at two but with the 
10 
witness. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No, that is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because the witness was served with a 
summons to be here and if he is going to apply for a 
postponement that application must happen at a time when 
the witness is in compliance with the summons. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that means being here even if she 
was supposed to be at nine and she was not here but I 
have difficulty with the idea where a summons has been 
20 
issued and served that you can apply for a postponement 
with a client or witness not being there unless it is a 
situation where the witness is sick, then that is different 
but – so I think if the witness is not here at two, when he is 
here, then I will have to hear what the good reason is why 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 65 of 76 
 
the witness is not here. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja and then if he has an application to 
move then we will deal with it then but if the application is 
moved in circumstances where the witness continues to be 
in breach of the summons, that might pose difficulties for 
the application. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No, that is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So we will adjourn until two o’clock. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Thank you, Chair.

INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good afternoon Mr Madlanga. 
MR MADLANGA:   Good afternoon Judge.   Thanks for 
giving us the opportunity and indulgence to appear this 
afternoon before the Commission. 
 
My client is Sandy Thomas.  We have been in 
consultation with Sandy for the past – when she received 
the first summons ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just pull the mic closer to you so I can 
20 
hear you, ja, I think. 
MR MADLANGA:  From the onset Judge we have been 
representing Ms Sandy Thomas and last week we wrote 
correspondence 
to 
the 
Commission 
requesting 
an 
indulgence for us to consult with her together with the brief 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 66 of 76 
 
counsels in the matter who are not available today.  We 
have Advocate Moos Mpaga [?] and Advocate Manala on 
the brief, they are not available today and we only received 
the Notice in terms of Rule 3.3 last week on the 19 t h of 
August 2020 and we are of the view that, according to the 
rules we’re supposed to have 14 days upon which our 
client should respond and proceed but we’re making an 
undertaking to provide the affidavit to the Commission 
before the 2 n d of September 2020, hence we request an 
indulgence to have the matter stood down until the 2 n d of 
10 
September for the legal teams to arrange and come and 
bring Ms Thomas before the Commission, that’s the 
request.  The letter details the reasons of our – the 
reasons 
why 
we 
request 
an 
indulgence 
from 
this 
Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can I see a copy of the letter, have you 
got a copy?  Well the first point is, the summons required 
Ms Thomas to be here this morning, isn’t it? 
MR MADLANGA:  Yes Judge. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think at 9 o’clock, is that right? 
20 
MR MADLANGA:  Ja she was supposed to be here at 9 
o’clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And she was not excused from being 
here at 9 o’clock, isn’t it? 
MR MADLANGA:  Yes Judge. 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 67 of 76 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, she should have been here, isn’t it? 
MR MADLANGA:  Yes Judge. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And irrespective of what application was 
to be made, if someone says you must be at Court or at the 
Commission on a certain date and time, until you are 
excused you have an obligation to be there at that time.  If 
you are going to ask for a postponement of the hearing of 
your evidence, you make it while you are there, while you 
are in compliance with the summons, you don’t sit at home 
and 
when 
the 
summons 
says 
you 
must 
be 
at 
the 
10 
Commission.  If your lawyers are going to apply, they apply 
while you are there because the application might be 
refused and what is supposed to happen if you are not 
there, you understand? 
MR 
MADLANGA: 
 
I 
understand 
Judge, 
our 
sincere 
apologies Judge, I think, amongst the reasons – the reason 
why she’s here now, she’s here now is because of those 
summons that you will realise that it will be a serious error 
on her part or on the part of the legal team not to bring her 
here before the Commission. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja I think bring the mic closer 
because I’m also struggling to hear you, do you want to 
just repeat what you said? 
MR MADLANGA:  Yes Judge, it’s exactly that error that 
we’re acknowledging, that we advised her to come this 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 68 of 76 
 
afternoon because whatever excuses she might be having, 
she needs to appear before the Commission and make this 
application before you Judge.  It was a serious error on our 
part, hence we’re requesting an indulgence from this 
Commission to grant the postponement, more in particular 
that she needs to be represented by counsel and counsel 
has to prepare affidavits on the matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I see from this letter that there have 
been 11 days, she seems to have been served with 
summons 11 days ago on the 14 t h of August, according to 
10 
this letter. 
MR MADLANGA:  She only drew to our attention the 
summons only last week Judge. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes well she might not have acted 
promptly which she should have done, you know, that 
appears to me to be enough time to have consulted with 
the lawyers and be ready and of course, as I understand 
the summons, and I’m speaking under correction, as I 
understand the summons it didn’t require her to put up an 
affidavit, it required her to present herself and she would 
20 
be 
questioned 
or 
have 
I 
missed 
something 
in 
the 
summons? 
MR MADLANGA:  Yes Judge, but we wanted to deal, 
holistically with all the matters because there is an 
affidavit by Gina which implicates our client, we wanted to 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 69 of 76 
 
also deal with that affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see…[intervenes]. 
MR MADLANGA:  Gina Peters. 
CHAIRPERSON:   My understanding from the legal team is 
that previous attempts that have been made to obtain an 
affidavit from your client by the Commission have not been 
successful, she has not been very cooperative, that’s the 
impression I have, from what I’ve been told.  That is why a 
summons was issued, to say, she needs to come here and 
be questioned because she didn’t seem to be cooperating 
10 
in terms of filing any affidavits, that’s the impression I 
have from the reports that I’ve been given and now if you 
say, as you do, in this letter that you have been 
representing her and interacting with the Commission, it 
may well be that you know about that as well. 
MR MADLANGA:  Yes Judge, there is also – there is a 
correspondence that the Commission evidence leader is 
having, they’ve not fully responded to that letter.  We’re 
surprised to see a Notice – a summons now without first 
dealing 
with 
that 
correspondence 
of 
which 
we 
were 
20 
requesting some information. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you see, my understanding, as I say, 
is that the Commission’s legal team and investigation team 
have long been trying to get an affidavit from her and that 
has not been forthcoming and that is why it was resorted to 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 70 of 76 
 
issuing a summons and getting her to come here to say, 
even without an affidavit she will be questioned because 
the Commission doesn’t have time we are running out of 
time, we can’t be postponing and postponing.  If she had 
provided an affidavit much earlier, maybe it would have 
been clear there was no need for her to come and give 
evidence or she would long have appeared before the 
Commission giving her evidence, that’s the impression I’ve 
received as to why, up to now, the Commission doesn’t 
have any affidavit from her and then a summons has been 
10 
issued then she’s not here in the morning.  This morning 
we – a summons had been issued more or less at the same 
time against one of the BOSASA drivers and his lawyer was 
here and I’m told he was here too because he understood 
that, if a summons says you must be at the Commission at 
such and such a date at such and such a time, you must be 
there.  They were here, they made arrangements because 
it transpired that he needed Sesotho interpreter and those 
arrangements had not been made because it was not 
known that he would need an interpreter and arrangements 
20 
were made but they were here, the lawyer was here and 
I’m told the client was – the witness was here to comply 
with the summons you see.  So, it’s unacceptable, when 
somebody receives a summons and without having been 
excused first, stays away.  If it’s a situation where 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 71 of 76 
 
somebody is in hospital, that’s different but then somebody 
must appear and say, this is the situation but you can’t just 
stay away just because the lawyers will apply for a 
postponement because who said the postponement will be 
granted, do you understand? 
MR MADLANGA:  No, I hear you – I hear you very well 
Judge. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now, with regard to there being an 
affidavit do you say there’s an affidavit of Ms Gina or Gina 
or somebody? 
10 
MR MADLANGA:  Gina Peters yes Judge. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That has been served on her? 
MR MADLANGA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How long ago was it served on her, do 
you know, together with summons or what? 
MR MADLANGA:  Yes, together with summons.  
CHAIRPERSON:   You can take instructions. 
MR MADLANGA:  It was sent, Judge last week. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hm. 
MR MADLANGA:  It was sent separately last week Judge. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, how long is it do you know?  I take 
it, it must be short? 
MR MADLANGA:  Short, but it was commissioned on the 
11 t h of …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How many pages is it? 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 72 of 76 
 
MR MADLANGA:  It is six pages. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja that’s quite short. 
MR MADLANGA:  Eight pages yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You know, I might postpone because of 
that affidavit otherwise I would have wanted her to take 
witness stand and give evidence because she would be 
asked about things that she knows and there’s been a lot 
of time, from what I’ve been told, when attempts were 
made to obtain an affidavit from her but now if I postpone 
the hearing of her evidence I would postpone it to either 
10 
Monday or Tuesday next week because from then on, I 
mean next week Monday we’re supposed to have a certain 
matter, certain witness, that witness, other arrangements 
have to be made, so there’s a space there, Tuesday, I think 
there may be – I think it’s Ms Gina or I’m not sure who is 
the 1 s t of September after that we have witnesses lined up 
for quite some time so it makes it very difficult when there 
has to be a postponement.  So, of course, in this kind of 
situation a client must get lawyers who are available when 
the client is required to appear because otherwise if we 
20 
are only going to wait for her lawyers who might not be 
available we are not going to get anywhere.  So, if I 
postpone, I’m looking at early next week and from what 
I’ve heard from other witnesses, I don’t expect that her 
evidence will be too long, so that’s why I’m saying, if she 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 73 of 76 
 
received the summons on the 14 t h there’s been enough 
time to prepare her affidavit but from the Commission’s 
side even if she didn’t prepare an affidavit, if she 
presented herself, she’ll be questioned and would get on 
with the job.  So, if I postpone you might have to see what 
arrangements you make but it would either be – it seems to 
me it would either be Monday or Tuesday. 
MR MADLANGA:  Yes Judge, Tuesday will be okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, let me hear what Mr Notshe has to 
say and then we’ll take it from there. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair if Monday is – Tuesday will be 
even better but then if we’re going to prepare a statement, 
we’d like to have a statement for Monday…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  If there’s going to be a statement then 
we’d like to…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But today there was going to be no 
statement and we would proceed, isn’t it? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  What I’m saying is, if there is going to 
be a statement it will be better if we get a statement by 
Friday but if they can’t then we’ll proceed without the 
statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well today is what, Tuesday? 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 74 of 76 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Today is Tuesday yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, well if they’re going to file an 
affidavit it might have to be this week. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you got a witness for Tuesday? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No, the witnesses are starting on 
Wednesday, the 2 n d. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On Wednesday? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, there might be some other witness 
10 
but even if there is, her evidence is not supposed to be too 
long as far as I’m concerned. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, Mr Madlanga what do you 
say to …[intervenes]. 
MR MADLANGA:  No, there’s no objection Judge we will 
find the affidavit…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You can file on Friday. 
MR MADLANGA:   On Friday, Judge, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, Ms Thomas it’s not good that 
20 
you are not here at 9 o’clock, it’s not acceptable.  If a 
summons says you must be in Court or in the Commission 
on a certain date at a certain time, unless you are sick, 
you are in hospital, you must be there.  If you are going to 
ask that there be an adjournment, a postponement you 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 75 of 76 
 
must first comply with the summons because when you 
don’t comply with the summons, that’s a criminal offence, 
you understand? 
MS THOMAS:  My apologies Your Honour, I wasn’t aware 
that, those were the procedures. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so the sheriff is supposed to have 
explained to you, so I’m going to grant your lawyer ’s 
request for a postponement. 
MS THOMAS:  Yes, Your Honour. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But then on that day that I’m going to 
10 
give you, you must be here. 
MS THOMAS:  I will do so sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I don’t think your evidence will be 
too long so even the preparation should take too long. 
MS THOMAS:  Yes sir, thank you so much. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay, alright.  I think what we’ll do 
then, Mr Madlanga,  one, I will postpone to – the hearing of 
her evidence to Monday and on the – and you must file her 
statement or affidavit by close of business on Friday this 
week and I will make this – her appearance to be in terms 
20 
of Regulation 10(6) of the Regulations of the Commission.  
Failure to comply with such a directive is a criminal 
offence, Ms Thomas.  So, the hearing of Ms Thomas’ 
evidence is postponed to Monday next week at 10 o’clock 
and in terms of Regulation of 10(6) of the Regulations of 
25 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 254 
 
Page 76 of 76 
 
the Commission I direct that she must appear in this venue 
at 10 o’clock on Monday next week.  Through her lawyers 
she must file her affidavit or affirmed declaration with the 
Commission by close of business on Friday this week, 
alright, okay. 
MR MADLANGA:  Thank you Commissioner. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are excused for today but come 
back on Monday as I indicated otherwise you will be – 
you’ll run the risk of facing criminal charges.   
We adjourn.
