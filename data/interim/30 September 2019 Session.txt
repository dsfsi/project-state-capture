HEARING RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Wentzel, good morning everybody. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And before I forget you need to talk to me during the 
break about this list. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It might be necessary that we stop early today.  I 
hope it will not be necessary.  I am just going to continue to monitor my 
situation.  I am not so well so – but – I am much better than yesterday. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I am sorry Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no that is fine.  As I feel now I think we should be 
able to go quite some distance.  So I will just monitor my situation.  
Good morning Colonel Naidoo. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Ms Wentzel are you ready for us to 
continue? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes I am. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I think where we were when we adjourned on 
Friday was where Colonel Naidoo had begun or had just said that there 
was a suggestion from somebody at the braai in General Lazarus house 
20 
that they should go somewhere. I think that is where we are.  Am I 
right? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay take it from there.  Maybe recap in terms of 
who had made that suggestion? 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 3 of 156 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes and Chair if I might just go one step back 
also just to clarify something? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is fine.  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo on Friday afternoon you 
testified what transpired on the evening of the 20 October 2011 at 
General Larzarus’ house and you said after there had been a 
discussion with regard to the destruction of evidence for travel records 
– pertaining to travel records.  You said that Colonel FM09 asked 
General Lazarus if he should spin a story.  What did you understand by 
that? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Sorry Ms Wentzel there 
seems to be a problem with the sound.  Can you just give me a moment 
or so? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair if I may before I go 
further with regards to my testimony on Friday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  There is just one incident 
that I need to clarify or bring to your attention. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  When I spoke of 
admitting the Hawks regarding putting in false claims I confided in two 
of colleagues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Namely Colonel Barnard 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 4 of 156 
 
and FM40.  Chair when – I am going back now to the – the meeting at 
General Lazarus’ house when FM – when FM10 said that his contact at 
the Hawks told him that I admitted to putting in false claims and I am 
now on the side of the Hawks.  Chair at that stage outside of myself 
and the two Hawks investigators there were only two other individuals 
who knew of – of my admissions to the Hawks.  So it was not possible 
for anyone else to know about this at that stage.  And the only other 
person that I believe spoke to FM – FM10 was FM40 Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So it could not be – it 
10 
could not be anyone from the Hawks.  It was not possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So I just wanted to 
clarify that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the – the four people who knew about the 
admission you had made to the Hawks were Colonel Barnard and the 
person that was with Colonel Barnard when you told them.  And then it 
was the two members of the Hawks, is that right? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is indeed correct 
Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So those are the four people who knew about it. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Outside of myself yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Outside of yourself. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so you say that it could not have been any of 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 5 of 156 
 
the two from the Hawks who would have spoken to anybody in Crime 
Intelligence about your admissions? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair it would not make 
sense for them to do that.  They were the investigators and I was 
liaising with them with regards to information.  I do not think they would 
have approached any of suspects and told them – give them that 
information.  So it does not make sense. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Unless of course they did not themselves directly 
speak to somebody in Crime Intelligence to tell them that but they 
shared the information of your admission with one or more other people 
10 
within the Hawks whom they trusted who might have broken that trust. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That could – that could 
have happened Chair but I – like I mentioned from my side. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  There was only those 
four individuals that I knew of at that stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Who know of – knew of 
this information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And in terms of Colonel Barnard and the person 
20 
who was with Colonel Barnard are you in a position to indicate your 
level of trust whether anyone of them may have told General Lazarus or 
somebody else within Crime Intelligence about it? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair but that evening 
Colonel Barnard had already informed General Lazarus regarding my 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 6 of 156 
 
admissions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Because that is what 
General Lazarus told me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So it only leave the other 
individual which is FM40 that probably spoke to – to FM10. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, okay.  Alright thank you.   Before we 
proceed I just want to – to remind that the – to remind you Colonel 
Naidoo that the oath that you took on Friday continues to apply until 
10 
you have finished your evidence.  Is that alright? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair perfect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  Ms Wentzel. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo could you now deal with how 
you understood the statement from Colonel FM09 to General Lazarus 
that whether he should spin a story.  What did you understand by that? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I have knowledge 
of – of when he said that spin a story what I believed that meant to be 
was using journalists either to plant information within the media that 
would be in favour of Crime Intelligence. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So is that a term that you knew to be used quite often 
within Crime Intelligence to mean that a story must be told to 
journalists who would then be expected to publish such story? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Not generally Chair but 
at that stage that is what I understood it be because I have other – I 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 7 of 156 
 
have knowledge of other incidents where journalists were either paid or 
were in touch with Crime Intelligence members. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so is the position that your understanding of what 
spinning a story was intended to mean simply based on your 
understanding of the term and not because of how you understood the 
term to be used in Crime Intelligence generally? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair if – as a standalone statement it might 
not mean much right now but as I continue with my – with my testimony. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It might give more insight 
or more understanding of what that statement meant at that particular 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo what did you do after you left 
General Lazarus’ house that evening? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Like to testified to 
previously … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe he must first just refresh our memory in 
20 
terms of who made the suggestion that they go somewhere. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair it was FM09 
suggested that we go for drinks as it – he said he was extremely 
stressed.  Chair I was also stressed but I was also weary this might just 
be another opportunity for me to be interrogated or debriefed but 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 8 of 156 
 
having said that I also did not want to create any suspicion as well so I 
agreed to go. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Did he say where you – you should – where 
the drinks would be – where you would go to have drinks? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I will get to that in a 
moment Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So as we left General 
Lazarus’ house like I just said there was the suggestion we go for 
drinks which I agreed to.  We went to and I am speaking now this – this 
10 
is myself, it is FM09 and FM08.  We proceeded to the Holiday – I think 
it is the Holiday Inn in – it is in the precinct of OR Tambo International 
Airport.  The one that is along the R24 if I remember correctly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It is a pub in the hotel 
Chair I cannot remember the name I think it is a Keg.  So we got in and 
we proceeded to get some drinks Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You mentioned who was with you and I just want to 
check.  Was it 3 people including you? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair it was FM08. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then FM09 and yourself? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright yes continue.  You got to the pub. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes.  Chair while – while 
we were waiting for our drinks FM09 showed me a message on his 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 9 of 156 
 
phone.  It was BBM message.  Chair I took a glance at it.  I cannot say 
for sure well I did not see what was actually on the message because it 
– the lighting was not too good.  But after – after he glanced the phone 
towards me obviously I could not read what was on the phone he said 
that we and what I understood this to be as in we – as in Crime 
Intelligence or I as an individual should stay away from General Dramat 
and General Sibiya.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair at that stage … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was FM08? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  FM09. 
CHAIRPERSON:  09 okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  FM 09 yes Chair.  I sort 
of discarded what he told me because it did not make sense because I 
knew who General Dramat and General Sibiya was.  At that stage just 
for the record General Dramat was the Head of the Hawks, National 
Head of the Hawks and General Sibiya was the Head of Hawks Gauteng 
Province.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes General Dramat was National Head of the 
Hawks? 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  At that stage I had not 
met any one of these individuals except from know who they were and 
what positions they held.  So I sorted discarded what he told me 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 10 of 156 
 
because I have never met these individuals.   
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not understand what the context was for him 
to say you should stay away from these two individuals. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Not at all Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And we continued.  We 
had – I think I had two drinks.  I am not sure how many drinks FM09 
had.  We were probably there an hour or so Chair but it was – it was 
quite a – it was an amicable situation.  There was no more questions 
put to me by FM09 nor FM08. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  08 Hm.  And what was your response to the 
suggestion?  You – did you just hear it and did not react to it? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I did not Chair because 
like I am saying it did not make sense to me because I had not met any 
of these individuals so I just sort of discarded what he told me or rather 
did not pay much attention to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  At that stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  We were probably there 
20 
about an hour or so and I – I think we called it a night.  We decided to 
go home.  FM09 and FM08 dropped me off at my home.  The next 
morning Chair which is now the 21 s t October 2011. Chair I just would 
like to mention as well at that stage I was using – I was making use of 
four or five cell phones that I had with me at the time.  One was my 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 11 of 156 
 
official phone from Crime Intelligence.  The other three or four that I 
had were pay as you go cell phones.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But that – by that stage I 
had – I had disconnected my home phone as well.  The cell phones that 
I was making use of the time I took off the batteries, I took off the SIM 
cards simply because of all the – the incidents that had transpired in 
the previous few hours or the day before.  The one phone – the one cell 
phone which was a pay as you go phone nobody had the number. None 
of my colleagues had that number.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I did not even know the 
number myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I eventually made 
contact with Colonel Roelofse.  Chair he had given me his cell phone 
number on that – on my first meeting in September or my other – the 
second meeting I refer to the 18 t h and the 19 t h.  On one of those two 
occasions he had given me his cell phone number.  He said I should 
keep it in case I need to contact him for anything and I remember that I 
20 
indeed had his number.  So I contacted Colonel Roelofse using this 
spare… 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is now still the 20 t h or is it the 21 s t of October. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  This is the morning of 
the 21 s t Chair. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 12 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh morning of the 21 October 2011? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I contacted Colonel 
Roelofse.  I am not sure whether I phoned him or sent him a message 
from this phone.  I told him that I need to see him urgently.  I cannot 
remember I think he said he will – he will come to – to meet with me 
and I told him to meet with me at my house.  I explained more or less 
where it was.  Chair at that stage I was driving a bakkie – a state 
vehicle so I decided to wait outside on the roadside in the bakkie 
10 
waiting for Colonel Roelofse.  I am not sure where he was and how long 
he was going to take to get to meet with me.  So I was waiting for him 
on the roadside sitting in the bakkie.  While I was waiting for Colonel 
Roelofse I noticed a blue Audi approaching my house.  Like I mentioned 
earlier Chair there is a field across my house so I have view of both the 
roads leading to my house so it is quite a fair view of what is going on 
around me.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Your bakkie was it parked not far from the gate to 
your house or was it parked quite some distance away from your 
house? 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair it was parked near 
the gate but on the road not in front of the gate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  In the driveway it was 
parked on the road. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 13 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I did this purely so I 
could have a fair view of – of what is happening in front of me and the 
side of me and at the back of me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Just to see vehicles 
approaching or anything like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Around about what time of the morning was it when 
you were – when you – you were waiting there for Colonel Roelofse? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair it would have been 
10 
probably around nine – nine or ten.  I must add as well that I did not go 
to work that – that morning or that day which is the 21 s t. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I know that … 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I did not – I did not 
report to work that day Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I know that you mentioned I think that either the 
18 t h or 19 t h was a Friday, am I correct?  One of those two?  Or did I 
misunderstand you cannot remember? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair the 20 t h when I 
dropped off General – I picked up General Lazarus and I dropped him 
20 
off at his office and that is when I told him I want to go home to rest.  
That was the 20 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you cannot remember what day of the week it 
was? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  The – the … 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 14 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    The 20 t h? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  The 20 t h was a Thursday 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was a Thursday? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes it be –  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I remember because the 
21 s t October very clearly because it was a Friday that is the day we 
were admitted into the witness protection programme. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Okay.  So while you were waiting either in 
10 
the bakkie or outside the bakkie on the road you said you saw – you 
saw some vehicle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Chair I was seated in the bakkie but the bakkie was 
parked on the roadside and I noticed this – this vehicle approaching my 
house.  It was a blue Audi.  As it got near I noticed it was FM10.  He 
parked alongside me.  He did not get off neither did I get off of my 
vehicle.  We were speaking through the windows of each vehicle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was he alone? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  He was alone Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  He told me that he was 
instructed by General Lazarus to pick me up and take me to his office 
for a meeting.  This is to General Lazarus’ office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What time – what time were you supposed to have 
started work that day? 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 15 of 156 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair we normally start 
at half past seven but like I said on that Friday I did not report to work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Alright. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair this was probably 
around nine or ten in the morning.  I could be wrong but it was 
definitely before twelve.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I actually got quite a 
shock when I saw him first approaching because I was actually waiting 
for Colonel Roelofse to come and meet with me.  So this put me in 
10 
quite a dilemma because if Colonel Roelofse showed up at the time that 
he was there then I would have had a problem.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So he – I tried to get out 
of it Chair.  I gave him some excuse.  I think I told him that I needed to 
take my wife to the doctor or I needed to take her somewhere. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  He did not back down.  
He insisted that I come.  I could see that he was – he was not going to 
let go so I eventually decided that I will go but I told him this is now 
20 
FM10 I told him I will – I will follow him in my vehicle because he 
wanted me to come with him in his car. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I wonder why he would have wanted that.  Do 
you have any idea?  You had your own official car with you? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  At that stage yes Chair.  
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 16 of 156 
 
It was not my own official car.  My – the car that I was driving at that 
stage was in the garage.  I was using – this was one of the pool cars of 
General Lazarus that I was using at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  While my own car was in 
the garage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Eventually we – I 
decided – well I was not going to go with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry you – I think you said that you know why or 
10 
you knew why he wanted you to rather go with him in the car that he 
was driving rather than follow in your own car. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I cannot say for 
sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Why he insisted that I 
come with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But eventually I – I said 
– I did not [indistinct] to him. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would follow him? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  General Lazarus’ office 
is in Centurion I will not mention where because it is a covert premises. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 17 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  When we got to the office 
obviously FM10 was there already he had parked his car.  I parked the 
vehicle that I was driving in a basement of the – of the office.  As I 
walked up to the reception of – of General Lazarus’ office I noticed 
Colonel Barnard was present was speaking to another Colonel 
Furstenberg.  FM obviously FM… 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the name of the other Colonel? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Colonel Furstenberg. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh how do you write that? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It is I think it is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am looking in your statement. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It is F-u-r-s-t-e-n – on 
page 065 Chair on 282. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair you will see it at the bottom of that 
page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the bottom of the page? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes.  F-u-r-s-t-e-n-b-u-r-g.  Furstenburg. 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes continue. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Like I mentioned Colonel 
Barnard was there.  FM09 this is Colonel FM09. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 18 of 156 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And FM – sorry Chair.  
FM07 was also present. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair when I like I said 
when I got to the basement and noticed all these individuals like I have 
just mentioned present I realised that this was going to be another – 
another interrogation session.  I asked FM40 where or rather FM40 – 
Chair sorry.  I asked FM40 what is going on.  He said he does not know 
he was instructed to come to the office to have a – for a meeting.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  At that stage I – if I 
remember correctly I think I said to FM40 can Burries not shut his 
mouth. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that a reference to Colonel Barnard? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  This I mentioned to 
FM40.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair if I remember 
20 
correctly General Lazarus at that stage was not at his office he was 
gone for a meeting or I think he had a meeting with the Inspector 
General of Intelligence.  This I picked up from the conversation that I 
had with either FM40 or FM7. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 19 of 156 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair at that stage I 
realised that I had to get out of this situation because once General 
Lazarus comes back then this – it is going to be a real problem for me.  
Chair at that state I – like I said I realised I needed to get out of that 
situation.  I – I deliberately became emotional.  When I say that I said 
to FM40 and FM07 that I had been interviewed by the Hawks and now 
by my own colleagues and I intentionally became emotional. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  At that stage I – if I 
remember correctly I used some vulgar language as well. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say that you did this deliberately as part of 
your plan to get out of the situation? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair it was – it was part 
deliberate – it was part genuine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But I was generally 
emotional – you know the last few days was quite stressful for me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And it was like I said – it 
was – it was genuine but also deliberate and I started to walk back to 
20 
my bakkie which was parked in a basement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So that was before you could even enter the 
room where the meeting was supposed to take place? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair this was all 
happening in – on the outside of the building.  Everybody was standing 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 20 of 156 
 
on the outside of General Lazarus’ building.  It was not on the inside. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh and General Lazarus had not arrived yet. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Not yet Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So I proceeded to walk 
back to my bakkie.  FM07 followed me and said that you know I should 
hold on because they just want to clear up the – or clarify the whole 
situation.  I did not listen to him.  I walked through the – through the 
basement door and as I walked past the door I kicked the door.  I 
jumped into my vehicle and I started to drive at high speed back to my 
10 
house which was in Kempton Park.  So it is probably a half an hour 
drive from where I was.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I got home. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did anybody try to follow you? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I will get to that now 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Oh from the office itself 
no.  I cannot recall anybody following me. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But when I got home 
Chair which was about half an hour or forty minutes later – a few 
minutes after I got home I heard a vehicle coming down the – down the 
road near to my house at high speed.  I asked my wife to check 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 21 of 156 
 
because when the – that vehicle eventually stopped in front of my 
driveway and the intercom buzzed.  
My wife answered.  It was FM09.  He wanted to know where I 
was.  My wife told him that I was - I came back very upset and I was 
asleep and he eventually left.  Chair by this stage I was really 
concerned not only of my own safety but that of my family as well. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what did you then do? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Can I just have a few 
minutes Chair?  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, alright.  You must just tell me if you need 
10 
us to take a short adjournment of five minutes or so if you need to just 
get yourself in a position where you are able to continue to give 
evidence. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I am fine.  I am 
fine.  I can continue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
After 
FM09 
left 
I 
immediately contacted - contacted Colonel Roelofse and - and it so 
happened he did not turn up for our initial meeting because I later 
found out from this - from him he was delayed and he could not make 
20 
that meeting where I was waiting for him outside in the bakkie but this I 
found out later but after FM09 left I immediately contacted - contacted 
Colonel Roelofse and I told him that I need to meet him very, very 
urgently. 
We made arrangements Chair to meet at a Roman’s Pizza.  
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 22 of 156 
 
This was in Edenvale in Van Riebeeck Street or Van Riebeeck Road if I 
remember correctly.  This was about five or seven kilometres from my 
house. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this was roundabout what time when you …? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  This was still - still 
probably … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before 12? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Be - before 12. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Probably 
before 
12 
10 
Chair, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair then I was faced 
with another dilemma to getting to this meeting because at that stage 
the bakkie that I came back with was - the way my house is - is situated 
the bakkie is clearly (jump in audio) wife’s car was parked next to the 
bakkie. 
So I - I were - I was just afraid if I use my own vehicle which 
- which is the bakkie the State vehicle that somebody might - might be 
surveilling my house and I could not use the bakkie and I could not 
20 
phone anybody because at that stage all of my friends were my actual 
colleagues from Crime Intelligence. 
So I could not phone anybody help - for help.  At that stage 
my wife was fully aware Chair of what was going on.  I am referring now 
to the - to my meeting with the Hawks - the initial meeting the second 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 23 of 156 
 
meeting of the 18 t h and the 19 t h and what transpired the night before … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And what happened the 
morning of the 21 s t and I explained to her that I needed to get to this 
meeting to meet Colonel Roelofse and my situation.  I am not sure if I 
suggested to her to take me there or she offered to take me there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair what happened 
next was like I said my wife’s vehicle was parked next - next to the 
bakkie.  The one side of the vehicle - I am referring to my wife’s car - 
10 
was partially visible on one side from the road side.  On the other side 
was the - the left hand side of the vehicle was not visible from the road 
side. 
So I told my wife that we needed to get - I - before I got in - 
into the vehicle I explained to her where we needed to - to go to.  So 
she had a - an idea of where we are going to go.  Chair if I had walked 
out normally to the car there was still a chance that somebody might 
see me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So I crawled on the 
20 
paving Chair.  I crawled … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You crawled? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I crawled on the paving 
so that I was not visible from - to - to the - to the road … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 24 of 156 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  If anybody was watching. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I crawled on the paving 
towards the side of the vehicle which was not visible from - from the 
road side. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I opened the left side 
passenger - back passenger door.  I crawled into the car Chair and I 
hid myself behind the front two seats. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Just so that nobody 
could see me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair while of - while all 
of this was happening my wife was - she was watching through the 
kitchen window and once I was in the vehicle she came into the car. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I told my wife 
whatever she does do not ever look back and speak to me.  She must 
just look in her rear-view mirror. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please just repeat that. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I - I told my wife that if 
she speaks to me when she jumped into the car do not ever look back. 
She must not turn her head back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Yes. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 25 of 156 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  She must just look into 
her - into her rear-view mirror.  So I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  She jumped into the car 
and I told her to reverse and she must be careful.  Check the - the 
surrounding areas if there is any vehicles parked around.  She did this 
and it was clear.  So I told her to continue.  I explained to her more or 
less where we need to get to. 
Chair it was - like I said it was about five or seven 
kilometres.  As we were continuing getting to this point where we 
10 
needed to be.  I told her to continue checking her rear-view mirrors if 
anybody was following us.  I told her to look out for the vehicles - 
which vehicles to look out for - specific ones. 
My colleagues at that stage I knew what vehicles they were 
driving.  So I told her to look out for these vehicles.  She continued 
Chair.  We eventually got to where I needed to be to meet 
Colonel Roelofse but all the while on this journey to - to get to where 
we needed to be at I - I was continuously speaking to her. 
Just checking to see if she was okay.  Chair I must also say 
at this point my wife is a civilian.  This was quite extreme for her to do 
20 
something like this.  So I was quite concerned for her … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  As well - for her safety … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But like I said I had no 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 26 of 156 
 
other choice.  That was the only person I could have trusted at that 
stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So I continuously was 
speaking to her - conversing with her.  Telling her to check her - her 
mirrors, any cars that were following.  As we got closer to the point 
where I needed to meet Colonel Roelofse I again told her to check one 
last time if she sees any suspicious vehicles. 
She told me that she could not see any vehicles.  At that 
stage where I needed to be the robot was actually red and I quickly 
10 
jumped off.  I told her to go - before I jumped off Chair I told my wife to 
go straight home and wait for my call.  Chair when I jumped out of the 
vehicle I ran into a bookshop across the Roman’s Pizza where I was 
going to meet Colonel Roelofse. 
This was merely to - oh - oh I am jumping the gun a bit.  I - I 
ran into the bookshop.  I pretended to - to be buying a book.  So I was 
looking at a book but while I was doing that I was just checking the exit 
and seeing if anybody was following me.  I waited in the - in the 
bookshop for about probably five minutes. 
Also not to arouse any suspicion from - from the shop owner.  
20 
I could not be there too long.  When I felt that it was all clear I 
proceeded to the Roman’s Pizza.  I am not sure who got there first.  
Whether I was there first or Colonel Roelofse was already there but 
what I can say is that I met with him and I explained to him Chair 
exactly all of the events from the night or the previous - the previous 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 27 of 156 
 
night and - and the morning of the - the 20 t h.  Pardon me Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The 21 s t. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  The 21 s t. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Before - sorry.  Also 
Chair, before - before I could tell him all of these things he asked me if 
I - if I minded if Colonel Viljoen joined us for the meeting and I - I told 
him I did not mind.  So Colonel Viljoen also joined us for that meeting.  
I … 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Was 
Colonel Viljoen 
the 
one 
that 
was 
with 
10 
Colonel Roelofse or - when they interviewed you on the 18 t h and the 
19 t h? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Indeed.  That is correct 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  He - he joined us for the 
meeting and I explained to both of them what exactly had transpired the 
night before and the morning of the 21 s t.  Chair at that stage I am not 
sure if he mentioned witness protection.  By - by this stage - I must 
also add when I got to this meeting Chair I was physically upset. 
20 
I think my hands were shaking by the time I got to - to 
Colonel Roelofse. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  He also - he could see 
that I was - I was not in - in a - in a good space. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 28 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  At that stage Chair I am 
not sure if he mentioned witness protection but after - we probably 
lasted about half an hour Chair - that meeting.  He asked me if I could 
meet him in Pretoria in the evening.  I think I told him I am not sure but 
I will try. 
Chair I went back home or rather when the meeting was over 
they left first and I phoned my wife. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you proceed.  You said you were not sure 
whether he mentioned witness protection at that meeting? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that because although witness protection was 
discussed at some stage you are not sure whether it was discussed at 
that meeting? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That - that evening Chair 
I was together with my family.  We were actually placed in the witness 
protection but like I am saying I am not sure if Colonel Roelofse at that 
moment or in that meeting of the morning of the 21 s t mentioned witness 
protection to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alight. 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I cannot be certain. 
CAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So you called your wife after Colonels Roelofse 
and Viljoen had left? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair.  
After they left I called my wife and I asked her to come fetch me but I 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 29 of 156 
 
told her not to - to come to - to the same place where she dropped me 
off.  I told her to park around the block of where she initially dropped 
me off.  Chair when she arrived I - I did the same as I came to the 
meeting. 
I jumped into the back of the car and hid myself be - behind 
the two seats and we went straight home.  Also Chair continuously 
speaking to my wife telling her to check her whereabouts.  See if any 
vehicles were following us.  Chair the - the period that - after I got 
home is a bit hazy for me.  I am not sure - I - I was really not in a good 
space after I got home. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I think I laid down for a 
while.  Probably had a nap for an hour or two.  I cannot remember.  
That is a bit hazy for me but what I can recall that afternoon of the 21 s t 
Colonel Roelofse contacted me and asked me if I could meet him at his 
officers.  This - this is now the Hawk’s Offices in Silverton. 
Chair, I - I think I told Colonel Roelofse I will - I will try my 
best to get to that meeting.  Chair we also had - were also expecting 
some visitors that evening.  So my wife could not drive me.  So I 
decided to take a chance and drive myself there.  I waited for it to get a 
20 
bit dark - for the sun to set. 
I put on a cap and I lay a bit low in the car and drove to 
Pretoria.  Also myself kept checking if there was anybody that was 
following me while I was driving to Pretoria.  When I got to the Hawk’s 
Offices Colonel Roelofse was there.  Also present was General Hankel.  
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 30 of 156 
 
I think that Colonel Roelofse had already briefed Colonel Hankel of my 
situation and the incidents that - that happened prior - the day before 
in the morning of the 21 s t. 
General Hankel said to me from what he has heard so far he 
genuinely sees that there is a threat on my life and that I should go into 
the Witness Protection Program. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was General Hankel? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Arrangements 
were 
10 
subsequently made for the task force.  They - they escorted me from 
the Hawk’s Offices back to my house in Kempton Park.  Chair but 
before - before - I am jumping the gun a bits.  Before we left I phoned 
my wife and told that she needs to politely get rid of the visitors that 
we had … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And that she needs to 
pack a bag for each one of us - an overnight bag and she needed to do 
that very, very quickly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I was escorted via 
the task team back to my house.  I am not sure at that stage - I cannot 
recall who - who brought my car - my wife’s car back.  I think it was one 
of the task … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Has you used your …? 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 31 of 156 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  One of the members of 
the task. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had you used your wife’s car to go to the Hawk’s 
Offices? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  At that stage it was 
probably one of the members of the task team that escorted or rather 
drove my wife’s car back to my house but I myself was escorted by a 
team from the task team - task team.  I think it was four of five of them.  
10 
When we got there my wife was very - she had already packed bags for 
each one of us. 
My wife’s sister who lives not far from us Chair - like I 
testified to on Friday this is the same residence that was broken into.  
She came to - to basically just - we basically just hand over everything 
to my wife’s sister.  The keys of the house and our - some of our 
personal things.  This also might be quite hazy for me. 
I cannot remember all the detail but in essence this is what 
happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  We were taken back - 
this is my family.  Myself, my wife and my two kids.  We were escorted 
back to the Hawk’s Offices in Silverton.  This was probably around nine 
- 9 o’ clock in the evening Chair.  I cannot remember exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When - when you went back to the … 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 32 of 156 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Went back - we were … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hawk’s Offices? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is indeed correct 
Chair.  We - we were taken back to the Hawk’s Offices.  Our cellphones 
- all our communication was taken away from us.  The only thing that 
we - I retained was a laptop.  We were subsequently handed over to 
members of the witness protection and I was temporary transferred 
from Crime Intelligence into the Witness Protection Program that was 
21 October 2011. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And that is as far as I 
can take it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Regarding this Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo what happened that Sunday 
23 October 2011? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair by this stage I was 
- well my family and I were already placed into the Witness Protection 
Program.  I generally buy the newspaper on a Sunday.  So I asked one 
20 
of my protectors to get the newspaper for me.  It was a Sunday Times.  
This is now 23 October 2011 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  On the front page of the 
Sunday Times was an article regarding General Dramat.  It was 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 33 of 156 
 
something to do with renditions.  I cannot recall the - the exact content 
of the article … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But that is what - that 
was basically what it was.  It was - it was regarding General Dramat 
and renditions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what did you think when you read that 
article? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Chair 
all 
of 
the 
10 
stand-alone incidents that I spoke of the previous as - as per my 
testimony previously as spinning a story and the incident that happened 
at the Holiday Inn when we - when FM09 told me to stay away from 
General Dramat and General Sibiya.  So this article - when I read the 
article it made sense to me and solidified my belief that journalists 
were being used by Crime Intelligence to plant stories in the media 
because Chair all of these things happened within a few days. 
The - the first incidents of spinning a story came at 
General Lazarus’ house from FM09.  That was on the 20 t h and the same 
evening 
he 
spoke 
of 
staying 
away 
from 
General Dramat 
and 
20 
General Sibiya and on the 21 s t - the 23 r d which was Sunday the 23 r d.  It 
was just a matter of a few days Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Which like I said I 
strongly believed that this article was planted in the paper using 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 34 of 156 
 
journalists. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo are you aware of any other 
instances where Crime Intelligence have used journalists to further 
their agenda? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair.  I - I have 
knowledge of three instances where journalists were either paid or used 
by Crime Intelligence.  One is - Chair this was early or rather late 
2009/2010.  I cannot be sure.  General Mdluli told me that he is 
meeting with the journalists. 
10 
Basically the essence of the conversation that I had was this 
journalist had information on Crime Intelligence that would have been 
detrimental had it been published. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  He needed - I think it 
was 20 or R25 000,00.  It was - basically he had to pay this journalist 
off. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  He did not give me the 
name of the journalist nor the - the publication that the journalist 
20 
worked for.  I eventually got to General Lazarus.  I explained to him the 
conversation that I had with General Mdluli and that he needed the 
cash.  I filled in an advance form for the amount of - it was either 20 or 
25 000. 
I cannot be sure.  When I got to General Lazarus for his 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 35 of 156 
 
signature for approval he said that I should not take the advance.  I do 
not know what was his reason.  He did not give me any reasons but he 
just said that I should not take the advance on my name.  FM08 was at 
his office at that moment. 
He asked - this is now General Lazarus - asked FM08 to take 
the advance on - on his name which he did.  He subsequently secured 
the cash and gave it - handed it over to me the cash and I subsequently 
handed it over to General Mdluli.  I am not sure where he was.  He was 
either at his office or I met him at OR Tambo International Airport. 
I cannot be sure but I did - what I am sure is that I did 
10 
eventually handed him - handed General Mdluli the - the cash that I had 
received from FM08.  Chair I am not sure how this - this particular 
advance was reconciled and I did not hear of - of this incident again 
neither from FM08 or General Mdluli.  That was the first instance. 
The second instance is I was in General Lazarus’ office.  I 
cannot remember the time period Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know whether it would have still been around 
the end of 2011? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair, I - I cannot be - I 
cannot be … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot remember. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I cannot be certain Chair 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And I do not want to 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 36 of 156 
 
speculate as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  General Lazarus was in 
his office.  FM09 was also present.  They were having a conversation.  
I am not sure what it was about but they seemed to be unsettled.  FM09 
then said to General Lazarus in my presence while I was there - this is 
now General Lazarus’ office Chair. 
He said that Marshall is waiting or rather Marshall needs an 
answer as a journalist is waiting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And who  
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So what I - I was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And who was Marshall? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair previously FM - 
FM09 had told me that Marshall is actually ex Crime Intelligence Head 
General Mulangi Mphego. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  He said that Marshall is 
waiting or rather Marshall is - this is not the exact words Chair from - 
from … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But the essence of that 
conversation was that Marshall needs an answer because the 
journalists are waiting … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Or journalist is waiting. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173

CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is what I picked up 
from that conversation and General Lazarus said pay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That was the second 
instance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you get to know how much was to be paid … 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On that occasion? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair.  There was no 
- there was no figure mentioned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  He just said pay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair the third instance 
of - of journalists either being paid or having some connection with 
Crime Intelligence I know of a female journalist by the name of 
Ranjeni Munusamy.  She is - I think she is a current Sunday Times 
journalist. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair if - this - in this 
instance I have more detail because I was personally involved.  If I can 
just have … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 38 of 156 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
A 
few 
moments 
to 
explain. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair during 2008 I was 
called by Assistant Commissioner Mphego.  Chair I am just using the 
ranks that they used at that stage.  This was 2008. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I was called by Assistant 
Commissioner Mphego to his office.  This is - and I must make mention 
at 
that 
stage 
Commissioner Mphego 
was 
the 
Head 
of 
Crime 
10 
Intelligence.  He was the Divisional Commissioner. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  He called me to his 
office.  He said he has this contact.  Her name is Jenny.  He gave me 
her cellphone number and that she is having problems with her vehicle 
and that I must make contact with her and see how we can help her.  
Chair I left - I left his office and I subsequently went to 
General Lazarus’ office and I explained to him that what was required 
of me. 
At that stage I am not sure who this person was.  I did not 
20 
meet her previously.  I do not know who she was.  She was just 
mentioned as Jenny.  At that stage I cannot recall if General Lazarus 
explained to me who this person was but I can confirm that it was 
indeed Ranjeni Munusamy that I met. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 39 of 156 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I met her on three 
occasions - probably two or three occasions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that after - the first meeting you had with her 
was it after you had called her on the number that Mr Mphego had 
given to you? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair, I - I contacted her 
to make arrangements to meet with her to collect a vehicle so that we 
can have it repaired. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but I just want to confirm whether … 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Used the number that Mr Mphego had given to you? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I am not sure when 
making the arrangements to pick up her vehicle.  I am not sure if I 
introduced myself to her or not or when I met her first and explained to 
her who I was but subsequently or - or rather before - before contacting 
her I asked General Lazarus how we going to fix this vehicle. 
20 
Who are we going - who are we going to send it to.  He told 
me that I should pick up the vehicle from this individual and take it to 
New World Motors.  Chair New World Motors is a supplier or service 
provider to Company X regarding - they do repairs to vehicles, 
servicing etcetera, tyres and all of that stuff. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 40 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Vehicle related matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you refer to Company X are you referring to the 
same company to which Colonel Roelofse also referred as Company X? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is indeed correct 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but let us just go back a little bit.  You had a 
discussion with Mr Mphego and he told you about this person that he 
said had a problem with her car but you say then thereafter you went to 
General Lazarus.  Did you find that General - General Lazarus was 
10 
aware of the issue? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I cannot - I am not too 
sure … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot say? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But he was not - he was 
not surprised that I mentioned this individual.  Like I said at that stage 
I am not sure if he - he mentioned or - or told me who she was.  I am 
not sure … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But he was not surprised. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it clear from what Mr Mphego told you what you 
were supposed to do?  What he expected you to do? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair he did not give me 
a specific instruction … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 41 of 156 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But he said this person 
was having problems with her vehicle and that I must make contact with 
her and see how we can help her or sort out the problems. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  This is now not the 
conversation I had with him … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but … 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But that is what I can 
recall Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The essence of it? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would - would that kind of request in the very terms 
in which it was be - would it have been normal to receive that kind of 
request in those kinds of vague terms from people high up in the - in 
Crime Intelligence?  I am asking that because you do not seem to have 
asked who is this person.  Why should we help her or anything like 
that? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair also you remember 
the environment of Crime Intelligence it is not your normal environment, 
normal police system. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So it was not anything 
out of the ordinary for me at that stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  Yes, okay and then you went to General 
Lazarus but he seemed to – did he give you more details of what you 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 42 of 156 
 
were supposed to do? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Not General Lazarus as 
such. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Because he did not, 
Commissioner Mpego also was very vague at that stage, she did not 
give me any specific, what specifically that I had to but except to – 
there was something wrong with the vehicle and we needed to attend to 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.   And what happened after your 
10 
discussion with General Lazarus? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  He told me that we 
should, or rather I should take the vehicle to New World Motors like I 
explained it New World Motors does servicing of repairs, vehicle 
related matters, it is a supplier to Company X, or service provider to 
Company X. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   I eventually met with – 
Chair I am not sure how you pronounce her name, her surname it is 
Moonsamy or Munusamy I am not too sure but it is something to that 
20 
effect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I met her ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  The same person that Mr Mpego had asked 
...[intervenes]  
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 43 of 156 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Chair I met her at – we 
made arrangements to meet at an Engen Garage, I am not going to say 
where because it is very close to our house. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I met Munusamy on three 
occasions, two or three occasions, I would phone her, well okay I am  
jumping the gun a bit Chair, let me just say how we met the first time.  I 
made arrangements, I contacted her, I made arrangements to meet her.  
10 
We met at an Engen Garage, which is not far from our house.  It is 
either I explained to her who I was over the phone, or when I met her, 
that was – that would have been obvious because she would not have 
given me her car, so she knew who I was at that stage when I met her, 
physically met her.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And you cannot remember whether this – or this was 
in 2008 you said? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Probably 2008 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, alright. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Probably thereabout. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot remember the month and so on? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair if the documents 
are shown to me, because there was an invoice put in for this car for 
payment I can confirm that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, okay alright, yes continue.  And what was 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 44 of 156 
 
the discussion you had with her on the first occasion that you met? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair if I can remember 
correctly there wasn’t much talk, I introduced myself and I told her that 
I was sent by Commission Mpego and that we needed to sort this car 
out.  She handed over the keys and I subsequently took the car to New 
World Motors.  Chair like I said I met this individual on three occasions.  
I cannot remember the logistics of getting there and all of that, it is not 
very clear how I got there and how she got to where she needed to be 
but what I can confirm is that I did take the vehicle from her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you took her vehicle and you took it to – did you 
10 
say New World Motors? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair on 
the instruction of General Lazarus. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and did she go with you in the car when you took 
the car to New World Motors? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I took the car off her 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, do you know how she was going to travel from 
there, from where you met to – back to whatever she wanted to go, was 
20 
there somebody else in another car or what? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair like I said I am not 
sure about the logistics of the whole thing.  It is not very clear to me, I 
cannot recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  But you took her car to New World Motors? 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 45 of 156 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And was the idea that whatever was wrong with it was 
going to be fixed at New World Motors? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you get to understand what was wrong with the 
car? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I am not sure, I am 
not too sure but what I can confirm is that the tyres on that specific 
vehicle was replaced with new tyres.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It was serviced, I think 
the radio was faulty, I am not sure if it was fixed or replaced and also I 
think the seat, one of the seats in the car needed some attention. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But what I can confirm is 
all of this – okay I am jumping the gun again a bit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you brought the car to New World Motors the 
information you gave them was it on the basis that you would be the 
one who would pick it up once it – they had repaired it, or were the 
arrangements such that she could come and pick it up once it was 
20 
ready? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No, no Chair I would pick 
up the vehicle once it was ready and take it back to her – to Ms 
Munusamy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the information that you gave them about the 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 46 of 156 
 
vehicle did it include anything to say the vehicle was hers, giving them 
her name or was it brought there on the basis that it was a car from 
Crime Intelligence? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair there was no, 
none of her information was given to the service provider by myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Including her name? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it was simply written on the basis of your name? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright, yes.  Continue. 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair the ...[intervenes]  
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Colonel Naidoo what happened after the 
tyres were replaced? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   This was actually Chair 
if I can remember correctly obviously I would have to tell the service 
provider, New World Motors, what repairs needed to be carried out, he 
needed to know, so I am not sure it would have probably come from Ms 
Munusamy, I cannot recall, but there had to be some instruction as to 
what needed to be done on the vehicle, I cannot recall that part. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, would ...[intervenes]  
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But what I can say is like 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I take it that whatever you told them would have been 
written down on their records. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 47 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm, okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair the vehicle, I think 
it was one or two weeks and the vehicle was repaired, probably after a 
week I got a call from the owner of New World Motors, Mr Joe Marks, 
he told me the vehicle is ready and that I should fetch it.  I took it back 
to Ms Munusamy and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well when you brought the vehicle to New World 
Motors what did you tell New World Motors as to who would be 
responsible for the payment for the repair of the motor vehicle? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair there was none of 
10 
that discussion that took place, New World Motors was a service 
provider or supplier to Company X, so ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  So would the understanding between you and New 
World Motors when you brought the vehicle would it have been that 
they would invoice Company X? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, continue. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Chair I subsequently 
picked up the vehicle and handed it back to Ms Munusamy, it was 
probably a week or two later that I got a call from Commissioner 
20 
Mpego, he enquired from me as to why we did not run flat tyres on that 
specific vehicle, referring to Ms Munusamy’s vehicle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What tyres?    
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Run flat tyres. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 48 of 156 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   I picked up the vehicle, 
made arrangements again to pick up the vehicle from Ms Munusamy, 
took it back to New World Motors, I had those specific tyres fitted on 
and took it back to her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that was the same day thing? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I am not sure, I am 
not sure if it was done on the same day, it is probably a day or two, I 
cannot recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But what I can confirm 
10 
was the tyres were replaced, with those specific ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you remember what type of car it was? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair it was a silver 
BMW convertible, I am not sure, yes it was a silver BMW. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Convertible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.   Yes continue – so you took it back to her 
so that was your third meeting with her? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Second meeting Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well wasn’t the second meeting when you took it back 
20 
for the first time? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Oh, yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or when you took it ...[intervenes]  
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Oh yes, yes, you are 
correct. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 49 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it was the third meeting. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Indeed correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   Was there any discussion of any consequence 
between yourself and her when you returned the car for the first time 
and when you returned the car for the second time? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair are you referring to 
insofar as any payment for the car? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whatever that you – was really of importance that 
could be important that you can tell us? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Not that I can recall 
10 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was just handing over the car? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, continue. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Like I said I am not sure 
if I met her two or three times in this manner but what I can recall this 
will be now either the third or the fourth term, I met her at her house 
Chair, I remember this clearly because it was a Sunday.  Commissioner 
Mpego called me and he said that this – well he mentioned her by – not 
by name but he said this contact had a problem with her vehicle it 
20 
wasn’t starting, so I had to go to her house ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, this is now a different occasion from the 
three meetings that you have told us or is it one of the three meetings? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
This 
is 
a 
different 
meeting Chair. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 50 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, after which came after the first three? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay maybe let us take the tea adjournment now and 
then when we come back you can then continue. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Okay thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Wentzel is that alright? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Yes, that is good Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright, we will take the tea adjournment, it is quarter 
past eleven, we will resume at half past eleven.   
 
We adjourn. 
10 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us continue Ms Wentzel and Colonel Naidoo. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo can you hear us? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo you were dealing with the 
third occasion that you went… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think the fourth occasion. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes the fourth occasion. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  But I think the third occasion that you went to 
collect Ms Montsame’s car from her.  
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Like I mentioned earlier 
this now is either the third or the fourth occasion. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 51 of 156 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That I fetched the car. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  This was on a … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe it is the fourth occasion you met with Ms 
Montsame but I do not know whether it would the third or whatever 
occasion you fetched the car but as I understood your evidence it 
certainly would be the fourth occasion on which you met her. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Just refresh our memory again how did 
10 
this come about? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair this was on a 
Sunday Commissioner Mphego phoned me he said the contact referring 
to then the – I cannot recall the exact conversation but in essence it 
was the car was not starting and he asked me to make arrangements to 
get it sorted out.  I contacted Mr Joe Marks of New World Motors the 
supplier to Company X.  We got the vehicle towed – well he towed the 
vehicle back to his workshop and I am not sure exactly what was wrong 
with the vehicle Chair but it was not starting.  That was the whole 
purpose of – of getting it towed away. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And are you able to recall how far apart these 
incidents were that last time you took the car to Ms Montsame after the 
issue of flat tyres and this occasion when you met her for the fourth 
time? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair the first two or 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 52 of 156 
 
three occasions as I mentioned was probably within a period of a few 
weeks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  The last – the last 
occasion when I say the last – the fourth – the third or fourth one was 
probably a week or a few weeks later.  I cannot really recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  As – ja okay alright.  Continue.  So you 
went to the house? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  This was on – this was 
the only occasion that I have been to her house Chair.  Like I said the 
10 
previous occasions I would meet her at a garage near her house.  This 
was on one occasion and the last one that I went to her house.  Her 
vehicle was eventually towed away.  Like I said I am not sure exactly 
what was wrong but it was eventually fixed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you find her in the house? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I remember going inside 
her house I think to fetch the key. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Yes so the car was – you made arrangements for 
20 
the car to be towed to Nowells. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Pardon me Chair I did 
not hear the last one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you make arrangements for the car – for her car 
to be taken to or towed to Nowells? 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 53 of 156 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  New World Motors Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  New World – oh New World Motors. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  New World Motors yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You – that – you made arrangements for it to be 
towed to New World Motors? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair that was when I 
10 
returned a vehicle after it had been repaired or fixed that was the last 
time I met Ms Montsame well at least as far as the car goes. I met her 
once subsequent to that which I will explain later.  But coming back to 
the vehicle itself Chair the amount of R40 000,00 was paid from the 
Secret Services Account for the repairs to this vehicle. Initially I was 
going to put in a claim for – for the repairs and General Lazarus said 
that I should not.  Instead Colonel Barnard put in a claim.  This was 
now for all of the – all of the – for the tyres. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For all the work done by… 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  All the work including the 
20 
run flat tyres. 
CHAIRPERSON:  New World Motors. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  The initial repairs that is 
indeed correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 54 of 156 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  The vehicle – the – 
pardon me.  The claim was put in by Colonel Barnard.  I – from what I 
can recall it was R40 000.00 but I can confirm when I see the – or if I 
am shown the documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Such a claim would have been put in by Colonel 
Barnard on – on what basis?  What would have been written in the 
claim to legitimise it or to make it look like it was legitimate? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair like I said this is 
not your normal police system it is very broad.  It would have – it – this 
was a private vehicle so it would not have been posted against any 
10 
Crime Intelligence vehicle SR vehicle if you can call it.  It would have 
been probably motivation would have been probably for a contact 
person or something to that – to that extent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you ever see the actual claim? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I cannot recall Chair I 
cannot recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether you saw it? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I cannot recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you – you not sure what would have been written 
on the claim documents? 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  But you say the amount was as far as 
you can recall around R40 000.00? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 55 of 156 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I remember the amount I 
think because like I – like I mentioned earlier I was the person who was 
putting the claim in initially.  So I would have seen the documents and 
subsequently Colonel Barnard put in a claim.  So I probably would have 
seen the documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was there any particular reason why General Lazarus 
said you should not be the one putting in the claim? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:    He did not say Chair.  
He did not say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay alright. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Colonel Naidoo.  Colonel Naidoo 
after you were placed in witness protection did you provide the Hawks 
with any affidavits? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is indeed correct. 
On the 25 October 2011 I deposed to an affidavit to Colonel Lieutenant 
Colonel Piet Viljoen from the Hawks.  That was my first affidavit – one 
of many.  I think in total I deposed to eleven – eleven in all over a 
period of time.  
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And if you have regard to Annexure DGN13 
there is an affidavit at page 124 which runs to 140.  Is that this what 
20 
you call the “Blanket Affidavit” that you deposed to? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  That is the affidavit starting at page 124? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that – so that was the affidavit deposed to by you 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 56 of 156 
 
on the 24 October 2011, is that right? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair.  
25 t h Chair, 25 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  25? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that appears at page 140 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  40. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see that no name is given on page 124 which is the 
first page of the affidavit as to who the person is who is deposing to the 
affidavit.  That was done deliberately is that right? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
.CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but it is your affidavit? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo how long have you been in 
witness protection? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair the next month the 
21 s t October will be 8 years. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And in those 8 years have you been called to 
testify in any criminal proceedings against any of the people you have 
20 
implicated? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you been told why that is so? Namely why such 
a long time has lapsed without being – without you being called to 
testify in any criminal proceedings relating to the people you have – 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 57 of 156 
 
you implicated in your statements to the Hawks? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I have had 
numerous consultations over a period of time with Colonel Roelofse and 
at 
times 
he 
had 
expressed 
his 
frustrations 
regarding 
certain 
documentations that were not forthcoming. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But outside of that I 
cannot say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Did he say that the delay was caused by the 
fact that there were seven documents that required to be declassified 
10 
but were not being declassified? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo did you testify at disciplinary 
proceedings against General Lazarus 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair.  In 
2013 I appeared on behalf of the SAPS as a witness in these 
proceedings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Ms Wentzel I kind did have some understanding 
why you started with the circumstances surrounding Colonel Naidoo’s 
20 
being placed on the witness protection program and not starting with 
the incidents which happened before that happened. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I – I think that is where you should go before the 
disciplinary hearing because I think the disciplinary hearing would have 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 58 of 156 
 
happened long after those incidents have happened.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes it is true Chair the only reason to do this 
is to put in context before we hear the incidences as to why it was that 
Colonel Naidoo decided to come clean as it were and I think if – if the 
public could understand… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But he – but he comes clean after knowing certain 
incidents, certain events. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  No Chair I am in your hands. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So… 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I am perfectly happy to deal with that at a 
10 
different stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is much more logical if we… 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Actually it might have been better even to start with 
those events – those incidents. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And following logically up to the time he went onto 
the witness protection.  But I kind of condoned you starting with the 
circumstances surrounding… 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The witness protection but we should start with the 
events. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  We will do that now Chair.  Before Colonel 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 59 of 156 
 
Naidoo we start with the events could you tell the Chair what your 
history has been in the South African Police Services? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I – I joined the 
police in 2002 as a clerk and placed within the division Crime 
Intelligence.  That same year November I was transferred to KZN Crime 
Intelligence gathering.  I was placed in the Provincial office also as a 
clerk.  I think it was 2004 I applied for a transfer back to Crime 
Intelligence National Head Office.  There I was placed in one of the 
operational teams.  This was in 2004.  Crime Intelligence Gathering the 
National Head Office. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And who did you work under? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  At that stage it was 
Colonel Malaza, V S Malaza. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what were your duties? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It was – it was – it was 
administrative duties but in a covert environment because this was like 
I mentioned it was an operational team.  All the members working at 
this office were undercover intelligence operatives.  A decision was 
taken by the commander that none of the operatives should go to – to 
our Head Office.  I am referring to the Crime Intelligence Head Office.  
20 
So I was delegated – I was the person delegated to take care of all of 
these administrative duties at the Crime Intelligence Head Office.  In 
2006 I was promoted still within Crime Intelligence I was promoted to 
the rank of Warrant Officer.  Here I was undercover intelligence 
operative.  This was probably for about a year and a half.  For a brief 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 60 of 156 
 
period I was under the direct command of Colonel Manie Victor.  In 
2010 or rather before that in – in around 2007 I was transferred to the 
Secret Service Account.  I reported to Colonel Barnard who in turn 
reported to General Lazarus. In 2010 I was promoted to the rank of 
Lieutenant Colonel.  That was within the 250 cover posts within Crime 
Intelligence and I occupied or I was placed within the facility 
management and I occupied that post until the 21 October 2011 until I 
was placed – temporarily transferred into the witness protection 
program.  That is very briefly my employment history. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is your status at Crime Intelligence as we speak 
10 
as you understand it?  You went into the witness protection program at 
a time when you were – you were employed at Crime Intelligence.  
What is – do you – are you still employed by them or is the position 
that having been in the witness program for so long you are no longer 
employed by them? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair just to give you 
some insight as far as I know.  I am still a member of Crime 
Intelligence.  I still hold that rank.  My transfer was temporary into the 
witness protection program. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I still receive a salary 
from the police. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay alright thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And Colonel Naidoo could you explain to the 
Chair how you understood the Secret Service Account worked and what 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 61 of 156 
 
the procedure was to obtain funding from the Secret Service Account? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair in essence the 
very, very in the short summary it is a covert fund Chair.  It is a fund 
that funds are received from National Treasury and it is allocated to the 
police well more especially Crime Intelligence.  It is utilised by Crime 
Intelligence to pay for goods and services, purchases of assets, 
equipment, and vehicles etcetera required for – for undercover 
operations.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So is it basically for most if not all the operational 
needs of Crime Intelligence? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And Colonel Naidoo how – what procedures 
were in place in order to obtain funding whether it be to purchase 
equipment or for an undercover operation or to pay an informer.  What 
procedure would have to be followed? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I think I am not 
going to go too much into the detail because it is a covert environment 
so I do not want to go too much into the detail but I will just use a very 
simply example. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Because it is a general 
thing.  I am going to use myself as an example.  If I needed money for 
– for petrol for my vehicle which is a state vehicle I would have to get 
an advance form.  Fill in an advance form, get it signed by my 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 62 of 156 
 
commander, take it to the cash office – advance office as they call it, 
that will just – that will then be captured on their system as an 
outstanding advance against my name.  Those funds would then 
subsequently be handed over to me which I have to sign for as 
receiving those funds.  Monies would then be utilised for that specific 
purpose in this case being petrol.  At the end of – and obviously 
receipts will have to be kept for purchases of petrol.  At the end of the 
month I would have to compile a claim.  Chair it is just very simple.  If 
there was an overspend meaning if there was more than R2 000.00 
spent in this particular month once it has been captured on the system 
10 
that money will be reimbursed to me.  If there is underspent it will 
reflect an amount owing against my name which I will have to pay back.  
So that is just using one example. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But by and large this is 
how the system worked and this is now the one leg I speak of where 
cash was used.  I go to the other leg where a Company X was in place. 
This was to pay for goods and services rendered to Crime Intelligence 
without – without exposing who the real recipients of these assets 
were.  So that is by and large how Crime Intelligence works.  That is at 
20 
least how I understand it to be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I just want to emphasise that you were right to be 
cautious about how you – about revealing how certain things work and 
in this regard I do ask you to be quite alert because you are familiar 
with the environment and with what is not supposed be generally 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 63 of 156 
 
revealed.  From time to time both Ms Wentzel and I might ask you 
questions that might require you to reveal something that should not be 
revealed publicly but when we do that we would not be aware 
necessarily that it is something that is not required to be revealed but 
you would know and you must just feel free to alert us to say that that 
is something that you would prefer not to reveal.  Alright? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Colonel Naidoo did you hear me? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair sorry I think there 
is a problem with the –  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  With the sound. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes there is a problem. 
Can – I am not sure… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know whether it is from your side? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I cannot hear you very 
clearly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot hear me? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No.  At this moment I can 
but the previous two minutes was a bit vague. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me try and repeat what I said and see whether 
20 
you will hear me. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if the problem arises again we might just need to 
adjourn for the technicians to attend to it. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Thank you Chair. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 64 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I was saying that in response to the question that Ms 
Wentzel put to you about how the Secret Service Account operates you 
did mention that because it relates to covert operations you did not 
want to reveal much but you used your own example. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I was saying Ms Wentzel and I may from time to 
time ask you questions that you might think require you to reveal 
something that should not be revealed publicly and when that happens 
it would not be deliberate on our part but it might just be because we 
are not used to that Crime Intelligence environment.  But because you 
10 
are used to it feel free to indicate that the answer that you would be 
required to give would reveal information that should not be revealed 
publicly.  You understand? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I will do so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Thank you.  Let us continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  Colonel Naidoo how did you 
become acquainted with General Lazarus? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair General Lazarus 
we actually played volleyball together in the same league I think it was 
in the ’90’s.  This was in Tongaat that is the town that we lived in there 
20 
at that stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is in KZN? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  General Lazarus is – we 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 65 of 156 
 
are also related by family Chair.  His wife in my mother’s cousin.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And how did you come to be employed at 
Crime Intelligence? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Around about 2002 Chair 
I was temporarily in Gauteng.  I was living with my sister at that stage.  
I was unemployed.  General Lazarus was aware of my situation and I 
am not sure how it came about but he – he actually drew up a CV for 
me and I was subsequently placed or employed within Crime 
Intelligence in 2002 I think it was June 21 s t there about. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And in what position were you employed? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I was a clerk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And who was the head of Crime Intelligence at that 
time if you able to remember? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It was Assistant 
Commissioner Raymond Lala. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  What happened after that – after your 
appointment to Crime Intelligence? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Well Ms Wentzel which 
20 
period you speaking of? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I am speaking of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  2002 after you had been appointed to Crime 
Intelligence. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 66 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  She is asked what happened after you started at 
Crime Intelligence? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  In terms of my 
employment history? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I can understand why your confusion Colonel 
Lazarus… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You might wish to direct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes during 2006/2007 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Were you involved with renovations to 
10 
General Lazarus’ home? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is indeed correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And… 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was that question again? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Was he involved in renovations to General 
Lazarus’ home? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Could you… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where are we on – what page are we on his 
statement now? 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Page 5 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes continue.  He has given an affirmative 
answer.  He was involved in renovations in General Lazarus’ house.  
How did that come about Colonel Naidoo? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair at that stage 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 67 of 156 
 
General Lazarus lives I think it is about four or five kilometres away 
from my house and I generally used to pick him up in the morning and 
drop him off at his office.  This was generally what happened.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Around about 2006/2007 
he began renovations at his home.  I was appointed a project manager 
and I said appointed project manager I say that in inverted commas 
because I could not have been the project manager I was employed by 
CI.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I was – I was basically 
there to oversee the renovations at his private home. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who – who did he have carry out the renovations in 
his house? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair he had private 
builders that were undertaking or carrying out the – the renovations.  I 
was just basically there to see – to oversee the project because on 
numerous times the builders would run short of – of building material 
and equipment.  I had to make sure that they had all of these things all 
the time. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I did not hear who you said was carrying out the 
renovations.  Do you want to repeat that? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair it was private – it 
was private individuals.  I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Private Contractor? 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 68 of 156 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright.  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you were asked – excuse me.  He asked you to be 
“a project manager” for the renovations? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair it was not a direct 
instruction.  It just happened over time and I can say this happened 
over a period of at least over a year when the renovations were 
eventually finished – completed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But I understood you to be saying he appointed 
10 
you to be the “project manager”.  Is the position that he did ask you to 
be the “project manager” or is the position that he kept – he kept on 
asking you to be involved in one or another with the renovations until 
you thought for all intends and purposes you were the “project 
manager”? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Indeed Chair.  It was not 
a direct instruction that you are now the project manager.  This 
happened over time because eventually like I will testify to later it was 
almost on a daily basis that I – like I said he – he travelled with me.  
Often I had to drop him off at his own office and come back to the site 
20 
because the builders would need one or other equipment, building 
supplies that they would run short of. So this happened quite often 
Chair over the period of the year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Continue … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And … 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 69 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Wentzel. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  At that stage who did you report to for your 
Crime Intelligence work? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair if I remember 
correctly I was - in 2006 I was promoted to the rank of Warrant Officer 
like I testified to as an undercover intelligence operative.  I think it was 
Colonel Manie Victor that we reported to.  Chair at that stage 
overseeing the - the project at - or the renovations to General Lazarus’ 
home 
it 
was 
affecting 
my 
ability 
to 
do 
my 
own 
job 
at 
Colonel Manie Victor’s home - office.  Sorry.  Pardon me. 
10 
So the arrangements were made or I expressed my concern 
to General Lazarus that I am getting pressure at my own office because 
I do not have the time to conduct normal police work that I should - 
should be doing.  So he said that he will speak to General Els.  I must 
make mention that General Els was a National Head of Crime 
Intelligence gathering at that stage. 
He would have been the person that Colonel Manie Victor 
reported to.  Arrangements or discussions between General Lazarus 
and General Els - well at least this is what General Lazarus informed 
me that he will speak to General Els for me to be transferred to the 
20 
Secret Service Account and that is when I was transferred to - to the 
Secret Service Account and I reported to Colonel Barnard. 
Colonel Barnard 
reported 
to 
General Lazarus 
who 
was 
basically his boss.  So this was actually - this arrangements was - new 
arrangements was made to facilitate me start overseeing the - the 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 70 of 156 
 
project at his - the renovations to General Lazarus’ house without really 
being pressured at work with normal duties that I should be performing. 
So there was no pressure for me at work.  So that basically in 
essence gave me the time to continue to oversee the - the project at 
General Lazarus’ home. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And at that stage who was the Chief Financial 
Officer for the Secret Service Account? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It was General Lazarus. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what was Colonel Barnard’s function to 
whom he reported? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Colonel Barnard was - 
was the Head of the Procurement Section which was a leg that fell 
within the Secret Service Account. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And in that position whilst you were not 
supervising the construction at General Lazarus’ house what would 
your duties have been? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  At that stage - well at 
least on paper I - I was supposed to be managing the vehicle fleet of 
Crime Intelligence. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL: 
 
Now 
how 
did 
you 
come 
to 
know 
20 
General Mdluli? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair General Mdluli was 
appointed if I can remember correctly in 2009.  I think it was 1 July.  
When he was first appointment - appointed - pardon me.  He - he had to 
- there was a lot of assets that he needed to in place for him to get 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 71 of 156 
 
going as the Divisional Commissioner.  Namely cars, cellphones a few 
other items. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This … 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Before … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Before you talk about General Mdluli in 
2009.  Have you exhausted what you need to tell me about in regard to 
the renovations at General Lazarus’ house?  Was there anything 
important in regard to your role there other than that the - you were 
using time that was meant for you to work at Crime Intelligence to 
actually oversee his private project in - in his house.  Is there - who - 
10 
who was paying - who was going to pay for those renovations and so 
on? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Chair 
it 
was 
him.  
General Lazarus undertook the - the financial - if there was anything to 
be paid he would give me money in terms of cash or cheques to pay for 
the various items that needed to be purchased. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where - where did he get that money from?  Was that 
money from his pocket?  Was that money from the Secret Service 
Account?  What was the position? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair at that stage this 
20 
was in 2006.  I cannot say for certain that he used funds from the 
Secret Service Account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So he - he gave you money and you did not 
know where - whether it was his money or not but you had no reason to 
think it might not be his money? 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 72 of 156 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair on … 
CHAIRPERSON:  At that stage. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  On numerous occasions 
he gave me cash which he had in his bag that he carried to work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I cannot say for certain 
that it was his own money … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Or it was money from the 
Secret Service Account. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Could you now turn Colonel Naidoo to explain 
how you first came to know General Mdluli? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Like I mentioned earlier 
General Mdluli was promoted - appointed sorry - in 2009, 1 July.  
General Lazarus was the CFO at that stage of the Secret Service 
Account.  General Mdluli liaised often with General Lazarus in order to 
get assets etcetera that he needed to get going in his post. 
20 
Seeing that I was - I had a close relationship with 
General Lazarus.  I would be the one or the person that General 
Lazarus would ask for me to help in the facilitation of - of getting these 
to General Mdluli. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When General Mdluli was appointed to Crime 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 73 of 156 
 
Intelligence he was appointed to the position of Head of Crime 
Intelligence.  He did not occupy a lower position in Crime Intelligence 
before that? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair General Mdluli was 
not in Crime Intelligence when he was appointed.  So I - I am not sure.  
He was in the police.  I - I speak under correction … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But he was not - he was 
not in the structure of Crime Intelligence … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  At that stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I think he was in SAPS. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Indeed yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  Continue Ms Wentzel. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And Colonel Naidoo who occupied the position 
General Mdluli took up before he was there? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Before he was appointed? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
It 
was 
Assistant 
Commissioner Mphego. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And after the appointment of General Mdluli 
what happened with regard to General Lazarus’ position? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Not so - so much in 
terms of his position but if I can recall correctly.  It was not long after 
that I am speaking of July 2009.  If I can recall correctly General Mdluli 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 74 of 156 
 
informed General Lazarus that he was going to be transferred out of the 
Secret Service Account. 
Not out of the - not out of Crime Intelligence but another 
component within Crime Intelligence. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what was General Lazarus’ reaction to 
that? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  He resisted the - the 
transfer.  This is at least what I picked up from the conversations that I 
had with him and this is my - and this is what I feel.  It is not fact.  I 
feel the resistance came because if he was indeed transferred out of 
10 
the Secret Service Account the person coming in to take charge would 
have access to all of the documents, the systems in place at Crime - at 
the Secret Service Account and I think that person would have been 
exposed to all of the corruption that is taking place at that unit. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo was General Lazarus in fact 
transferred? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  He was never transferred 
from that position. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what transpired do you believe to ensure 
that he was not transferred? 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I am going to read 
point 22 from page 006 and I will explain. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is paragraph 22 of your affidavit before this 
Commission at page 6? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Indeed. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 75 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Huh-uh. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  The heading is “The 
Involvement of General Bheki Cele” and its point 22. 
“At the time that General Mdluli was appointed 
General Bheki Cele was the National Commissioner 
of the SAPS and it was rumoured that whilst he had 
been a member of the Executive Committee of 
Transport in KwaZulu-Natal he had been involved in 
the 
awarding 
of 
large 
tenders 
to 
a 
local 
businessman 
Mr Panganathan 
also 
known 
as 
10 
Timmy Marimuthu.  Mr Marimuthu was a former 
police officer who I am informed was convicted of 
drug dealing.  However as far as I am aware he 
never served any custodial sentence for his - for - 
for this conviction and as a result of the tenders he 
obtained through Mr Bheki Cele he became very 
wealthy or extreme wealthy.” 
That is as per my statement Chair and if I can just explain 
what I have read out.  These - what is in my statement is what I picked 
up from - from having conversations with various of my colleagues at 
20 
Crime Intelligence.  I cannot say for sure that it happened on a specific 
day and who I spoke to. 
This was just what I picked up from general conversation over 
a number of - over a period of time from a number of my colleagues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So you - so you have - you have no knowledge 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 76 of 156 
 
whether what you heard with regard to General Bheki Cele was true or 
not? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair.  I cannot say 
what is in my statement is actually true.  This is what I heard.  If it is 
indeed true.  I - I cannot say for sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo was General Lazarus aware of 
the alleged association between General Cele and Mr Marimuthu? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes he was.  Like I said 
Chair earlier.  General Lazarus was informed by General Mdluli that he 
10 
was going to be transferred out of the Secret Service Account.  
Obviously there was resistance.  He was aware of this - this 
relationship between Mr Marimuthu and Bheki Cele. 
He subsequently made - made arrangements for a meeting to 
be held between himself and Bheki Cele as Mr Marimuthu would be the 
- the go to guy.  So to speak or the person who would facilitate this - 
this meeting. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And why do you believe that he wanted to 
have a meeting with General Cele? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  The initial meeting I 
20 
cannot recall exactly but there were several meetings held with General 
- between General Cele and General Lazarus as he would inform me 
that he is going to meet General Bheki Cele. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And were you ever present at any of these 
meetings? 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 77 of 156 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I was present - not 
actually at the meeting.  I cannot recall the exact year.  It probably 
would have been 2009 or rather not 2009.  Early 2009/2010.  It was at 
Mr Marimuthu’s house in Umhlanga Rocks in Durban.  We were there 
already. 
When I say we it was myself, General Lazarus and 
Mr Marimuthu.  They were waiting - (clearing throat) pardon me Chair.  
We … 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was the purpose of your visit to Mr Marimuthu in 
Umhlanga? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Chair 
the 
- 
General Lazarus was waiting for General Bheki Cele.  They were having 
a meeting.  We were probably there around - about two hours or so.  If 
I can remember correctly we have not even had some tea or some 
beverages. 
I 
am 
not 
too 
sure 
and 
closer 
to 
the 
time 
that 
General Bheki Cele arrived General Lazarus told me that it was not 
easy to organise a meeting with - with Bheki Cele and he made a call.  
This was in my presence Chair.  He made a call to another CI member 
which is FM08 to organise cash which I assumed was to be paid over to 
20 
General Cele when he eventually arrived for the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Wentzel you can see that in paragraph 24 there is 
no reference to FM08. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He has just said that person was FM08. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 78 of 156 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would you make sure that that is replaced with a 
page that has got that? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  I will. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And check whether there are any other gaps in the 
affidavit. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  We did discover gaps and it is being 
attended to now Chair and that will be replaced. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Were you - was General Lazarus within your 
hearing when he spoke to FM - FM08 on that occasion on the phone? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair, I - I do not recall 
hearing the - the whole conversation but I do know that he - he phoned 
FM08 to organise cash.  I - I - if I recall correctly he told me that he is 
going to phone FM08 but subsequent to that - subsequent to his … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before - before subsequent to that.  How did you 
know that the call was about organising cash?  Did he tell you that? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I assumed that it 
was to organise cash based on what he said a minute earlier.  It was 
not easy to (mechanical interference). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but simply because it was not easy to - simply 
20 
because he said it was not easy to organise a meeting with 
General Bheki Cele should not necessarily have anything to do with his 
call being a call to organise cash.  So what made you - what makes you 
associate the call with cash? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I cannot really say Chair 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 79 of 156 
 
but the next paragraph of my statement will - will add some insight as 
to why I think it was so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Chair 
at 
- 
like 
I 
mentioned at the - I was also present while this phone call took place.  
General Lazarus was not aware that I had cash with me.  It was 
R40 000,00 which I had taken from our Head Office.  When I say “our” 
it is CI Head Office in Pretoria. 
I cannot remember exactly what the - what the advance was 
for.  At this - at this stage I cannot really.  I informed General Lazarus 
10 
that I had the cash and I subsequently handed him the money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes there is - there is a gap there.  He did not tell 
you that he was making a call to get cash from FM08.  He said that 
organising a meeting with General Bheki Cele was not easy. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then he made a call to FM08? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was not - you did not hear their conversation on 
the phone? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you assumed that the call was about cash? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is indeed - indeed 
correct Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  As to what I heard 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 80 of 156 
 
previously what he - what he had said to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and you must tell me if I am wrong now.  As I 
understand it you cannot say why you assumed the call to have been 
about cash.  Am I right? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It was an assumption 
Chair.  I cannot say for sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you cannot tell me why you made that 
assumption? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then the next thing you say in paragraph 25: 
“At the time General Lazarus was unaware that I 
had R40 000,00 in cash with me which I had taken 
from Head Office for some other purpose which I 
cannot recall.” 
You then say: 
“I then informed General Lazarus about the cash 
and handed him the money.” 
There is a gap in the story there.  How does it come about 
20 
that you - you give him cash when there has been no discussion about 
cash?  He has not told you about he - he needs money. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair there - I am 
with you - there is - there is a gap but this is what I recall from - from 
that particular incident Chair. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 81 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but I would have expected you to recall much 
more than just that because it seems to me the context if there was 
discussion of cash may well have been bribery or corruption and I 
would have thought that you would have remembered how the issue of 
cash came about. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair unfortunately at 
this stage I cannot recall.  What is in my statement as - is - I recall 
what as is in my statement.  I - I cannot recall any other further - 
further details than - than what is in the statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Do you recall why you had that R40 000,00 cash 
10 
with you?  What purpose you wanted to use it for? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I am not sure Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I cannot recall? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I had many - I had many 
advances on my name for numerous … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  For numerous purposes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  At the time of - of being - 
of my being admitted into witness protection in October 2011 I had 
20 
almost 140 to R150 000,00 of outstanding advances against my name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Anyway - (coughing) excuse me.  You 
told General Lazarus that you had R40 000,00 on you and you handed 
it him - handed it to him.  Is that right? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 82 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he say why he wanted - he wanted that money? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair from what he said - 
from what he said earlier it was not easy to organise a meeting with 
Bheki Cele and me subsequently handing him the cash.  This was my 
belief that that money was intended to pay General Bheki Cele. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But this was all - your assumptions.  He did not say 
that himself? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair.  He did not.  It 
is - it is an assumption. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  You will just have to be careful and in - in your 
10 
evidence because while one can accept a few assumptions you know.  
It is going to be difficult if - there are going to be too many 
assumptions.  So try and remember to the best of your ability.  I know 
that we are talking many, many years later. 
I appreciate that but it is important that we - that I get as 
much in terms of facts as - as possible as - as you recall them.  You 
understand that? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Indeed Chair.  I - I will … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will do your best? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I will try my best as we 
20 
go along now … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But also I will try and 
gather my thoughts … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 83 of 156 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And if - and if need be I 
will put in a supplementary statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Alright.  No that is fine.  Ms Wentzel let 
us continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  After you had given General Lazarus the 
40 000 cash that you had on you what happened? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair this was - like I 
mentioned - this was in Mr Marimuthu’s home in Durban - Umhlanga 
Rocks.  We were in one part of the house.  When General - 
General Bheki Cele arrived which I did not see him arriving but 
10 
obviously General Lazarus told me he is going into a meeting with 
General Bheki Cele and he does not want me to be part of that meeting. 
So I remained in that part of the house.  The meeting with 
General Bheki Cele was held in another section of the house.  
Mr Marimuthu’s house is quite vast. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you - do you know whether you would still be able 
to take somebody to Mr Marimuthu’s house? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Pardon 
Chair.  
Physically? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know whether you would be able to take 
20 
somebody to Mr Marimuthu’s house? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  To - to physically go 
there? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes.  I will.  I will.  I 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 84 of 156 
 
know where the house is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know where it is? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Then after this meeting did General Lazarus 
return all or any of the money back to you? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair none of that money 
was returned to me and I - and an assumption again on my part that the 
money was handed over to General Bheki Cele. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now if we can just look at another thing.  Is 
10 
that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why did you not ask General Lazarus what are you 
going to do with this money?  I had another purpose for it.  Why do you 
need this money?  I have a - I have it on me for another purpose. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair at that stage this 
was in - in 2000 - probably 2009/2010.  Remember the time period the - 
the account was already being abused by then already Chair by - with 
large amounts of - of money was taken. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So I did not bother to - to 
20 
ask him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Getting another amount would - was not going to 
be a problem from the account? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Not at all Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 85 of 156 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  There was often rolling - 
I think maybe just to give you some insight Chair on this …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  On this incident and I - 
and I speak for myself because this is what I did.  On numerous 
occasions … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I took advances big 
amounts that I could not reconcile.  So with General Lazarus’ 
knowledge and his approval because most of the time he signed my 
10 
advances. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I would take - say just to 
give you a simple example.  If R10,00 was outstanding on my name and 
I could not pay back the R10,00.  I would take another advance for 
R10,00 and pay off the previous advance that was outstanding.  So it is 
basically what is known as rolling advances to pay off another advance 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And this was done on 
20 
numerous occasions by myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So - okay alright.  Thank you.  Ms Wentzel. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo to clarify you say that before 
General Cele arrived General Lazarus told you it is not easy to 
organise a meeting with Bheki Cele.  Who was it that organised the 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 86 of 156 
 
meeting? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
That 
- 
that 
- 
an 
assumption again - would be Mr Marimuthu because the meeting was 
held at his house.  So he would have had knowledge of - of a meeting 
in his house. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Why then …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but the question is who made this remark.  Who 
said it was not or rather I am sorry.  I think I am - I am … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I may be confusing both you and Ms Wentzel.  Okay.  
10 
So I - so you - so I think the question was who organised the meeting 
with General Bheki Cele in Mr Marimuthu’s house and your answer is 
you assume it was Mr Marimuthu? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  An assumption again.  
Yes indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  With having made that assumption why did 
you assume that the money that you believe was requested or was 
needed was to pay General Cele and not Mr Marimuthu who organised 
the meeting? 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair like I mentioned 
earlier.  We were at Mr Marimuthu’s house for quite some time.  
Probably one and a half hours or maybe two.  There was no attempt on 
General Lazarus side to or no attempt to - to contact FM08 in that 
period while we waited for Mr Bheki Cele to arrive to organise cash. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 87 of 156 
 
So there was ample time for him to - to - I am speaking now 
about General Lazarus now - for him to phone FM08 to make 
arrangements for the cash.  It was only closer to the time that 
General Bheki Cele arrived that this arrangement was made for cash.  
So an assumption again on my side. 
That is why I believed that the money was given to 
General Cele and not to Mr Marimuthu. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - would it be true to say that you do not know 
whether - when General Lazarus came out of the room where he had a 
meeting with General Cele you do not know whether he came back with 
10 
the money or not? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair there was no 
money returned to me.  So I assumed the money was paid over to 
General Cele. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but he could have come back with the money in 
his own pocket? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It is - it is a possibility 
Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so you - you really do not know what happened 
to the money other than that you gave it to him and he never gave it 
20 
back to you? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL: 
 
Colonel 
Naidoo 
was 
General 
Lazarus 
transferred from his position as CFO of the Secret Service account? 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 88 of 156 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No he was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me go back to the purpose of the meeting, did you 
know what the actual purpose of the meeting was, why General Lazarus 
wanted to meet with General Cele? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair, no reasons 
were given to me by General Lazarus, except to say that he was having 
a meeting with General Cele. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You – did you and General Lazarus go all the way 
from Gauteng to KZN to meet with General Cele without you finding out 
what is the purpose and why should I come with you? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair if I remember 
correctly it was not a specific meeting where we flew down from 
Gauteng to KZN to meet with General Cele, if I can remember correctly 
we were in KwaZulu Natal for a few days, I cannot remember exactly 
why we were there but it wasn’t specifically to fly down for that 
meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And one of the days 
while we were in KZN this meeting came up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay no that is alright. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Thank you Chair.  Colonel Naidoo could you 
now please tell the Chair about a private trip that was undertaken by 
General Mdluli and his wife to China. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before that question Colonel Naidoo, somehow in 
your evidence there is an implied suggestion that the reason why 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 89 of 156 
 
General Lazarus was not transferred as had been proposed by General 
Mdluli was because General – because he sought the support of 
General Cele to oppose the transfer.  Is my reading of your evidence 
correct? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it correct that you do not actually have any basis 
for that implication or insinuation other than that you know that General 
Lazarus approached General Cele and that there was a meeting, is that 
right or is there something more on which you base that on? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair 
10 
regarding this incident. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, did General Lazarus at any stage say to you or 
within your hearing that he was going to approach General Bheki Cele 
in order to prevent General Mdluli from transferring him? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair this was, like I said 
this was not an initial meeting Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  The initial meeting with 
General Cele was for that specific purpose that he is not transferred.   
This was subsequent, this was one of the several meetings that he had 
20 
that I was privy to, or rather not privy to, but I was in the room or in the 
same vicinity.   So it is not – this is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  This one is not connected with the transfer. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  The incident that we 
speak of now is not connected to the transfer. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 90 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That was the initial 
contact that was made with Bheki Cele, for that specific purpose it was 
basically to get a – organise a meeting with General Bheki Cele, so this 
incident that I speak of is subsequent to that, it was one of several 
meetings prior to the – or subsequent to the first initial meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let me try and understand this.  As you 
understand it General Lazarus had a number of meetings with General 
Cele, is that right? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes that is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  How many of those did you attend? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It was this one that I 
testified to now Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, was it the only one? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and you don’t know what the purpose of this one 
was, is that right? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you were excluded from the actual meeting when 
General Lazarus had a discussion with General Cele in another room at 
20 
Mr Marimuthu’s house or another section of the room? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And was Mr Marimuthu part of that discussion 
between General Cele and General Lazarus? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I assume that he would 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 91 of 156 
 
have been Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You don’t know? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was the meeting in another room in which you were 
at Mr Marimuthu’s house, or was it in the same room but in a different 
section, away from you? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It was in another room 
Chair, not in the same room that I was in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, but for all intents and purposes other than 
that you gave General Lazarus some money, R40 000, which you 
10 
assumed was going to be given to somebody, and I cannot remember 
whether you said Mr Marimuthu or General Cele ...[intervenes]  
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then there is no particular significance in that 
meeting? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And actually if one does not know what the R45 000 
was for there is actually no significance to that meeting at all? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now is there a meeting that you attended which 
20 
involved General Lazarus and General Cele which related to General 
Lazarus possible transfer away from the Secret Service Account? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  Okay any of the meetings that General Lazarus 
may have had with General Cele you do not know if they are of any 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 92 of 156 
 
significance do you? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, Ms Wentzel? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just try and make sure that we go to those issues 
that are really of importance for our purposes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes I will Chair.  Colonel Naidoo could you 
please now deal with the private trip that General Mdluli and his wife 
took to China. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair if I remember 
10 
correctly this was around October/November 2009, it was just a few 
months after General Mdluli was appointed as Crime Intelligence 
Divisional Commissioner.   Prior to General Mdluli flying to China with 
his wife General Lazarus told me, I remember the conversation I had 
with him, he said to me that General Mdluli wants to take his wife to 
China and we must see how we can help him, and Chair if I can read 
from my statement his exact words to me, and I say this is General 
Lazarus’s words, that Delani wants to take his vrou to China and we 
must see how we can help him.   This simply means Delani referring to 
General Mdluli, wants to take his vrou, which is his wife at that stage 
20 
was – I do not know her full name, I think it is Vuziwane, to China and 
we must see how we can help him.  
 
The reference to we there I assume was General Lazarus and 
Colonel Barnard.   
 
General Lazarus then instructed me to make enquiries with 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 93 of 156 
 
regards to the air tickets.  I think I went to Menlyn Park, it was a Flight 
Centre where I made enquiries.  Chair before I go there I think I am 
jumping the gun a bit, I would have spoken either to General Lazarus or 
General Mdluli because obviously to make bookings I would have to get 
their ID numbers and their destination of travel, so it was either one of 
them who had given me this information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Once 
I 
had 
the 
information, like I said I went to Flight Centre, it was Menlo Park or the 
Mall there, I don’t recall the name, I made provisional bookings for 
10 
General Mdluli and his wife at that stage, Vuziwane Lily Mdluli.  On the 
3 r d of November 2009 General Lazarus called me to his office, when I 
got there Chair he had an envelope with him.  At that stage I cannot 
recall if he told me what was in the envelope or what the contents of 
the envelope was or at later stage but what I can recall of the incident 
is that he told me – he gave me the envelope which was on his desk, he 
said that I must take the envelope and keep it with me, because he is 
going into another meeting with another Colonel Hein if I remember 
correctly.   
 
I did so, I took the envelope, I put it in my bag and I waited at 
20 
the reception at his office, outside of his office.   While I was waiting 
there Colonel Barnard also came to the reception.  His meeting with 
Colonel Hein and when I say his meeting, General Lazarus’s meeting 
with Colonel Hein was probably a few minutes, it did not take long, 
when Colonel Hein had finished with his meeting he left and General 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 94 of 156 
 
Lazarus called Colonel Barnard and myself into his office.   
 
General Lazarus informed me that there was R50 000 in the 
envelope, like I said earlier Chair I am not sure at that stage about the 
R50 000 or it was previously to Colonel Hein’s meeting with him, but 
what I can say is that he indeed told me that there was R50 000 in the 
envelope, this he said they managed to get a loan from Mr Jan Venter. 
 
Chair Mr Jan Venter is a dealer principal of Atlantis Motors, a 
company of which Crime Intelligence purchases their vehicles from. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   This was a loan for what purpose and in whose 
favour? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair this was what 
General Lazarus told me, they had managed to secure a loan from Mr 
Jan Venter to purchase a ticket for General Mdluli’s wife for his 
tentative trip to China. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Continue Ms Wentzel. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   What then transpired Colonel Naidoo? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair on that same day, 
and I speak of the 3 r d of November. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, you took the envelope and there was R50 
000 in the envelope? 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I assumed that 
there was R50 000 in the envelope, I did not open it and I did not count 
the money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, did you find out later that there was R50 000? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Indeed I did. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 95 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair on the same day, 
the 3 r d of November after receiving, after speaking or rather with a 
short meeting with Colonel Barnard and myself and after handing over 
the R50 000 which was in the envelope, General Lazarus instructed me 
to take another – a further R50 000 advance from the cash office, 
advance office, on my name.  This was to pay for General Mdluli’s 
ticket.   
CHAIRPERSON:  How much was that, he instructed you to take how 
much? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  R50 000. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, from the Secret Service Account? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Secret Service Account 
that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I filled in the necessary 
documentation and I think it was General Lazarus who approved it, I am 
not certain, if the documents are shown to me I can confirm.   It was 
either General Lazarus or Colonel Barnard who approved that advance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I secured the funds Chair 
and in total I had with me R100 000. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes for both General Mdluli and his wife? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  The R50 000 loan from 
Mr Jan Venter and the R50 000 that I took an advance on my name. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 96 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  General Lazarus then 
instructed me to go and pay for the two tickets, one for General Mdluli 
and the one for his wife, his then wife. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ms Wentzel? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   And did you actually purchase the tickets? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes I did.  I did.  If I 
remember correctly the combined total for the two tickets was around 
R86 000, thereabout. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Now Chair the copy of these tickets is very 
10 
difficult to read because it is a scanned copy and as I indicated Chair 
we will try and get better copies for you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but on what page is it? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   It is page 74, and Colonel Naidoo can you 
confirm, it is almost impossible to see that these are the flight tickets 
that you purchased, the e-ticket receipts? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair it is not very clear, 
but I do see my signature at the bottom so I can confirm that these are 
the documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm, okay. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   And what – how did you feel about having the 
advance for R50 000 for General Mdluli’s ticket in your name? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before that Colonel Naidoo I see that you say 
that you went to the Flight Centre to make bookings, is that right? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   The bookings were made 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 97 of 156 
 
a few – provisional bookings Chair, that was a few days prior to the 3 r d 
of November. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but you made them with Flight Centre? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that how you would normally make bookings if it 
was an official trip or did Crime Intelligence have travel agents that it 
used for official trips? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair from what I am 
given to understand on the open account they have service providers in 
place, you need to get approval and the necessary paperwork.  With 
10 
Crime Intelligence they used a certain company, that I have already 
testified to, I think it ...[indistinct] Travel, we have never used Flight 
Centre prior to this incident. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is the position that your experience as at that time 
was that whenever bookings had to be made, flight bookings had to be 
made for official trips they were made with a  particular travel agent 
and not with Flight Centre? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is indeed correct 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, continue Ms Wentzel. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Colonel – is it a convenient time to adjourn 
or are you happy to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us adjourn, it is about two minutes to one, 
let us adjourn then, we will adjourn and resume at two o’clock. 
 
We adjourn. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 98 of 156 
 
REGISTRAR:    All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready Colonel Naidoo? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  We probably will stop at three o’clock but I will 
– I will decide as we go along.  Let us continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Colonel Naidoo before the 
10 
lunch adjournment you were talking about the tickets that you 
purchased from Flight Centre for General Mdluli and his wife.   
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  You say in your statement you were 
concerned about this advance in your name.  Could you just explain 
that? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair this transaction 
made me uncomfortable in a sense the – not so much in my statement I 
say it was –  I knew I had – I knew it was not allowed although that was 
a concern but the greater concern was actually the amount it was quite 
20 
a substantial amount and it was on my name.   And I feared that it 
eventually I would held responsible for that amount.  So that was what 
made me feel uncomfortable.  And in light of that Chair that same 
afternoon I am speaking of the 3 November I wrote out a note of what 
had transpired during the course of the day regarding the air tickets 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 99 of 156 
 
and the loan and I kept a copy of it at my house. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words you created a record? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of what – of how it had come about that this amount 
was taken out in your name? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Did you share it with anybody such as General 
Lazarus? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was just for yourself to remember… 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What had happened that gave rise to it? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  This was a handwritten 
copy that I had made available for myself just in case.  I gave that 
handwritten document to my wife. She typed it at her work and those 
two documents together with copies of the air tickets I made – I kept at 
my home just for future reference if there was any queries regarding 
this incident.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are they part of the bundle that is before me today? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes they are Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They are okay.  Ms Wentzel says they are.  Okay take 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 100 of 156 
 
it from there Ms Wentzel. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  They appear in – at Annexure DGN3 from 
pages 77 to 80 it looks like.  The handwritten notes that you wrote do 
those appear from page 79 to 80? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes I confirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the handwritten note that you talk about appears 
at pages 79 to 80 of the bundle, is that right? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I see that the copy might not be so legible but 
part of it is legible to some extent.  Is the position that or does it not 
10 
start earlier?  I see page 79 starts with the word agreement. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So that cannot be the 
beginning of a sentence. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  Chair you are absolutely correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well is there a page missing or a few pages missing 
Colonel Naidoo? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I am – from what I 
recall it is one page Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is a – there is one page missing. 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No this is the page. 
There is no page missing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but I see it starts with – it looks like at 79 it 
starts from what would be the middle of a sentence.  It says agreement 
was shown to me.  So the sentence must have started – there must be 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 101 of 156 
 
another page from which it started this sentence.  At page 78 you – 
there is a tight… 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair this is our – I think 
it is just in reverse.  80 should come first. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It is just reverse 80 
should be first before 79. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Ms Wentzel. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  80 is actually the first 
page 79 is the second page. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes  
CHAIRPERSON:  You should have picked that up. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes I should have Chair.  You are … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You should have picked that up. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  You are quite correct it should have been 
picked up.  And as – Chair we have also had this typed again because 
even the copy the typed copy of his wife is – it is absolutely illegible.  
But… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think what you should do then is to – I think on all 
our bundles Colonel Naidoo let us – that mistake.  What was page 80 
20 
should be page 79. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what was page 79 should be page 80> 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Ms Wentzel arrange for new pages with red 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 102 of 156 
 
pagination to be provided to replace these. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  I will do that Sir – Chair.  Chair you see 
that in the statement Colonel Naidoo you say in paragraph 34 that 
these documents were subsequently handed over to Colonel Roelofse, 
is that correct? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair we will try and obtain the original 
documents from Colonel Roelofse so that better copies can be provided 
and I will make sure that they are put into the record and into your file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  That is fine but this should have been done 
10 
quite some time back? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes it is correct and I apologise it should 
have been done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Colonel Naidoo’s statement has been available for 
quite some time. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes it has. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  It is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  Now Colonel Naidoo did you 
20 
thereafter meet General Mdluli at the airport with regard to this trip and 
if so could you please explain the circumstances to the Chair? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes, yes I did meet 
General Mdluli.  Chair on the 7 t h… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just before you proceed Colonel Naidoo Ms Wentzel 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 103 of 156 
 
can you also – can we also try and be faster than we are. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us be faster. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Colonel Naidoo is supposed to know these incidents 
and let us try and be faster and make the best of the time available. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think he was about to answer your question. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I interrupted him.  Colonel Naidoo please give 
10 
your answer. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair on the 7 November 
this was the day General Mdluli was due to fly to – to China.  General 
Lazarus instructed me to take a further R10 000.00 advance in my 
name.  I did so.  He said this – this was money for General Mdluli or 
intended for General Mdluli for his trip to China.  I subsequently gave – 
managed to obtain the R10 000.00 Chair.  On the same day 7 November 
I met General Mdluli at the airport and I gave him R10 000.00 – 
R20 000.00 sorry – pardon me.  Chair this R20 000.00 was the 
R10 000.00 advance that I had taken on my name and if you remember 
20 
correctly Chair as I testified to previously there was R100 000.00 that I 
had for the air tickets. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  There was R13 000.00 
plus minus there about I cannot recall exact figure was left over from 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 104 of 156 
 
that transaction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was – you said that R50 000.00 was a loan from 
Atlantis Motors I think. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which was for the ticket – for Ms Mdluli’s ticket. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And R50 000.00 was from the Secret Service Account 
which was for General Mdluli’s ticket, is that right? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Correct – correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did they ticket end up costing less than that? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Both tickets were 
R86 000.00 thereabout plus minus. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So there was some money left? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Indeed yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And that was about R24 or R14? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja if it was R86 it was R14 000.00. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It was R13 848.00 left 
over after paying for two tickets Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if you had R100 000.00 and the two tickets cost 
20 
R86 000.00 and the balance could not have been R30 000.00. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  R13 000.00 Chair R13. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh 13 – 13? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes.  R13 000.00 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay I thought you said R30 I am sorry.  Okay yes. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 105 of 156 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  The tickets were exactly 
the amount was R86 152.00 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And the remaining 
balance was – that was left over from the R100 000.00 was R13 848.00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  This is the R10 000.00 
that I took from this amount of the R13 848.00 added to the R10 000.00 
advance which gave me R20 000.00 in total.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  This is the amount 
handed over to General Mdluli for his trip. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the airport? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I met him at the airport. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that at OR Tambo airport? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Correct Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  This is when his wife was 
with him.  This is when General Mdluli informed me that he is taking his 
wife to visit their daughter who is studying in China. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you know his wife prior to that? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you met her? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I met her because I had 
previously gone on several occasion to General Mdluli’s private 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 106 of 156 
 
residence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So General Mdluli told you that he was taking 
his wife to China to – for them to visit their daughter who was studying 
there? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And was there anything else that was 
discussed at the airport between the two of you? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Did you ever ask why General Mdluli was not 
the one who would sign documents if money – if he needed money for 
10 
his own purposes and why you had to sign? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why it had to be the advance had to be in your name 
or somebody else’s name Colonel Barnard or so on. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair General Mdlluli 
never took any advances on his name Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And did you ever know why – why that was so? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I cannot say for sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But he never took any advances in his name? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So there will be documentation that reflects that he 
took advances from the Secret Services Account as far as you know? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it General Lazarus who initiated as far as you 
know that whenever General Mdluli needed money that somebody else 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 107 of 156 
 
would take the money out of his – in his name? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Continue Ms Wentzel. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo how did you reconcile the 
advance of R50 000.00 taken to purchase General Mdluli’s ticket? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair initially when I paid 
for the tickets the tickets were printed on one invoice which was the 
total of the two tickets which an amount of – which amounted to 
R86 000.00.  R86 152.00 but the actual advance was only R50 000.00 
on my name.   I subsequently went back to – to Flight Centre so that 
10 
they could print me another invoice for just one ticket because only on 
– I only had reconcile one ticket which was against the R50 000.00.  
Remember the other R50 000.00 was a loan or supposedly a loan.  So 
this is how I closed that – or reconciled that advance by asking Flight 
Centre to generate a new invoice – a fresh invoice for one ticket.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And is that the document Annexure DGN5? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry what page is that? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  At page 91.   
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second.  Yes.  Can I take you back to the 
20 
document that you prepared that you said you prepared or statement or 
note that you prepared to have a record of how it came about that you 
took out money in your name that you had to give to General Mdluli. 
That is the document starting at page 79.  It might be difficult for 
someone else to read that document but maybe because you are the 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 108 of 156 
 
author you might be able to.  Are you able to read it or only parts of it? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I will try Chair up to a 
point because part of it is quite – it is not very clear so I will try. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that fine.  Maybe you will – you do not need 
to read now but do you confirm that what is – what you recorded on the 
note is along the lines that you have told me about in terms of how it 
came about that you took that money in your name? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so when we get a clearer copy it should just 
reflect what you have told me? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Colonel Naidoo could you 
please tell the Chair about the overseas trip to Singapore? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair this also – this trip 
was undertaken in 2009.  I think it was the 20 t h November 2009.  It was 
about two weeks after General Mdluli returned from China. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One – one second.  Ms Wentzel just remind me from 
time to time where – on page you are so that I keep a general track? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes certainly Chair.  It 
20 
is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where – where is that? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It is page 10 of the 
statement from paragraphs 41 Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Continue Colonel Naidoo. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 109 of 156 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair this was about two 
weeks after General Mdluli returned from China on the 20 November.  
Colonel Barnard, Colonel Barnard’s wife, General Lazarus, his wife, 
Colonel Miranda Venter, General Mdluli. Chair my statement reads 
General Mdluli’s wife but at that stage it was not his wife.  She was his 
girlfriend if I can call it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And Warrant Officer 
Godfrey Mawai[?] and myself travelled to Singapore. Chair the reason 
given to me – this was according to General Lazarus that Crime 
10 
Intelligence went on this – or was to go on this trip to buy equipment – 
spy equipment for the unit.   
CHAIRPERSON:  To buy some equipment for the operations of Crime 
Intelligence? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Were you given any more particulars as to 
exactly what was to be bought or not really? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Were you told why there were so many of you 
who needed to go? 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair this – not – that – 
no I was not given any reason but I think I just need to point out one 
matter which is quite important.  I myself was in General Lazarus’ office 
prior to us flying to Singapore and FM09 was also present there.  I 
enquired from him – Chair I enquired – I enquired on two fronts.  One 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 110 of 156 
 
was – I asked him why am I going on this trip. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And the second – the 
second front was why am I flying on the Secret Service Account 
because other members were flying on an open account.  So it seemed 
strange to me that I was flying on the Secret Service Account. So these 
are the two – two points that I brought to his attention and he told me 
that is – that was the instruction of General Mdluli and I did not – I did 
not take it further than that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So were you the only one who was being paid – 
10 
whose travelling was being paid for from the Secret Service Account? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair there were two 
members from Crime Intelligence who travelled on this trip on the 
Secret Service Account. It was myself and Colonel Maranda Venter the 
other civilian member who travelled on this account was General 
Mdluli’s girlfriend Theresa Lyons. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And your wife was also travelling on this Secret 
Service Account? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair it is not – it was 
not my wife it was Colonel Barnard’s wife. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I thought you said your wife also went along. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Yes Okay.   
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Pardon me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Please continue Ms Wentzel. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 111 of 156 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Did you make air bookings for this trip 
Colonel Naidoo? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes I did. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And could you just explain that? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I think it was in a week 
prior to us travelling.  We travelled on the 20 November 2009.  I made 
bookings at African Imprint Travel for T Lyons, Colonel Venter and 
myself.  I also made bookings for Sandra Lazarus this is General Mdluli 
– pardon me – this is General Lazarus’ wife and I think that of Juanita 
Barnard which is Colonel Barnard’s wife.  Chair I do mention in my 
10 
statement point 44 I point out that T Lyons was General Mdluli’s 
girlfriend at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one second.  I hope everybody at the back does 
hear.  Everybody does hear?  Okay alright.  So – so the bookings that 
you made some were made under the Secret Service Account but others 
were made under the open account, is that right? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The ones that were made under the Secret Service 
20 
Account were your and who else’s. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair there is two parts 
to this.  The bookings – the bookings were initially made for – it was 
myself, Colonel Venter, T Lyons, Juanita Barnard and Sandra Lazarus. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 112 of 156 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But the actual payment 
from the Secret Service Account those were provisional bookings the 
names I mentioned now Chair but the actual payment for those that 
travelled on this account from the Secret – or was paid from the Secret 
Service Account was myself, Colonel Venter and T Lyons. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I do not know how – how 
Juanita Barnard and Sandra Lazarus’ ticket was paid for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  The – I think you mentioned two travel agents 
that were used for this purpose, is that correct? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  One Chair it was African 
Imprint Travel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that the normal travel agent that was – was that 
the travel agent that Crime Intelligence used to use when trips were – 
official trips were undertaken? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is another company 
Chair.  That is Westville Travel.  This is African Imprint Travel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – but was this particular company travel agency 
did Crime Intelligence use it from time to time or as far as you know 
this was the first time it was used? 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  As far as I know this is 
the first time we used this particular company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Is the invoice page to African Imprint Travel – 
does that appear at Annexure DGN6 page 94? 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 113 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Wentzel you are going to confuse her.  Remember 
when we started on Friday we said you will not mention I think the 
alphabets before the number. You just mention the number. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Oh yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you are confusing me as well. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just mention the page. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Page 94, is that correct? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now when you went on this trip who went 
10 
business class and who went economy class? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair General Mdluli, 
General Lazarus and T Lyons flew business class.  Colonel Barnard, 
myself, Colonel Venter, Colonel Barnard’s wife and Warrant Officer 
Godfrey Mawai[?] flew economy class.  
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now when you were in Singapore did you 
indeed go purchase equipment for Crime Intelligence? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair we did 
purchase equipment over two days.  If I can just give some insight into 
that?  Chair this – like I said this was done over two days but in the two 
20 
days I think it was most two hours that we spent at this particular shop 
over two days.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So we basically four 
hours in total.  This – it is an electronics mall Chair.  It is not a covert 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 114 of 156 
 
shop. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Where you have to make 
an appointment it is like how you and I would go to a normal shop to 
purchase an item except this was an electronics mall only dealing with 
electronic stuff and nothing else. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  We got to the shop.  I did 
not pay too much of attention as to what was being purchased because 
this was not my area of expertise Chair.  But I do know that we were at 
10 
this shop at – for over two days, two hours probably most at a time. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And then what did you do during the rest of 
the trip? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair we were there from 
the 20 t h to the 29 t h.  The rest of the time except for these – over these 
two days probably two hours a day the rest of the time we spent 
shopping and sightseeing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So all in all about how many were you?   About six or 
eight? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair it was eight I think 
20 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About eight? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And were you able to tell who in the whole group 
really may have been necessary for purposes of buying whatever 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 115 of 156 
 
equipment needed to be bought? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair in my view this trip 
was not necessary at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I say that because if – if 
somebody got onto the internet could have purchased this over the 
internet and paid for it via EFT and had it couriered to South Africa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is the best case 
scenario.  The worst case scenario is that a member from technical 
10 
support unit from Crime Intelligence should have gone over to purchase 
this vehicle – this equipment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But was the equipment actually purchased? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes it was purchased 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But you said there was nothing covert about it 
really? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And did you Colonel Naidoo purchase 
20 
anything on this trip> 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Prior to me going on this 
trip Chair my sister asked if I could purchase a camera for her.  If I can 
remember correctly I informed General Lazarus that I wanted to buy – 
this is while in Singapore Chair.  I informed General Lazarus that I 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 116 of 156 
 
wanted to buy a camera for my sister.  He indicated to me that we 
should purchase it using SSA funds and we will sort it out when we get 
back home.  I purchased the camera Chair.  The value was 
approximately R5000.00 and on my return I gave it to my sister.  Both 
General Lazarus and Colonel Barnard approved the funding for this 
purchase. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat that last sentence please?  Both General? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Lazarus and Colonel 
Barnard they approved the funding for the purchase.  Meaning they 
were aware of me using the card to purchase this particular camera. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you said that General Lazarus said that you could 
use the Secret Service Account funds and this would be sorted out 
when you came back.  Was it sorted out? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was not sorted out? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  As far as I know this was 
– this particular camera was captured on the system as belonging to 
Crime Intelligence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but it was actually in the possession of your 
sister? 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And being used by her? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So would the records reflect that it is – it was an 
asset belonging to Crime Intelligence? 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 117 of 156 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is – that is what I 
am given to understand Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  When you came through the airport was the 
equipment declared? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair General Lazarus 
and General Mdluli did not want customs to know what we were 
bringing back into the country.  General Mdluli then made arrangements 
with his contacts at the airport and I am speaking about OR Tambo 
Airport that we as a group bypass customs. 
10 
So as a result of this arrangement nothing was declared at 
customs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  How was the equipment purchased? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair Colonel Barnard’s 
wife works at an Absa Branch in Pretoria.  She made arrangements for 
two cards - two credit cards to be issued.  One which Colonel Barnard 
signed for him - for it himself and the other one was on my name.  
These two credit cards were preloaded with R100 000,00 each. 
I assume that this funds would have been or these funds 
20 
would have been arranged by Colonel Barnard to give to his wife to be 
preloaded onto these two credit cards. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  You say … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms Wentzel.  After you came back from this 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 118 of 156 
 
trip at the latest after you had come back I take it that you would have 
reflected and you would have reflected as to why you were taken along.  
Did you reflect on that and came to some conclusion? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair like … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because from what you say you clearly were not 
needed for - for making any decisions relating to the purchase of the - 
of the equipment and - and you have said that the equipment actually 
could have been obtained without the trip.  Did you try and reflect on 
why you were taken along? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair.  Like - like I 
10 
said in the beginning I - I protested already to General Lazarus why I 
was - why I was going on this trip. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So I did not take it 
further than that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What did he say when you protested? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  He … 
CHAIRPERSON:  General Lazarus. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  He said it was an 
instruction from General Mdluli and I must comply. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Assuming that that was true.  Did it occur to you that 
maybe you were be made to be part of the trip so that if there are any 
problems you would not - you would not tell? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is a possibility 
Chair. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 119 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Before this time had you already yourself 
started engaging in any illegal transactions.  You - you testified on 
Friday that you admitted to the Haws that you had put through a false - 
you had put through false claims running into about R100 000,00.  Had 
this happened by this time or had it not happened yet? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  This was before - this 
was before the time Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This was before this trip? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  This - that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  So you had already started? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would it be fair to say by this time you were really 
part of whatever wrong was taking place at Crime Intelligence? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo in relation to the Chair’s 
question.  With regard to the reconciliation of the amount that was 
provided to you to purchase the tickets for General Mdluli and his wife 
the R100 000,00.  You said after buying the air tickets you had 
R13 848,00 spare … 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Of which you gave to R10 000,00 to 
General Mdluli.  Is that correct? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So we are going back to 
the - the previous trip - the China trip? 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 120 of 156 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  I am just - sorry.  If you can have regard 
to page 9 paragraph 37. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes.  I am there. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So of the 13 848 you gave 10 000 of that 
remaining to General Mdluli.  What happened to the balance of 
R3 848,00? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair this balance of 
R3 848,00 which was in cash I kept in my bag for several weeks.  When 
no one inquired about it I used it for my personal use. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo if you have regard to the 
document at page 100 Annexure DGN7, Annexure 7.  These are - reflect 
transaction history.  The one at page 100 where the card holder is 
reflected as Hein Barnard and the one at page 102 where the account 
is under your name - Naidoo. 
Is that a fair reflection of the spending on those credit cards 
during the Singapore trip? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I do not remember 
all of the - of all the transactions but yes the - the transactions are on 
the card that I used.  My name reflects on the top left corner and the 
20 
previous one of Colonel Barnard.  So yes I would confirm these - these 
documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I think Ms Wentzel you must draw to our 
attention which transactions fall within the days that he was in 
Singapore. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 121 of 156 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Do the - these transactions fall between the 
time that you were in Singapore? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Remember what were the dates for your Singapore 
trip?  How …? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair, we - we left on 
20 November 2009 and returned on 29 November in that same year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So was it about 10 days? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Thereabout.  Nine days. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Nine days/10 days? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Nine days, yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was quite a long time and you said that - at the 
shop where you were supposed to buy the equipment you spent about 
four hours all in all over two days - two days.  Each day is - two hours 
each day.  Is that right? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So for the rest of the time you were just having a 
good time? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the state expense? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So these transactions - well Ms Wentzel you 
must confirm.  Do they fall within those dates when he was in 
Singapore? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or he could - if he can see. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 122 of 156 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He can confirm also. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Can you confirm that these transactions fall 
within the dates that you were in Singapore? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I just want to 
confirm the dates first.  I am not sure if it is the 20 t h … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I think look at the dates Ms Wentzel … 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Ja.  I think that - that 
would be very … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Wentzel and tell her the first transaction on page - 
10 
is it 102?  Is that his one? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  His … 
CHAIRPERSON:  His one starts at … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  His is at 102. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Tell him the - the date of the first transaction 
there and the date of the last transaction. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So the first transaction is 27 November 2009 
… 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And the last is the - well it is - it is … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are the dates upside down? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I think it is going through at a different date.  
You will see it is - it is 18 November 2009.  So it starts on the 18 t h and 
then goes up to 27 November 2009. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  The document - the page seems to be starting 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 123 of 156 
 
with the last … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Transaction and ending with the first transaction. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it would mean that it reflects that the transactions 
covered by it start on 18/11/2009 … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And go up to 27/11/2009 but you said that you left for 
Singapore on the 20 t h.  Is that right? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  The transactions before the 20 t h would they have 
been connected with this trip or not? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Chair 
that 
would 
probably be the preloaded I spoke of - the preloaded amount that was 
initially loaded onto this card before we left. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Arrangements 
were 
made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So that falls outside of 
20 
the time period that we were in Singapore.  So this - this date will 
explain what I have testified to earlier.  That money was preloaded onto 
each of these card.  If you look at page 102 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  The actual amount in 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 124 of 156 
 
US$13 182,53. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The - the amount on the first day on the 18 t h.  Is that 
correct? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the bottom. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  On the 18 t h.  This is the 
preloaded amount I speak of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but at the top there it says local currency but at 
the bottom it - it reflects USD rather than Rands.  Is that - can you see 
that or are we … 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On different columns?  You know the column written 
local currency. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair that was the local 
currency of Singapore and it also reflects the same amount in US 
Dollars. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that was local currency of Singapore not of South 
Africa? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  SSGD is the Singapore 
currency Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  USD would be the US 
Dollar. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So Chair if you look at 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 125 of 156 
 
the bottom I am referring to the last column. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  18/11 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  2009. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It says Travelex Retail 
Card Whizz US$13 182,53.  This is the - this is the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The amount? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Preloaded amount that 
10 
was loaded onto each of these cards. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  That is US$13 182,00? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You might be able to - you might have recollection of 
how - at - at that time how much that was in Rands more or less? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair if I can recollect it 
would have been 100 000 because that is what I signed for on the card. 
CHAIRPERSON:  100 000? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you came back from Singapore how much of 
that R100 000,00 had been used? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I - I am not sure Chair.  I 
cannot recall. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 126 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do - do you know whether there was anything left on 
the amount that had been loaded? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I - I cannot recall Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But are you able to - to say that while you might not 
recall whether you used the whole amount you are able to say that you 
must have used more than 80 percent of the amount or more than 90 
percent of the amount or you not able to say that? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I - I would say so Chair 
but I can confirm if the documents are shown to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay but your - your recollection is that you must 
10 
have used more than 80 percent of the amount? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I do not know whether Ms Wentzel on these 
transactions you have been able to make the total of what was used? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I have not but I will do it overnight for you 
Chair and I will … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I will tell you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  It is important just to get - give us the picture 
of how much was spent.  Yes. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  I will address that overnight Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo can you tell the Chair what 
was your relationship with Colonel Lazarus - I mean General Lazarus 
and General Mdluli? 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 127 of 156 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before you do that.  We have dealt Ms Wentzel 
with the - with page 102 which as I understand the position relates to 
Colonel Naidoo.  Maybe … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And somebody else or just him alone.  There is the 
other one that relates to other members of the delegation.  Do you not 
want to deal with that? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  We can deal with that.  I was thinking 
that I would deal with it tomorrow when I have had a chance also so 
10 
that I can add this all up and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Maybe deal with it … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Deal with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Deal with it insofar as you are able to and all that 
might be left is just … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Just the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The figures, ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  The quantum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before we move onto something else. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo could you have a look at the 
document at page 100. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Okay.  I am there. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And at page 101 this also seems to be 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 128 of 156 
 
reflected backwards.  So you will see that on 19 November 2009 there 
is an amount of US$13 152,53.  Is that correct? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And it is very close to the amount that was 
loaded onto the card under your name. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yours was 13 182,53. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It is probably because I 
see it is over - it is done on two separate days.  So probably with the 
exchange rate. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It is a variation in the 
amounts. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And so with that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Otherwise - I am sorry.  Otherwise it was meant to be 
the same amount? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It was 100 000 each 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So that - that would 
20 
probably account for the small variation … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Because it was done 
over two days.  One car on the 19 t h and the other one on the 18 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 129 of 156 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And then the transactions that are then 
reflected up until 27 November 2009 would those reflect transactions 
that took place during the trip to Singapore while you were overseas? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I - I just want to look at 
the dates quickly.  Chair I can confirm that all of these purchasers were 
made while we were on this trip. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
In 
terms 
of 
the 
timeframes … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Or the dates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and do you have any recollection as to whether 
they too would have used no less than 80 percent of the amount to say 
the least or is - is that something you did not apply your mind to? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair.  I will have to - 
I will have to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have to have a look? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I have to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Look at his documents … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  All the time. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Barnard - I mean Colonel Naidoo 
could you explain what your relationship was with General Mdluli and 
General Lazarus? 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 130 of 156 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I worked very 
closely over a long period of time with General Lazarus.  Like I testified 
to earlier.  He was the one who had initially organised for me to be 
placed within Crime Intelligence.  My relationship with General Mdluli 
started - was purely because of my relationship with General Lazarus. 
So that is how I became - I became acquainted or - or close 
to General Mdluli. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And could you tell the Chair what sort of 
functions you would perform for General Mdluli and General Lazarus. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Sorry 
Ms Wentzel.  
10 
Where - what page are we on? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Page 12 and paragraph 56. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Chair 
when 
General Mdluli was appointed which was in 2009, 1 July - if I am 
correct.  Up to the point of me being placed in witness protection which 
is 21 October 2011 I did minimal work in terms of my own job 
description. 
Purely because there was no time for me to do what I was 
supposed to be doing.  I say this because there always something to do 
for General Lazarus or General Mdluli.  I basically became their lackey.  
20 
I was required at the beck and call at odd hours as well.  This would 
include 
Chair 
making 
sure 
that 
safe 
houses 
- 
at 
that 
time 
General Mdluli made use of a safe house. 
This safe house had to be stocked with groceries.  It had to 
be cleaned. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 131 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Safe house you said? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Safe houses, okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By the way safe houses were houses that were used 
by Crime Intelligence for or performing - for meeting certain people 
including inform - informants in - and also when they needed to do 
some work away from Crime Intelligence offices.  Is that right? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair.  
That would be for operational purposes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So if you could just continue Colonel Naidoo 
as to the sorts of things that you would do for General Mdluli and 
General Lazarus. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And maybe just start again on what exactly you were 
supposed to do with regard to safe houses. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair General Mdluli at 
the time made - made use of a safe house.  I had to make sure that the 
safe house was stocked with groceries whenever he was there.  He also 
had a vehicle that was parked there that he used.  I had to make sure 
20 
that the vehicle was cleaned all the time whenever he used it. 
Also initially for purchasing of - of flight tickets for him - this 
is for General Mdluli.  So these things took up part of my time Chair.  I 
was hardly at my office doing the job that I - I was supposed to be 
doing. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 132 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Buying groceries - did you get money from him to buy 
groceries for him in the safe - in the safe house that you used? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair.  This would be 
funds from the Secret Service Account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The - the funds would be from the Secret Service 
Account? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you need to put those under your name as well or 
not really? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I would have to take an 
10 
advance on my name Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay and you able to indicate more or less what 
kind of money you would use for groceries at any particular time if 
there was a kind of more or less common amount or was it - it is not 
easy to say? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair, I - I cannot recall 
but if the documents are shown - shown to me I can confirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo did you also - were you also 
required to do things for Mr Marimuthu? 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair on one occasion I 
do recall it was on a Saturday Chair.  Mr Marimuthu - by this stage a 
relationship had been established by - between General Lazarus and 
Mr Marimuthu.  I got a call it was a Saturday morning.  I think it was 
between six and seven.  If I am correct in my time. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 133 of 156 
 
Mr Marimuthu said that he needs a toothbrush and toothpaste 
and that I should buy these items and bring it to me.  He was - he was 
booked into the Holiday Inn.  It was the one near OR Tambo 
International. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was Mr Marimuthu part of Crime Intelligence? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair at that stage the 
relationship between himself and General Lazarus was in the process 
of being established or it was already established by that stage.  I am 
just not sure of the timeframe … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But he later be - he was 
later signed on as a contact person at Crime Intelligence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair this particular 
incident it really made me stop to think for a moment.  Is this what 
Crime Intelligence has come to and I also questioned my own - my own 
- my own position on this.  Is this what I joined the police for?  It was 
really the - quite a low point for me at that stage. 
I was getting instruction from a convicted drug dealer to bring 
him a toothpaste and a toothbrush. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Did you know Mr Marimuthu to be a drug dealer? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair like I mentioned 
earlier in the paragraph that I read.  It is - this is not fact.  What I read 
out is conversations that I had with various colleagues of mine at Crime 
Intelligence regarding Mr Marimuthu and his relationship - his status 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 134 of 156 
 
and his relationship with General Bheki Cele. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but this was just an allegation and you did not 
know it to be a fact that he was a drug dealer? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair, but 
I am just expressing my - my thoughts at the time Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  So this is what you - you were thinking and 
you were reflecting on - on your position to say is this what you came 
to do? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and then what happened? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I eventually went.  
I - I bought him the items.  I gave it to him and then I subsequently 
dropped him off at General Lazarus’ house and I left. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair you indicated you wanted to stop at 
three.  Is that still the position? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Maybe let us continue a little bit and let me see.  
Well let us continue and let me see how - maybe we will end up at half 
- we will - we will stop at half past.  Let us just continue a bit, ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Okay.  Colonel Naidoo we are now going to 
deal with what you have referred to as the 250 posts.  These were 
appointments and promotions made in Crime Intelligence.  It is dealt 
with at your statement at page 13 from paragraph 58 onwards.  Could 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 135 of 156 
 
you please give the Chair some background into this? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair before we go to 
that - if I may.  I just reflect on two things that comes to mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Regarding the Singapore 
trip. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I remember having 
a conversation with General Lazarus where he told me that the Queen 
is heavy on the pocket and what this simply means is Queen referring 
10 
to Lyons was heavy on the pocket.  He told me that General Mdluli had 
told him that or - or rather what I picked up from this conversation she 
was actually becoming a nuisance.  I say that because … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
General Mdluli 
complained to General Lazarus that Theresa Lyons his girlfriend at the 
time was shopping excessively and she was putting financial burdens 
on him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  He had then asked 
20 
General Lazarus for more money because he had run out of funds. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  This happened on two 
occasions Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 136 of 156 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  This was in Singapore 
and on our return from Singapore to South Africa General Mdluli again 
asked General Lazarus for money because he had run out of funds. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes.  Okay, thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo if you could now please deal 
with these 250 posts that became available at Crime Intelligence during 
January and February 2010. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How did this come about?  Please just go ahead and 
relayed the story as you know it. 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I am not sure 
exactly how this came about but I know that General Lazarus was 
driving this process.  It was during the period 2010 - early 2010 where 
250 posts were made available for positions within Crime Intelligences.  
This is now commonly known as the 250 posts. 
This - these were all covert posts.  Chair most of these 
positions were - were utilised to provide employment for family and 
friends of General Mdluli (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  As far as you know were these posts officially 
created?  In other words if one went to the records of Crime 
20 
Intelligence would one find documents relating to their creation or is 
that something you do not know. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair as far as I know 
this was not done in - as with the normal police system the open 
account where an advert would be placed in the - in the newspaper.  
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 137 of 156 
 
Saying that X amount of posts are available with - with each rank.  As 
far as I know it was a - a covert post placed in the newspaper.  
Meaning that it did not reflect that these were positions that needed to 
be filled within Crime Intelligence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Could you tell the Chair as you understand it 
what would be the normal procedure to be followed when appointing an 
agent to Crime Intelligence? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
 
Chair 
normally 
to 
appoint an agent, an agent is generally a police official, an official, 
10 
they must be or they should be an operation registered that would be 
addressing a specific crime area or syndicate.  Generally an agent is a 
police official, or police member, that police member would be 
identified by the project manager or the person that is running that 
specific operation or project.    
 
Once this individual is identified and he is suitable for that 
particular project Chair I think I am going to like you mentioned earlier 
this is now ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, you’re ...[intervenes]  
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It is giving too much of 
20 
detail 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja ...[intervenes]  
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I am going to skip this 
point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, skip whatever I would give information that should 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 138 of 156 
 
not be given out publicly. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but maybe I could ask this is there a difference 
between an agent and an informant or informer? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Chair like I mentioned 
an agent is generally a police official, an informer is a private citizen 
recruited to gather intelligence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Informers are normally 
remunerated for their work. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  As and when they do work? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They are not paid monthly? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Informers 
are 
paid 
monthly Chair but they are also remunerated on successes as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So do they have a basic salary? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  If you could say so yes, 
they get a basic salary and they are remunerated in terms of their 
production. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So there’s a performance bonus as it were if – or a 
20 
success fee as it were if they have done something quite well on a 
particular project then apart from their basic salary they get paid 
something to top up. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright, but the difference between them and an 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 139 of 156 
 
agent is that an agent is a member of the SAPS whereas they don’t – 
they are not members of the SAPS, or they do not need to be members 
of the SAPS. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair, an 
agent is generally or normally a member of the police. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, alright. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Colonel Naidoo now looking at page 14, 
paragraph 64 of your statement could you explain to the Chair how 
members of the Mdluli family came to be appointed to be Crime 
Intelligence? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well he might already have mentioned the Mdluli 
family but let us try and get him to just give evidence about who was 
appointed and so on and if it happens to be Mdluli family that is fine.   
Just speak more on this – Colonel Naidoo – as to who got appointed as 
far as you know to these positions and so and so on. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair if I may regarding 
the Mdluli family how their appointment came about, if I just can get a 
few moments to explain. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  This was around January 
or February 2010 Chair, I was in General Lazarus’s office when General 
Mdluli arrived, with normal protocol I greeted him and excused myself, 
and he said I should wait.  General Mdluli the produced a piece of 
paper and he gave it to General – or handed it over to General Lazarus 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 140 of 156 
 
and he said the he wants all of those people on that list to be 
appointed, and I am referring to this 250 posts, the covert post. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  General Lazarus then 
asked General Mdluli how or what would be the best way that these 
individuals that was written on this piece of paper how they were going 
to be appointed.  Chair I cannot remember the exact conversation but 
they both agreed that these individuals should be appointed into the 
agent programme or rather placed and appointed into – appointed first 
and then placed into the agent programme. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes when you are appointed as an agent as opposed 
to an informer are you paid generally at a higher rate than an informer?  
Or not necessarily? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair an agent would get 
his normal salary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As a member of the police? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  As a normal, it depends 
on what his rank is he will get the same amount.  Informers 
remuneration can fluctuate, it all depends on the successes and the 
intelligence they gather. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you say an agent would get his normal salary that 
he was getting as a police officer before being appointed as an agent? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then upon being appointed as agent there is then 
some additional amount that is added to his salary or not? 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 141 of 156 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Not that I am aware of 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, so he would normally be paid the same amount 
that he would have been paid if he had remained at the rank at which 
he was simply as a member of the police? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair, b 
but just there is more detail to this, but it is going to delve into 
operational matters so I do not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay no that is fine, that is fine. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Now you deal in your statement which 
10 
individuals associated with the – General Mdluli’s family were 
appointed as agents, it is difficult to – for you to testify to this without 
disclosing the family relationship but could you broadly say how many 
appointments were made to – who were members of General Mdluli’s 
family and friends? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I will do that in a moment 
Chair, if I could just finish up on my previous, I am referring to 64, the 
Mdluli family regarding the conversation at General Lazarus’s office. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Regarding the piece of 
20 
paper that was handed to General Lazarus from General Mdluli, 
General Lazarus then instructed me to fetch documents, these are 
application for employment in SAPS, it is a booklet Chair that one 
needs to fill out for employment, which I did, I collected a stack of 
them, I brought it back and I handed it over to General Mdluli. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 142 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what document did you hand over to General 
Mdluli? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It has got a specific 
number Chair, at this stage I cannot recall it, but it is basically an 
application for employment in SAPS. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay, and why did you give that to him? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I think it is a Z8 form, I 
am not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why did you give that to him? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
General 
Lazarus 
10 
instructed me to get a few of those from Colonel Furstenburg’s office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh were they forms that would be filled by the 
persons that General Mdluli wanted to be appointed? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, yes continue. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That stack of booklets I 
handed over to the General Mdluli and he subsequently left.   After 
General Mdluli left General Lazarus took a look at the piece of paper 
that was handed over to him from General Mdluli – Chair I am sorry I 
just went ahead of myself a little bit. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Referring to those people 
or individuals that were going to be appointed as agents.  I testified 
that General Lazarus and Mdluli agreed that those individuals should 
be placed in the agent program and General Lazarus asked General 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 143 of 156 
 
Mdluli who was going to be the handler, and General Mdluli looked in 
my direction and said this man can do it, I trust him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   And were you ultimately appointed as their 
handler? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Indeed, seven, I was 
handling seven agents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is a handler like their supervisor who should know 
what activities they are involved in and what really they do in terms of 
their responsibilities as agents? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  In essence that is what it 
is Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and if anybody wants to find out where they are 
and what they are busy with they would come to you? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  To their handler that is 
correct, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To their handler, yes okay, alright. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Chair 
after 
General 
Mdluli left General Lazarus looked at the piece of paper that was 
handed to him, and he told me that Mdluli wanted to appoint his family 
20 
members, referring to the list. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  His exact words were 
Delani wants to appoint and I mentioned obviously I cannot mention the 
names, FM24 and FM28. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 144 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  General Lazarus was 
referring to FM24, he mentioned Delani wants to appoint his vrou  and 
the queen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That simply means at 
that stage the vrou referring to his then wife, and the queen, referring 
to the girlfriend. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  (laughing) 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair it is a bit difficult 
10 
here because you know with the code names or code numbers it is a bit 
difficult for me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I said Chair with the 
code numbers it is a bit difficult. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well are you at – are you looking at paragraph 67? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  66 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  66? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay, okay no I understand what you are saying.   
20 
Yes, continue. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair as in 67 of my 
statement I am just going to read it out because it is basically there is 
no names, it is numbers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 145 of 156 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   
“The following individuals associated with General Mdluli’s 
family were subsequently appointed as agents within CI 
following the aforementioned discussion; FM24, FM29, FM26, 
FM28, FM27.” 
And then we go on to 68, point 68, although I am uncertain of the 
relationship between General Mdluli and the following two individuals 
they formed part of the appointments following the discussion between 
General Lazarus and General Mdluli, hence I have included them as 
part of the General Mdluli family, these two would be FM25 and FM30. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And FM30? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Then Colonel Naidoo were similar 
appointments made in respect of General Lazarus’s family and friends? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before we do that, you did confirm that those 
persons in General Mdluli’s list that were his family members as well as 
the two persons that you mentioned in paragraph 68 where you said 
you were not sure if they were ...[intervenes]  
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Chair I can confirm it 
20 
quickly referring to the list that I have in front of me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  If I have a moment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm.  What are you seeking to confirm Colonel 
Naidoo? 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 146 of 156 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair in terms of the list 
that I have in front of me I am just confirming that the codes that are in 
the statement is actually the person that is on my list.  I do confirm the 
codes according to my list Chair, as to what I put it in my statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, alright, you did confirm that you ultimately 
were the handler for all those persons mentioned in paragraph 67 and 
paragraph 68 by way of the codes? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and at the time that you went onto the witness 
protection program were you still their handler? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, so that would mean that you would have been 
their handler for about a year from 20? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It was more than a year 
Chair, it was from 2010, the first few months of 2010, to October 2011, 
so it would be about a year and a half Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it could be about a year and a half? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  I think after this Ms Wentzel you to 
then say whether there was somebody else within Crime Intelligence 
20 
whose family and friends were also appointed to some of these posts. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was there? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   First with – first let us deal with General 
Lazarus’s family and friends, which is dealt with on page 16, paragraph 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 147 of 156 
 
69. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes, Chair I am also 
going to read this out because it is basically code names, code 
numbers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And I read the family, 
and this is page 16: 
“The Lazarus family and friends point 69, General Lazarus 
also secured the undue appointment and promotion of his 
family, 
friends and 
associates 
as 
follows; 
FM01 
was 
10 
appointed as a Warrant Officer without any prior appointment 
in the SAPS or Crime Intelligence.  FM01 was appointed as a 
Warrant Officer without any prior appointment in SAPS or CI 
and a few months later this same person was promoted to 
Captain.  FM03 was appointed as Captain without any prior 
appointment in the SAPS or CI.  FM04 was appointed as a 
Lieutenant Colonel without any prior appointment in SAPS or 
CI.  FM05 was appointed as a clerk, FM06 was appointed as 
a Captain coming from the SAPS in Pietermaritzburg at a 
lower rank and as a clerk.  FM31 was appointed as a 
20 
constable without any prior police experience.  FM32 [I see 
it’s redacted], owner of [redacted] an entity dealt with below 
was appointed as a captain without any prior appointment in 
SAPS or CI.  FM33 was appointed as a Colonel under 
General Lazarus, her husband was appointed as a Colonel at 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 148 of 156 
 
[and the name is redacted] without any prior appointment in 
the SAPS or CI.   FM34 was stationed at SAPS Tongaat in the 
uniform branch to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.  General 
Lazarus was previously stationed at this station where he and 
FM34 were friends.   FM34’s three daughters were also 
employed through General Lazarus due his relationship or 
friendship with Warrant Officer FM34.” 
Chair I cannot recall their names or on what level they were placed or 
promoted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And I am now reading 
from point 70 Chair. 
“Those of us who were within General Lazarus’s inner circle 
received promotions often skipping a rank.  Those of us who 
benefitted were as follows; I was promoted from Warrant 
Officer to Lieutenant Colonel, FM07, a close confidante of 
General Lazarus was appointed from the rank of Captain to 
Colonel.  I am convinced that his promotion needed to be 
concealed as shortly thereafter he was placed into the Agent 
Programme.  FM08, a close confidante of General Lazarus 
20 
and the son of [redacted] from CI was promoted from 
constable ...[intervenes] ...” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry, sorry Ms Wentzel will you make sure that that 
gap is filled to say the son of who because I assume it is somebody 
who should be given an FM code. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 149 of 156 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   This person does not have an FM code but – 
because they weren’t an agent but it would identify who this person was 
the son of, and I understand that is why it was redacted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat that. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   If I understand it the son of – this person was 
not given an FM number because I do not think that person was an 
agent, and just whose son it was was redacted so that you could not 
then deduce who the person was, but I will make sure that an FM 
number is given to that person as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, because it is maybe necessary to say something 
10 
so that’s not just have blank, if it is X or Y. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes I appreciate that, it would be much 
better. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With maybe in brackets something indicating why it 
cannot be disclosed. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes I agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but obviously Colonel Naidoo knows who the son 
or the son of? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I know who this 
person is, he is, I believe he is now deceased, he is late. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay but disclosing that person might disclose 
FM08? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It would probably, might 
do that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, alright, yes, continue. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 150 of 156 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I am reading from 70.4.  
FM12 who is related to General Lazarus’s wife was appointed to 
Colonel from the rank of Captain.  I am convinced FM12 Chair, I think 
this is incorrect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It must have been his promotion, not promotions. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  This is incorrect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It must have been meant to be his promotion? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Chair 
70.4 
should 
actually read FM09. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh it should be FM09, not 12. 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, so that should be in a supplementary affidavit 
Ms Wentzel. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because this would have been sent to the implicated 
person as is. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the supplementary affidavit would say that the 
reference FM12 in Clause 17.4 is incorrect, it should FM whatever the 
code is supposed to be. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes, I will attend to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, continue. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I will just read 17.4 again 
Chair: 
“FM09 who is related to General Lazarus’ wife was appointed 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 151 of 156 
 
to Colonel on the rank of Captain.  I am convinced that his 
promotion also needed to be concealed as shortly thereafter 
he was placed in the Agents Programme.   FM10 a confidante 
and possible business partner to General Lazarus was 
promoted from Lieutenant Colonel to a full Colonel.” 
And then I go onto the Marimuthu family, this is point 71 Chair: 
“The Marimuthu family and friends also benefited from their 
association with General Lazarus.  This was still under the 
umbrella of the 250 posts.  General Lazarus appointed the 
following person from Mr Marimuthu’s family, these were ...” 
10 
Mr Marimuthu himself Chair was not appointed in this process, he was 
registered as a contact person and he received a salary in the amount 
of R50 000 per month. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What’s the difference, if any, between a contact 
person and an informer? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair an informer is 
remunerated by CI, is registered on the system.   A contact person 
normally deals with ad hoc information, is not a registered person 
within CI. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And would he be paid on an ad hoc basis and when 
20 
there is something he has helped the police with, or he would also be – 
receive a standard payment, salary? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Chair 
from 
what 
I 
understand the contact person does not get remunerated, although they 
can, it all depends on the level of assistance, if you want to put it that. 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 152 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Whereas an informer 
gets a monthly stipend and obviously based on successes gets 
remunerated on that level as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, continue. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Like I mentioned Mr 
Marimuthu was not promoted in this process but he was registered as a 
contact person and he received an amount of R50 000 per month.  This 
piece of information was told to me by his handler Chair, which is 
FM08. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Claims from SIC would 
prove this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  FM13 was appointed as a 
colonel, without any prior appointment in the SAPS or CI.  Chair this is 
still within the Marimuthu family. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
71.2, 
FM35 
was 
appointed as a Lieutenant Colonel, without any prior appointment in the 
20 
SAPS or CI.  FM15 was appointed as a Captain or Lieutenant Colonel 
without any prior appointment in the SAPS or CI.  FM36 was appointed 
as a Colonel, after leave the SAPS at a lower ranks some years prior to 
this appointment.  FM17 was appointed as a Captain without any prior 
appointment in the SAPS or CI.  FM18 was appointed as a clerk and 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 153 of 156 
 
FM19 was appointed as a clerk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And so these were all either family members of Mr 
Marimuthu or friends of the Marimuthu family? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and altogether it was one, two, three, four, five, 
six, seven, eight, eight people excluding Mr Marimuthu or nine with 
him. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair, 
eight without him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Yes and then ...[intervenes]  
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I also referred to 
another incident that I remember, this is in direct relation to how these 
individuals were appointed, like I mentioned earlier General Lazarus 
travelled with me to – from his home to his office and back, this was 
almost every day.  On one occasion, if I can remember it was coming 
back from work in the afternoon, having a conversation with him, and 
he said that Timmy did a lot for him and he is going to return the 
favour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was this now after or before or after the appointment 
of Mr Marimuthu’s family members and friends to some of these 
20 
positions? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I assume this was 
before, this statement was made “Timmy did a lot for me and I am going 
to return the favour” I assume they were subsequently appointed after 
him saying this, because in what he said he is going to do it, so it still 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 154 of 156 
 
needed to be done, from what I understand this to be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes continue Ms Wentzel. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Chair it is half past three, unless you would 
like to continue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe we could reach, this could go quite quickly, 
maybe we could finish the appointments, these appointments and they 
go up to the top of paragraph 24, I think he will be fast with those. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes, Colonel Naidoo we are at page 19, so 
you have told us up to now that General Mdluli came to General 
Lazarus with a paper which reflected names of his family members that 
10 
he wanted to be appointed to some of the 250 posts, and that that was 
done and that then General Lazarus also had his own family members 
and friends appointed as well to some of these posts and that the 
family members, or certain family members of the Marimuthu family 
were also appointed and their friends to some of the posts, is that 
right? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and then I see that at page 19 you have 
something to say about Colonel Barnard. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair, if I 
20 
can just continue reading from my statement.    
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Page 19, point 73, 
Colonel Barnard was a Colonel, who is a Colonel in the procurement 
unit of CI and had dealings with SSA account referring to the Secret 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 155 of 156 
 
Service Account, his son or family members of his were appointed, 
Chair I do not see the FM numbers, 73.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are there names there, which should not be there and 
should be represented by FM codes? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair at this stage we 
don’t have them because on the statement it’s redacted and on the FM 
list I don’t have their names. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, maybe let us stop here.  Ms Wentzel would you 
please just go through the whole of this documents with Colonel 
Naidoo, identify things that should be corrected. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then have a supplementary affidavit that will 
correct things, so that tomorrow we can just move with some speed 
without any problem. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes, we will attend to this overnight Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay Colonel Naidoo we are going to stop at this 
stage, it is about twenty nine minutes to four and I am thinking whether 
I should say we should start at half past nine tomorrow or not, but I 
might wish to not disturb my plans in terms what time to start to take 
care of my health situation.   
20 
 
From your side Colonel Naidoo if I were to say we shall start 
at half past nine that would not create any problems? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That would be fine Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That would be fine with you, okay let us say we will 
start at half past nine tomorrow but there is room that in the morning 
30 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 173 
 
Page 156 of 156 
 
depending on how I feel, I might send a message that we will start at 
ten, so if you come at half past nine and find that there is a message 
that we will start at ten please bear with me, but if at all possible we 
will try half past nine. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes, that is perfectly suitable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you.  We will stop at that then for today.  
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 1 OCTOBER 2019
