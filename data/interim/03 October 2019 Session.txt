PROCEEDINGS COMMENCE 3 OCTOBER 2019 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good afternoon Ms Gcabashe, good afternoon 
everybody. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Good afternoon DCJ 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Good afternoon Mr Thabethe. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Are you ready Ms Gcabashe? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Yes, yes we are Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  I think in the light of the lapse of time 
another oath must be administered.  Please administer the oath before 
10 
we start? 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Mbana Peter Thabethe. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the prescribed oath? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
conscience? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the 
truth; the whole truth and nothing but the truth if so please raise your 
20 
right hand and say, so help me God. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Thank you Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 3 of 115 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Chairman with your leave might I just give 
you a very short roadmap. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Covering the areas that we will dealing with 
today we hope we can finish by tomorrow. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Chairman in about early September the 
commission was able to source a significant amount of information from 
the NPA as you had asked us to try and do.  Our investigators got onto 
it. We have indeed included those documents that are relevant to Mr 
10 
Thabethe in the Reference bundle and will refer you to them at the 
relevant time.  Included in this documentation is the affidavit of Mr 
Thabethe which he deposed to in 2017 under Park Road Case number 
200/0701/2017.  That affidavit has always been part of our bundles 
Chairman.  What was missing were the annexures and we were having 
a little of difficulty at some point in dealing with those annexures 
because as you indicated without the annexures the evidence itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The picture was not complete. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Ja  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja Hm. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Creates a few difficulties.  So we – we now 
have most of those annexures Chairman so we will be taking Mr 
Thabethe through those just so he gives context to what he has said in 
his affidavits.  Chairman in light of that might I ask leave to hand up 
two documents – two files.  The first one is Exhibit HH10B it is Mr 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 4 of 115 
 
Thabethe’s affidavit but this really consists of all those annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  That we have been able to source. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So there are just annexures there nothing 
else. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Chairman then this… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there an indication here – oh the affidavit is there 
as well? 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  The affidavit Chairman is in File A we have 
had it all along. You may even have scribbled notes on it I really am not 
sure.  It is the very last … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Affidavit in – in File A.  So you now have… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  For… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in other words what I have here is the affidavit 
that we have always had but we did not have annexures. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But now we also have annexures. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is the complete set as far as that affidavit is 
concerned?  Maybe there might be some annexures that you have not 
been able to get? 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 5 of 115 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Chairman there are. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Annexures we have not been able to get. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but most are here. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  I will be indicating – Sir? 
CHAIRPERSON:  But most are here? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Most are there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Then Chairman the second file I would like to 
hand up and ask you to admit to the record is an additional Reference 
10 
bundle.  The documents in this Reference bundle largely come from 
documentation we sourced from another witness’ bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  You will be hearing her evidence in due 
course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  But because she has not appeared before you 
yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  We thought it prudent to use – she actually 
20 
had more information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Than Mr Thabathe was able to source. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  He has been struggling to get informationl. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 6 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So with your leave Chair we have called this 
Exhibit HH Reference bundle F for Freddy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this one that you have already handed up you 
would like to be admitted as. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  The one I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Exhibit HH10B? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Correct Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  The lever arch file containing Mr Thabethe’s 
affidavit of 10 August 2017 with annexures thereto will be admitted as 
10 
Exhibit HH10B.  And then this one.  Do you want to keep it as Exhibit 
HH without any number? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Chairman with the Reference bundles we 
have not given them numbers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the past? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  In the past. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  The … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  If I might? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Chairman assist.  We have in fact just given 
20 
them lower case letters of the alphabet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Reference.  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  To identify that particular file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  To make it easy to identify. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 7 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  The lever arch file that has got various 
documents starting with Free State Legislature copies, member 
translators – surely it is marked – it is reflected as Appropriation Bill.  
So the file – the lever arch file containing various documents starting 
with Appropriation Bill – an Appropriation Bill will be marked Exhibit HH 
Reference bundle F.  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Chairman there is one more Reference bundle 
that ought to be with you but is not we have found.  It is Reference 
bundle E which comes just before the one you have just admitted.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  My recollection is that we had – you had 
admitted it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Last time we were here at some point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So one of the investigators has gone across 
the road to make sure you – you get your copy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  As far as I know Chairman we will not be 
referring to it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Certainly not in the first hour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Might I proceed Chairman? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may proceed. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 8 of 115 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Thank you.  Mr Thabethe good afternoon 
again. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Good afternoon. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  I am hoping to the do the following to try and 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I think we were going to let his counsel place 
himself on record first. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Oh yes indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Especially because there has now been a change of 
legal representatives.   
10 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  Good afternoon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good afternoon. 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  I am Nqabayethu Buthelezi on 
instruction from Lugisani Mantsha Attorneys now representing Mr 
Thabethe.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Mr Thabetha I was just indicating that the 
first thing I am probably going to do is just put the version of Mr 
20 
Mosenbenzi Zwane before you. The commission has now received hisk 
sworn statement and I think at some point the Chairman may elect to 
ask him to come and give oral evidence.  But because we do not know 
when that might be I just want to sure that you understand his version 
especially in relation to your roles and responsibilities as he 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 9 of 115 
 
understood them and set them out in his version.  So I will be putting 
that to you.  I will just start with that to get it out of the way.  That will 
then be followed by the annexures that we were missing from the 2017 
affidavit.  We will deal with those very quickly.  You will just give 
content to them now that you have them before you.  Those have 
indeed been placed before you.  After that portion we will deal with 
outstanding matters arising from the questions we had asked you 
earlier on and also just seeking clarity on one or two aspects.  And we 
hope to complete this entire exercise by tomorrow in going through 
some of the annual financial reports.  Going through the monthly and 
10 
quarterly statements that Estina presented to you etcetera.  So that is 
the idea we hoping to finish with that section.  There are one or two 
other things we had indicated to you that there are media reports we 
will be putting to you etcetera.  But those are very short questions that 
I knitted into what we will be asking you.  Are you happy with that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja I am – the only thing I wanted to 
check Chair.  I have not received the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The affidavit? 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The affidavit yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Well I am sure you will make it available to 
him ahead of him having to deal with it. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Chairman I – if that is your ruling that is in 
order but we do not… 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 10 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I am not making a ruling.  I am just saying I am 
sure that you do not intend to ambush him. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Chairman I – I did not understand that when 
an implicated party gives us a version that we give that version to the 
next implicated party.  That is really how we are sitting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Mr Mosenbenzi Zwane is an implicated party. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  No, no I think what we have been doing 
is when a witness – a witness as opposed – I mean they are all witness 
but a witness as distinct from an implicated person has implicated 
10 
somebody when that person has given the commission a version then 
that affidavit would be given to – to him – to the witness.  So I think 
effectively he is saying he would expect to be furnished with a copy.  I 
think what should happen is his counsel and yourself will talk and then 
we will take things from there.  Is that – in other words if they want to 
put a request they first discuss with you and there may be no need for 
any ruling.  But if there is a problem then it can come to me.  Is that 
fine? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Not really Chairman because that is what I 
was going to start with. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  But if this is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okayh. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Because it is just another witness who is 
going to say something about him. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 11 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And I thought that he should at least have the 
benefit of hearing that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Before we go back to where we were 
essentially. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  When we stopped last time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  But this is why I say I am in your hands 
10 
Chairman I am guided by you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no I see his counsel seems to want to say 
something and maybe let me hear what he has to say.  It may or may 
not be necessary to adjourn for a few minutes to resolve the issue. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja let me hear what he has to say. 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair.  It is – it is I think 
it is a similar problem that keeps arising at the commission where a 
witness is served with a Rule 3.3 Notice and after having been served 
with this Rule 3.3 Notice is then expected to respond to the contents or 
20 
the paragraphs in the implicating statement that there is.  Confusion 
somewhat exists between ourselves as to say are we here to answer to 
allegations that are contained in the statements of other witnesses or 
are we here on the strength of our own independent statement?  And it 
is our understanding and our request that if Mr Thabethe is expected to 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 12 of 115 
 
testify or give answers with regards to the evidence of another witness 
that may have potentially even implicated himself that he be given 
ample time to consider that so that we do not stall the commission 
when he is unable to provide answers or give context to questions that 
are not intended to ambush him in our understanding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes well I use the term ambush. 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  I accept it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it might not be appropriate. 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It might not be appropriate.  I think what we should 
10 
do is – I should probably adjourn for something like five to ten minutes.  
Give both sides a chance to talk about – about the issue and then when 
I come back if it is resolved it is resolved – if I have to make any 
decision we can take it from there.  Or if a decision must be made at 
another time then that would be fine.  I think the – I think the – the 
difference really is here that certainly Ms Gcabashe wants to put to Mr 
Thabethe whatever version Mr Zwane has so that he can comment on it. 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is for sure.  That is 1.  
2. The question would be whether Mr Thabethe should have a copy of 
20 
that affidavit before he is asked or not or is it enough if he is told this 
is what you have said but Mr Zwane says this, what do you say?  You 
know.  And it may well be that at a practical level really having the copy 
or not might be neither here nor there. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 13 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know.  So maybe let us – let me adjourn for five 
to ten minutes.  It is twenty past now and then let us say at half past I 
will return unless in the meantime both sides have approached me in 
chambers.  So if there is no approach I will just return. 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Indebted to you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  You understand what is going on ne? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes I do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  I am going to adjourn then until half past.  
10 
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Gcabashe. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  Chairman I now 
have Reference bundle E to hand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before – well… 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And all E is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before that has the issue been sorted out? 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Oh yes – yes it has Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And I actually very quickly took Mr 
Buthelezi through. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. What you had in mind. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 14 of 115 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The portions that are relevant to this 
stream. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Because there are other streams in that 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Where – because he is responding to 
various 3.3’s that he was given. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I think they are satisfied Chairman. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That I am not trying to ambush them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  This commission would not ambush them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And… 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You are here to protect them in any event. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright.  And the Chairperson should not 
have said ambush.  Okay let – the Chairperson should have known that 
20 
this counsel would not ambush anybody.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I try Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman Reference bundle E has 
appeared and all it is really is that Reference bundle D was rather large 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 15 of 115 
 
so we split it to make it easier for you to handle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The documentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Again Chairman I must say the only 
reason we have so many Reference bundles is because we have been 
struggling to get information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Mr Thabethe had struggled.  We managed 
to put together what we now have. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And we will be using it with all the other 
implicated parties and regular witnesses will be coming through. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and you said this one we have already 
admitted? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    I – Chairman just out of an abundance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will check. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Of caution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I do not know if you can formulate a 
20 
sentence that says in the event that I now admit… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well no that would cause more confusion.  I think – I 
think somebody needs to check and then tomorrow morning especially if 
you are not going to be using it really.  So tomorrow morning we can 
have clarity. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 16 of 115 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Might I proceed? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja you may proceed. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you.  Mr Thabethe this is Mr 
Zwane’s version that should he be given the opportunity he will be 
placing before this commission.  It is just important for you to 
understand what he says because you worked in the same environment.  
The context of the first few questions really relates to what we have 
been discussing all along.  Section 38 of the PFMA which really sets 
10 
out the responsibilities of an Accounting Officer.  You are happy with 
that?  We have dealt with that ad nauseam.  You are happy with it. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  [Not speaking into the microphone]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You might wish to bring the microphone a little closer 
to you Mr Thabethe.  Not too close but Ja.  Ja thank you.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So the first thing I want to deal with is Mr 
Zwane’s view where essentially agrees with you with respect to the 
responsibilities that fall within the jurisdiction of an Accounting Officer.  
He in fact draws a clear distinction between the responsibilities of an 
Accounting Officer and those of a member of the Executive Council.  
20 
And when I interpret what he says or when I read what he says he 
really is quoting the constitution.  You know Section 133 of The 
Constitution which sets out the roles of the Executive Council.  Are you 
happy with that proposition? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No I am fine. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 17 of 115 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The next proposition is in his affidavit Mr 
Zwane says that the Mohoma Mobung Project was his brain child.  And I 
have understood that to be your evidence.  Please correct me if my 
understanding is wrong. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes.  Because your evidence is you found 
this process in place when you arrived? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Correct.  And we know that Mr 
Jankielsohn himself told us about Mr Zwane talking to him about 
10 
Mohoma Mobung.  Good so no disagreement here.  He also says that is 
Mr Zwane also says that he introduced the idea of Mohoma Mobung to 
the Executive Council of the Free State.  This would be correct in your 
view as I understand your evidence.  Because the development of 
policy is the prerogative of the executive.  Are you in agreement with 
that proposition? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you.  Again when I look at what he 
says he really is restating what is in Section 125 of the constitution in 
respect of the development and implementation of policy by the 
20 
National Executive or hereby the Provincial Executive in this particular 
instance.  What I will interrogate with you is a fine point around the 
implementation what we call implementation of the mandate of the 
department.  But I will get to that in a minute.  So that is really the only 
area that I want us to – to deal with in a little more detail.  Mr Zwane 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 18 of 115 
 
also says that the EXCO the Executive Council gave him the go ahead 
when he presented Mohoma Mobung as the broad project during his 
budget speech.  You will agree that this was what he did? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Ja.  Then Mr Zwane clearly states that 
after that process the implementation of the project lay in the hands of 
the Accounting Officers and he clarifies.  These are officers who have 
the experience and the knowledge and specialisation to implement what 
has been agreed at policy level.  You would agree with that as well? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja that is correct.  I might maybe 
10 
come back to it. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That is fine.  In fact I am going to break 
that little concept down a little more because there are really two 
propositions to what Mr Zwane says in this particular paragraph of his 
affidavit.  The first relates to who takes responsibility for the 
implementation of policy.  We are going to debate that with you.  Then 
the second speaks to the skills set that is required of an Accounting 
Officer and that that particular individual brings to the job that they 
have been tasked with as Accounting Officer.  I think the second one is 
a quicker one and an easier matter to deal with Mr Thabethe.  Because 
20 
I believe you have already agreed that the position of Accounting 
Officer requires a certain level of skill and knowledge.  Am I correct? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And it is on this basis that you were 
appointed in fact to the position of HOD/Accounting Officer because 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 19 of 115 
 
you had skill and knowledge.  Yes? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is my understanding Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That is what I have understood you to say 
as well.  And you also agree this is really your evidence that when you 
arrived there were two HOD’s.  One for the Department of Agriculture 
and one for the Department of Rural Development.  That is correct? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That is what he says because he says the 
Accounting Officers in the plural and that is how I interpret that.  That 
those officers have certain responsibilities.  Yes?  Then we get to the 
10 
second part of that broader proposition.  Because Mr Zwane’s 
understanding of the implementation of the project is that with respect 
to the implementation of Mohoma Mobung that development framework 
that they sorted out at a higher level. That responsibility sits with the 
Accounting Officer.  I would like your view on that. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Chair I may want to refer back to 
a document that we have spoken to.  I think… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The Exhibit HH the court record I am 
not sure which document has the charge sheet. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you mean you are not sure which lever arch file 
has got the charge sheet? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Which – which has the charge sheet 
but I would – could quickly … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You want to have a look at that here in – before 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 20 of 115 
 
responding? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  If I could – if I could be assisted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Because I would want to start there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes they might be able to … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  In giving that response. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  In my document I can find it much 
quicker Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  Okay. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  So that then they can help me to find 
it on the official document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  On the – on the court file it was I 
think it is page 145. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the court file? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  On the court file page 145. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know.  Do they have it?  Do you have the 
court file? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We do have the court file. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I think that will give you … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja but it is not the paginated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not the paginated court file? 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 21 of 115 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja but it is the – it is the court file 
page 145. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. Oh the – page 145 is not a paginated 145? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Not the paginated it is the original 
court file page number. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Because I am – I understand they are 
still on the documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  You will be able to find it. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman with your leave might we 
proceed? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Because it should be the same document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We will just give it the proper reference 
number. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  For record purposes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  That is fine. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  While – as soon as we find it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  Now Chair this was the charge 
sheet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the criminal case? 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 22 of 115 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  In the criminal case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Now I want to go specifically in 
responding to that question to that page 145. I think it is item number 
24. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Which says: 
“Thabethe’s request was approved by the Provincial 
Executive Council.” 
Now that is what I wanted to … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  To refer to? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  To refer to that I was charged to 
implement the decision of the Executive Council. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That was on the charge sheet of 
court. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That I received approval. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  And I was charged for implementing  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  A decision of council. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The decision of council.  Right now I 
am coming back to the – to the question Chair.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can I just get clarity on what you have 
just said?  So you are talking about that EXCO resolution of the 13 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 23 of 115 
 
June 2012? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Which said you should go ahead and 
implement. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And there were a few things including 
finding the R84 million that was lacking and including – and getting the 
FDC? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  To assist you one way or the other? 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Right. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So that is a document we have spoken 
about already. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  the particular decision as he puts it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman. Just to give context. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Once we know where in the bundles it is then as you 
said we can just make reference to it to say where it is to be found.  So 
the reader of the transcript can relate – can find it easily.  Okay alright. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Chair I am – I was not 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 24 of 115 
 
specifically referring to the – to the EXCO approval as a document but 
this is an extract in the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  From the minutes of an EXCO meeting? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No from the – from the court charge 
sheet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That it was a charge. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That I was implementing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  An approval of the Executive Council. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  So I am just – I am just mentioning 
that part.  We did discuss the document itself where the Executive 
Council had approved. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes okay, okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. All I am referring to is that I got 
charged. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  For implementing the decision of the 
20 
Executive Council. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It is in the charge sheet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  So – may – sorry. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 25 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I must allow you to finish I am just thinking 
that of course if you – if the Executive Council made a decision that 
you must do something illegal you would not be expected to implement 
that, is it not? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair.  As it came that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no, no I am just – it is just that the way you were 
emphasising the point that you were charged for implementing. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Decision of the Executive Council.  I got the 
impression that the point you were seeking to make is how could I be 
charged for implementing a decision of the Executive Council.  So that 
is the context in which I was – I was making that remark. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I hear Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I wanted to refer back to the comment 
she asked me to respond. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That in the affidavit of Mr Zwane was 
20 
that he was not responsible for implementation.  The officials are which 
I accepted and agreed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The implement – the decision is taken 
and we are responsible for the implementation which I have already 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 26 of 115 
 
said I agree that we are responsible for implementation.  Thank you 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Mr Zwane – I beg your pardon.  Mr 
Thabethe you are not Mr Zwane. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well previously I do not know if it was you but 
previously when an evidence leader kept on calling a witness by 
somebody else she said they might have to pay.  Must have been Ms 
Hofmeyr who kept on calling some witness by somebody else’s name.  
10 
Yes okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The – we have too many affidavits we deal 
with Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  But you know counsel has no problem with 
paying.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I am coming to get some cattle from you 
so I can pass them on to somebody Mr Thabethe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes let us continue. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So if we then go back to what you have 
said in your evidence that this framework policy framework developed. 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  My question is, as it was developing did 
you consult Mr Zwane in his capacity as the MEC for agriculture?  Did 
he give you input on that development?  Because I am just trying to 
understand what implementation in these circumstances might mean.  
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 27 of 115 
 
That is really what I am trying to understand. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja Chair.  We had a very long debate 
on this matter.  I remember we wanted to decide whether it was a 
strategy or a concept. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that is your – when you say we is it yourself and 
Mr Zwane or yourself and other officials in the department? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No, no in the commission.  We did 
debate it in the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh outside of the hearing or in the hearing? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  In the hearing Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  It has been a long time.  Since then I have 
had the evidence of many witnesses – other witnesses.  Yes okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what – so what is the point you want to make? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  What I am saying Chair we are 
going back there again.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it might be necessary sometimes just to refresh 
our memory and to reconnect but it depends. But I see Ms Gcabashe is 
shaking her head to say she – we are not going back.  So I think I will 
allow her to ask the question again and then see if you can answer it. 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay thanks Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Mr Thaabethe all I am asking is as the 
whether we call it a strategy, whether we call it a development 
framework as that was being refined – this is what I understood of your 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 28 of 115 
 
evidence that you had to work with it.  Did you get input from your 
political principle in your department?  That is all. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja Chair we made inputs.  We made 
technical inputs into his idea.  My understanding is that it is us who 
were making input to refine it so that technically it becomes 
implementable.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not – I do not know you – in case it is not clear 
you might have to make it clear but it may be that it was clear.  My 
understanding of your question was that it related to – related more to 
refining implementation or how it would be implemented at as opposed 
10 
to the concept but I may have misunderstood.  But I think the answer 
seems to relate to the concept. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I – this is why I was just going to ask. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  For clarity sake Mr Thabethe.  If what you 
are talking about the refinement you are talking about the inputs you 
gave Mr Zwane whether those were before the budget speech where the 
legislature heard about it and before he told his EXCO colleagues 
about it.  Because that would just clarify the matter.  So your inputs 
were before he took steps to put the policy position to his colleagues? 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair.  The police position ends 
when he goes and presents a budget speech and presents the projects 
to the legislature for implementation and the allocation of the budget.  
That is where we then come in and make inputs because that is his 
policy speech that he presents to the legislature.  Then once that has 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 29 of 115 
 
been concluded then our responsibility is then the implementation of 
what has been made policy now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the input that you are talking about that you made 
to his concept is input that was made prior to him presenting his budget 
speech? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  Now because this 
started 
out as 
Mohoma 
Mobung 
you 
eventually reshaped the 
implementation by selecting the Vrede Dairy Project as a mega project. 
10 
Is that part of implementation or just that selection of Vrede as a mega 
project was that part of implementation and therefore part of policy or 
was it part of the everyday application that kind of implementation?  
Just help me understand? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja Chair the Vrede Dairy was one of 
the mega projects of Mohoma Mobung it was not the project.  There 
were other projects under the same concept that were being 
implemented.  So it – the Mohoma Mobung cannot only be referred to 
Vrede Dairy.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Mr Zwane – Mr Thabethe  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are close to paying. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  [African language].  Mr Thabethe I really 
am not trying to trick you.  I really am simply trying to understand 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 30 of 115 
 
implementation as you experienced it there. So it is a matter of 
understanding what it is that you and the officials in the department did 
once the Mohoma Mobung broad concept had been adopted by the 
legislature.  Because once that broad concept had been adopted you 
then looked at various projects. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I have no difficulty with that.  But you also 
in looking at various projects selected the Vrede Dairy Project for 
special attention.  Am I correct? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair I will not say necessarily 
10 
special attention but it was one of the key projects. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe let – let me see if I can  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Good. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me see if I can ask you this question.  The 
decision that there must be Vrede Dairy – there must be the Vrede 
Dairy Project.  The making of that decision I take it was part of the 
implementation of the policy, is that correct? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that decision was made by the officials that is 
yourself and the department.  The people who were meant to 
20 
implement? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja Chair that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  What is true is that we – from all the 
presentations that we have made on project to the Executive Council 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 31 of 115 
 
for this commission only that one was singled out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  But it is not the only projects that we 
go to the Executive Council. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  And request approval. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I understand that for this specific 
reason we are responding but my understanding is that it should not 
look like when we went to the Executive Council we only went to 
10 
present one project which was the Vrede Dairy no it was not there were 
others which we had done so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well even if you had gone there for one I mean in 
principle why should that be wrong you know. So I do not think that is 
Ms Gcabashe’s concern. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  Mr Thabethe I 
would just like to move on because there are a couple of other things 
that I want to place on record in relation to what Mr Zwane has to say.  
20 
So he says that after the presentation to the legislature the project was 
handed over to the department and he did not interfere with the duties 
of the administrators whose responsibility it was to implement the 
Mohoma Mobung Project.  Would you agree with that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 32 of 115 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  What he did however do was by way of 
example assist in the identification of beneficiaries? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja Chair after the projects is 
approved for implementation we do the implementation.  Our 
responsibility is to report back to him on progress.  That is what we 
then do.  If for an example we have difficulty like in the issue of 
identifying beneficiaries we would go to him and say, this is the issue 
that we may need you to assist us to do where – as part of our report 
back to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I just note the reference to interference that he 
10 
says he did not interfere.  And I note what you have just said.  I do not 
know what he regards as interference and what he does not regard as 
interference.  But from what you say it is clear that – and one would 
expect this to be the case that you would report back to him on 
implementation. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To see how is the implementation process and I take 
it that as you report back to him on progress he would have – he would 
raise questions where he thinks there should be questions and maybe 
he would even make suggestions.  Is that not so? 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair that is correct because he 
needs to have a full understanding so that when he goes to the 
legislature and questions are raised he should be able to respond to 
those questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it may well be but you might not agree with this.  
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 33 of 115 
 
It may well be that he would also issue instructions on implementation. 
MR 
MBANA 
PETER 
THABETHE: 
 
Chair 
my 
understanding 
of 
interference is – my understanding is that of the PFMA.  When he gives 
you instructions to implement things that are not in line with policy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  It might not – the issue might not arise so we – 
if it arises we can go back to it. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  So the example I 
had given was in identifying beneficiaries he assisted in that regard? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Did he assist with respect to the selection 
10 
of a strategic partner? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair no, no.  The – I think we have – 
we had gone though that also how the strategic partner was selected.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but the – how the strategic partner was selected 
is one thing the question whether he had an input on the selection 
might be another.  So the question is whether he assisted in this 
selection of the strategic partner? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Chair I would not know because 
the strategic partner was not selected by us.  If I am referring to 
Estina. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It was selected by Paras.  So I would 
not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Hm.  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Just for the record my understanding of 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 34 of 115 
 
your evidence is that the strategic partner was Paras? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And Paras then selected Estina.  But the 
strategic partner was Paras. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you.  Now Mr Zwane goes on to say 
that he was not required to approve the appointment of Estina as the 
implementing agent.  Is that correct?  And please this is important.  He 
was not required to approve the appointment of Estina as the 
implementing agent.   
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja I am – it is a very tricky question 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I can understand. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe let me ask from – let me ask a related 
question.  As a matter of fact do you know whether he approved the 
selection of Paras as a strategic partner irrespective of whether it was 
his – he was required or not.  Do you know whether as a matter of fact 
he did give approval? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair as part of the Executive 
20 
Council. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  He has. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Because that agreement and 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 35 of 115 
 
approval. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Was done by the Executive Council 
and he was in the Executive Council. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  So he was part of that approval. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  By the Executive Council. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I - I think you - you would have picked up 
Ms Gcabashe that for me what I was not sure about the required part 
10 
was - was whether it meant he was required by law or not.  So the - 
that is the part that was in my mind that is why I put that question. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chair.  Brought clarity - your 
question did bring clarity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The - the next portion then is in respect of 
the payment of funds to any creditor or recipient.  Now again he was 
not required - and this is the language you used if I - my recollection 
serves me well.  To approve the payment of any funds to any creditor or 
recipient that is an administrative function. 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair it - that - that becomes the 
responsibility of the administrators. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  To … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so do you accept his version that he was not 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 36 of 115 
 
required to approve any funding? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No.  You see there are two things 
Chair.  When - when he goes to the legislature he request the 
legislature to approve the budget … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Of the department which includes the 
Vrede Project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Once that approval is given to him … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  In - in implementing that project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That automatically gets translated to 
the administrators to implement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  So it does not play a role anymore in 
terms of approval once he gets the approval at the legislature in terms 
of the budget allocation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But also that means that when he goes to the 
legislature he is the one who is saying please approve this budget … 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which has got these components? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Therefore and - and he cannot say to the legislature 
approve this unless he is happy with it.  He is himself approving of it. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 37 of 115 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So - but - but the point you are making is 
approval within that context he gets involved? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But not outside of that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Out - outside.  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Then his view is that: 
“The Mohuma Mobung Project was a great idea and 
a flagship project that would have put the Free 
10 
State Province on the map had it been executed 
properly.” 
Great project.  It would have put the Free State Province on 
the map had it been executed properly.  That is his view.  Do you share 
that view? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The implication … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  May … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Can we check something Chair? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  If - if it had been properly executed … 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Ja 
and 
properly 
executed 
means 
properly 
implemented? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 38 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  If - if it was given an opportunity to 
be executed that - that will be my version to that statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you - you seek to qualify your answer? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To say you say if it was - if it had been given a proper 
opportunity to be executed? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is your position that it was not executed or it was 
executed but was not given enough time? 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I am not sure which of the two - Chairman 
I thought you put two … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Different propositions to - to Mr Thabethe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I did.  I think - I think he agreed to both but let us 
- let us help because it could cause confusion. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As I understand it what - what you are - what you are 
20 
saying you are - you admit that it was executed but you are saying it 
was not given a proper opportunity to be executed? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  To be executed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which seems to suggest to me that more time - you 
are saying more time should have been given to it. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 39 of 115 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No, no.  Chair - Chair what - what I 
am trying to say is that because when - when the project was being 
implemented a problem started from the initiation when - when it was 
started then problems came.  So it never had an opportunity to be 
implemented properly. 
My understanding is that he is referring to that.  He - he - 
because the other version could have been if - if the official could have 
implemented it properly which is not my understanding because if - if 
that was the case then it is a different story. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you see he - he might not be particular with how 
10 
he is formulating it but the one option - the one proposition could be 
the officials who were supposed to implement it failed to implement it 
properly.  That is why we have … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We have this problem. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Another proposition would be to say the opportunity 
to - to implement it was not a proper opportunity.  So some execution 
was tried but it did not work well because there was not a proper or 
enough opportunity but from what you are saying it seems you are 
20 
saying it was not given an opportunity from the beginning.  Is that 
right? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair I am - I am agreeing with your 
second option. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 40 of 115 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is why I was trying then to 
correct … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  To - to amend … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The statement to say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It is not because of the failure of the 
officials … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  But it was because of the opportunity 
that was not granted for the project to be implemented. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Maybe you can just clarify what you mean 
by the project was not given the opportunity to develop in the manner 
in which you had envisaged it would.  Maybe that is the only area 
where I - I do not understand you.  What opportunity? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair, we - we had intended to deal 
with this earlier on.  That when we were starting the project the - the - 
there were so many articles in the media.  You will remember it was - 
20 
we were beginning to implement the project when there was the 
Waterkloof … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The landing? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The landing … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 41 of 115 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  And it was that time that everything 
came to a halt. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why did anything have to come to a halt about Vrede 
because of the landing - Waterkloof landing? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Exactly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Because that - that was the time 
when the first article about Vrede Dairy came to be and - and you will 
remember the - the testimony of the first witness that came in here 
referred to - to that and all the investigations that came thereafter was 
10 
based on that newspaper article which was on Mail & Guardian. 
So from that time there was never an opportunity to 
implement because it was investigation after investigation.  So it never 
had that opportunity to - to have the time to implement it. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Mr Thabethe I want to challenge that 
thinking but I will do so tomorrow on the basis of the monies that were 
advanced to make sure that this dairy project got off the ground but it 
is a specific issue because we look at how much money was put in.  We 
look at the quarterly reports that were present - presented to the 
officials and then make an assessment.  I think … 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  On where things went horribly wrong. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I think if we generalise now and look at 
the period 13 June 2010 to roughly 30 April 2013 which is the time of 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 42 of 115 
 
the Waterkloof landing. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You had about a year.  I do not want us to 
generalise about what could have been done in that - in that period.  
We will look at the numbers and the allocations and use those to 
determine what could have been done. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  If - if that suits you. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Chair - Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  What - what I am trying to - to explain 
is that this was a three year project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It stalled in the first year … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Of - of its implementation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hence the statement that if it was 
given the opportunity … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  To - to be implemented it would have 
been one of the greatest projects. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Ms Gcabashe said you - she will deal with this 
tomorrow … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Good. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 43 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I wanted to ask you why do you say the fact that 
somebody wrote an article in the newspaper about Waterkloof landing 
or and/or about Vrede - Vrede Farm that takes away from you the 
opportunity to do your job? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  They did not come physically - to physically prevent 
you from doing your work about Vrede. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  That - that is - that is correct 
Chair but that triggered a lot of problems.  I think if - if when we come 
to it then I will explain.  One - one of the issues - one of the basis 
10 
when - when that happened National Treasury … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The writing of an article in the newspaper? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The - the investigation that was done 
by National Treasury was on the basis of the newspaper article and 
they mentioned that in their report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and so what? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  And then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  They - they can investigate.  You carry on with your 
20 
job.  If they say we want to have two hours with you tomorrow to ask 
you about this.  You say okay I will make time.  You see them for two 
hours.  They want to see somebody else.  You say the staff is available.  
You can talk to them.  After you are had done you continue.  You - you 
do your job. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 44 of 115 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That - that is correct Chair but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So how does it - how does it take away from you the 
opportunity to implement which you otherwise had before somebody 
wrote in the article? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Wrote an article. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair National Treasury wrote a letter 
to hold the project.  The letter was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  We - we received a letter from the 
10 
National Department from Agriculture … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Saying we - they - we should not be 
allowed to proceed implementing the project with the money that was 
allocated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That - that can I understand.  When did that happen? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It - it was - Chair during - it was not 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well we - Ms Gcabashe just reminded you that the 
Waterkloof landing was in April 2013.  So - so … 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes and - and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So when was this? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Until that time Chair everything was 
progressing well. 
CHAIRPERSON: Yes. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 45 of 115 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  In terms of implementation.  In terms 
of the infrastructure that was on the ground. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So you had had a year? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  More or less. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That - that happened very well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Now after the landing … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  We - we were then beginning to enter 
10 
into the - the second year … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  And - and that is where the problem 
started. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but when did the letter from National Treasury or 
did you say National Department of Agriculture? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  National Department of Agriculture. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  If - if I am not mistaken Chair it was 
June/July. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  June July 2013? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is in August.  It is an August letter.  It is 
an August letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is August.  August 2013? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We have a witness who will be dealing 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 46 of 115 
 
with that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Next week Tuesday Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  From the department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So August 2013? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  August 2013 was the final 
withdrawal.  They … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  They write you … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Before with an intention to withdraw 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  But already the letter from National 
Treasury instruct Agriculture … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Not to allow us to proceed had 
20 
already been written. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, but what you - what you do say is so is the 
position therefore that you are saying that what took away the 
opportunity to implement the project was the instruction to stop … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 47 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Using the fund?  Not the newspaper article.  The 
newspaper article brought the issue to the attention of the world. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The attention - okay.  That is correct 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it is not - it is - it is something else.  Not that 
one. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Not, not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And just for further clarity Chairman.  The 
amount that had been allocated by the National Office that is the CUSP.  
We have talked about the CUSP Grant … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And - and we have a witness who will deal 
with it in detail on Tuesday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That was 53 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Of the 53 million you know Mr Thabethe 
20 
you had already spent 24 million … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And what the National Office said was the 
balance should be allocated to one of the other projects. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 48 of 115 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Take it away from this one … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And they gave you specific reasons why 
they were asking you to do that and you know that. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is - that is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We are going to get to that letter 
Chairman because the reasons had to do with whether they met the - 
the Department of Agriculture and Rural Department met the conditions 
that were attached to that 53 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In respect of what they were doing at 
Vrede. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So it actually has nothing to do the 
Waterkloof landing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I agree with you Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Please Mr Thabethe.  It has nothing to do 
with the newspaper article.  Please Mr Thabethe. 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja Chair - Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Can I - can I go back to that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE: 
 Remember 
the investigation by 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 49 of 115 
 
National Treasury is quoting that newspaper article.  Hence I am 
referring to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but just because they are quoting that article 
does not mean it is because of that article that you were not given an 
opportunity to - to implement you know.  The article brought up what it 
brought up.  If you say we were instructed to stop at a time when we 
were still implementing and had we been given a chance to continue. 
You would have seen what would have happened.  You would 
have come up with something very beautiful that is something else. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Now my understanding again is that it is 
the department that identified the possibility of establishing a 
processing plant.  Now this is the milk processing plant in the province.  
It is part of the Mohuma Mobung thinking.  Am I correct? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And your version is that Mr Zwane would 
have been part of this at that strategic policy level - part of that 
20 
discussion? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And the identification of the Vrede Dairy 
Project as a mega project again Mr Zwane would have been part of in 
terms of the strategic decision.  Is this your version? 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 50 of 115 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  Chair the - the decision to add 
value comes even beyond the Free State.  It comes from the NDP 
document itself.  The National Development Plan to say provinces like 
the Free State are doing well in primary agriculture but we are not 
doing much in terms of agroprocessing and value adding. 
Hence that strategic decision flows through like that.  That - 
That is what is also agreed in the Free State Growth and Development 
Plan to say agriculture must begin also to do agroprocessing and add 
value to the products.  Hence when we then presented that idea it was 
acceptable that this is what we - we are supposed to do.  Therefore I 
10 
agree Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Then at paragraph 42 of your 2018 
affidavit you state that the agreements relating to the Vrede Dairy 
Project were approved by the Executive Council and Mr Zwane who 
then was the MEC for Agriculture.  That is your evidence. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is - that is … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Correct? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And this is actually what you say … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In your affidavit? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Then in your 2019 affidavit which you 
have made for the Commission at paragraph 37.5 page 13 you state 
that you did not perform any function or take a decision in respect of 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 51 of 115 
 
the implementation and execution of the Vrede Dairy Project without 
having followed the prescribed departmental processes, number one. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Or without having first obtained the 
required approvals and authority from the MEC Agriculture and Exco.  
That is correct? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That is what you say in your statement. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Now I take it that when you speak about 
10 
the approvals and the authority of the MEC for Agriculture you would 
there be referring to Mr Zwane … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And then when she did take over you 
would there be referring to Ms Qabathe? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I will just leave it at those two because 
they really were there during the period we have been debating.  So 
that says to me that you did one of two things.  You either asked them 
for guidance as you were implementing or you asked for instructions as 
20 
you were implementing.  Which of the two was it? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair when - when we sought 
approval of the Executive Council it is the MEC that goes to the 
Executive Council because the MEC is a member of the Executive 
Council.  So we - we generate the - the submission to the MEC.  If the 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 52 of 115 
 
MEC agrees then he goes and he presents it to the Executive Council 
for approval. 
Hence I am saying if he would not have agreed he would not 
have gone to present it to the Executive Council.  Hence I am saying 
the way we - we putting it there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but the question is whether you asked for 
guidance or asked - Ms Gcabashe says for an instruction but I guess it 
could also be said approval but she said instruction.  So what did you 
seek from them?  Was it guidance or an instruction? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It - it is guidance Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You also state in your 2018 affidavit at 
paragraph 51.8 that: 
“Mr Zwane recommended to the Provincial Treasury 
the release of the required funding because it was 
necessary to shift funds between projects as 
provided for in the 2012/2013 budget of the 
department.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms Gcabashe. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes sir. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please do not forget that question.  I just want to ask 
something on the paragraph that you just read to Mr Thabethe a few 
minutes ago.  You see Mr Thabethe you have just said that when you 
asked what you sought from the MEC and Exco was guidance but that 
is not what paragraph 37.5 says which is the paragraph that 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 53 of 115 
 
Ms Gcabashe just read.  It says: 
“I did not perform any function and did not take any 
decision …” 
Listen to this: 
“…in respect of implementation and execution of 
the Vrede Dairy Project.  Without …” 
I leave out other things. 
“…having first obtained the required approvals and 
authority from the MEC Agriculture and Exco.” 
Is there something I am missing there when I compare with 
10 
what you have just said?  Maybe I am missing something.  Maybe the 
two can be reconciled. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Chair - Chair she gave two 
options and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Instruction or guidance, yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Guidance … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you said guidance. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  And I understood you putting the third 
one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but I - you did not … 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I wanted to focus on what she put to you.  The 
instruction and guidance … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you said guidance. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 54 of 115 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It is - it is more of guidance because 
what we request from him is approval … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Because the MEC’s responsibility is 
oversight … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  When we are doing implementation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That - that is the responsibility of the 
- of the MEC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  So the - the - my statement is 
actually saying I would not decide to implement a project … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Until such time that the MEC and the 
Executive Council agrees with the project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is what my statement is actually 
20 
saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well that - that may be right but that might not - 
that is not the same as guidance.  You remember you just said a few 
minutes ago … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 55 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would be seeking guidance. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you seek guidance you are not seeking necessarily 
approval.  You - you - guidance you can disregard if you have good 
reasons.  You know but if you seek approval if you do not have 
approval you cannot proceed.  Is it not? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That - that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But guidance is not the same as approval.  Guidance 
is I think this is how you should handle it but you are not bound.  You 
can - you can reflect on it. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the end you might decide no, no.  That is going to 
be problematic and the person who gives the guidance understands that 
it is guidance.  It is not an instruction.  That is my understanding of the 
two. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you have the same understanding? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I - I did Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  If - if approval would have been one 
20 
of the options … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Then it would be the correct one.  I - I 
know Chair we have - I have been in trouble with the evidence leader of 
not answering the question. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 56 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja.  So you - so you say if - if the options you 
were given included approval you would have chosen approval? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Approval.  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not guidance? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Not guidance, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Because - because guidance must be 
in my understanding could be overarching over - also approval but the - 
the most correct one is approval. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course what you could have said is none of the 
10 
above.  It is approval.  You could have said that.  Is it not? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair.  I have - I have trouble 
before with the evidence leader of not answering. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I - I can see that you are more scary of being in 
trouble with - with Counsel than with me.  So - so you - you are saying 
therefore now when you approach them you were seeking approval? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Approval.  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not - not guidance? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And - and we are still talking about the 
implementation of a resolution taken by Exco.  Am I correct? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I just want to - I do not want to get things 
mixed up. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 57 of 115 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is - that is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That is what we are talking about? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes, but - but Chair that - that 
statement in affidavit refers to approval before the implementation.  It 
is not referring to approval after the implementation because you have 
received their approval.  You do not ask for another approval. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So just by way of example that resolution 
of 13 June 2012 if there was anything you did not understand that was 
in that resolution you would again go back to the MEC and say can you 
10 
explain what you meant by Clause 3? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  This is what we are talking about. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is important to differentiate that 
between administrative decisions such as the deviation decision that 
you took Mr Thabethe … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Because as I understand matters on the 
deviation decision that you took that was your decision? 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is - that is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Okay.  I just wanted that clarity so that we 
do not get things mixed up.  Excellent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you remember earlier on I said I did not know 
what Mr Zwane has in mind in talking about and using the word 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 58 of 115 
 
interfere.  I did not interfere and in how you responded but I - I gained 
the impression from what Ms Gcabashe read as part of his version that 
he was saying his role was limited to policy. 
 
Once it was implementation he would not get involved, but this 
paragraph suggests to me that he was as fully involved in the 
implementation 
at 
last in the 
taking of 
decisions 
relating 
to 
implementation, as you were, if it is true, because you say I did not 
perform any function and did not take any decision in respect of the 
implementation and execution of the Vrede Dairy Project without the 
approval of the MEC and Exco?

MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes Chair that’s  why I was then 
qualifying that statement, that that statement refers to me implementing 
any projects without approval of the Executive Council, that is my – 
how I put it, it was not referring to decisions during the implementation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no Mr Thabethe, in this paragraph, do you 
have the paragraph in front of you? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Sir it is in your statement, it is EXHIBIT 
HH10 Volume A, you will find it at page 13. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is your affidavit before this Commission which 
you deposed to in August 2019, page 13 paragraph 37.5. 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can you – have you found it? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   I have it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, you see it doesn’t talk about many projects, it 
talks about decisions in respect of the implementation and execution of 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 59 of 115 
 
the Vrede Dairy Project, so as the implementation happens decisions 
have to be taken and what it says is that you did not take any decisions 
in relation to the implementation of this project without – that is how at 
least I read it, I may be mistaken without their approval.   It may be 
that it may be that it shouldn’t be read literally because then maybe it 
will be very difficult to do anything if you had to go back to them all the 
time, but that’s what I read the paragraph to mean and when I read it 
and I bear in mind what you just said and what he said about the 
officials being involved in implementation and he being involved in the 
policy only I seem to find – I don’t find much harmony, but maybe that I 
10 
am missing something, do you understand where I come from? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   I, I, I hear you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   My understanding when I put – it 
might not have been put maybe exactly the way I would have wanted it 
to be, but my explanation in this is saying what I am explaining, it is 
not meaning that during the implementation I had to call and ask for 
decision, no it is not saying that Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well that’s fine I will leave it to Ms Gcabashe to make 
of it what she may either now or later.  Yes? 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman what I will say is that the 
context being the prescribed departmental processes and the approvals 
and authorities that lie with those executive officials I understood this 
to mean that where that was required you would go and get those 
approvals but where it wasn’t required, if it was something that was 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 60 of 115 
 
within your remit you would just go ahead and do what you needed to 
do, this is how I understood it. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  
Well 
what kind of approvals 
in relation 
to 
implementation decisions would be required of the political head, the 
MEC or Exco for this kind of, for the implementation of this project, 
after the Exco had given the approval that we have always been talking 
about. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair this paragraph is referring to 
that initial approval of having agreed that these projects can be 
10 
budgeted for and that the project can be implemented so that’s what 
this paragraph is referring to, you will not be able to implement without 
obtaining the required approval, so the required approval is the 
executive council approval to do the project and also to have the 
budget allocated to the project, so you cannot do the implementation 
without having obtained those required approvals. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it refers to – you are referring to the approval that 
had already been given, that was given first before the project came to 
you for implementation? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I think let’s continue, I think I will have further 
questions about that, but let’s continue and look at it overnight, it may 
be that it may be that it does not necessarily reflect what you intended, 
but to me it doesn’t seem to say what you say, what you’re saying it 
says you know, but let me look at the whole affidavit overnight and then 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 61 of 115 
 
if need be we can talk about it tomorrow. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   But that is my intention 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is your intention ja, whether or not it reflects it 
correctly is another matter. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman with your leave I just want to 
10 
again give context to what I understood that paragraph to mean and 
what Mr Thabethe’s evidence is, which is that Exco resolution and I will 
just very quickly say what Exco approved was one, the implementation 
of the proposed Vrede Dairy Agri-business project.  So in relation to 
that he would have to have a relationship with the MEC.  Exco 
approved the sourcing of additional funding of R84million and in again 
in relation to that there would be discussions about where that would 
come from because it was not budgeted for.    
 
Am I correct? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is correct. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The next one that Exco agreed on was the 
Department should meet the costs and will later be refunded and 
engage other relevant departments.  Again that is what you would be 
talking to the MEC about, but if it’s a resolution that had been taken. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 62 of 115 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And so you would consult him on that. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Then the matter would be further 
discussed in the Treasury Committee which is part of my next question 
because 
again 
the 
Provincial 
Treasury 
was 
important 
to 
the 
implementation, that’s again an approval by Exco, correct? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Then the FDC, the Free State State 
Development Corporation, should also play a role, especially from the 
business point of view. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You  were again discouraged to engage in 
discussions with them. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And then the last item is that for the next 
three years the Department of Agriculture will have to pay R130 – it 
should be million it’s written as a thousand here, R113million. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In respect of this project. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So that is what I understood to be the 
context of following prescribed procedures, consulting as and when you 
needed to, just in relation to what they had approved. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I just wanted to give you this document as 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 63 of 115 
 
well Chairman to read at your leisure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The resolution? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Which is the resolution it is in your file 
Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, what page in my file? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is reference file A Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, ...[intervenes]  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is a poor copy, I know we have a better 
one elsewhere. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, what page? 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is page 323 Chairman and at a later 
stage we will tell you where you can find a better – it is legible, but 
there is a better copy we believe in the court record file.  But it is very 
clear that these are the items they had approved. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And I understood ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I think what will be important is also to just read 
some of the paragraphs in the affidavit surround before and after that 
paragraph, to see whether it fits in with what Mr Thabethe says. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Absolutely Chairman.  I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  But on the face of it it does seem to be problematic to 
me but I must just check, it may be that once I have checked my 
problem will go away. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 64 of 115 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I should also remember Chairman that 
much as we have had studied the documents you have read them but 
not studied them the way we have had to, because you are faced with 
so many matters in one week. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja, ja, that’s fine ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I will take that into account Chair.    
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And so – Chairman my colleague says 
page `175 of the same bundle has a better copy of that document, just 
a slightly more legible. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  The same being? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The, the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  The reference bundle? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The reference bundle A. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Reference Bundle A. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What’s the page. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is just a little more legible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What’s the page? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  175. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  175.  And that is where everything really starts in a 
sense. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I have got it.  Yes? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  And this is why in 
the same context and again correct even me if I am wrong in my 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 65 of 115 
 
understanding, you state at paragraph 51.8 of the 2018 affidavit that Mr 
Zwane recommended to the Provincial Treasury the release of the 
required funding because it was necessary to shift funds between 
projects. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  As provided for in the 2012/2013 budget 
of the Department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry you’re reading from where now? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman so if we go to the 2018 affidavit 
of Mr Thabethe ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And where ...[intervenes]  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  At paragraph 51.8 Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In which bundle is it again? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is again the very same – my apologies 
Chair.  If you go to page 114 Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of which Bundle? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Of Bundle 8, Mr Thabethe’s statements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  118? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  114 Chairman, so that is the 2018 
affidavit, so we start with the 2019 affidavit then we have the 2018 
20 
affidavit, the last affidavit is the 2017 affidavit.  We are currently 
looking at the 2018 affidavit and the particular paragraph is on page 
114 of Bundle A, of HH10. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, I have got it. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  Again you can 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 66 of 115 
 
refer, and Chairman you know that you have got a better copy right at 
the end because the one, but it is also called page one, right at the end 
we put in a better copy, a more legible copy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, but this one looks legible. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Oh if you are happy with it Chairman that 
is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If this one is legible maybe the one that was 
supposed to be put in later was put in here.  This quite a ...[intervenes]  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Legible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, yes I have got 114. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So we are looking at paragraph 51.8 
Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And if I might read it into the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then I haven’t got I am not on the same page as you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  MPT114. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This page 114 I have is of – refers Bundles H. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No Chairman HH10, HH10 Volume A, you 
were reading the other paragraph from the FE from the same file 
Chairman.  So it’s HH10 Volume A, page 114. 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   If I may assist the Chair, the number 
has been ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I have just found it. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   They have been duplicated towards 
the end the clearer you will see the number repeats again from 099. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 67 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, I found 114 which is has got paragraph 50 
something. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That must be the correct one. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Is that a clear copy that you have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is a clear copy as well. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay, yes, thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman just for context what Mr 
Thabethe was dealing with here was he was explaining how if you look 
10 
at the earlier pages very quickly he was explaining how the 
implementation of this particular dairy project took place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Happened okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes, so at 51.7 he speaks of the 
implementation and the funding structure as explained in the proposals, 
and he refers to that Exco resolution of the 13 t h of June.  Then at 51.8 
he says for purposes of the release of the required funding it was 
necessary to shift funds between projects, as provided for in the 
2012/2013 budget of the Department, which transfer was approved by 
the Free State Provincial Treasury on the 20 t h of June 2010.  The  
20 
request which was made to the Provincial Treasury in this regard was 
not only recommended by me, but by the MEC for Agriculture, and then 
he says there is an approval. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So my question in relation to this Mr 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 68 of 115 
 
Thabethe is I have understood that you had to try and accommodate the 
finding of funding. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Of funding yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes, so my question is what role therefore 
did the MEC play in assisting you in either giving approval for the 
shifting of funds or giving guidance on where else you could find funds. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair the assistance of the MEC – 
our responsibility will be to find where the funds will be allocated, once 
we have found the money then we make a submission that the MEC 
approves because the budget is gazetted, he must then approve so that 
10 
we submit to Treasury for the shifting of those funds, because we are 
changing the gazette, and that approval was then recommended by him 
because in that instance the approval must come from Treasury,  he 
must recommend to Treasury.  That is what I am trying to say here that 
he also recommended for the approval that we then shift those funds, 
and that line item comes from the Exco resolution that we were 
required then to find those funds. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But again the fine distinction there is that 
that wasn’t the day to day implementation of the project, you were still 
20 
at a more strategic level making sure you had funding for the project. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Again I have told you the context in which 
I am interrogating issues is I am trying to understand implementation by 
the Executive and by the administration, I am still doing that.  Can I 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 69 of 115 
 
move on to the identification of land for the dairy project Mr Thabethe?  
Mr Zwane’s version is that he was not directly involved in the 
identification of land for the dairy project, he was aware that there was 
land available but that’s about it, your evidence however before  the 
Commission was that it was Mr Zwane who told you about the 
availability of land and said that you should talk to the Phumelele 
Municipality about what could be made available, so there is a bit of a 
difference there, which I think it would be useful for you to clear up.  
He says he was not directly involved, and you say in fact he is the one 
who told you where you could go and talk to people about land. 
10 
 
If you can clear it up, if not we will put the question to Mr 
Zwane. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Ja, thanks Chair, I think it’s a matter 
of semantics, because we were looking for land and then he advised us 
that talk to the municipality, I am aware they have land.  Whether we 
would call that identification or not I am not sure but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but that’s what happened. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s what  happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   And when we engaged the 
20 
municipality there was an indication that yes indeed we do have the 
land and then we started those negotiations. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So your evidence remains the same? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you.   Mr Zwane in his affidavit 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 70 of 115 
 
then deals with the travel to India which he had to approve and 
recommend to the Premier to approve. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Do you remember that memo? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Now he seemed to be under the 
impression that you were going to India with other Government 
officials, where would he have gotten this impression?   My 
understanding of his affidavit is Mr Narijan is one person and he 
speaks about Narijan going with you, in fact he says he recommended 
10 
Narijan. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But over and above that he seems to have 
been under the impression that you were going with other government 
officials.  Had that been the original plan? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair I am speaking under correction 
here, he might have confused other trips with this one, that could be 
very easy because there were other trips where I went with government 
officials, so ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  To Indian? 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   To Indian yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So your short answer is you did not 
indicate to him that you would be going with other government officials?  
You did not say that to him? 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 71 of 115 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair the submission that goes to the 
Executive Council for the approval would not go there without going 
through him, he  must sign it before it goes for approval. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that stated exactly who you would go with? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So would it the be correct to say that he could not 
have thought that you were going with anybody other than whoever was 
written in the documentation that he approved?  After approving that 
documentation he could not have thought you were going with anybody 
who had not been approved? 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   He would not have missed it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but why are you running away from the way I am 
putting it. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   (laughing) 
CHAIRPERSON:  He – you being the HOD of his department you, 
everybody within the department who needed to go overseas would 
have needed his approval? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Therefore once he had approved what you gave him 
reflecting who you would be going with he could not have thought there 
20 
was somebody else from within the department that you would be going 
with, other than those he had approved? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Ja, except the fact that he 
recommends also Chair, he does not approve, he recommends. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but what I am saying is nobody would be 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 72 of 115 
 
approved by Exco or by the Premier that had not gone through him? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he may or may not be mistaken but as far as the 
point after he had approved there was clarity as to who was going. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Was going, that’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And there were no other officials, other than the 
people mentioned in the documentation that he was happy with? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can I just explore one element of your 
10 
discussion with the Chairman, are you saying that even in respect of 
junior officials, no you are the most senior public servant, so of course 
the MEC must approve your travel, you can’t approve your own travel, 
but if you were going with a Director or with a Chief Director would 
would the MEC also have to approve those people travelling with you or 
would you as the head of department approve the Chief Director or 
Director travelling? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair in line with the cost 
containment mergers a decision was taken that all overseas travel must 
be approved by the Premier, irrespective of a level that was the 
20 
decision Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they could only be taken to the Premier by the 
relevant MEC. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   By the relevant MEC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hmm, so no matter how junior an official in your 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 73 of 115 
 
department was if he was going to go to India with you the MEC would 
have seen that name. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Mr Thabethe then for some reason again 
Mr Zwane seems to have been under the impression that you were 
meeting other government officials in India, are you able to throw any 
light on that aspect? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair I can’t because my 
understanding was that the approval was on the basis of a submission 
10 
that he recommended to the Premier for approval, hence I was saying 
in the beginning maybe he might have mistaken this trip with other trip 
but it shouldn’t be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say that the approval of the trip included, 
entailed that he would have, the documentation, the submission would 
have told him what the purpose of the trip was. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And who the people were that you were planning to 
meet in India. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he wouldn’t have had to guess who you would 
have to meet. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is anyone that was important for the trip? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 74 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if there were government officials they would 
have stated in their submission. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if they were not stated in the submission it 
means they were not part of the plan. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You see because when he suggested that 
Mr Narajan accompany you, as I have understood his version it was 
because one he thought that without a protocol person, remember you 
10 
had explained the whole protocol issue to us last time. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Now Mr Zwane thought that without a 
protocol person you would not get the best outcome from the meeting 
you would be attending, that is the one reason? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The second reason was he says that they 
did not want to be disappointed or disappoint the foreign government 
officials.  I am not sure I understand that clearly, I thought you might 
be able to explain this, that he did not want you to be disappointed or 
20 
the people you were meeting to be disappointed hence the selection of 
Mr Narajan to accompany you.  Is this what you understood? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair I cannot comment on how he 
understood it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well what – well you can comment to a certain extent 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 75 of 115 
 
if for his impression of who you – he says he thought you were going to 
meet, he advances a certain reason to support that, you may be able to 
say no but that doesn’t make sense because of A, B, C, it couldn’t have 
– that couldn’t have been true, so I am just saying as I understand he 
seems to say something that seems to explain why he may have had a 
certain impression in terms of who you were going to meet. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   I hear you Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  You may or may not be able to I am just – I am just 
saying it is not true necessarily that you might not be – ever be able to 
comment.  It depends on what you are being told.  You might evaluate it 
10 
and say no what is – what he is saying in support of his impression 
really is not justified by what I know he knew. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair that is where I have a difficulty. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Because I – I – when he was given 
the presentation and requested to recommend for approval I do not 
know what was his understanding at that time.  Because if I say he 
knew I must be very certain that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you must – you can – you may be able to say as 
far as you know he must have known ABCD because he was given 
20 
certain documents.  He must have read them because he approved 
what was written there. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair that is what I was saying.  
Because it was in the document and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but that is how you must articulate.  That is – Ms 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176

Gcabashe I do not know if you want to repeat your question so he can 
then answer it. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  The question really was that Mr Zwane 
seemed to be under the impression that if he did not send a chaperone 
with you I am calling the person accompanying as somebody who would 
be assisting you in that – in that context.  You would be disappointed 
and the government officials you were meeting would be disappointed. 
So he thought it prudent to send a protocol person to be of assistance 
to you. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja Chair the… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if you do not understand what he is saying you 
are free to say you do not understand what he is saying. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja the difficulty I have and because 
the evidence leader says he was under the impression.  You see I have 
not seen the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but take what the evidence leader is saying as 
true. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Is saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you are free to say if that is what he is saying this 
is my answer. 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja I do not understand Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not understand this thing of … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is why… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of disappointment. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It will be a problem for me to answer 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 77 of 115 
 
when I do not understand the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know any reason why the absence of protocol 
officer on the trip would have disappointed you? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Now I am confused. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no what was important about a protocol officer in 
your trip?  What was important?  If it was the presence of a protocol 
officer was not important I do not see why you would be disappointed if 
there was no protocol officer.  But if you know of a particular reason 
maybe you are able to tell me.  Ms Gcabashe it was a protocol officer 
that he is talking about in relation to disappointment? 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  In – yes and Narayan in particular. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Narayan. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Was the protocol officer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Who Mr Zwane actually recommended. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So I ask you the question Mr Thabethe.  Was – 
would you have been disappointed if Mr – if a protocol officer or Mr 
Narayan was not there? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja – Chair it is a very difficult 
question because I am… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  It cannot be a difficult question. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I am a technical person.  The people 
that are worried about protocol is at the political level and at the 
Premier office that is why they told us they insist. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but we are not talking about those people we are 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 78 of 115 
 
talking about you.  My question is whether you Mr Thabethe would have 
been disappointed if there was no protocol officer in the trip. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I would be disappointed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because he says you would have been disappointed. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I would have been – I will be 
disappointed Chair if there would be an expectation in terms of the 
protocol to do and there was not anybody to advise me to do it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But knowing what you know about the trip would you 
have been disappointed if there was no protocol officer? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair my understanding is that the 
10 
disappointment comes when you do something not knowing you should 
have done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No Mr Thabethe. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Then you get the disappointment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you are going on a trip you know if you need 
certain people and without those people it is going – there are going to 
be challenges – serious challenges. You would be disappointed if your 
PA is not allowed to go with you.  Or your deputy is not allowed to go 
with you because you know you are going to rely on your deputy on the 
issues that would be discussed in India for example.  Did you need a 
20 
protocol officer as far as you are concerned for the trip? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair… 
CHAIRPERSON:  As far as you are concerned do not bother about what 
anyone else might have thought.  Did you need a protocol officer? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair if I go to a foreign country as a 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 79 of 115 
 
government representative where I do not understand the protocol I 
would need a protocol. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you need a protocol officer on your trip to India? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It was necessary Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was necessary? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Because it – I was going to a country 
that I do not understand its protocols. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were you going to meet government officials in India? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No it – not necessarily meeting 
government officials Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I am talking about the trip. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No, no Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were they in the plans?   They were not in the plans? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No they were not Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So why would you need a protocol officer if you are 
not going to meet government officials in India? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  My understanding is that protocol 
does not only apply in government.  I am not trying to defend Chair the 
need.  I am saying it – to me it did not come as an embarrassment to 
me. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  To what? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  To have not to have. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Okay 
maybe 
embarrassment 
is 
close 
to 
disappointment.   Let us go back to my question.  Would you have been 
disappointed if the protocol officer – there was no protocol officer on 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 80 of 115 
 
the trip? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair I would not have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would not have? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Until such time that something would 
have happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but if you are told there would be no protocol 
officer on the trip before you depart for India you would not be have 
been disappointed? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No I would not Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  In fact I seem to think and you must tell me if I 
10 
am wrong.  I seem to think that previously you did testify that you did 
not see any need for a protocol officer.  Am I – is my recollection 
wrong? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No Chair the only – what I said I 
appreciated the presence of the person to assist with the interpretation.  
That is where my appreciation came into this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You needed an interpreter? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I needed somebody to assist me with 
the interpretation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  And… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not necessarily a protocol officer? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Most of the time the protocol officer 
that is allocated to you would be somebody who understand the 
language, who understand – and so there is a number of people they 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 81 of 115 
 
get selected. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Based on which country are you 
going. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but what you are saying means to me – suggest 
to me all you need is somebody who can interpret for you? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Do the interpretation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What else he does that is something else but you 
need somebody who can interpret for you? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  In fact what Mr Zwane in his affidavit refers to 
is the foreign culture, the foreign language, somebody to assist in – in 
helping you communicate effectively?  I am just giving you the 
highlights. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Of why he thought a protocol officer would 
assist.  But my – my next question though is that you had been to India 
before in 2010.  I know that is on your CV. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  In fact when you had gone to India in 2010 
you had gone to do an assessment and this is from your CV. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  On a request for accreditation of an 
establishment for the export to South Africa of deboned and deglanded 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 82 of 115 
 
frozen buffalo meat? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So you had been to negotiate. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  On behalf of an establishment. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And you were not at agriculture at the time – 
not at Free State at the time? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes I was… 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Because this was in 2010. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I was at National Agriculture. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So did you explain to Mr Zwane that you had 
actually been to India before to go negotiate with the locals there and it 
really did not need a protocol officer?  Or was it irrelevant? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It – ja it was a different – at that time 
the arrangements were made for me by the embassy in India for the 
interpretation and all those.  And that trip was undertaken as such.  So 
the – how the province operated and how national operated it was not 
the same. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  You see the other oddity for me certainly is 
20 
you had been talking to the CEO of Paras. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  That is your evidence. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Did you not tell Mr Zwane that you know it is 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 83 of 115 
 
going to cost us to have a protocol officer.  I have actually been talking 
to the man I am going to visit and we have a good understanding of why 
I am going to visit him in India.  You – there was – there is nothing 
unusual about the trip because you had arranged the trip.  Did you 
communicate this to the MEC? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No, no I did not Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  The reason I have always had an interest in 
Mr Narayan is because of the dual role he seems to have played in the 
Vrede Dairy Project.  Because at one point he is advisor to the Premier.  
At another point he is representing Estina and this is why really I ask 
10 
these questions because it is important to understand which hat Mr 
Narayan was wearing as he did different things for the Free State 
government.  I am just giving you context. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Okay.  Can you then confirm – I have moved 
away from the trip to India.  That any report that is tabled in the 
legislature by an incumbent MEC for Vrede – I beg your pardon MEC for 
agriculture on the Vrede Dairy Project would be based on information 
that was provided by you/by the department.  Would – is that a 
correction assumption that if the MEC goes to the legislature to 
20 
address on the Vrede Dairy Project the information they are imparting 
you would know about.  You would have given that MEC. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja – ja there is two ways of it Chair.  
If it is a written reply then the department would do so but if it 
sometimes when it is an oral reply the MEC can respond orally without 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 84 of 115 
 
– I must… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Consulting you. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Without consulting us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  So there are two ways.  If it is a 
written reply yes the department would have made that input. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  If it is a budget vote speech? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  If it is a budget vote speech then 
there are two things in the budget for – there is technical and political 
in the speech.  We made the technical input into the budget speech. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And then as far as the Premier is concerned 
and the state of the province address where he refers to or where she 
refers to a matter from DARD would that information be coming from 
the officials within the department? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair.  We submit our 
inputs then they formulate it into the speech. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  I will come back to that probably tomorrow 
because there is a point at which the Premier says that the milk 
processing plant was 90% complete.  But I just give you that heads up 
because I would want to know where he got that impression or that 
20 
information from.  But I will show you the proper document tomorrow 
because it is part of the financials that we will be studying tomorrow. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is… 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  But it is something for you at least just to 
reflect on. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 85 of 115 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Can we just deal with a couple of other 
issues.  I am moving away from Mr Zwane’s version completely.  There 
may be something that pops up somewhere but really I just want to 
finish off some of the issues that arose from the three affidavits that we 
have not covered yet. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE: Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Most importantly I just – I do not think it will 
take us very long Mr Thabethe.  But for your convenience you may want 
to hold onto Exhibit HH10b which is the second file that now has the 
10 
annexures to your 2017 affidavit.  So you get the affidavit in front and 
then these are the annexures that we were eventually able to locate.  I 
will just run through those annexures and where you want to elaborate 
and go back into the affi itself please feel free to do so.  I really just 
wanted to place on record what annexures you had included and 
understand why you included particular annexures in that 2017 affidavit 
here with me. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So if we look at MPT1 and I think there are 
flags Mr Thabethe.  If you go to 1 lift it and you get to page 254 that 
20 
document is the document that sets out the basic criteria for Vrede 
Dairy beneficiaries.  Mr Thabethe I believe that the file you want to be 
looking at – is the one with the pink flags. Are you happy with that?  
What is that – what is… 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  MPT001 is this one. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 86 of 115 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  No Mr Thabethe – maybe it is our fault for… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think tell him – tell him the Exhibit number on the 
spine first. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  The exhibit number on the spine is B not A. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It is B – okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Yes.  So it is the first – ja that is the correct 
one you had.  So those flags should be numbered 1 all the way down to 
21, are they? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Those are your annexures.  Some of them are 
10 
missing but that is fine we will deal with that. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  If you look at the first flag number 1. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  If you lift you will get to the basic criteria for 
Vrede Dairy beneficiaries. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Good.  Have you seen this document before? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes I have seen it Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  While you were HOD at DARD? 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Ja.  Was this document drafted before you 
signed the agreement of the 5 June 2012 with Estina?  Do you recall? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I cannot remember Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Nothing turns on it so I do not want you to 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 87 of 115 
 
worry about it Mr Thabethe.  The intention is not to trick you or 
anything I just wanted to try and locate it in a particular period of time.  
But you will agree with me when I say that to date there is no evidence 
that this criteria had any relevance to the selection of beneficiaries.  If 
you look at those criteria it had no relevance or very limited relevance 
to the selection of beneficiaries.  And I can repeat your evidence to you 
just to assist you.  What you did say is that when you went to speak to 
beneficiaries you wanted to know who is interested in poultry. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:    Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Who is interested in dairy, who is interested 
10 
in red meat?  So I grant you that.  But that is about the only issue that 
you teased out when you were talking to beneficiaries.  Correct me if I 
am wrong? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja Chair.  I agree I have seen the 
document but I have not interacted with the document because it is a 
document that official will develop.  It does not necessarily come to the 
HOD for approval because this will then become their basic guidelines 
as they go out to identify and see these are the issues.  Hence I say I 
have seen the document but I might not have done reflection on it 
because I believe the officials in the department who would have done 
20 
that. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  I just want to spend one or two minutes to 
make the point that most of what was set out in this document was 
completely irrelevant to the search for beneficiaries for the Vrede Dairy 
Project.  A quick example is the very last criteria the one dealing with 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 88 of 115 
 
age. Age more or less 65 was the cut off … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well there are two ways of dealing with the document 
Ms Gcabashe. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One is if your proposition is that this – the criteria set 
out in it were relevant is to either quickly read them and tell them or 
take one by one and tell them or otherwise he can read it overnight and 
you ask him tomorrow when he has had a chance to reflect on it.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  I – I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whichever because he says he has not had a chance 
10 
to reflect on it. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Chairman and please correct me Mr Thabethe 
if I am wrong.  Your ultimate answer is you know that the document 
exists. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  But it was not your function to put together 
the criteria it is a junior function. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So you cannot really speak to the relevance 
of the criteria because it is something that you gave an instruction it 
20 
had to be done by be it the Chief Director or below. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So I do not know if that answers the issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  As I understood the evidence. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 89 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no Yes okay no that is fine.  Just remember to 
make sure that your – you are able to be recorded Mr Thabethe.  I think 
your past two, three answers may have been quite soft.   
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright.  But I understand that your answer is 
you had no input in the creation of the document. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You knew about – it would have been prepared by 
officials but you cannot comment on  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Comment on. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  The relevance of its contents to anything? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Maybe I should also clarify that because the 
national cusp conditional grant required beneficiaries you are correct 
when you say that you had to develop a beneficiary document so that 
you could meet that condition.  Again if I am wrong tell the Chairman 
the facts. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair.  There is a national 
document that speaks to the issue of beneficiaries and that is the 
20 
document that I am required to implement. Then from that document 
then the department can develop its own document maybe to cover 
areas where they feel maybe they are lacking.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And the document that would be required for 
purposes of the agreement with Estina and getting that conditional 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 90 of 115 
 
grant from CUSP would be the document the department had 
developed.  Your department. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE: No, no Chair.  The requirements is 
meeting the criteria of the national department.  When you meet those 
requirements then – then you are allocated the funding not the 
departmental one. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Oh. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Because national has given the 
conditions. There are conditions that goes with the money so you have 
to meet those conditions of national for the money to be allocated. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Now I know one of the reasons that the CUSP 
grant was withdrawn was because you failed to present a beneficiary 
list that met their condition.  Am I correct? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair that is not correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The list was provided.  By the time 
they withdrew they already had the list.  Hence the reason for the 
withdrawal had nothing to do with beneficiaries.  It had everything to do 
with what I had explained earlier that treasury had requested the 
department to do so. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  That is your evidence Mr Thabethe. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. Yes and there is a letter Chair 
from National Treasury to Agriculture requesting them to do so? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  We have somebody coming from CUSP who 
either confirm what you are saying or differ with what you are saying.  
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 91 of 115 
 
And tell me that my interpretation was wrong that is why. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair.  I have seen – I had an 
advantage of being provided with that.  I think that letter is an exhibit 
in there. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  The – I do not think there is any merit in 
going into the detail of the criteria here as I had wanted to because you 
say you had nothing to do with it.  So I will move on to the next point 
which is annexure 2.  So at least the Chairman knows that not only did 
you set out criteria – basic criteria you had a list which is part of 
annexure 1 which was prepared by the department. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And on your version you – that list complied 
with the requirements of the national office.  Please go to the next 
annexure Mr Thabethe.  Now as I have understood your affidavit this 
presentation was made when you consulted with Nestle, Parmalat, 
Clover, Dairybelle.  If you look at your paragraph 7 – paragraph 7 of 
the 2017 affidavit and for your convenience it is the first document in 
the same file.  You can – you can even stay with the same file it is 
actually – ja we just repeated.  We simply put it there for convenience.  
You say this is the document that you relied on and then you continued 
20 
to say no response was received.   
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yip that is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  You in agreement with that?  If you look at 
this document Mr Thabethe please explain why any of those dairy 
companies would have been persuaded to invest to become partners 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 92 of 115 
 
with you in the Vrede Dairy Project?  Because if you just page through 
it slowly – just go through it. It actually tells you on the first page that 
it is the Mohoma Mobung, Agriculture and Rural Development 
framework 2012 to 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on Ms Gcabashe. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Last time I heard was when you were referring to 
paragraph 7 of his affidavit. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Of his affidavit which… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have moved somewhere else. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Chairman it refers to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  This document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that document is at page? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  It is at page 262.  It is the second flag 
Chairman.  Flag 2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And so I am going through all the annexures.  
This is what he had annexed to his affidavit Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So I am asking him to explain. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no that is fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  The relevance of this to the people he said he 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 93 of 115 
 
spoke to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  When he was looking for local partners. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Mr Thabethe. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja Chair this was the generic project 
Mohoma Mobung Agriculture and Rural Development framework 2011 
which we had – we presented.  But depending on who is the party we 
10 
are talking to then we then emphasise on specific areas of interest.  So 
the presentation is generic but the discussion then they will focus as 
you enter into discussion. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  That is not what you say in your paragraph 7.  
Because what you communicate in your paragraph 7  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And it was an important paragraph because 
you had to decide on whether to use local companies or look further 
afield.  And you say this is the presentation you used and on the basis 
of this presentation there was no response received.  That is what you 
20 
say in paragraph 7. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Now just by way of example really to illustrate 
the point.  If you look at – go to page 266 I am really just illustrating 
the point.  When you look at that particular schedule or diagram it 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 94 of 115 
 
simply – at page 266 Mr Thabethe.  It really under Thabo Mofutsenyana 
which is where Vrede would fall.  If you run down that column you 
speak about cattle, maize, wheat, flowers, asparagus, apples, cherries, 
peaches, vegetable, soya beans, and potatoes.  Now you – this is a 
pitch to me Parmalat why would Parmalat be interested in working with 
you? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair - Chair I am trying to get to … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Page 2-6-6.  That is the one.  So go to Thabo 
Mofutsanyana and that is the Vrede area.  Vrede falls within that 
particular district and you are talking - you are trying to get money - 
10 
you are trying to get partners. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  You are trying to get interest from local 
people to work with you and set up this mega dairy project and you 
show them a document like this.  This is what I have understood of your 
paragraph 7. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair can I refer you on - on the 
same presentation to page 2-7-2. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  2-7-2?  Chairman are you there? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I have got it. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Continue Mr Thabethe. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The - the - you will - you will read 
from the column from the left.  It says Thabo Mofutsanyana where it 
says mostly rural. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  No.  Yes, yes.  I am with you.  Yes. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 95 of 115 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  Now if … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The first column? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  The first - the first column and 
then the - the second column is the column that talks to the corridor.  
The third one talks to the focus areas and then you will see in the focus 
area there - there is made specific of the areas.  I think we did discuss 
them before and then until - until you go to the column where you say 
commodity type which is one, two, three, four, five column - column 
number five. 
Then you will be able to see dairy there becomes a 
10 
commodity type to be implemented in Thabo Mofutsanyana and you will 
see on the - on the corridor and - and also the focus areas you would 
see which areas we intending to focus on which we have discussed.  
Fouriesburg, Ficksburg, Memel, Vrede. 
Hence I say this is a PowerPoint presentation.  A PowerPoint 
presentation you present it.  You talk to it.  If - if you are not in the 
presentation you are not going to be able to understand.  So you - you 
summarise in your PowerPoint presentation and then you talk to the 
presentation.  You talk to the people that are sitting there. 
You explain to them but this is just a presentation that we 
20 
gave to them and - but what I am trying to explain is the issues that 
you are looking for.  They are covered in the presentation. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  They are hidden if at all anything else.  You 
can look at the very next column having pointed us to the - the dairy - 
mention of dairy in column number one, two, three, four, five. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 96 of 115 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Column six - livestock improvement, dairy 
cow hotel, agro processing/value adding hub Harrismith.  Grains, dry 
bean 
production 
and 
water 
reticulation. 
 
Market 
infrastructure 
development.  My simple question Mr Thabethe is how do you expect an 
investor to look at a presentation like this and say that dairy cow hotel 
sounds like a brilliant idea?  You cannot. 
If you go to page 280 of the same document and really I am 
just illustrating the point.  It is the same point.  There you talk about a 
mega pilot project and there is a chart provided there.  I am just getting 
10 
there myself.  Free State DARD.  Planning agent, strategic partner.  A 
most unhelpful presentation. 
If what you really want from Nestle or Parmalat or Dairybelle 
etcetera is there attention - asking them to pay attention to what you 
can do with the Free State and dairy farming in the Free State.  On 
page 285 there is no mention of dairy.  I have actually got a little list 
here just to illustrate. 
On page 272 where Thabo Mofutsanyana is mentioned 
commodity approach.  It just is not a very helpful document.  Anyway 
that is - that is the essential question because you annexed this 
20 
document to your affidavit.  I do not want to spend too much time on 
making the same point. 
It is your document.  You used it to try and gain interest from 
big boys and girls money wise who are actually operating also in the 
Free State.  Anyway. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 97 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it maybe - I think it is an important point 
Ms Gcabashe.  Are you able to respond to what Ms Gcabashe is putting 
to you?  She is in effect saying remember you told me last - previously 
that you would have liked to have got local partners. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Companies from South Africa to partner with you but 
you tried and you did not get them.  Remember I think at some stage I 
may have said something like it is difficult to understand why you would 
not get companies interested in South Africa but you would have to go 
all the way to India and then get one that was interested there. 
10 
Now in the context of what she is putting to you is how could 
you have hoped to get anybody to buy into this if you gave them a 
document that was not helpful in making that kind of decision. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Chair - Chair I - I do not agree … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Because you - you call a meeting and 
you sit and you discuss.  Then before the discussion you give them a 
broader discussion of what we want to do.  You give them this 
presentation.  Now this presentation you give it to everybody because it 
talks to the agriculture in the Free State in general and then - then you 
20 
sit in the meeting and you say one of the focus areas you want to do 
why we have you called you is this one and we know you are experts in 
that particular area. 
So looking at the document to be talking to what you intended 
to do is - is not all that we had discussed in the meeting.  All I am 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 98 of 115 
 
saying is that we had the meeting.  We presented this view to them so 
that they have a holistic picture of what we want to do which we have 
done to everybody and then you then become specific depending on the 
audience that you are sitting with what you want to talk about on that 
particular day. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Is this the same document you took to Paras 
when you went to speak to them about the possibility of having them as 
a strategic partner? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  Chair this is one of the 
documents that we - we had but when you talk to Paras they are not a 
10 
South African company that have got interest in the generic agriculture.  
That you would have done when you are sitting with - with a - a South 
African company of what is our intention in the Free State agriculture. 
So it is - it is a different but yes I agree.  We also took this 
document with us. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  I actually asked the question if this was the 
document you relied on.  If this was the document you took.  You say it 
is one of. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Of the documents we took. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So you had other documents? 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  We had also another document 
that we had prepared. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  That was more dairy specific? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That - that had - was giving them the 
picture of the dairy in South Africa. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 99 of 115 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Why did you not take something like that to 
Parmalat or Nestle? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  But they - they have the picture of the 
dairy in South Africa.  I cannot go to Parmalat or - or Nestle and tell 
them about the dairy in South - because they know those facts and 
figures that I had presented to them there.  All I needed to persuade 
them to work with us because they know the industry even far better 
than - than I would have explained it. 
All I needed them to say this is what we want to do.  It is 
informed by this document of ours that we have developed.  Can you 
10 
work with us?  We want to focus into dairy but when you go to India 
then you give them the picture of the dairy industry in South Africa so 
that they have an understanding of - if they would want to go where 
they are going. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Chairman Mr Buthelezi appears to want to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Is there something …? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Say something. 
MR NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  It is not my intention to disrupt the 
line of questioning (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Proceedings but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 100 of 115 
 
MR NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  In my calculation now we have 
exceeded a good 15 minutes discussing this presentation the quality 
thereof and whether it could have found applicability locally or 
internationally or globally … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  And with respect I have been trying to 
establish how it the advances any of the critical issues which we need 
to get through before the end of the day … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  And if - it is - it is a subjectivity point.  
10 
It is subjective to say whether I consider one presentation to be of 
value or not and if the witness testifies that well I think this was great 
and the evidence leader does not hold the same view.  We cannot sit 
and try haggling over that point Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well - well I do not know about 15 minutes.  That 
might be … 
MR NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Maybe I am stretching it because I am 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja.  I think you might be stretching it, ja. 
MR NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  (Intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think it is - it is an important area.  You - you 
would have heard me say to Ms Gcabashe the question might relate to 
something important.  One of the - one of the things that still intrigues 
me is how it was not possible to find a - a company within South Africa 
to partner with them and how Paras was selected … 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 101 of 115 
 
MR NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And how a company so far away was found and so on 
and so on.  Now Ms Gcabashe might have had more time than I have 
had to - to focus on this document but it could be - it could be that her 
questions are aimed at saying that the presentation at least that part of 
it that is in document form that you gave to local companies was not 
the kind of document that had any chance of persuading them to come 
on board and - and maybe and she is not necessarily saying that but 
she will say so if she says that. 
Maybe the idea was to go and get Paras but able to say local 
10 
companies were not interested but the way you went about it was not 
meant to generate any interest from them anyway.  You know.  So - so - 
but that is one area - that is one angle on - or which she might be 
persuading - pursuing and if that is the angle I am quite interested in it 
because I think every - everyone who list - has been listening to 
evidence relating to this project you know is wondering how come you 
know a company - the company that was found to partner was in India 
when the Department of Agriculture and the Head of Department says 
actually we wanted local companies but did not find them. 
They were not interested.  So let us - let us allow it and then 
20 
let us see, ja. 
MR NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  I - I accept Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
MR NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  I think what triggered me … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 102 of 115 
 
MR NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  To - to - in fairness was that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  The initial question had started to say 
how would Parmalat have accepted this … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  And then the question is now how 
would Nestle have accepted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  I am thinking well … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  They did not accept it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  We now know this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  We do not think it was a great quality 
presentation anyway. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  How did Paras then accept it and then 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  And then let us … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Take the point forth. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No, no that is - that is … 
MR NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 103 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine.  Thank you.  Ms Gcabashe. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Chair … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Chairman fortunately I am the one who is 
leading evidence not Mr Buthelezi.  So let us go back to this. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Chair can - can I go back? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It - it is my understanding … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE: 
 
That 
South 
African 
companies 
understand Government operations and the programs … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That exist in Government … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  And - and where they are required to 
- to participate.  You do not need to lecture them in - in those things 
and they know the amount of funding available for what in Government 
because they are exposed to that.  What you require from your side as 
Government is to persuade not - not the document - repeat of a 
document - of documents that they have seen in order to be able to 
persuade them. 
20 
In - in fact my understanding would be if that would have 
been the case would have had a great success on the development of 
smallholder farmers if - if that - that is the - is the - is the - my 
understanding that private sectors would have wanted to be involved 
together with all Provincial Governments in assisting smallholder - of 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 104 of 115 
 
which budget Government has. 
We would have achieved great success.  We go to that 
persuasion but we do not win and - and I could give you an example 
Chair.  We - we are sitting - we are sitting in the Free State with 
another project state of the art of fish which was done by the Chinese. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The - on the same principles.  They 
came and they built a very beautiful fish research centre and the 
production of fingerling and - and we are sitting here.  We have got a 
very big fish industry in South Africa which - which could have done it.  
10 
Now - now all - all that I am saying is that it is not that easy that you 
go there and you persuade and people say we are interested. 
There are other dynamics at play that you - you cannot 
influence and you have to move on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Otherwise we would - we would be 
doing - because all Provincial Government would sit which budget 
where they want to assist smallholder farmers … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  But the entire industry in South Africa 
20 
knows that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That money is available and they 
could come partner with the departments and implement but it is not 
happening. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 105 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Just for … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  For - I beg your pardon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Can I go ahead? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Just for clarity and correct me again if I am 
wrong.  That Chinese sponsored fisheries project … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  The Chinese actually put money into it? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Yes.  It is very different when you are talking 
to a local company because you have to persuade them for whatever 
reason to put money in - in the same way you persuaded Paras to put 
money into this project eventually.  So all I am saying is I do not think 
you are comparing apples with apples when you look at the Chinese 
sponsored fish - fish hatchery.  I happen to know about it … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And the approach you would have been 
20 
making to the local South African companies.  I did not understand you 
to say that you were asking them to sponsor as the Chinese have done 
and they do on the whole continent … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  (Intervenes). 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  But that you wanted them to come in on the 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 106 of 115 
 
different basis but they are local. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  That - that is correct Chair.  
What - Chair what - what I - we persuaded the Chinese the same way 
because we had to go there and - and say if - if you - if this project 
would be done in South Africa … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  In the Free State this would be the 
benefit to us and - and the Chinese invested the money in the 
infrastructure but we had to budget the operations to make sure that it 
becomes functional.  It became the responsibility of - of the department 
10 
to make sure that - that operates. 
So we had to make money available in - into that but what I 
am trying to explain Chair is that we - we would not have persuaded 
South Africans because they understand the situation.  In - in some 
instances I would - I would actually say in fact it was the private sector 
would have come - should have come to the department to say can we 
work with you in assisting these farmers. 
What would you want to do and how?  How much money do 
we have and then we plan together and we implement and we assist. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Chairman if I might move on? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but what maybe important if you had in mind 
what I had in mind about what would have been important to put in the 
document.  It maybe - I see we are five to five.  It maybe something for 
tomorrow to look at what the important features would have been that 
one would have expected to be in the kind of presentation that was 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 107 of 115 
 
given to the local companies. 
Were those features there?  You know.  That - that kind of 
information but maybe that can be dealt with tomorrow. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  I - I will … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Look at that Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  I - I think part of the difficulty of course is 
also just the documents that Mr Thabethe has not been able to - to get 
hold of.  For instance his … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  His high level desktop … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Research … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Would also have been helpful … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  But I know he has not been able to get hold 
of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To get it, ja. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Am I correct? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  I do not know if there are any other 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 108 of 115 
 
documents that you - you might have.  This is really all we have been 
able to get hold of from various sources but if you - you have better 
documentation to help the Chairman understand these features in 
respect of a local company that you would have wanted them to bring to 
the table on this dairy project.  It would be helpful … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No.  That is fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  But I will also look at the Setsoto 
presentation Chairman because it was similar.  Not the same but 
similar. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  It was also a dairy cow hotel … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And there might be things we can glean from 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  That would assist the Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair - Chair the Setsoto … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Detail had already been developed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Now during the time when we were 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 109 of 115 
 
talking to strategic partners we had not even developed a concept. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  We wanted to develop a concept 
together with somebody who would want to be part of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  So you would not have a document 
like you have at Setsoto … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Because Setsoto had been fully 
developed … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  By that time … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  For implementation … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  But at this time you want - when you 
agree then you begin to develop the document together. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  All - all that you needed … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  And it did not mean that after it has 
been developed then you must put the money.  You go that together.  
We agree.  We do the investigation.  We do the feasibility study.  If we 
agree then we implement.  That - that was the level at which this was 
done but you - you would not have a - a fully-fledged document by that 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 110 of 115 
 
time to present to somebody to say please put money here because 
that - that was not the intention. 
It was - it was too develop the document together with 
whoever was interested.  Hence you do not have … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I understand that we would have done 
it ourselves first and done the feasibility study.  Done everything and at 
that time then we would go and say we have a business plan.  This is 
the money we need.  Are you interested and - but that was not the 
approach that we were looking at. 
10 
CHAIRPERSO:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hence we did not have a document 
that she might have been looking for. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  I also have in mind Mr Thabethe the 
document that was prepared by Dawie Marais who you know gave 
evidence here because he spoke to - much as it was a - a criticism in 
part - not in whole - in part of the Vrede Dairy Project but the elements 
of - of how you run a dairy farm what you would require are in that 
document. 
Maybe that also is a source document we can use to help the 
20 
Chairman understand those features that you would want to use to 
attract a local company to invest with you and work on something that 
will benefit the Free State Province.  I do not know … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  If you think it is a good or bad idea. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 111 of 115 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Chair I do not agree because he 
was critiquing a document that had already been developed.  He was 
not critiquing the intention.  He - he in his document he said there was 
nothing wrong with the intention to develop.  So he looked at a specific 
document that was developed already and that is what he was 
critiquing. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  You are closing all the doors I am opening 
Mr Thabethe. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  No and you are entitled to and I rely on your 
10 
expertise.  You are an expert in this field which is why I ask you the 
question shall we do this, shall we do that and I - I have understood 
your answers as well.  That this was at inception that you were trying to 
put something together. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  It was not a document that had already been 
prepared and you were just going to - you were asking partners to come 
and work with you and conceive and tailor make something that would 
suit the Free State Province. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  Chair - Chair we - we - 
20 
previously when - when we discussed this.  I have also indicated that 
using the same document and criteria we managed to find other 
strategy partners in the Free State to do other projects which we have 
implemented.  So this document did not dismally fail.  We - we were … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 112 of 115 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Able to achieve … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Using it because there are other 
partners who said we understand you.  We would want to work with you 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  And those projects were implemented. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Chairman I have three and four which we 
have dealt with already.  Maybe I should just put that on record. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE: 
 
Annexure 
3 
is 
the 
Memorandum 
of 
Understanding 
that 
we 
have 
already 
discussed 
between 
the 
Government of South Africa and the Government of - of India.  So we 
do not have to go back to that.  Then Annexure 4 is that 
motivation/submission 
you 
made 
to 
the 
Premier 
with 
the 
recommendation of Mr Zwane.  Again we have dealt with the material. 
We do not need to look - look at that.  Annexure 5 we have 
not received and it is a bit of a pity because that is the presentation 
that you brought back from Paras.  We - we have not - unless you have 
20 
it.  We have not been able to find it and it is not part of this Court 
bundle of yours.  If you have it please share it with us Mr Thabethe. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I - I think it is Chair in the Court 
bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.

MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So maybe he can look at it overnight. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then tomorrow morning then we can … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He can report back. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Thanks Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Then tomorrow Chairman if this is - a 
convenient time  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  To stop. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  We can start with MPT6 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Depending on what Mr Thabethe is able to 
find … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  In regard to Annexure 5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No that is fine.  What is your assessment at this 
stage of how we are likely - how much time we might need … 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Chairman … 
CHAIRPERSON:  For Mr - to Mr Thabethe tomorrow?  Does it look …? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  If we could have the whole day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No that is right.  We do have the whole day but I 
am just wondering whether in terms of what we have covered so far 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 114 of 115 
 
whether it gives any indication whether our pace is fine for the - the 
whole day or whether we - we might not finish or it might be too little to 
make an assessment. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  No Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  What we have done today. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Chairman the intention is still to finish.  We 
are on question 55 of 120 before we get to the financials.  So I am 
going to - I am going to chop … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  I am going to try and reduce. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine but the bottom line is that nothing 
has - that has happened this afternoon changes your view that we 
should be able to finish tomorrow? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  I - I think we should Chairman … 
CHAIRPERSON:  We should be able, ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Simply because I will cut … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Because a lot of the material we have 
covered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No, no that is fine.  We have - we had covered 
20 
but I - I will also have look.  I do recall that I did have some issues that 
I wanted to look at again and then raise with Mr Thabethe.  So I will 
have a look. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Can we start at half past nine though 
Chairman?  Is that convenient? 
03 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 176 
 
Page 115 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well that is what I was now wanting to talk about.  
Partly that is why I was asking the question because I was wondering 
whether we should start at 10 or half past nine depending on what our 
estimate is in terms of whether we would finish on time.  So maybe to 
be on the safe side let us start at half past nine to give us just a little 
extra. 
Would that be fine Mr Thabethe from your side starting at half 
past nine? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  I will be fine Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and your Counsel indicates it would be fine as 
10 
well.  Alright we will start at half past nine tomorrow.  We will adjourn 
for the day and then start at half past nine tomorrow.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.
