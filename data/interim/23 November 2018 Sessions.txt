PROCEEDINGS HELD ON 23 NOVEMBER 2018  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there anybody there?  Usually there is somebody standing there 
by the time I lift my head up. 
MS NORMAN:  Good afternoon, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good afternoon, Ms Norman, good afternoon everybody. 
MS NORMAN:  Mr Chairman, first, I think there is something wrong with my mic 
here, is it an echo?  Thank you.  Mr Chairman, I wish to apologise for yesterday.  I 
think that one thing that I learned from yesterday is that if I have an application to 
move I must do it myself and not ask anyone to do it for me. 
 
I apologise I happened to be one of the woman who were chosen by the 
10 
country to represent the values of Mama Sisulu and that function and those persons 
were happening yesterday.  Then I requested my colleagues to stand in for me, but 
things did not go the way I planned.  I sincerely apologise for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, no, that is fine. 
MS NORMAN:  Thank you, Mr Chairman.  And I was advised, Mr Chairman, that you 
would like to hear the application first today, is that correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I would like us to deal with it quickly. 
MS NORMAN:  Yes, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NORMAN:  Mr Chairman, this is an application for condonation for the late filing 
20 
of the Rule 3.3 notices on Mr Whitley, Mr Bobart, Mr van Rooyen and Mr Mabaso.  
Mr Mabaso is represented by Mr Denga, he is present today, but on the day when I 
moved the application, the initial day the representatives of Mr – of the other three 
implicated persons were present and they indicated that they were not opposing the 
application and so does Mr Denga.  He also does not oppose it. 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 3 of 63 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS NORMAN:  Yes.  I submit, Mr Chairperson that a proper case is made 
out…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  The delay was…[intervenes] 
MS NORMAN:  The delay is a delay of actually 13 days. 
CHAIRPERSON:  13 days? 
MS NORMAN:  13 days, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NORMAN:  Because the signed statements were received only on Friday after 
17:00 on Friday and then we worked on the notices over the weekend and they were 
10 
issued on Monday morning and as a result of that, because the first witness was 
going to testify on Tuesday and then by the time that witness had testified the 
implicated persons had only one day to deal and have a look at the notices. 
 
And I did explain to Mr Denga, that because it is due to the lateness of the 
issuing of the notices, therefore there are 14 – we are going to apply to the 
Chairperson that their 14 day period not be interrupted by the fact that the witnesses 
have testified, that they be afforded the exact two weeks for them to put up their 
version and deal with the matter in the manner in which they deem appropriate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes. 
MS NORMAN:  Yes.  If the, Chairperson, is satisfied with the explanation 
20 
given…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, that is in order. 
MS NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the – what is the Prayer 1 would be condonation? 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 4 of 63 
 
MS NORMAN:  Condonation and then Prayer 2 is – in fact Prayer 2 and 3, they are 
kind of repetitive, save that in Prayer 3 the persons affected are mentioned by name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS NORMAN:  The order is then that we are seeking paragraph 1, 2 and 3, Mr 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS NORMAN:  Of the notice of motion which appears at pages 1 to 2 of the bundle. 
ORDER 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay condonation is granted in regard to the failure of the 
Commission's legal team to comply with the rules of the Commission in relation to 
the timeous delivery or service of the Rule 3(3) notices.  Does that cover everything? 
MS NORMAN:  That covers everything, as the Chairperson pleases, thank you, Mr 
Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MS NORMAN:  Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Mr Chairman, the second of the three Treasury 
witnesses is Mr Dondo Mogajane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  He is ready to testify. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If that is the correct pronunciation I would like you to repeat it, 
otherwise I will ask the DG to give the correct pronunciation, because I would have 
pronounced it very differently, so, and I believe in trying to pronounce people's 
names and surnames correctly. 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 5 of 63 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know whether you have got the pronunciation right? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  As I have it from the statement signed by him is 
Mogajane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no the spelling I know, it is just I would have said ga, Gayane 
instead of Ghajane, so that is why I am saying I want to get the correct 
pronunciation.  The DG will indicate in due course if we are not pronouncing it 
correctly. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you.  Registrar you can administer the oath or the 
10 
affirmation? 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  My name is Andrew Dondo Mogajane. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the prescribed oath? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  I do not have any objection. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your conscience? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, I do. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the truth, the 
whole truth and nothing but the truth, if so raise your right hand and say so help me 
God? 
20 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  So help me God. 
ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE (Duly sworn states) 
EXAMINATION BY ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Mr Mogajane first thing first, how 
do you pronounce your name? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  My surname is Mogajane. 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 6 of 63 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mogajane, have I got it right? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, Chair, you have got it right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  I do not want people not pronouncing my surname 
incorrectly or even saying Zondi, so I do not want to pronounce anybody's surname 
wrongly. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Mr Mogajane for the purposes of your evidence we 
will be working with one bundle only.  And, Chair, that will be EXHIBIT P the bundle 
that we used yesterday. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I just asked the Registrar a few minutes before we came in 
whether we needed all these bundles and she said that somebody said to be on the 
safe side they must all be brought in and I said the moment when somebody says to 
be on the safe side, it means that they did not apply their mind as to whether it is 
needed or not. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  That silent laziness.  Chair, the statement of Mr 
Mogajane begins at page 44 of EXHIBIT P. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say 84? 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  44. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Thank you, I have got it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You will see that page 44 is a title page together with 
the index of the statement and then page 45 is the table of contents and the 
substantive statement begins from page 46.  And that is where I would like to start 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 7 of 63 
 
Mr Mogajane.  It is now common ground that you are the present Director General of 
the National Treasury, correct? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, it is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  When were you appointed? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  I was appointed Director General of the 
National Treasury on 8 June 2017. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And we heard the witness who testified before you 
that he was your predecessor and he left office sometime in May 2017? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, that is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And that is Mr Lungile Fuzile? 
10 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, sir. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What happened between June and May to that 
office? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  I was appointed Acting Director General after 
Mr Fuzile left the National Treasury and I was formally appointed by Cabinet on 
8 June 2017. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So you acted for more or less a month…[intervenes] 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Before your final and permanent occupation of that 
office.  Can I ask you to just give us a sense of your qualifications? 
20 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  I have Bachelor of Administration Degree that 
I acquired at the University of Durban Westville.  I also have two Honours Degrees, 
one in Public Management and the other one in Industrial Relations and Human 
Resources that are also acquired, both of them acquired at the University of Durban 
Westville. 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 8 of 63 
 
 
I also have a certificate of Public Management and Financial Management 
from Harvard University.  I also have a Masters Degree from University of Maryland 
in Public Management and acquired this from the University of Maryland in the 
United States. 
MS NORMAN:  In Washington? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, no, yes in Washington Maryland, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I note Mr Mogajane that you studied in KZN and your 
predecessor also did study in KZN, so I think KZN is making some contribution to 
National Treasury. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Indeed, KZN is, those of us that studied at 
10 
KZN are contributing positively in South Africa. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And in case you do not know Mr Mogajane we wisely 
boast that KZN, especially the University of Zululand has produced three successive 
Chief Justices of this country and we hope that in due course it will add to that 
number.  Mr Mogajane in paragraph 1 you set out in detail your employment history 
in National Treasury beginning from 1999.  Is there any other historic employment 
matter before you joined National Treasury that you think important to bring to the 
attention of the Chairperson? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, advocate, I can do that.  Before I joined 
the University, I mean before I joined National Treasury I was a lecturer at Technicon 
20 
South Africa and before then I was full time employed at the University of Durban 
Westville.  I was in the student housing division and I was responsible for student 
housing and on a part time basis I was also teaching at the University of Durban 
Westville and at the same time I was also teaching part time at the Emil Sudan 
Technicon in Durban. 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 9 of 63 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright.  So you have a fair amount of academic 
background? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  In my early years yes sir. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  There are two aspects of your official duties in 
National Treasury that I would like to highlight and emphasise for the purposes of 
your testimony.  The first is that position which you occupied from May 2014 to May 
2015 as the Chief Operating Officer in National Treasury, do you see that? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, I can see that. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can you give us a sense of what you generally broad 
official functions and duties were in that regard? 
10 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Thank you.  Before I go onto answering that 
question, can I also explain that in 2000, between 2000 and 2001 which is also 
material I have left the Treasury for one year and I was with EDA Trust, an 
Environmental and Development Agency Trust, an NGO based in Braamfontein, and 
it is that year, so it is also important that I was a Deputy Director at that NGO for just 
one year and I rejoined National Treasury in 2001 in September of that year. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, thank you for that addition.  Can we get back to 
your general functions as the COO…[intervenes] 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Of National Treasury for that one year period? 
20 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  After the elections in 2014 and after 
Minister Gordhan, because I was his Chief of Staff before then…[intervenes] 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I will get to that. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Oh, yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Ja. 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 10 of 63 
 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  As COO having been around the position exist 
is at a DDG level in the National Treasury my duty was basically to be a liaison 
between the office of the DG and the office – and the rest of the National Treasury 
including the office of the Minister at the time and at the time it was Minister Nene 
who was the Minister. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, but what were you doing as a COO? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  As COO I was simply in most cases 
representing the DG internally taking matters outside the Treasury, where the office 
of the DG was needed in terms of liaison ensuring that in government it is very 
interesting.  Government, it depends where you are coming from and what your level 
10 
is. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Now if you are asked as the Minister I mean 
the office of the DG to engage with other departments and a DGG comes, then they 
sometimes want to insist that they engage with the office of the DG.  So it was easy 
for this role to be performed on behalf – in some cases on behalf of the DG office 
and I would interact ensuring that the aspirations and objections of the National 
Treasury are actually entrenched in the system of government, including liaising 
between various divisions of the Treasury and the office of the DG. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So in a sense you were the technical gateway to the 
20 
DG's office? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, I confirm and say yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The next office is the one you already presaged and 
that is the office of Chief of Staff.  We heard a lot about it yesterday and I would like 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 11 of 63 
 
you to solicit your views about it.  Where does that office fit in within the 
administration of National Treasury? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  As Chief of Staff I am the head of the office of 
the Minister and the head and that includes the office of the Deputy Minister, 
administratively so.  I would then make sure that the rest of the National Treasury 
including the office of the DG, playing a liaison role between the office of the Minister 
and the rest of the National Treasury and the office of the Minister and the rest of the 
administration, government as a whole, in terms of again what Ministers 
responsibilities are and how they are communicated to the rest of the department 
and sometimes, because again as I said the authority of the ministry becomes quite 
10 
critically, and I represent a view or the authority of the Minister as Chief of Staff. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And in that capacity do you have any authority to 
issue instructions to first the DG? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  I would not put it like that.  I would rather say 
in collaboration with the office of the DG, understanding that the DG is the one I 
enter into a contract with the DG is my direct administratively and officially so he 
becomes my supervisor and as a result the avoidance at all material instances would 
be to give or to be seen to be giving instruction or be seen to be superimposing 
myself on the DG or the Deputy Minister's office. 
 
So at any given point in time collaboratively so I would then not issue 
20 
instructions, but request and in some cases I would then directly engage with the 
department, but the DG would be aware. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So the short answer to my question is you would 
have no authority to give instructions to the DG? 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 12 of 63 
 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  I would not have authority at all to give 
instruction to the DG. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Conversely would the DG have the capacity or the 
authority to issue instructions to you? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, yes, certainly the DG would give 
instruction to me, yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Second, would you have the authority as the Chief of 
Staff to issue instructions to any DDG or any other management employees of 
National Treasury? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  I would reasonable instructions in line with our 
10 
work, but obviously in collaboration with the DG and not as I say superimpose on the 
functioning of the administration of the National Treasury and the function of the 
DDG's. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  I will get to the office that you occupied when 
the events that began on the Wednesday of 9 December 2015 unfolded, and before I 
do so, can I ask you to confirm that you had consulted through your lawyers with 
members of the legal team, and certainly not me, but some of my colleagues, 
correct? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, I did consult. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And they invited you to make a statement and asked 
20 
for your assistance in relation to the term of reference relating to paragraph 1.8 of 
the terms of reference and I take it that you know what that paragraph 1.8 requires of 
the Commission? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, yes, I do. 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 13 of 63 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And then you did so by compiling the statement which 
begins from page 46. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes sir. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And the body of the statement ends at page 50, 
correct? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  At page? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  5-0. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  5-0, yes sir. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, typed page 6 at the bottom, correct? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, yes sir. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And then you only annexe one annexure to that 
statement which is the email accompanied by a media statement from pages 51 to 
52, correct? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, yes sir. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  At page 50 there is a signature just above your 
name? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, sir, that is my signature, yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Do you confirm that is your signature? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes sir, it is my signature. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And by that signature you do confirm that you have 
20 
read the contents of the statement and that they are true and correct to the best of 
your knowledge and belief, correct? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Is there any part of the statement that you would wish 
to alter, modify or supplement? 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 14 of 63 
 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  No, not at this stage, no, not at all. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  On that premise can we now begin with the office that 
you occupied when the events I have indicated took place?  What was your position 
in Treasury around that period of December 2015? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  At the time of that period I was Deputy 
Director General responsible for public finance at the National Treasury. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can you repeat that again? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  I was a Deputy Director General responsible 
for public finance at the National Treasury. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  And what were your general responsibilities? 
10 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  My general responsibilities included liaison 
and overseeing expenditure and revenue issues in relation to all national 
government departments and public entities under those national government 
departments. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  And assisting the budget office in preparation 
of the national budget including liaison on behalf of the National Treasury with 
various bodies in parliament and I mean various parliamentary committees, in 
particular the SCOF which is the standing committed on finance, standing committee 
on appropriations, standing committee on public accounts and other committees as 
20 
and when we had been requested to engage on behalf of National Treasury insofar 
as public national entities are concerned and national government departments. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, you heard the Chairman yesterday made an 
appeal to Mr Fuzile who in turn said that you are the appropriate person to deal with 
the Chairperson's appeal around information regarding the extent of business and 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 15 of 63 
 
revenue that the Gupta related entities would have procured from state or 
government business.  You remember or do you have any knowledge of that appeal? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, I do have knowledge of what Mr Fuzile 
was referring to. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Because at the time the National Treasury did 
do some estimates in terms of the impact of what then was finally called the 
nenegate, the impact that it had and again I requested my economic policy team to 
then remodel the impact of that – the impact that, that had. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I think we are speaking across purpose.  Let me 
10 
make it quite clear…[intervenes] 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What is the context of the appeal that the 
Chairperson has extended.  And I assume that you would want to talk about the 
consequences of the so called nenegate, we will get to that. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Oh. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But the appeal was made in the context of the 
evidence which has now been placed before the Chairperson through the evidence 
of then Minister Jonas, Deputy Minister Jonas, who I take you know him? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, I know him. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  He told the Chairperson at some point during the 
course of his evidence that a member of the Gupta family said to him, when they had 
a conversation in October 2015 that they received revenue from their business with 
government entities in the order of 6 billion I think, Chairperson, and they would like 
to push it up, ramp it up to 8 billion.  For that reason they wanted Mr Jonas to assist 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 16 of 63 
 
them.  The appeal is in that context, and it is this, can you in National Treasury 
confirm the extent of business and associated revenue the Gupta owned or 
controlled entities have received from government?  Can you model that revenue 
stream especially in relation to 2015 financial year, and can you please produce that 
type of data to us? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, sir, yes, I will certainly do that.  I have 
already actioned that request, what came through yesterday.  I have asked our Chief 
Procurement Office together with our Financial Management Office to model the cost 
and the revenue that would have been accrued to the Gupta empire and as and 
when it is available I will certainly make it available to the Commission. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, and if I may give you some kind of indication of 
what the information we are looking for is, it relates to revenue. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, revenue. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I will be surprised if you can give us information 
relating to the cost structure of those business entities? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  No, I will not be able to give you the cost 
structures. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, yes.  That we will get, sorry Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can continue, maybe what I wanted to say is what you want to 
say. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  No, no, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to make sure that you have correct understanding one of the 
aspects that the information must address, particularly the one that we are asking 
for, but you know, it will not hurt if we get more, is whether as at 2015 maybe 
2014/2015, 2013/2014/2015 what revenue were Gupta related entities obtaining 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 17 of 63 
 
annually from government and maybe SOEs, yes.  So, that is what we would very 
much like to know. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, no, thank you, Chair, I will certainly look 
at it like that.  Revenues, state owned companies and national government from the 
period 2013 to 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I think it is fairly straight forward from national 
departments, because we are told that they have the BAS system that they utilize to 
track and trace payments from various expenses, but it would be difficult, we are 
told, insofar as state owned enterprises are concerned. 
10 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  It will certainly be difficult for state owned 
companies and municipalities. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  For provincial departments and national 
departments through the basic accounting system we should be able to get the 
information. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, and that is the BAS system? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, the BAS system. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you.  And just to conclude on that score, this 
may well be…[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you conclude, you say it will be difficult with municipalities? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just difficult meaning you need more time in order to achieve or it 
will be impossible? 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 18 of 63 
 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  It will not be impossible, it will mean we will 
have to engage all 250 plus municipalities, because they are not on the same 
system, and so that includes state owned companies, it is going to be difficult for 
state owned companies, but however, most state owned companies would be better 
structured than most of the challenges that we have in the municipalities.  So 
accumulating such data is not impossible, but we will try all sort of ways to try and 
get the information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that is fine.  Obviously you might be able to produce exact 
figures, but if you ask me if they, what you get is not exact, but is a reasonable 
estimate, I will not complain. 
10 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But obviously if you can get exact that is first price. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you, Chair, and the point is you can churn out 
the information in batches, so the information that is easy and quick to produce you 
can send that to us and the ones that are difficult, on which you may well have to do 
reasonable estimates can be brought in later. 
 
We are under tight control and tight timelines.  We would like to have that 
information fairly quickly.  You had indicated that there were some adverse financial 
20 
and micro economic consequences flowing from the so called nenegate and you 
deal with those consequences in paragraph 4 of your statement at page 47. 
 
Can we get to it?  Because you seem to suggest that you have reflected 
on those consequences and you have done some additional research through those 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 19 of 63 
 
who report to you.  Can I start here?  We know that, that week began on 7 
December, Monday, 2015, correct? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  During that week as far as you are aware, was 
National Treasury aware of any possible dismissal of Minister Nene, including 
yourself, in other words, did you have any idea or suspicion that Minister Nene might 
well be removed from office? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  I had only became aware on the Tuesday, 
8 December, through an article that I read on Independent Online that was forwarded 
by one of the colleagues in the Treasury and in that article, a newspaper online 
10 
article it was indicated that a Minister Nene might be replaced by Minister van 
Rooyen. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, but that is gossip?  All I am trying to establish 
from you is was there any official communication conveyed to you about the possible 
removal of Mr Nene, yes or no as far as you know? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  No, there was no official communication. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  So when you began that Monday and when you 
went to Cabinet on 9 December it was business as usual? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, it was business as usual. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And then we already know that there was some 
20 
speculation around the 8th of Minister Nene's possible removal and that speculation 
became real on 9 December, correct? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  And you say in paragraph 4 that there were 
serious adverse consequences flowing from the removal of Minister Nene and I 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 20 of 63 
 
would like you to get there and explain to us in your own words what those 
consequences were? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  There was indeed what I term as a 
catastrophic fall of the Rand at the time and the impact was that we saw about 
148 000 jobs lost in terms of the model that we ran.  We saw a reduction of about 
378 billion Rand in the JSE market capitalisation and we also saw, the cost impact to 
at least 1.1% of GDP by the end of that year 2017. 
 
That for me are the three variables that we looked at in the model that I 
requested my teams, economic policy team in the Treasury to run for me. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  And can we be clear, because people like us 
10 
who do not understand the quantification of that impact, may assume that for 
instance the 148 000 jobs that were lost, would have been lost as a result of that 
event on that day, but your model does not suggest that as I understand it?  You look 
at that significant event over a period around which you calculate the effect, correct? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Correct, correct, ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And can you indicate to us what was the period that 
you nominated for that calculation and quantification? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  We nominated the period from the 
announcement of Mr Nene's you know existing from the system until the 
replacement when before the Asian markets open on that Sunday, until around 
20 
Sunday, so that was a period, but however, the impact would have carried through 
costs. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Obviously that ran through and the impact 
would have been felt throughout. 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 21 of 63 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Effectively the impact of which one can say 
lasted for a longer, much longer period than the three days that, you know Minister 
Nene was replaced. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Ja, so the impact is much longer, it is not just 
because of one day. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, and I understand that and I want to see the 
extrapolation what is the longer period for that effect around which you made the 
calculation. 
10 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Look in terms of the impact that we saw and 
the as you say, Chair, the – one can say, you know I do not have the exact date time 
lines, but it is the impact that we saw much later and one can even say the impact 
can be even felt by now.  I do not think that we were able ever to recover in a way 
that we had lost the market recapitalisation of about 370 billion.  The JSE has never 
recovered to that level.  So the impact we are still experiencing to date. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I understand that, but for the purposes of you 
calculation you used metrics such as quarter period, Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4.  Sometimes 
you use a financial year.  Sometimes you use a six month period.  I just want to 
understand whether the calculation relates to the whole financial year after 
20 
December 2015 or it related to a quarter or six months thereafter? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  One can say, Chair, it is the period – in terms 
of the numbers that I have, because the high frequency data that we have one can 
see that the impact in 2015 recovering was only started being recognised and 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 22 of 63 
 
noticed around 2016 in quarter 2 of 2016, that is when recovery starting being 
experienced and realised. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So on a straight line calculation it will be about a 
period of six months more or less? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Of six months, it could be, yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Then you indicate that there was a reduction of 
the JSE capital value of 378 billion Rand and then you say that GDP shrunk by 
1.1%, correct? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, sir. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  There are of course other micro economic adverse 
10 
consequences which flowed from this and Minister Gordhan and also Mr Fuzile did 
talk about them, because they say that ordinary members such as ourselves do not 
appreciate it until we feel it at the counters of the supermarkets.  The cost of living 
would rise as a result of these adverse micro economic consequences. 
 
Do you have any comment to make in that regard? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, I do have a comment.  Business 
confidence were at its lowest as we approached January of that year and that is why 
Minister Gordhan in his statement would have indicated that there was clearly a 
need to rally around each other as a country and various sectors of the economy, 
business labour and government and the first such engagement was around 23 
20 
January when business came together with government and after the DAVOS 
meeting CO's came at very short notice to meet and by March we had had a plan to 
do something about it, because if business confidence at its lowest it means then 
that there is an impact on investor sentiment and you would not see any new 
investments coming through and that is why in March of that year we went on a very, 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 23 of 63 
 
call it intensive road show with business labour and government as a block.  We 
went to the US, we went to Europe to explain that the fundamentals are still in place 
and that South Africa is still open for business, and it was a very difficult 
conversation in March 2016 that we had with this global investors, because we had 
seen the impact and we were not recovering at all in terms of what they saw as 
clearly the challenge that South Africa was experiencing at the time. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, one thing that I would like you to comment on as 
part and parcel of this adverse consequence and I am not to sure if it was covered 
by both Minister Gordhan and Mr Fuzile.  Relates to whether or not these 
consequences might impact on the cost of our country's ability to service its 
10 
sovereign debt?  By that I mean would the depreciation of the currency as a result of 
these things impact on your cost of servicing the debt which our country incurs? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  The cost of servicing debt would certainly rise 
when the country is faced with such environmental situation.  By just the movement 
in the Rand as an example, because the, you know, we have to service our debt, our 
debt to GDP is packed to a certain exchange rate assumption and once that 
changes then clearly there is impact. 
 
Now we go and Mr Fuzile did correctly indicate that at the time we were 
going to – into the market on a weekly basis and raise anything between 9 and 14 
billion Rand.  Now if at the level of you – the performance of the economy are not 
20 
doing well and you are too risky as – you know – as a potential client to investors or 
people who actually lend you money…[intervenes] 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  The money will be more expensive.  In simple 
terms I normally explain to people that if you have to buy a car and or you want to 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 24 of 63 
 
get a home loan and you are listed at the credit bureau.  Some lenders will still say 
at least we have a job, but they will give it to you at prime, maybe even prime +5%, 
because you are risky.  And if you are okay they will even go and give you prime less 
2% if you have got a stable job and your ability to pay is not questionable. 
 
Now if the country's situation is such that the performance of the country, 
performance of the economy is not at the level where we will give comfort to people 
who lend us money, then it becomes very expensive and that translates therefore 
into your debt rising, because you borrow at very high rates, including again the cost 
of servicing your debt and that is then your debt, debt service cost increases to 
levels that will be difficult to manage as time goes on. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, thank you for that.  Lastly on that issue.  If you 
have a modelling exercise which you may have done to quantify the effects of this 
nenegate on the country's ability to service its debt that will be useful and you can 
use the indicators such as – but – we borrow our money in foreign currency and yet 
our revenue is raised in terms of the local currency, and so the local currency goes 
down obviously the repayment is going to be higher by that fact alone. 
 
But if our creditors would have said look you are risky and therefore we 
would want to protect ourselves and they make calculations that impact on our ability 
you can do so.  So what we are interested in are the figures.  If you have them we 
would be grateful for that exercise. 
20 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes we will certainly make them available. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You then talk about the events of 11 December from 
paragraph 5 of your statement on page 47.  You talk about a meeting with Minister 
van Rooyen that was scheduled to begin at 11:00 that morning.  How did you get to 
know about that meeting yourself? 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 25 of 63 
 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  We got notification from the office of the DG, 
DG Fuzile, at the time that there would be meeting at 11:00 to meet with the new 
Minister and this notice was sent to all Deputy Director Generals. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you received one of them, you received that 
notice? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, I did receive the notice. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And so you were ready for the meeting? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  I was ready for the meeting, yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And then what happened when 11:00 struck? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  We waited, we were in the big board room.  
10 
Sorry DG's board room as you call it, you know, DG's board room on the second 
floor, 40 Church Square and then as usual, you now we were all excited that we are 
going to see or meet the new Minister. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  When you say we, who were there to the best of your 
recollection? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  There were a number of colleagues. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Who were there? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  The DDG's I do not have a list of colleagues 
who were there, but there were a number of colleagues who were DDG's and some 
who were representing the office of the DDG's because most people were on leave 
20 
as it was around 11 December, so most people were on leave, so there could have 
been a sizeable number of colleagues, I remember a few, Mr Monale was in the 
meeting, Whendiphane was in the meeting, Mr Momaniat came late and a few 
others. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Mr Sachs was he there? 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 26 of 63 
 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Mr Sachs was not in the meeting he was on 
leave. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay.  What, so you were waiting in excitement for 
the new Minister, what happened thereafter? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  As we were waiting the new Minister walked in 
with two gentlemen that I did not know.  I have never met before, I was meeting them 
for the first time and shortly as soon as they walked in then they were followed by Mr 
Fuzile and we all sat down waiting for the meeting to start. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  It is now the evidence before the Chairperson 
that those two gentlemen who walked with the Minister were Mr Mohammed Bobart 
10 
and Mr Ian Whitley.  You yourself did not know them? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, I did not know them. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Had you met them before? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  I have never met them before, I was seeing 
them for the first time. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Had you heard about the name Mohammed Bobart 
and the name Ian Whitley before? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Not at all, I was hearing about them for the 
first time. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, alright, and you say in paragraph 7 that before 
20 
that meeting you had been busy with a media statement? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes sir. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay, and you indicate that, that media statement, let 
me not lead you, let me ask you, how did it come about that you were engaged in 
that media statement? 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 27 of 63 
 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  I was engaged to the media statement 
because of the situation at the time, the Rand was taking a beating.  The narrative in 
the public was very negative and I was worried that we are quiet as a National 
Treasury.  The Presidency is quiet in terms of what happened, because at the time I 
had developed a very good working relationship when I was Chief of Staff when the 
head of the office of the President, Ms Lakela Kaunda, I was in touch with her on the 
days after Mr van Rooyen was announced as the new Minister.  Actually I called her 
on Thursday at the early morning after the announcement, because we had a very 
close relationship, close working relationship when she sent me a message and say 
you know we did not see this coming and I said you know it is tough but we have to 
10 
stand firm, but as the time goes by the office of the President was quiet.  And the 
Treasury and I could imagine Mr Fuzile was busy with, you know, as he said what he 
was busy with on Thursday the swearing in ceremonies etcetera, so we then agreed 
with Ms Lakela Kaunda that I think it is better that we issue the statement to calm the 
markets to explain, because we had accepted that Mr van Rooyen was going to be 
the Minister of finance…[intervenes] 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  So we realised that the best is to at least calm 
the markets and indicate to the markets and everyone who wishes to listen that 
South Africa is still keeping the fundamentals in place and those fundamentals that I 
20 
was talking about are captured in the draft statement that I sent to Ms Lakela that 
day. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, the point of the inquiry is this, did you take it 
upon yourself together with Ms Kaunda to formulate a statement or did someone 
within the National Executive as you to do so? 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 28 of 63 
 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  There was no one at the National Executive I 
was engaged with at the time, because it was a freefall in terms of the governance of 
the economy.  I as, knowing the impact as a responsible national treasury official and 
obviously talking amongst some of my colleagues who I was waiting for inputs and 
Mr Fuzile as you can imagine I was not in touch with him…[intervenes] 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  At the time, because I did not see him actually 
on Thursday. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  I only saw him on Friday morning. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  And so as a result I did it upon myself in 
relation I mean in connection with the office of the President, Ms Kaunda, to make 
sure at lest we calm the markets, because I knew the impact of calming that 
markets. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  You heard yesterday I did cover and canvas 
with Mr Fuzile about the fact that it was a crisis moment which was unfolding right in 
front of his eyes and that there was a need for critical leadership intervention and yet 
there was none.  You took it upon yourself to try and solicit some intervention in 
order to address that crises? 
20 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, I did, I did take it upon myself. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you say so, because of your sense of 
responsibility? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes sir. 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 29 of 63 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay.  Look at – I am going to jump all over like a cat 
on hot bricks if you do not mind, look at the statement which is at page 52 and we 
will get to its contents in a moment, but page 51 is an email, do you see that? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes sir. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Where does it come from? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  It is an email coming from me and I am 
sending it to Lakela and I have copied Phumela Williams and Nebo Hoo, both of 
them were at GCIS at the time. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you will see that it was sent on Friday the very 
day that you had a meeting and it was sent at almost an hour after the scheduled 
10 
commencement time of the meeting, 11:58, do you see that? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  It is 11:41. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  11:41? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  And 58 seconds. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I am sorry, you sent it at 11:41, okay, so you must 
have sent it sometime after the meeting? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, I did send it after the meeting, because 
at the meeting itself I was having my laptop with me and I was busy writing the 
statement when the meeting was taking place with Mr van Rooyen. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So you had divided attention? 
20 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  I was more interested in calming the markets, 
because I could see that with that meeting we were not going anywhere. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  And that is dexprerity pa excelace but in any 
way let us look at your statement.  It is at page 52, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page? 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 30 of 63 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  52. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You indicate that it is a draft statement, correct? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, it was a draft statement. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, it has not been issued to the media houses? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Not at all at this time, no. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  And then in the first unnumbered paragraph of 
that statement you record a historical fact, do you see that? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes sir. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But then you raise in the last sentence of that 
10 
paragraph policy questions and you say, let me quote, so that we are on the same 
wave length: 
"Our fiscal policy continuous to anchor on the principles of 
counter cyclicality, debt sustainability and intergenerational 
fairness." 
 
I mean these are big phrases.  I am not going to ask you to decode them 
for us, but it seems to me that these are major policy issues.  Why did you consider it 
necessary to incorporate these fundamental policy principles in your statement or 
draft statement? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  I decided to put these three basic policy 
20 
principles, because in the budget of that year the February budget, and confirmed in 
the medium budget policy statement of that year we wanted to – and this was what 
was at the pillar of what we represented and that was the storyline of our budget that 
counter cyclicality will be what we want to do, meaning when the economy is not 
doing well we will have to come in.  We are going to approach our debt sustainably, 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 31 of 63 
 
we are not going to borrow to a point where it actually impacts us negatively and we 
are with inter generational fairness we are saying that we were not going to, you 
know, burden future generations in terms of our fiscal policy. 
 
Now the narrative at the time this is what we were punting out there to 
investors and to South Africans around what our fiscal policy stance, so that 
departure of a statement like that would have made sure that South Africa has not 
deviated from maintaining these. 
 
Why am I saying debt sustainability?  The issue at the time as Mr Fuzile 
indicated was around nuclear financing.  The issue was around higher education 
challenges that we saw manifesting themselves two/three years later. 
10 
 
So by saying that we are going to maintain this, effectively we would have 
calmed people down that thought we are going to go, you know, we are going to 
break this policy framework that we had set for ourselves.  So by putting it up, right 
there is paragraph 1 that was the intention to calm that view out there, that was 
already suggesting that we are not going to respect what we said in the budget of 
that year. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Chair, you would recall that Minister Gordhan 
said at that point in time the estimate for the nuclear procurement would be in the 
order of one trillion Rand, and yet the revenues expected for that financial year 
would be in the order of 800 billion, so there would essentially be a shortfall and that 
20 
would mean that your debt would rise and therefore you would not be able to 
manage it and then as you borrow more and more of course you would ultimately not 
be able to raise debt, and you will be left with one and one source and that is the 
IMF that will come with its own structural adjustment conditionalities as you know 
them. 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 32 of 63 
 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes sir. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Anyway, I am going to skip paragraph 2 that is the 
unnumbered paragraph 2, unless you want to comment on it? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Paragraph 2 is important, because 
expenditure ceiling is what has defined South Africa's policy, physical policy stance 
to date, and meaning the ceiling that you had set the medium term budget policy 
statement.  It is actually confirming what you have just indicated as part of the cost 
that was going to be on us if you were going to embark on a nuclear financing 
arrangement, which would have costed us in excesses of a trillion at the time. 
 
So by saying that we would adhere to the expenditure ceiling while 
10 
maintaining a trajectory on our debt portfolio, meaning that we are not going to 
borrow any extra cent to finance nuclear or any other expenditure which may be 
unsustainable.  And that is why I am saying that as set out in the 2015 budget. 
 
So the two paragraphs basically, you know confirms each other. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We heard figures from Minister Gordhan about the 
debt ceiling at the point in time.  Are you able to tell us from your own knowledge 
what was the debt ceiling at that point in time? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  I do not want to – I do not have the figures 
with me, I would not want to get into that, but we had a ceiling. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay.  I am going to skip the third unnumbered 
20 
paragraph unless you want to comment on it, in case I overlook its importance.  Is 
there anything you want to comment? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  On paragraph? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The paragraph that follow?  The one that is the third 
from the top? 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 33 of 63 
 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  No, I am okay with it, I am okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But I would like to deal with the one that follows 
thereafter, because you make either a prediction or a factual assumption, and there 
you say and let me read it so that we are at one: 
"Minister van Rooyen will not abandon the fiscal path that 
we have chosen in the last few years.  He will strengthen the 
path and continue to support all efforts to improve the lives 
of ordinary South Africans." 
 
Do you see that? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, what I have learned to understand in my 
10 
years in the Treasury even up to that point, when you put something like this out in 
public it gives the market confidence and in a way for me where I was seated, Chair, 
I was fighting my own battles, if you can imagine, in terms of what Mr Fuzile said. 
 
When I say fighting my own battles, meaning I wanted to contribute in a 
particular way in stabilizing the situation now.  In here I am now binding whether I 
like it or not, a Minister who is imposed on us in the way that he came, I am then 
binding with this draft that he will come, if he wants to abandon he would have 
committed himself or the Presidency would have committed themselves on this, 
which I know was correct and true by the way in terms of what we said in the budget. 
 
So by saying that he would not abandon the fiscal path that we have 
20 
chosen in the last few years, it means indirectly we will then force Minister van 
Rooyen to not deviate from what we have said and there will be a statement coming 
from the President to confirm that he cannot – for me it was a strategic move and a 
strategic, you know, point that I was putting upfront to ensure that we actually, you 
know maintain the fiscal discipline and ceiling that we had aspired to. 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 34 of 63 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thanks for that.  That is your sense of responsibility, 
but on the facts you had not yet spoken to Minister van Rooyen, correct? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, no, not at all, not at all. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You had not spoken to anyone who at that point in 
time would lawfully be entitled to speak on his behalf? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you were including in the statement what you believed would 
continue as the government's position at the time? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, correct, Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words in your own mind you could not imagine that there 
10 
would be a departure on that aspect? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  It was not only imagining, Chair, but I wanted 
to that there should not be a departure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but what I am saying apart from your subjective desires. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of what you understood government to be likely to do and 
not to be likely to do, it was something you did not think government would do to 
depart from that? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, at that point I did not think government 
would do that, ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You expected a Minister who is appointed by the President who 
has been around for the past few years to continue on that part of the policy? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  I wanted exactly that, Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright, thank you. 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 35 of 63 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you, Chair.  We have now confirmed that you 
had not yet spoken to the Minister and you expected that he would not change these 
policy positions which is fair of course, but the point is this, that Mr Fuzile said that 
immediately after his inauguration Minister van Rooyen took out a piece of paper 
and I do not want to undermine the status of what he took out, but he described it as 
a piece of paper, and he read something from it, and that was his inaugural speech 
which is now on the websites, did you have a look at that speech? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  This speech was on Thursday at the – I was 
not there and I have not seen him, I have not interacted with him at all, I did not 
know, you know his speech, I did not contribute to his speech. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, I understand, but did you subsequently read it 
from the website or you had not read it at all? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  I had not read it at all at this time.  I had not 
read it – you know, Chair it was very painful – for me in particular it was a very 
painful period having been at the Treasury for years and so I had two options on the 
Thursday and for me it was, I had switched myself off from what was happening, just 
because of sadness of what we were doing to ourselves and at a later stage 
obviously when you engage on other matters it will come through, because my pain 
started that Monday, it did not start on Friday, Thursday or Friday. 
 
So by Thursday I had completely switched off, I did not even listen to, you 
20 
know even watch on TV the swearing in ceremony.  I completely just taken a – I was 
too angry to watch TV that Thursday. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Ja, I know it is events of the past, but take us along in 
that pain and the painful moments you experienced, because we have not yet 
received evidence of a witness who speaks in personal emotive terms around that 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 36 of 63 
 
event and you make a very interesting observation.  And if you can take us through it 
and give us more information it will be useful.  You say that you were saddened by 
what, and I paraphrase what we were doing to ourselves.  I would like you if you can 
and if you feel comfortable jus to take us through that emotional journey and indicate 
what is it so painful that we were doing to ourselves? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, Mr Maleka, I am happy that you have asked that question, 
because I have read your statement DG and you have just made the point that there 
are – there are certain things that happened from Monday or that you got to know 
from Monday and I am as keen as Mr Maleka is just to hear about that pain that you 
are talking about. 
10 
 
Yes.  Thank you. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Chair, thank you very much.  I would not give 
further details expect to mention and if Commission so feels I will be more than 
happy to assist the Commission to get into more details, but what I mean about the 
pain is that I was at the meeting on Monday afternoon when the 
Treasury…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Monday before the 9th? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  The 9th. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The 9th was a Monday? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  No, no, the 9th was a Wednesday, the 7th was the 
20 
Monday. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  The 7th. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Monday the 7th. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Monday the 7th. 
CHAIRPERSON:  December 2015? 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 37 of 63 
 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  2015.  In the afternoon I was at a meeting 
where as tradition DDG Michael Sachs, myself responsible for public finance, 
Michael was responsible for budget office and Mr Fuzile as the DG including Mr 
Nene as Minister, we went to brief the President on the budget, because we were 
going to Cabinet on Wednesday the 9th. 
 
So I am saying that it was painful in that there was that meeting, which 
was a normal meeting where we were you know just presenting the budget to the 
President and explaining, because the budget is not one event it is a process, so we 
are explaining the allocations and how we got to them and the tone of that meeting 
was so cordial that you know, we were engaged as to how can we improve this 
10 
moving forward. 
 
I left that meeting a very positive South African and public official and I 
was happy and I was even telling Mr Fuzile and Mr Sachs, you know, we had a very 
good meeting, because it was very constructive in terms of things – you know it is a 
close space with the President, you know, really appreciate in terms of suggesting 
things openly, you know, around allocations and also around, you know the wastage 
that we see, so that as President you would be aware and he would give guidance in 
terms of future processes that we should engage on, on how we have to set 
priorities, how we have to find expression in the Cabinet Legotla processes and also 
find expression in the ANC government, ANC the party aspirations, because then 
20 
they will be translated into government. 
 
So it is on that basis that I say that it was a very nice, good meeting, and I 
left on that note on Monday.  Tuesday I was also at another meeting at the same 
time almost at the same venue at the President's residence at what then we know 
later as a nuclear meeting, the NNEC meeting, the National Nuclear Energy Sub-
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 38 of 63 
 
committee of Cabinet, that committee, that long name.  I was in that meeting and 
you know the interactions in that meeting pained me. 
 
The feeling that I had the previous day was gone in terms of how the 
meeting ended up and in how I think at the time, you know the meeting went about.  
I was also at a meeting on the following day on a Wednesday in Cabinet when we 
presented our budget and the way we presented out budget and the way Cabinet 
including everyone in the room interacted with the budget and subsequent to that 
then the Cabinet meeting ends and then I go home. 
 
And as I am driving then I get a call from somebody in the President's 
office, because of the relationship that I indicated, it was not from Ms Lakela Kaunda 
10 
per say, but as Chief of Staff I interacted very closely in the previous term Minister 
Gordhan between 2010 and 2014.  I got a call and they were looking for Minister 
Nene.  I said look, why are you calling me, I am not Chief of Staff, he has got a Chief 
of Staff. 
 
This gentleman said no, but you were with him just now.  I said no, I am – 
I have left and he also left.  So then I called him and said look you are being called 
by the President.  This was after the Cabinet meeting.  So now I am saying Monday, 
Tuesday, Wednesday and then what we then came to know later in the evening 
around after 20:00 when it was announced that Minister Nene has been – you know, 
has been fired, basically. 
20 
 
So it is now – and when you take that into Thursday now where I say I did 
not even want to watch TV, I am now tracing back the three days and what I felt in 
the three days and why, and the call we got and the message that you know we 
exchanged amongst each other that evening that said the axe has, you know, fallen. 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 39 of 63 
 
 
So for me it was to painful to say, you know, it cannot be as an important 
institution like the Treasury our own system would have interacted with us like that.  
So it was a – that is why I am saying it was a very painful – that is why I am saying if 
at a later stage and I would prefer, Chair, that I leave it at that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  For me that is what I meant. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Well if I may press you a bit and I am not reviving 
your pain, what do you think should have happened in order to avoid or lessen the 
pain that you had experienced in the normal ordinary responsible way of doing 
government's business?  And by that I mean Treasury's responsibility including the 
10 
executive line function of the Minister?  What would you have had expected to 
happen so as to avoid or lessen the pain? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Chair, I do not get it, is it during or after? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Take any moment in regard to the time and frame of 
reference of the painful moment that you have talked about.  For that pain not to 
arise or if it arose for it not to become as severe as you discuss, what are the things 
that you would have expected to happen differently? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  I think, the first, the first thing that one 
expected we should not have – firstly Minister Nene should not have been fired.  So 
there would not have been any pain. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Because where I was seated I did not get the 
justification as to why Minister Nene should have – was supposed to have been 
fired.  Even today when I look back I do not clearly see the reason.  Even after Mr 
Fuzile tried to go into after in a way that we would have expected things to be 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 40 of 63 
 
because when Minister Trevor Manuel left the Treasury and Minister Gordhan came 
there was a process, a handover, a very process that tells you there is no crisis. 
 
When Minister Nene came onboard and Minister Gordhan was shifted to 
COGTA again there was a process.  Now Minister Nene comes and after a few 
months, 18 months or so I am not sure of the time period.  You can confirm that 
Minister Van Rooyen comes and there is no – there is no handover proper. 
 
It should have been done differently in a way that you know the tradition 
there is that the collective of the Treasury is called to what we call the Banking Hall.  
The outgoing Minister gives a speech.  The incoming Minister gives a speech. 
 
It then tells you that and it also tells the staff, the 1000 plus staff of the 
10 
National Treasury, that there is no crisis here, things are okay but we did not see any 
of that even after when Minister Van Rooyen came onboard. 
 
That is why I am saying it could have been done differently and I would 
have certainly go back to tradition in terms of what possible and proper handover is 
all about. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you for that.  Chair, I think I have covered the 
issue unless you have further questions on that issue? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no that is fine.  I am going to do today this afternoon 
what I did I think what is it yesterday? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will take a very short adjournment.  On my watch it is 21 
minutes past.  We will resume at half past. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you, Chair. 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 41 of 63 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
HEARING ADJOURNS 
HEARING RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may continue. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you, Chair.  Mr Mogajane we are at paragraph 
eight of your statement and there you describe what happened after the Minister 
entered the DG’s boardroom.  Can I invite you to tell us what unfolded thereafter? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Thank you.  The Minister walked into the 
meeting and greeted us in a very colloquial manner saying I just wanted to say hi, hi, 
hi to all of you.  He must have said that three or four times and then he said or he sat 
10 
down and then as he was sitting down as I say that I mean I say I have worked with 
Mr Fuzile because remember we do not know now what happened before. 
 
We are seeing him for the first time and I could see that Mr Fuzile was in a 
very sombre mind, I mean you know state of mind and I could see his face was not 
how I used to because I know him very well.  I had worked with him since I joined the 
Treasury in 1999 and I could tell through his demeanour that he was reserved and 
he was very tense and then so because we all were looking up to him I think that 
immediately just made the meeting room to be tense and so as soon as he sat down 
after saying hi, hi, hi then he started trying to engage already. 
 
You know I just wanted to say hi to you and you know and tell you that this 
20 
place is going to change.  Things are going to change around here and things are 
not going to be the same.  You know that language.  We are going to be accessible 
to rural people and rural areas. 
 
You know and now at this time as he was trying to go on this must have 
been say for a minute or half a minute or so, one and half a minute Mr Momoniat 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 42 of 63 
 
walks in.  Mr Momoniat was also on leave on the day but because he lives in 
Johannesburg he was able to drive through to actually try and make the meeting. 
 
Now Mr Momoniat you know we know him.  I mean he is a very simple 
person and he walks in.  He sees all of us.  He starts joking and say oh, no welcome 
Minister.  Welcome to the Treasury.  You know now you are on our side.  You are not 
on the other side meaning he was the member of the Standing Committee on 
Finance and they would have dealt with various pieces of legislation at the time, the 
Twin Peaks Legislation and other pieces of legislation and then Mr Momoniat soon 
realised that you know we are not going to smile and be happy and jolly as he was. 
 
So I think as soon as he looked at the meeting room and how tense we 
10 
were all he then decided to quietly sit down and let Mr Van Rooyen you know 
continue with what he was trying to do. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  So that is what happened the first few 
minutes, say three minutes of his talk around what he was – at that point Chair it was 
you know Mr Fuzile said but you already need – why do you not try and know the 
people here?  
 
At least you know, know the people here or even introduce.  That is when 
[missing audio] and then he is going to be my Chief of Staff and Mohamed said no, 
no, no.  You did this.  No, no, no I am advisor.  Then he looked at ja of course this is 
20 
Mr Ian Whitley.  He is going to be my Chief of Staff. 
 
So it was clear that you know for me...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Mogajane.  Some of the things that non lawyers 
might not appreciate are important.  As you were giving your evidence as to how – 
as to what Mr Van Rooyen said you were making gestures when you were telling us 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 43 of 63 
 
and you must just confirm if what I am saying is right because I want it to go into the 
record. 
 
When you were telling us what he said when he looked to his left but I 
think you looked to your right – to his left where Mr Bobat was as I understand your 
statement. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You stretched your hand and to point to the person that he was 
speaking to.  Is that what he was doing or is that just what you are doing to express 
what you understood but not necessarily what he was doing? 
 
Did he point him like that and I think at some stage when you were 
10 
indicating Mr Bobat's response you said when he said no, no, no you were moving 
your hand from right to left and left to right in front of your face. 
 
Is that what Mr Bobat was doing gesturing as he was saying no, no, no or 
is it something that you are just using to express yourself? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Chair, you are correct.  Mr Bobat was 
gesturing.  He was – firstly Minister Van Rooyen was gesturing in this case to his left 
yes and saying pointing as he was busy trying to reconnect or recollect his name 
and saying this is – he was pointing at Mr Bobat and the same Chair when Mr Bobat 
was responding he was waving his fingers and no, no, no.  Meaning correcting him 
but waving his finger and saying...[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Waving his pointing finger? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Just as I am pointing it out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes as you are doing. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Not to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 44 of 63 
 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  You know just...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  In front of Mr Bobat's face just to express...[intervenes] 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes just in front of his face. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Saying no, no, no.  It could have been a finger 
or a hand but he was...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  You could see he was saying no, no, no it 
is...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  It is Advisor not Chief of Staff. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you.  So but I summarised it correctly? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes you summarised it correctly and as he 
was pointing to Mr Whitley same thing.  He was...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  He was then pointing to him and this is Ian 
Whitley. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  And he is going to be the Chief of Staff. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, thank you.  I interrupted you but I wanted that to be recorded.  
20 
It has got some significance. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For lawyers. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair, I am grateful for placing on record the replay of 
the audio visual seen of that moment.  I am interested in whether Mr Whitley said 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 45 of 63 
 
anything when he was introduced as the Chief of Staff by the Minister?  Did he or did 
he not say anything? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Mr Whitley did not say anything. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay and what happened after the Minister 
introduced the two individuals? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  The DG then requested that he then wants to 
introduce his team and he slowly introduced each one of us indicating our names 
and the roles that we play in the Treasury including those that were in acting 
capacity on the day indicating who the original or the DGD is and who is not there 
and he was taking his time obviously. 
10 
 
I think you know looking back he was then trying to prove to 
Mr Van Rooyen – Minister Van Rooyen at the time that I know my people and I can 
introduce them.  It came out very clear to me at the time. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that was about how many people that from Treasury more or 
less who were there? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  More or less nine, 10, 11.  I mean we can with 
the names because there are 10 divisions in the National Treasury so it could have 
been around the same number. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  You know with Mr Momoniat coming in 
because I could have explained that someone who was acting on his behalf would 
have been in the meeting but around 10, 11, 12. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  But we have got a list of the names that were, 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 46 of 63 
 
people who were there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  So the DG did the introductions name by name, 
office by office and then he completed the introduction, correct? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  There is some conclusions that the DG shared with 
us about how the introduction if any by the Minister unfolded and I am not going to 
explain to you what those conclusions are but what I would like you to do for us if 
you can is to tell us that whether you too drew some conclusions about the way the 
introduction from the Minister's side took place. 
10 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Look I think from where he is seated, I was 
seated it was clear that I was seeing obviously Mr Van Rooyen that week for the first 
time on the day and I was experiencing the two gentlemen who were with him the 
first time. 
 
But the gestures that he was making referring – when he was trying to get 
his name really kind of gave me an indication that he may not know them and he 
was – his body language also suggested that he is not comfortable in the way he 
was going about in the meeting and the conclusion therefore that I am drawing is 
that you know having interacted with Ministers before and also having been a Chief 
of Staff before and the relation that I could see in that room clearly you know made 
20 
me realise that he may not be you know very familiar with the colleagues that he was 
with on the day and the only observation that I can make and draw from is the 
introduction because if I expected that he would have explained in detail his Chief of 
Staff, where he was from, what he is doing and how he is coming, what his 
qualification is, how he is going to be of value to the Treasury. 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 47 of 63 
 
 
He would have done the same with the Advisor.  He would have said this 
is my Advisor.  His background is X.  He is coming from, his qualifications.  He is an 
economist or he is an accountant, whatever because I know in instances when I was 
Chief of Staff, Chair, to Minister Pravin Gordhan when we had gotten one or two 
people to assist as advisors or as short term consultants I would take the pain of one 
as Chief of Staff understanding who they are and you know and then would call the 
collective of the Treasury and saying look we have asked so and so to come and you 
know he is going to assist us in the capacity as an Advisor to Minister Gordhan. 
 
He is so and so.  His qualifications, he is going to focus on this area 
etcetera.  Now none of that happened and I had experienced two Advisors that 
10 
Minister Gordhan appointed in his first term when he was you know and that is how 
we introduced them. 
 
So and I did not see this happening so again the conclusion suggest that 
if Minister was not confident to introduce the two colleagues in a way that he did then 
that means he did not know them. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you deal with the point and I am going to jump 
some few paragraphs of your statement but just to locate your conclusion.  You deal 
with it at page 50, paragraph 15, and there you say a little more than what you had 
just said about the relationship between a Minister and his or her Chief of Staff.  Now 
can you elaborate a bit? 
20 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  I had a relationship with Minister Gordhan, not 
very close, in the early days when I was a student – in fact when I was a staff 
member at the University of Durban Westville in the 80's and 90's.  
 
Minster Gordhan was a member of the Convex, Convocation Executive of 
the University.  Now if you know that university you would know that we would not go 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 48 of 63 
 
a year without issues.  We would enjoy around August of every year we would just 
have a nice and it was like that and we would then either a university assembly 
would be called and issues would be dealt with or students would have trashed the 
administration of the university but things would be so. 
 
Now how we resolved issues at the time because a struggle as students it 
was around council representation and all those issues and I was also in the student 
activists movement.  I was active in that, you know though I was never an SRC 
member person. 
 
So Minister Gordhan would come as Convex because the collective of the 
university so I always admired how issues would have been dealt with and he kind of 
10 
just knew me then.  Later when I joined the Treasury after 1999 and in the later 
years 2000 he was then at SARS. 
 
So we would have crossed paths one way or the other so he had an idea 
from when I was still at maybe Durban Westville he saw me around in the Treasury.  
In 2009 I was still in Washington at the time representing South Africa at the World 
Bank and then I had indicated to some colleagues that hey, you know I am okay with 
America.  I am fine.  Like I want to go home and just you know and then so someone 
whispered...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am okay not in the sense that you wanted to stay there forever. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, I want to come back home. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay in the sense that you have had enough. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Not had enough.  Not had enough.  I was – 
Minister Trevor Manuel took me out for lunch one day in Spain on the 23rd of June 
2006.  He sat with me and he said I want you to go to Washington and I want you to 
do the following. 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 49 of 63 
 
 
One key thing that he asked me he says look we have a relationship.  We 
are going to have a challenge with Eskom.  We have a relationship.  Eskom will soon 
run into trouble.  We have to understand the World Bank and at some point we will 
have to get money from them. 
 
So when I left the World Bank I had done my – the $3.57 billlion was in 
the kitty and when I say I was done meaning my mission was complete as a 
secondee of the Treasury to the World Bank system to navigate that.  So I had 
indicated to some colleagues and say I am, you know, I think maybe next year 
whenever I will come home, but August 2009 when I was home for holiday 
because around that time is holiday and I was going to greet my Minister for the 
10 
first time because he started in May, formally so.  I went to his office and he says 
"hey, you know what someone told me you want to come back home I want you to 
come and work with me."  I tried to argue and said "no, Minister."  You know he 
said "no, no, no", he again convinced me in October of that year in Turkey when 
we met again and by December I had decided with my family that we will go back 
to South Africa.  It is the relationship that I was talking about Chair that I say he 
understood, he knew me, he understood that I was in the Treasury from the 90's 
and understand how Treasury functions.  I was in various divisions in the 
Treasury, I understood the work.  So when I come back to be his chief of staff he 
knows my background, he knows what I am capable of and it is on those bases 
20 
Chair that I say the relationship between the chief of staff and the Minister is quite 
important because I will know what it is all about and he will know what I can do 
and as I say it is an intimate relationship of trust and shared values generally built 
over a long period of time.  So it was not surprising for the Treasury when I come 
back in 2010 to become chief of staff to Minister Gordhan and how then that was 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 50 of 63 
 
accepted and how, what role I understood because I was clearly a bridge 
between, and I understood the dynamics, in paragraph 15, I understood the 
dynamics of the department and I understood what is expected of the Minister's 
office, because I had interacted with that office long – from '99 onwards in various 
capacities.  So in that way my point is here are two colleagues who are not 
introduced to give me the comfort that they understand the dynamics of the 
department.  They understand the work of the Treasury, understanding that Minister 
van Rooyen is new obviously, but I would have expected that Minister van Rooyen 
eases himself into the department just like, at least we had an idea that 
Minister Gordhan was the first after Minister Manuel was there for ten years.  
10 
Minister Gordhan comes in, he did not come in with advisors at all.  He came in 
2009, he came in with administer, people who will understand, you know what he 
likes, what kind of food he eats and he came with such admin people from SARS.  
Who some obviously they were known, but he did not bring any advisor, nor did he 
bring a Chief of Staff. 
 
He brought some senior admin people to assist as he was busy looking.  
His first advisor Mr Voor Kashim was only appointed in 2010 on 5 January around 
that time, but it was January if I remember, because I had formally started as Chief 
of Staff and I knew I interacted with him and again Mr Gordhan called me in and he 
said this is Voor Kashim and we went through the process.  I knew he was an 
20 
economist and it was then easy to introduce him to the collective of the Treasury. 
 
So one expected that as this two new people who are going to come with 
Minister van Rooyen that would have had that kind of introduction which again I say 
it should have been build over time, but again, I cannot attest and put my head on 
the block and say I know that they knew each other or they did not know each other, 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 51 of 63 
 
but what I saw suggested and in the way they were introduced suggested that they 
may not know each other. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  I would like to be quick now and go through the 
concluding parts of the meeting.  You say and I am going to quote the last sentence 
of paragraph 11 and I will ask you to comment on it.  Are you at page 49? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Paragraph 11? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, the last statement reads as follows: 
"I have met all the Finance Ministers since the tenure of 
Minister Manuel and from my observations Minister van 
Rooyen seemed very ill at ease and hesitant as he was 
10 
talking to us." 
 
What do you mean by that? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Here is a country in turmoil from what I 
explained earlier in terms of the impact that what we were experiencing that week in 
South Africa and Minister van Rooyen is not talking to those issues, but instead the 
focus of the meeting is just greeting and saying hi, I came to say hi to you, without 
saying I am appointed and show leadership that are inspected a Minister should 
have shown.  That I expected sitting in the room to say welcome colleagues, thank 
you very much, I am here, let us not get into the details of how I am here, but for the 
fact that I am here, let us work together, one, two, we are in trouble. 
20 
 
Three, how can we address the challenges, because the Rand was taking 
a tumbling, Chair.  So I do not see – I did not get the sense of the authority insofar 
as issues that mattered on that day, but what I saw was the fact that I am coming to 
sort you out.  When he said this place is going to change.  What did he mean by 
saying this place? 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 52 of 63 
 
 
I think he had preconceived views about us and about the collective that 
he was going to engage with and that is why I am saying, you know – secondly for 
the fact that he did not mention issues that were related to what was affecting the 
country on the day. 
 
That suggested to me that he was not at ease or he was hesitant in 
addressing those issues, because the reality is that he could have said maybe I am 
the cause of the issues, because really the economy was taking a beating, because 
of exactly someone who is appointed to the markets did not have an idea of and 
secondly who the market did not respect, and that was demonstrated by the impact 
that the appointment cost. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I do not know whether when you said he could have said I 
am the cause, whether that is because that is what you believe is the position, but 
we know that he did not make or rather we believe that he did not appoint himself he 
was appointed to the position.  And there is nothing that we know that may suggest 
that he was responsible for the removal of his predecessor. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Chair, I agree with you completely, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I guess what you meant was the perceptions that were driving 
the markets to do what they were doing were connected, he was a factor in that, that 
is what you…[intervenes] 
20 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, he was a factor, that is what I am saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you.  So you say in paragraph 12 that the 
meeting lasted for about 20 minutes, is that correct? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  It is correct sir, yes. 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 53 of 63 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you say there was nothing substantive that was 
discussed at that meeting? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, that is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And then what was the response of you and your 
colleague now that we know how the introductions had gone about and we also 
know that nothing substantive were discussed?  I mean how did you respond? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  I can simply sum it up by saying as officials of 
the Treasury we were all stunned. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Stunned? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Stunned, yes. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Stunned.  Meaning we were stunned, we were 
just – we did not know what was happening, we were like – we did not have words, 
or I did not have words to explain what I was witnessing on the day. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, and then you reference the important name and 
Treasury at that time and that was Deputy Minister Jonas. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  He was absent in the meeting he did not form 
part of the meeting on the morning. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Was he not invited to the meeting? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  He was not at the meeting no. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Do you or do you not know that he was invited to that 
meeting? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  I do not know if – but, I cannot recall exactly if 
he was part of the –but I would imagine, I would imagine which is standard practice 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 54 of 63 
 
in the Treasury that such meetings where Minister is going to engage with the rest of 
the senior managers that a Deputy Minister would be invited to a meeting like that. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  I mean that is standard practice, it has 
happened, he was not the first or the last Deputy Minister.  There have been 
predecessors before him and there have been successors, I mean…[intervenes] 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, as I say in such meetings where the 
Minister engages with the DDG's in the Treasury it is standard even the assistants, 
even now they know that they will invite the Deputy, whether he is there or not is 
another thing, but there will be such a standing invitation, but I guess for a meeting 
as important as that meeting when a new Minister of Finance is being introduced to 
10 
his senior managers that, you know, a Deputy Minister is not there, it is very unusual.  
I would have expected that you would want him to make himself available, or he 
should be in the meeting. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  I am sure the issue will be explored with Mr 
Jonas when he resumes his testimony, but from your side that absence you 
described as conspicuous and highly unusual.  What signals did it send to you if you 
can speak for yourself? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  It simply said to me that there will be – there 
are challenges.  There are something that is not going right, because remember I am 
connecting now what I said earlier the demeanour of Mr Fuzile and the fact that 
20 
Deputy Minister Jonas is not here and that the tone of the meeting is tense and this 
place is going to be changing. 
 
All of that, the connection of that tells me that things were not in a good 
shape, including between the Minister and the Deputy Minister.   
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 55 of 63 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, and then in paragraph 14 you express the 
impression arising from how the meeting unfolded.  You have made some points 
regarding that impression, but can I ask you to sum up by reading that paragraph? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE: 
"My impression of this short engagement was that 
Minister van Rooyen did not appear to be confident in this 
role.  He did not appear to know the two people he came 
with.  Minister van Rooyen was just sworn in on Thursday 
and had already appointed an advisor and a Chief of Staff 
by Friday morning." 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  We have dealt with paragraph 15 and in 
paragraph 16 you revert back to the draft statement that you had prepared and you 
say that you raised the issue of the draft statement with Mr Fuzile and what was his 
response? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  I, he was – he angrily just indicated to me that 
I should just send this statement to the President.  He did not even read it, he was 
just too angry to interact with the statement.  So I then took it upon myself as soon 
as I was back at my desk to send the press button, to send it to the Presidency. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, and in paragraph 17 you draw some conclusions 
about the presence of Minister van Rooyen and his two – the two individuals that 
20 
accompanied him.  Can you just tell us what the conclusion that you draw is? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  This was the last time I saw and engaged with 
Mr van Rooyen, Mr Mohammed Bobart and Mr Ian Whitley at the Treasury after this 
meeting.  I did see them again later in my interactions with the Department of 
Corporative Governance and Traditional Affairs. 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 56 of 63 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Do you now meet with them in a different capacity? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  I do not meet them, the only time I met Mr 
Whitley and Mr Bobart was at the lobby of the hotel at the BRICS summit in Chia-
Men in China last year.  I just bumped into them, greeted them and they were all in 
the lobby and I did not recall them very well.  It took me a while for me to connect the 
dots. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  That was the last time I saw them. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright, alright, Chair, one last question.  The 
revolving door of ministerial engagement with Treasury did not stop with Minister van 
10 
Rooyen. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Not at all. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You now have a new Minister. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Minister Mboweni. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes sir. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Does he have advisors and Chief of Staff? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Minister Mboweni does not have advisors.  
Minister Mboweni has a Chief of Staff who is Mr Marlon Geswint who used to work 
with Minister Nene and he also has a PA Mary Marumo who used to work with 
20 
Minister Nene and he constantly say that the Treasury will be his advisors and we 
had an agreement that as and when needed based on specific responsibilities, 
issues that we want to deal with and we do not have the necessary competence in 
the Treasury that we will then see if there is a need to actually acquire those 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 57 of 63 
 
services from anywhere else, if we deem so, but currently there are no advisors to 
the Treasury. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So you as Treasury are the in-house advisors of 
Mr Mboweni? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, the same way that we were previously. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair, that will be the end of our questions to 
Mr Mogajane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you Mr Maleka.  I have one or two questions for you 
Mr Mogajane.  We heard from Mr Fuzile's evidence in the past two days that he had 
had interactions with Mr van Rooyen prior to Mr van Rooyen's appointment as a 
10 
Minister of Finance and he had those interactions, because Mr van Rooyen was a 
member of the standing committee on finance in parliament.  Had you had any 
interactions with Mr van Rooyen in his capacity as a member of the standing 
committee on finance prior to his appointment? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  I never had any interactions with Mr van 
Rooyen except in committee when he would maybe ask a question and I would 
respond as a delegation coming from the National Treasury, but I did not have any 
relations with him, I did not even have his phone numbers at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So whatever interactions you had would have been in a committee 
meeting between the committee and the Treasury – National Treasury? 
20 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Yes, Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now he did not say much at that meeting, but the one thing 
that he did say according to you and I think that is consistent with what Mr Fuzile 
also said namely that this place is going to change and it is going to be accessible to 
rural people.  In the interactions in committee between National Treasury and the 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 58 of 63 
 
standing committee on finance had there been any complaints, maybe voiced by him 
or anybody about National Treasury that might relate to how accessible National 
Treasury is to rural people or not? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Not that I – I do not remember any particular 
interaction with Mr van Rooyen with the Treasury insofar as the issues that the, 
Chair, you are mentioning, but generally there has always been a narrative that says 
Treasury is neoliberal, Treasury is a problem, Treasury, which is normal, I mean and 
we have learnt to accept that, because we have tend to develop thick skin over the 
years in that it will not always be likeable, because of the kind of responsibilities and 
job that we do, obviously given to us by the Constitution.  So I think, you know, 
10 
people might have had views about the Treasury and some of them would be 
articulated differently, but I do not remember any situation where Mr van Rooyen 
took us on in terms of his views about the Treasury in committee, I do not remember 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But leaving Mr van Rooyen aside, were you then or are you now 
aware of there being maybe sections of society or certain people or organisations or 
groups of people whose criticism of National Treasury includes anything along the 
lines that National Treasury is not accessible to rural people or to people in general?  
In other words is this – was this something that you could associate with anybody or 
was it just a new thing completely to you? 
20 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Chair, it will always be with people who would 
not want to understand or agree with the fact that we have got a particular role, given 
to us by the Constitution, given to us by the MFMA and PFMA, because these three 
pieces of legislation, firstly as we know the Constitution established the National 
Treasury.  It gives us certain powers and I always say to colleagues in the Treasury 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 59 of 63 
 
that as you perform your functions know that we are directed by the Constitution and 
the PFMA and the FMA and other pieces of legislation. 
 
So it is not always that as we engage with these issues that as I said we 
will be likeable we would make friends all the way.  There would be those who have 
views about the Treasury, but also it is also then equally important that, because this 
view then may be a wrong view that says you are not accessible, we are of a certain 
breed, that we should then make ourselves accessible in the way we engage with 
the departments, in the way we engage with the public, in the way we engage with 
business, both black and white business in South Africa and then issues that talks 
about our accessibility. 
10 
 
But, however, in performing our functions we should know that we will 
always not be likeable, so – but however it is also important that we strive as a 
department that we work within the collective of government.  We work within the 
collective of advancing the ideals of the NDP as I think it is important and make sure 
that we achieve and improve the lives of South Africans.  That is the brief and that is 
the kind of culture that I am continuing to inculcate even today in the Treasury that 
we should as much as we say no, let us say no with a smile. 
 
I know it is difficult, because of the role I played as DDG Public Finance 
where all 40 government departments and 1 000 plus public entities were always, 
even now where people will demand or ask to see that they want to see the DG of 
20 
the National Treasury including and there was a newspaper article, Chair, just to 
divert where parliament said that the DG of Treasury has gone awol.  And where the 
DG of the Treasury at the same time was being wanted by another committee at the 
same time and the DG of the Treasury was at the same time presenting at a very 
critical important workshop. 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 60 of 63 
 
 
So you can imagine our time now.  Sometimes for other people when you 
are not available then it is an issue about accessibility and he is never available, he 
is always busy, he is never on the phone, he does not return messages, but the 
challenge is our work is quite strenuous and unique in many ways, so but I think it is 
important that we be seen and act to define who we are, because we are working 
within a collective, and that is critically important. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but are you saying that this was kind of criticism, because it 
seems to have been criticism that you people – this place is not accessible to rural 
people.  Are you saying that you could not associate this criticism with any particular 
grouping, or it was not something you had particularly heard or that had registered in 
10 
your mind as being a complaint against National Treasury? 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  No, Chair, I attributed that statement to many 
things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, talk about that…[intervenes] 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  That has to do with the Treasury and the 
stance that we took on major things and it is worse now after the fact, years later 
that I then finally tried to understand what that means.  The stance that we took as 
an example which is a fact now on nuclear, and our approach and the stance I said 
we took as in the discussions especially the 8th of December discussions at the 
meeting of the nuclear meeting, and finally what now is public knowledge in terms of 
20 
the views articulated by both Minister Nene and Minister Gordhan as the reasons 
why Minister Nene was removed. 
 
Then it is clear for me now after the fact that it was no coincidence that we 
are viewed as a stumbling block to certain things, we are viewed as being 
inaccessible, we are viewed as arrogant etcetera and all of these things then 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 61 of 63 
 
manifest itself in many ways to me to say a view that people have is not the other 
issues that I mentioned earlier on, people accessibility and so on in doing our job, 
but it is also us clearly now in terms of a blockage where evidence came from the 
various people before me, a blockage to what essentially was deemed as the state 
capture by the former Public Protector in terms of the report and what this 
Commission is all about. 
 
So it is, I am already combining these things and it is then for that reason 
that we were seen to be inaccessible and we are seen to be arrogant and we are 
seen to be Mr and Mrs Nose as we embark on our responsibilities. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, thank you.  Unless there is something arising there, there is 
10 
nothing. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  No, no, Chair, there is nothing from my side. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much Mr Mogajane for coming forward to give the 
evidence and assist the Commission.  You know already I am sure by now what I 
have been saying all along about asking current DG's and past DG's and other 
people to come forward and assist the Commission.  We are grateful to you.  I am 
also grateful that you are still going to come back, because there is more that you 
want to share with the Commission from what I have seen and we are interested in 
hearing whatever you have that may fall under the terms of reference and I have no 
doubt that the legal team will make sure, if it has not already done so that they 
20 
obtain that information from you and at the right time I am sure that you will come 
back.  But thank you very much and you are excused. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE:  Thank you very much, Chair. 
MR ANDREW DONDO MOGAJANE EXCUSED 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, Mr Pretorius. 
23 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 29 
 
Page 62 of 63 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Chair, we then adjourn until Monday for the evidence 
of Ms Macanda, as well as Mr Manye.  The only problem, however, is whether we 
begin at 09:00 or 10:00.  We have caught up some time and we are on time if we 
start at 10:00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are on time? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that assurance is more reliable. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Chair, I am not as bold as my colleague. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you suggest we stick to normal starting time? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  10:00 it just allows preparation to take place 
10 
conveniently. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, alright.  We will adjourn now and then we will resume 
on Monday at 10:00 o’clock when we will hear evidence from another official from 
the National Treasury Ms Macanda and thereafter we will hear Mr Zwanele Manye.  
We adjourn.
