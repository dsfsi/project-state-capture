Good 
morning 
Ms 
September, 
good 
morning 
everybody,  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes we are Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us proceed. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Before we proceed Chair there is 
one legal representative who by your leave.

Page 3 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning.  Are you ready? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Proceed. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Chair yesterday we ended on page 
30 of the affidavit which is in bundle KK2.1.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I have got it thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Just to contextualise Mr Roelofse I 
ask that you please look at Exhibit KK2.3 an in particular diagram 2.   
CHAIRPERSON:  It does not look like I have got the diagrams – the 
diagram file here.  That – that cannot be your fault.  I think we will just 
10 
have to adjourn and let them check.  It is diagram – I think you said 
diagram file and the other one.  Oh have you got a spare one? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   We do have a spare one Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Just remember to check with them during the 
break.  Okay thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   So diagram 2 of Exhibit KK2.3.  Mr 
Roelofse is it correct that this diagram talks to part of the evidence that 
you provided yesterday in that the first investigation that you were 
involved in for purposes of your evidence concerned the Richard – 
General Richard Mdluli Vosloorus case? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And that was an investigation that 
you led which resulted in certain members from Crime Intelligence and 
the police to approach you to provide you with information relative to 
the abuse of the Secret Services Account and the funds in those 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 4 of 134 
 
accounts? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And is it also correct that off the 
information that you received from a certain Mr – certain Colonel 
Naidoo the – the investigations that have been outlined in diagram 2 
not diagram 1. The eleven investigations there are but some of the 
investigations that you have been involved in but these are the eleven 
investigations that you place before the commission? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And then to take us to page 30 of – 
10 
which takes us to page 30 of your affidavit you now deal with 
investigation number 5 and you have titled that General Lazarus abuse 
of Secret Services Account purchasing of vehicles. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That looks… 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   We at paragraph 94. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That looks like 4.  Is that not roman figure iv? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   It is at the bottom of page 30 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you are at the bottom.  I thought you were – okay, 
alright.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   My understanding is we have 
20 
completed the previous investigation yesterday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay – oh that is the abuse of the safe house? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Unless you wish us to address any 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no. 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 5 of 134 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Any other aspect in relation to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No it is fine. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Colonel Roelofse how did it come 
about that you were informed of allegations in the – in relation to this 
investigation? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair once again it was – I was 
informed by Colonel Naidoo regarding certain allegations and then 
based on that I tried to follow up to either corroborate – to prove – I 
mean to corroborate what he said to me.  And then … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And what did Colonel Naidoo inform 
10 
you? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Well he… 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Which resulted in this investigation? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Colonel Naidoo informed me in 
broad terms that vehicles especially luxury vehicles were used to – and 
I will use the word influence very broadly to influence senior 
management to pose no obstacle when it comes to what General 
Lazarus as part of his agenda.  In other words as I said yesterday 
these are methods that was employed to put people in a – in a difficult 
situation – in a compromising position and then based on that… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh basically they were being maybe indirectly maybe 
directly bribed so that they would not say anything against General 
Lazarus. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair.  The 
problem with the – the problem with the – that is how it started.  The 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 6 of 134 
 
unfortunate part is it did not stop there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   When – at that point when that 
individual are comprised he is not in a position to act. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   So then this is basically what – 
what I am referring to when we talking about the vehicles. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And when is it that you discovered 
this information about General Lazarus using funds from the Secret 
10 
Services Account to procure vehicles for senior managers? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   It would have been in the 
timeframe when I spoke to Colonel Naidoo so it would have been after 
the 20 t h or on or about the 20 t h October 2011. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   If I can take you to page 31 of your 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just before that in paragraph 94 the senior police and 
other government officials referred to in paragraph 94 would they have 
been senior to him 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   To General Lazarus? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes Chair they would have been. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that would – I take it that since as I understand 
the position only General Mdludlu was senior to him. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   In terms of Crime Intelligence. 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 7 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Am I correct about that? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Am I correct about that? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes. If we talk about Crime 
Intelligence yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja Crime Intelligence? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes.  So it means that if there were others 
senior to him they fell outside – some of them fell outside Crime 
Intelligence? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Thai is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That he tried to influence. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair but maybe I 
should just correct myself.  There – the senior was General Mdludlu the 
other Generals were on a Major-General level.  So in that sense they 
were on the same level but he held the position within the SSA as the 
Financial – the Chief Financial Officer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   So he might be on the same level 
in terms of seniority with the other members at CI who was also 
20 
Generals. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so – so – but all of them that you are talking 
about in paragraph 94 were people who were – he had in Crime 
Intelligence not anybody outside of Crime Intelligence? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair as far as I can remember 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 8 of 134 
 
there are people outside. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Crime Intelligence. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Outside Crime Intelligence who 
also received a vehicle yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. No I just – we can deal with them later.  
I just wanted to have an idea whether it was confined to Crime 
Intelligence or it went beyond. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   No it went beyond Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   At page 31 you talk about a 
10 
discovery that you had in May 2011.  Please clarify what that relates 
to? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair this is – when I –when I am 
referring to this I am referring to the other members that came forward.  
Not Colonel Naidoo.  So what I am trying to convey here this is when 
members came forward and made allegations that vehicles were used in 
this fashion but without any specific detail which I could follow up.  So 
that – it became known to me at that time but the meat of the 
information – the more accurate information came from Naidoo after I 
spoke to him after he was – after October 2011. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   You then talk specifically to a 
monetary threshold that was permitted for use in obtaining a vehicle 
and you do so with specific regard to senior managers.  Can you please 
elaborate on this allegation? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair this allegation – while I was 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 9 of 134 
 
talking to General Hankel at the time when he was the intermediary.  
He informed me and I cannot remember if it was – if he was specific to 
that timeframe or was it a little bit later – after – at the time when I 
took his affidavit.  He referred me to a conversation that he had with 
General Lazarus who phoned him and told him that he is entitled to a 
vehicle from the SSA account to the value of approximately 
R500 000,00.  He said no I do not want a vehicle I do have my vehicle 
which is in our terms; SAPS terms we talk about a SMS vehicle; senior 
management vehicles for which they get a subsidy.  He said he does 
not want – he does not need one, he does not want one.  He then – he 
10 
then relayed to me that he then after that he received a call from 
General Mdluli. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I missed – who was saying he did not want 
it? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   General Hankel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   He was relaying the story to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Okay.  Then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  He got a call from General Mdluli. 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Mdluli confirming what General 
Lazarus’ has said that you are entitled to this vehicle.  And he again 
refused he said I do not want the vehicle.  So – and – we are aware or I 
am aware of the fact that senior managers did in fact drive with state 
vehicles from the SSA account contrary to the SMS packaging because 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 10 of 134 
 
they already got that.  They already have that advantage that financial 
advantage.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And your awareness of these 
particular individuals that you refer to are those the individuals that you 
will now talk to? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes some of them yes Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Who was the first individual that was 
discovered in your investigation? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair during my investigation I 
discovered that the following vehicles as I mentioned in paragraph 95 
10 
were in – were bought through the SSA account for the use of General 
Mdluli and his office.  And when I say his office I use that term also 
loosely because it was used by him.  And in that regard we were able to 
identify a Mercedes Benz E Class Sedan.  A Mercedes Benz 300 – 
350CDI.  BMW 350D Sedan.  A Mercedes Benz … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   530 to correct you. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Sorry? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   So it is a BMW 540D Sedan. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you. 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   A Mercedes Benz ML350 and a 
Lexus.  The total value of those vehicles amounts to more than R3 
million.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   R3.153 730.00. 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 11 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The – those amounts are for new hey for as they were 
when they were bought? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  And now this is about what five vehicles, 
this is five vehicles.  Would that be separate from his SMS vehicle as 
you put it or this would include his SMS vehicle? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is separate from his SMS 
vehicle Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   You will remember that I testified 
10 
that he sold his SMS vehicle as part of the trade in deal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   So this is separate from that.   
CHAIRPERSON:  But now did you establish whether he had all these 
five vehicles available to him at the same time or whether he used one 
– he had one available to him for a year and then brought another one 
and gave that one to somebody else or something like that? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair that is correct.  He used 
these vehicles over a period of time.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   So he would not necessarily have 
two or three of the – of these vehicles in his possession at the same 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   It would have been used and then 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 12 of 134 
 
given back to a member of CI to be used. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   For – to be utilised further yes 
that is what happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Do have any recollection of what the minimum 
period was when anyone of these vehicles were used by him before it 
was given away to somebody? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I do not have that detail 
with me but it would be part of the – of the case docket which we 
investigated. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Because I have the actual 
documents there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but we are not talking about like a week, a month 
we are talking about quite a long – much longer time or you are not 
sure? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair it depends. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   And in respect of each vehicle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Where some of them were longer, 
some will be a bit shorter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   But I might – what I can inform 
the Chair is that in respect of the Lexus vehicle. 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 13 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   You will see that I will speak later 
on about a – private properties leased for private use. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Now when we did the search and 
seizure at one of those properties I found the Lexus vehicle in the 
garage.  The vehicle was used by General Mdluli.  It was parked there 
in – at the time when he got arrested.  It was left there for more than 
seven – it was left there from April 2011 until November 2011 where the 
car was not used.  It was just left in the garage.  So … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was he – was he on suspension during that time? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   He was on suspension during that 
time ja.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   And it is this Crime Intelligence 
vehicle that – the vehicle is not being utilised.  It was bought for his – 
for his use. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   So that is and the other instance 
when we search – when we looked for Mr Mdluli prior to his arrest we 
20 
also found a Mercedes Benz E-Class Mercedes at his pre – at his 
property which is the top one that I am referring to.  The vehicle at that 
time was not even registered.  That is how new it was.  So it was over a 
period of time.   Some he used for longer times than others. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you have any recollection whether there could 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 14 of 134 
 
have been times when there is an overlap?  In other words a new one 
comes but an old one stays for some time before it is… 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair as far as I can remember 
there were overlaps. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Mr Mdluli after his marriage he 
used to go to Cape Town quite a lot. So he had a vehicle there for his 
use as well as a vehicle in Gauteng for his use. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Mr Roelofse you mentioned that 
10 
these vehicle were the outcome of an investigation that you conducted 
independently.  Is that to be understood correctly? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is – that is true Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And these five vehicles over what 
period was – did your investigation cover? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair this covered the period 
between General Mdluli’s suspension which happened on – which 
happened on the day of his arrest which was the 30 t h March if I am not 
mistaken and – 2011 and – and – in other words from his appointment 
in July 2009 up until the time that he was suspended.  The car that I am 
20 
referring to that we found in the garage was obviously only found 
afterwards at six over seven months afterwards. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Is that then the period referred to in 
paragraph 95 of your affidavit which is 01 July 2009 until 31 March 
2011? 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 15 of 134 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And your discovery of the Lexus was 
then outside that time period? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Ja the vehicle was bought within 
that period but the discovery was outside the time period. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   You then deal with another police 
member who also benefitted from vehicles that was purchased through 
the use of state funds by the Secret Services Account. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Can you please address this 
10 
individual insofar as your investigation concerned this general. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I did not know about this 
vehicle.  This was – this was information given to me by Colonel 
Naidoo.  It was a Q5 Audi that was bought through the SSA funds for 
the use of General Monoko Mpshe I as I – in the amount of 
R557 079.96.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   What position did this General hold? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   At the time she was the Divisional 
Commissioner in terms of Human Resources if I am not mistaken and in 
that regard she would have been or she would have played a role in the 
20 
250 appointment process within Crime Intelligence because of her 
position as the – as the – as a general in charge of personnel. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Is that the 250 recruitment drive you 
alluded yesterday that occurred during 20 – the year of 2010 for Crime 
Intelligence in particular? 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 16 of 134 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   So did this General hold any 
position within Crime Intelligence?  Or how exactly would her 
involvement have been as the Head of HR in that process? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair from what I understand she 
did not hold the position within Crime Intelligence but she does play a 
role in – with the – deciding how many posts – how many posts will be 
available?  How much money the budget in terms of that?  So she 
would have played a role in terms of that and that is where here role 
becomes important and her buy in into this process becomes important.  
10 
Without that they would not have been able to – to push these things 
through. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   But would this General not be 
entitled to receive a vehicle purchased through the SSA? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair no she would not be 
entitled.  In fact she already had – because of her position she had a 
SMS vehicle to which she was entitled. She had further had – to that 
she had an official vehicle and that allow her not only to have the 
vehicle but also a driver that is attached to that vehicle.  So in her 
position she already got those kind of – that is part of her – the post 
20 
that she was occupying at the time it came with that post.  So she 
already received those benefits.  She is not entitled to this vehicle.  
She is not doing Crime Intelligence business.  She is not doing official 
– an official function of Crime Intelligence. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   So what exactly were you able to 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 17 of 134 
 
independently verify through your investigations from the allegations 
that you received from Colonel Naidoo? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   In respect of this specific 
vehicle? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Correct. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I was able to obtain the 
actual motivation for the vehicle this [indistinct] – this specific vehicle 
and I would like to quote from the memorandum which allowed them to 
buy the vehicle.  This is now a memorandum from Crime Intelligence 
applying or motivating for this specific vehicle. It says the following” 
10 
“There are times – there are time vehicles are being 
procured 
for 
various 
operations 
but 
without 
applications.  Reason being that these vehicles are 
being used in highly sensitive operations. These 
vehicles are utilised by agents.  This happens during 
the course of the year when the need arises.” 
That clearly has got absolutely nothing to do with General Mpshe.  As I 
– as I stated right now General Mpshe was never a member of CI.  She 
was never in the agent program as far as I know and she never 
undertook highly sensitive operations within CI.  So in respect of the 
20 
application or the motivation there is already a misrepresentation made 
to the state in regards to the – to the – to buying – to the buying of this 
vehicle. 
ADV 
VERUSCHKA 
SEPTEMBER: 
 
 
Was 
there 
any 
other 
misrepresentation that was made that you were – that you are aware of 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 18 of 134 
 
in relation to this vehicle? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes Chair I am aware of the 
following misrepresentations it was also made.  I had an opportunity to 
see Colonel Barnard at the office of General Hankel.  He mentioned to 
me or he actually mentioned to General Hankel – I was just present that 
this specific vehicle is registered on their SR register – their asset 
register as a Q4 – sorry an A4 Audi.  And the reason he – he advanced 
for that is that the Auditor General will pick up this anomaly of a Q5 
and that will raise a flag from the Auditor General and they will ask – 
they will ask questions regarding the purchase of this vehicle.  That is 
10 
why it was registered as an A4 which would not raise that red flag from 
the AG’s office.  The AG is not – does not audit each and every 
transaction so they would look for flags for things that stand out and 
this would have been one.  So this would then negate the auditing 
process of the Auditor General. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Were any disciplinary steps taken in 
relation to this matter? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes Chair.  General Lazarus was 
– was found guilty as part of the disciplinary process in respect of this 
specific matter.  General Mpshe was informed that a disciplinary action 
20 
will be taken against her and she after being informed she resigned the 
next day.  I do not know if anything happened to Colonel Barnard I am 
not – I am not aware whether he was charged for this in a disciplinary 
matter. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And then what is the status of the 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 19 of 134 
 
criminal investigation in relation to this matter if any? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair the investigation is done 
but I – but the unfortunate part is I cannot use the documentation in a 
court of law because it is not declassified. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If we can then turn to page 33 of 
your affidavit where you start with the next investigation that you place 
before this commission and that is titled General Lazarus use of Secret 
Services – SSA to fund upgrades to private premises.  Is that correct? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And like you did in relation to the 
10 
purchasing of vehicles where you spoke to particular individuals that 
you discovered in your investigation so too are there certain individuals 
that you – that your investigations revealed regarding upgrades to 
private premises, is that correct? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair.  If I may 
this also emanates from Colonel Naidoo which I followed up and in an 
effort to corroborate what he says.  He informed me that General Mdluli 
received comprehensive – received a comprehensive security upgrade 
at his private residence.  When I was able to retrieve some of those 
documentation from Crime Intelligence which was handed to me the 
20 
value of that upgrade was valued at R190 735.00.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And that was information that you 
verified through your investigation? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair.  I have the 
documentation showing this transaction.  Unfortunately also classified. 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 20 of 134 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Was that General Mdluli’s private 
home – official residence private home? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That was his private home which 
is situated in Dawn Park, Boksburg. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The next security upgrade relates to 
a particular Lieutenant General can you please address the next 
individual that your investigations unveiled? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair this is again General 
Monoko Mpshe.  She received again according to Colonel Naidoo she 
received a security upgrade at her private residence to the value of 
10 
about R40 000.00.  I did request these documents I was not – I was not 
provided the documents from Crime Intelligence.  But we were able to 
identify some of the individuals, private individuals who actually 
installed the security upgrades.  So that is why I am – I am dealing with 
an approximate amount of R40 000,00 because I cannot confirm from 
Crime Intelligence side what the actual amount was that was paid to the 
service providers. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   So were you then able to verify 
whether or not the SSA was used to fund these renovations? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes Chair I was able to verify that 
20 
and through the payments and the bank statements. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Payments and bank statements of 
whom? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Of the – of the – of the service 
provider. 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 21 of 134 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The next individual that you refer to 
is a Minister who received upgrades to private premises.  Can you 
please address that part of your evidence? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes Chair.  Again according to - 
(clearing throat) sorry - according to Colonel Naidoo he informed me 
about security renovations that he had undertaken or that was 
undertaken at a private residence of the then Minister of Police 
Mr Mthethwa in KwaMbonambi in KwaZulu-Natal. 
There was a risk - there was a risk assessment done on 
31 May 2010 on the premises on the instruction of General Mdluli.  
10 
Colonel Naidoo submitted the claims to the value of R195 581,45 on 
14 September 2010 and then I list the other - that is the total amount.  
So it was three - three payments to the value of 195 581,45. 
The 
one 
was 
submitted 
on 
14 September 2010, 
13 December 2010 and 31 January 2011 totalling that amount.  General 
- Colonel Naidoo was responsible for the claims in this regard.  He 
would put in the claim and he would - in respect of the work that has 
been done … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Has your … 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  And I was … 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Has your investigation established 
whether Minister Mthethwa was aware of the source of the funding for 
the - for the renovations? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair that I cannot say.  I do know 
that - that is again according to Naidoo - Colonel Naidoo.  He was 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 22 of 134 
 
present when General Mdluli and the Minister was at the - his premises 
at - in Natal - KwaZulu-Natal.  So whether he actually knew where the 
money came from or not that I cannot - I will speculate if I - if I say 
that. 
What I do know is that the Secret Service Account did make 
payment for this and there was a security risk assessment done and it 
was approved by General - General Mdluli. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And this risk assessment that you 
refer to is that in relation to the process that you spoke of yesterday 
insofar as where there is a need for a security upgrade to the private - 
10 
private premises of a member and that the threat assessment is done in 
order to establish the need and extent of a security upgrade to be 
funded by Public Works? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  In - in all of 
these instances that is what should have happened.  In respect of the 
Minister of Police at the time if I am not mistaken the - Parliament sets 
aside I think it is - it is roundabout R100 000,00 for a - for a Minister 
for security upgrades on his private residence. 
Any additional amount is - is for his own - at his own cost.  I 
cannot speculate as to what the Minister knew or did not know.  I know 
20 
that the amount was more than the R100 000,00 that was needed for 
the - for the security upgrade.  I did not see any - any risk assessment.  
It was done on the home of General Mdluli in terms of the 
documentation that was provided to me. 
I cannot speculate on General Mche (?) because I did not 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 23 of 134 
 
receive the actual documents to see whether there was a risk 
assessment done or not. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
It 
was 
your 
evidence 
that 
Colonel Naidoo informed you that he was responsible for the 
submission of claims in relation to these renovations? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  In respect 
of 
General Mdluli, 
General Mche 
and the 
then 
Police 
Minister, 
Minister Mthethwa. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
In 
regard 
to 
the 
claims 
that 
Colonel Naidoo 
submitted 
for 
the 
renovations 
to 
10 
Minister Nathi Mthethwa’s home did he inform you about those claim 
documents having any particular purpose? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  He informed 
me that he had copies of those claims in his office where he worked at 
the time.  I went with him.  I - I went to fetch the copies of the 
documents.  He then relayed to me the story as to why he had copies - 
why he was asked to make copies of the documents. 
According - (background noise) sorry Chair - according to 
Colonel Naidoo General Lazarus requested him - sorry - to make claims 
after 
it 
became 
apparent 
that 
General Bheki Cele 
the 
then 
20 
Commissioner of - of SAPS and Minister Mthethwa had lost touch with 
each other. 
According to Colonel Naidoo the documents were to be given 
to General Cele to ensure the - that the Minister could not act - act 
against him.  This is however also an example of an investigation which 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 24 of 134 
 
was never finalised due to SAPS’ failure to assist and providing 
important investigative documents. 
So - and this falls within the category of what I described 
earlier placing people at - putting them in a situation where they cannot 
get out from and putting them at risk and it was a common theme that 
came apparent throughout this investigation from Crime Intelligence 
from the Secret Service Account. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So we do understand that this 
investigation is ongoing? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair it is ongoing in the sense 
10 
that it continue once we were - once we are given access to 
declassified documents relating to - to this event. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The next investigation on page 34 is 
titled General Lazarus and I cannot pronounce the first name with 
respect Chair but it is Mr P Marimuthu. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Panganathan 
I 
think, 
but 
that 
is 
my 
own 
pronunciation. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr Roelofse might know … 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  I … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  How it is pronounced. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  I have it the same way Chair as 
(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Panganathan … 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 25 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Marimuthu. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  Please give us insight 
into how your investigation into this individual started … 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Once … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And progressed. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Once again Chair it was - it was 
started through the - the information provided by Colonel Naidoo.  The 
premise this - according to Colonel Naidoo - the premise under which 
this took place is because in late 2010 CI went through a restructuring 
10 
process which would have an infect - an effect on appointments within 
CI and positions and where people are being placed or not. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And who was ultimately responsible 
for the sign off for that restructuring process in your investigations as 
you understood it to be? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair that would be the SAPS 
National Commissioner which - which would have been Bheki - 
General Bheki Cele at the time.  Now according to Naidoo as part of the 
restructuring General Lazarus as the CFO want to - wanted to retain 
and augment an operational capability which - within CI which fell - 
20 
which fell outside his mandate. 
This was contrary to the working methodology within CI 
because his unit being the SSA is considered to be an operational unit.  
It is - it is operational support unit.  Chair if I may elaborate on that. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Please. 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 26 of 134 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  What it - what it means is that 
Crime Intelligence have an operational - have operational units which 
needs to be supported.  General Lazarus was in the position as the 
Head of the SSA to provide that support.  If he - if he has an 
operational capability within his - within his unit he becomes the 
referee and the player. 
He is supposed to make sure that one of his tasks is 
supposed to make sure that funds are spread evenly and that give - and 
given according to needs.  If he has this kind of power he is in the 
position to - to decide who gets what and he can also then also reward 
10 
himself in respect of whatever he wants to do and this is largely the 
reason why we have these instances of people being placed in a very 
difficult situation because these claims and these transactions were 
dealt 
with 
within 
that 
operational 
unit 
which 
was 
run 
by 
General Lazarus. 
He could not go outside that trust circle for this kind of 
arrangement.  So that in essence is what - what this means.  It is not - 
it is not a working ideology that Crime Intelligence had before that.  
There needs to be a Chinese wall between the two. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So what is the importance of the roll 
20 
of Mr Marimuthu in the context of the restructuring process? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair according - as I said this is 
according to Colonel Naidoo.  Mr Marimuthu was seen as a close 
confident, close friend of General Cele dating back to his time as the 
Minister of Transport - the MEC for Transport in KwaZulu-Natal.  I do 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 27 of 134 
 
not have prior - I did not have prior knowledge of that. 
I did not know Mr Marimuthu.  I knew about General Cele 
because he was the Head of the - the National Commissioner.  In any 
event 
according 
to 
General 
- 
according 
to 
Colonel Naidoo 
General Lazarus 
approached 
Mr Marimuthu 
to 
assist 
him 
- 
by 
introducing him to General Cele. 
He wanted a direct relationship with General Cele.  This is 
now General Lazarus and according to my information as I stated 
earlier he had - he was a member of the Executive Committee, the MEC 
for Transport in KwaZulu-Natal where this relationship was - was 
10 
formed between him - between Bheki - General Bheki Cele and 
Mr Marimuthu. 
He then went further.  He says that Mr Marimuthu facilitated a 
series of meetings in which General Cele agreed to - to this 
restructuring proposals made by General Lazarus in respect of Crime 
Intelligence.  Colonel Naidoo also alleges that General Cele was paid 
in cash to secure the support in relation to General Lazarus 
restructuring proposal allowing operational capability. 
Mr Marimuthu 
also 
received 
some 
benefits 
from 
his 
relationship 
as 
Mr Marimuthu 
was 
registered 
as 
a 
contact 
20 
person/informer at CI and he was - in that process he was paid large 
sums of money to influence General Cele to support General Lazarus.  
Colonel Naidoo also indicated that the personally paid R50 000,00 to 
Mr Marimuthu on one of such occasion and then I refer to FM08 which 
was Mr Marimuthu’s main handler at the time. 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 28 of 134 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If we can pause there then for a 
moment.  The information that you present now before this Commission 
is information that you - you source from Colonel Naidoo? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  To what extent have you been able to 
verify any aspects of this information? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair I can - at this point in time I 
- I can verify the R50 000,00 payment that was made.  I have a copy of 
that document.  That is the copy of the document that was not 
declassified by SAPS and that was placed in a - in an envelope and 
10 
agreed by them that it could be handed up to - to yourself Chair. 
So that is that document.  That confirms the payment and it 
was dealt with if I am not mistaken by Naidoo.  It also contains a 
memorandum explaining the reason why Mr Marimuthu had to be paid 
for the period of a year.  I think in the amount of R50 000,00 a month.  
Although I was only able to retrieve the one - the one payment.  I do 
not have the other documentation relating to that.  It was not provided 
to me. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair the evidence that is presented 
in relation to that sealed document is then in accordance with the 
20 
agreement that this witness is in no way stopped from presenting the 
evidence save for the document not being presented to the Commission 
as such which at this stage we do not intend to rely on. 
In regard to Mr Marimuthu you have now through your 
investigations verified certain payments that were made to him and 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 29 of 134 
 
those verifications were done independently.  Have you established any 
other conduct action untoward behaviour in relation to Mr Marimuthu 
and appointments of individuals? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes Chair I did.  I just want to 
rectify something quickly.  I - I think I have a mistake. When I - when I 
referred to the R50 000,00 to - paid to Mr Marimuthu it was according 
to Colonel Naidoo paid by him.  I do not have the document relating to 
that but I do have the document relating to the R50 000,00 that was 
paid by FM08 which contains the motivation for that payment and also 
explains that there will be a yearly - monthly payment for - for 12 
10 
months of R50 000,00. 
Yes Chair.  There is also then the appointment of family and 
friends which has happened in terms of Mr Marimuthu.  Mr - Mr - 
Colonel Naidoo gave me names.  I then tried to verify those names and 
confirm whether it is actually true or not and then in terms of - and - 
and in terms of the list that I provided to the - to the Chair family and 
friends of Mr Marimuthu from FM13 to FM23 was appointed within the 
South African Police Service. 
Oh, sorry within Crime Intelligence as part of the 250 
appointment process. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so all those - all the people involved in regard to 
that column fell under Crime Intelligence? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  You now referring then to the table 4 
on pages 35 and 36 of your affidavit.  Is that correct? 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 30 of 134 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Just by way of - by way of summary 
is it correct that there are then 11 individuals that you were able to 
verify as having being appointed? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  I think I - 
there is one individual in there which - he was actually - let me say he 
or she was actually a - a policeman before the time.  He was brought in 
under different circumstances but he was also part of that specific click 
of individuals. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And is it also correct that the 
10 
construct of this table is no different to the construct of the table 
referenced before in relation to appointments in that it tables 
relationships, status, date of appointment in rank, rank level, date of 
promotion/appointment in rank, rank and level? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  It is 
precisely the same. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
Is 
it 
also 
correct 
that 
the 
appointments listed in this table consists of civilians who were 
appointed into positions as well as promotions of existing members? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair and it is 
20 
especially the civilians that were promoted at - that is - that is more 
controversial than the others.  These are individuals without any 
experience in policing nor Crime Intelligence or intelligence gathering. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  To look at some of the listings.  If 
you look at the first line item on page 35 marked FM13 - 1-3.  Can you 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 31 of 134 
 
please take us through that? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair this person is currently still 
in the South - in - in Crime Intelligence according to as I stated earlier 
according to the records which I looked at just prior to finalising my 
affidavit.  Whether that person is still active today I - I cannot say.  The 
person was - this person was a civilian.  Was appointed on 
1 February 2011 in the rank of a Colonel which is - which is a Level 12. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And we are then to understand that 
from being a civilian this particular individual was appointed directly to 
a Level 12 … 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Which is a level of Colonel? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is - that is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If we then look to the next line item 
which is FM14.  Can you please take us through that individual? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair as I indicated here this 
individual resigned on the - on 4 July 2016.  This individual was a 
civilian.  Appointed on 1 January 2011 in the rank of Lieutenant Colonel 
on the level - on the Level 10. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Just by way of another example 
20 
relative to the investigations you were able to establish.  If we look at - 
on page 36 FM1-7. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can you please take us through that 
line item? 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 32 of 134 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair this person was retired on 
the 31 s t - 31 March 2013.  First appointment into SAPS was the 23 r d - 
23 May 2003.  He was a Constable or she was a Constable and 
appointed at a level - Level 5.  On 1 February 2011 this person was 
promoted from a Constable to a Captain which is a Level 8. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
Thank 
you. 
 
What 
was 
the 
intelligence that you received from Colonel Naidoo in relation to these 
individuals and their knowledge for purposes of the positions that they 
were appointed into? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair according to Colonel - 
10 
Colonel Naidoo there was no proper procedures followed in the 
appointment.  The individuals did not have any knowledge of Crime 
Intelligence or intelligence gathering.  They came from a civilian life 
and there is no value that they could add to Crime Intelligence at the 
time. 
Had they been appointed - there is no problem in appointing 
them.  They should have then just gone through the process of being 
appointed correctly and then as we call it come through the ranks for 
them to get to a situation where they are being appointed in those 
senior levels or at those senior levels. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Are these appointments aligned at all 
to the 250 appointment process in 2011? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  That is part 
of that - that process. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And who would have approved these 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 33 of 134 
 
appointments/promotions? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair it would be General Lazarus 
but I since - well during the investigation it became very difficult who 
actually appointed them because that person has run away.  So we sit 
with the situation these - I do not have the documentation - all of the 
documentation relating to the appointments but according to Naidoo - 
Colonel Naidoo 
it 
is 
General Lazarus 
that 
- 
that 
made 
these 
appointments. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
What 
is 
a 
production 
file 
Mr Roelofse? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair when I - when we talk about 
a production file and I am still - am now using again the language used 
by Crime Intelligence.  A production file is if you a member of Crime 
Intelligence you either an informer or an agent.  You would - your - your 
core function is to - is to gather intelligence. 
Based on that intelligence you would write a report.  Now if 
the informant does not write a report then his handler or an agent which 
is his handler will write a report on his behalf.  That report would then 
be placed in his production file.  Based on that report an amount would 
be - would be decided upon and if the amount becomes a - a large 
20 
amount - I do not have the - the number with me - but it definitely - if it 
is more than R10 000,00 then there is a Committee that needs to sit 
and to decide whether this is value for money information and then 
based on that the payment would be made to the informer. 
In this regard there were no production files when we asked 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 34 of 134 
 
for them.  There is no - there was absolutely no proof that they did any 
work for Crime Intelligence and I am talking now about the time when 
they still had access to those documents.  In that period they could not 
find it so they could not give it to me. 
So and - and afterwards it was provided to me in any event 
after - after General Hankel was - was transferred from - from Crime 
Intelligence.  So in terms of that process in terms of the files - 
production files we did not receive any although we did ask for them at 
the time and General Hankel informed me that he could not find any 
and I have not received them in any event up to - up to now. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
Who 
was 
tasked 
with 
the 
investigation into the appointment of - as you have - as you have 
referred to - family and friends of Crime Intelligence members? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair a - you will remember that I 
testified yesterday about General Mothiba that came to visit me in Cape 
Town.  He was in charge of disciplinary actions that were supposed - 
disciplinary investigations that were supposed to take place.  Assisting 
him a Brigadier Madonsela and a Captain Hiralel was appointed and I 
requested them and I cannot remember whether it was through 
General Dramat or whether it was through direct contact with them to 
20 
assist me with the investigation regarding Colonel Naidoo’s allegations 
as to what is going on in KwaZulu-Natal specifically relating to 
Mr Marimuthu as I did not have time at the time. 
I was busy in Gauteng as I stated earlier and they continued 
with that investigation and they did certain investigations and we on a 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 35 of 134 
 
continued basis we exchanged information and affidavits regarding 
that. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So what was your role relative to 
theirs in relation to the appointments of - as you have termed family 
and friends investigation? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair I was more concentrating on 
the appointments that were done up in - up in Gauteng relating to 
General Mdluli 
and 
General Lazarus. 
 Although 
we shared 
the 
investigation regarding that but that was my focus area.  They - their 
focus when beyond just KwaZulu-Natal.  Their focus went to the actual 
10 
process itself and the investigation into that process. 
So I was not involved in the complete process of the 
investigation of the two - 250 - 250 process.  They were appointed to 
do 
that. 
 
My 
involvement 
related 
to 
General Lazarus 
and 
General Mdluli.  That is how I know about this and as - as I stated 
earlier I requested Madonsela either through Dramat or direct contact 
to - to do the investigation regarding Mr Marimuthu and we traded 
information as well as affidavits in that regard. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As a result of the investigation into 
the appointment of family and friends of Mr Marimuthu what other 
20 
allegations or concerns or complaints did you establish? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair one of the allegations that 
was - that was very concerning to me was an allegation of sexual 
misconduct against Mr Marimuthu.  I have - to that effect I - I received 
a - an - a sworn affidavit explaining exactly what happened.  This was - 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 36 of 134 
 
this was brought under intention - attention of not only police 
management but also under the attention of the then Inspector-General 
of Intelligence Ms Faith Radebe. 
It was at that point in time that it was decided - well it was 
decided it should be investigated but Ms Radebe has - has indicated 
that that event also shocked her and she indicated that it should be 
investigated thoroughly.  So it was known at the time that this has 
happened and the request was that it was - that it should be 
investigated. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Did the investigation continue into 
10 
these allegations? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  No Chair.  It did not.  Not as far as 
I know.  I did not receive any other communication relating - relating to 
this investigation.  This investigation was stopped. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  But having said that in that the 
investigation was stopped are we to accept then that the allegations of 
sexual misconduct are no more than allegations because it was not 
ventilated in any legal process? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair we have the 
affidavit which is under oath but that is as far as it was taken.  I think 
20 
at the time further affidavits were also taken to corroborate what had 
taken place of which I also do have access but it did not go further than 
that.  So it has not been ventilated in Court there is no decision been 
made regarding this, not as far as I know. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And as such it remains to be 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 37 of 134 
 
allegations according to your investigations? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Pardon? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And as such it remains to be 
allegations according to your investigations? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes Chair this remain an 
allegation according to my investigation. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   We are on page 37 of your affidavit 
which documents additional allegations that you received of – or 
complaints of wrong doing against Mr Marimuthu can you please give 
us an overview of such complaints? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair in – as I stated earlier 
Brigadier Madonsella and I exchanged affidavits and information 
regarding his investigation that was in Natal, no in terms of those 
affidavits that is in my possession it indicates nepotism in relation to 
Mr Marimuthu, it indicates a leading role at Mr Marimuthu played in the 
appointed of family and friends to such an extent that he would call 
people in, he would make them sign the appointment documents that 
they are appointed.  There’s no illusion that he made the appointment 
with individuals involved he was responsible for that that cannot be, 
he’s not a member of Crime Intelligence, he is not in a position to do 
20 
that.  Then there is the blatant non-compliance with selection and 
recruitment procedures within SAPS, in other words these individuals 
were recruited into SAPS without the necessary skills to fulfil that 
function that they were appointed for and then the infiltration of Mr 
Marimuthu and other role players involved in fraud, corruption and 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 38 of 134 
 
other crimes in the KZN Legislature and KZN province and then 
obviously, as I stated earlier the sexual exploitation by Mr Marimuthu of 
a CI employee.  Copies of the affidavits are in my possession and will 
be made available to the Commission if necessary.  I do not attach 
these affidavits due to the possible exposure of agents whose names 
are mentioned therein and not in the public interest. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Now what relevance do all of the 
affidavits which presents all of these – all of this evidence against Mr 
Marimuthu, how does that link to the Secret Services Account?  
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair the finance that’s 
10 
responsible for this comes from the Secret Service’s Account apart from 
salary payments – and there I’m not exactly sure because I can’t 
remember if the agent’s payments comes from the Secret Services 
Account and the being reimbursed by SAPS or visa versa but the money 
comes through the Secret Services Account for any other expenses 
relating to these individuals.  In other words, vehicles, office furniture 
and that kind of thing. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The next aspect that you refer to 
relative to Mr Marimuthu concerns rental of properties. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Can you please elaborate? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair as I stated earlier this also 
comes from Colonel Naidoo relating to properties leased to the State by 
Mr Marimuthu as safe houses.  According to Colonel Naidoo, Mr 
Marimuthu received inflated rentals up to R250 000 a month for these 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 39 of 134 
 
premises.  Unfortunately, I was not in a position to corroborate this 
allegation as I was not provided the documents to do so. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Was there any aspect of this that 
you were able to verify? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes that is true Chair, I was able 
to verify the use of a Mr John Appalsami and his company Deaz Trading 
who was used as a conduit to lease properties on behalf of Crime 
Intelligence to be used as safe houses.  What I can state in this regard 
is that Crime Intelligence do have a process that they go through when 
they are contemplating leasing a property because that comes with a 12 
10 
year – a 12-month contract and all the legal things that is associated 
with that.  So they have a process through which that goes, in this 
regard with the appointment of Deaz Trading it did not go through that 
process. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And is there any relationship 
between Deaz Trading, which for the record is Deaz Trading and the 
rental of Mr Marimuthu? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair he was 
instrumental in – as the leasing agent that signed the lease agreement 
of properties belonging to Mr Marimuthu on behalf of Mr Marimuthu as a 
20 
leasing agent with Crime Intelligence as the lessor in that transaction. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Who is John Appalsami, for the 
record spelt Appalsami? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair Mr John Appalsami 
according to my information and according to our investigations is a 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 40 of 134 
 
friend of General Lazarus, they go to the same church together and his 
wife as well as Mr Appalsami’s wife at some stage – and I know I have 
not mentioned this in the affidavits as at, just prior to this were co-
members or directors of either a company or a CC.  So there were 
personal interactions between Mr Appalsami and Mr Lazarus on a – and 
I regard them as friends. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And have now addressed Deaz 
Trading you’re taking us to the next investigation which you’ve titled as 
General Lazarus, Mr John Appalsami of Deaz Trading CC safe houses. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   In this regard you refer to various 
properties which were rented as safe houses, can you please take the 
Chair through the evidence in this regard, not only insofar as where you 
obtained the information from but which parts of that information you 
verified, if you can start with the first property called Clear Water 
Estate? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair this property was also 
leased through Deaz Trading. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   When was this? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   The lease was – the monthly 
20 
rental for that property was R20 000 and the lease – it was leased 
during November 2010, as far as I can remember that’s when the 
contract was signed for that property.  That specific property was for 
the exclusive use of General Mdluli,, he had a private residence in 
Boksburg as I stated earlier but he also used this place as a residence 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 41 of 134 
 
and that is also – this is also the property which I stated where the 
Lexus vehicle were found six to eight – this is November so we – eight 
months, six months after his…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let’s – is that a different one from the premises 
where you got the Lexus or the same one? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   This is the premises yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Now this information was 
provided to me by Colonel Naidoo and we were able to corroborate 
what he said to this extent. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you, the next property you 
refer to is called Gordon Villas. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair, this 
property belongs to General Mdluli it was also leased through the 
company called Deaz Trading and the contract that I had showed that 
the lease- that the end of the lease was supposed to be September 
2011 and Colonel Naidoo said that he paid the monthly rental in cash of 
this property to General Mdluli.  Now on the outset there is no – 
policemen and not precluded at the time policemen or state officials are 
not precluded from doing business with the State but the caveat is, you 
20 
need to declare such and inform your employer.  No financial disclosure 
was done regarding this and that is why the – according to Colonel 
Naidoo that is why payments were made in cash. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The next property you refer to was 
called Morgan Ridge. 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 42 of 134 
 
 MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair this is a – this is also a 
property that was leased from the Marx family and it is based on the 
same premise as I explained earlier regarding Mr Marx’s son, there was 
this relationship between Mr Marx and his company and General 
Lazarus and according to Colonel Naidoo the monthly rental for that 
specific property was inflated by R2 000 per month which was divided 
between himself and General Lazarus. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And in respect of both Gordon Villas 
and 
Morgan 
Ridge 
what 
did 
your 
investigations 
corroborate 
with…[intervenes]. 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair that these leases did in fact 
take place, that payments were made and that the lease agreements 
were with Deaz Trading, we have the documentation relating to that 
although we don’t have the classified documents that says that sets 
this out. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Were you able to establish whether 
Ms C L Dicks being the daughter of Mr Marx was aware of this 
situation? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I would not know we didn’t 
approach her because it is one of the investigations that we couldn’t 
20 
finalise. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Why? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Due to the fact that we didn’t 
have all the documentation as provided – that was supposed to be 
provided by Crime Intelligence. 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 43 of 134 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The next premises you refer to is 
Office Accommodation, please elaborate? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair in respect of – this ties 
closely with the appointment of family and friends specifically General 
Mdluli.  These individuals were employed by the State as agents and 
they worked from this specific office accommodation to do their 
functions.  So apart from the fact that, on my assertion that these 
members or these individuals were not only appointed improperly and 
illegally further financial implications for this State are that these 
people had to be housed and for that office accommodation there was a 
10 
rental for office accommodation. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Was there any concern in relation to 
the monthly rental that was payable in respect of this office 
accommodation? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair, Colonel Naidoo in this 
regard also says that the monthly rental was inflated, I’m not in a 
position to verify whether such inflation did take place and I just want 
to clarify, in terms of the previous one when – regarding Morgan Ridge 
it is what Colonel Naidoo told me, I am not in a position to say whether 
it was inflated or not or whether the R2 000 was paid or not.  It is 
20 
impossible to verify that apart from Colonel Naidoo. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Is it then to be understood that in 
relation to this investigation Deaz Trading was used as the entity 
through which certain properties were rented for purposes of safe 
houses? 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 44 of 134 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Most of which were at monthly 
rentals that were inflated but some of that information in relation to that 
you were not able to verify due to documentation not being available? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes Chair that is true and also 
due to the fact that some of these allegations is Colonel Naidoo’s word 
against General Lazarus’ word so I would not be able to know whether 
that transaction between General Lazarus or Colonel Naidoo did take 
place or not. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The next investigation starts on 
10 
page 39 and it’s titled General Lazarus authorised trips abroad for 
General Mdluli and family.  Your evidence speaks specifically to two 
trips, can you…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe that might be a convenient time to take the 
tea adjournment so that when we come back he can then start on that 
one. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   As is pleases Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We’ll take the tea adjournment and resume at half 
past eleven, we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS    
20 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us proceed. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Mr Roelofse we are on page 39 of 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 45 of 134 
 
your affidavit at which you now deal with the next investigation titled 
General Lazarus Authorised trips abroad for General Mdluli and family.  
In particular you refer to two trips.  Can we deal with the first trip which 
is referenced as Trip to China?  Please switch on your microphone.  
Thank you. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes Chair.  This again was on the 
back of information provided to me by Colonel Naidoo and based on 
this information I was able to establish that General Mdluli and his – 
his then wife Ms V L Mdluli flew business class and departed from 
Oliver Tambo International Airport to Hong Kong International Airport 
10 
and returned from Hong Kong International Airport on the 14 t h 
November 2009.  According to General – Colonel Naidoo General Mdluli 
informed him that the Mdluli were visiting their daughter Bonsiswe 
Mdluli in China.  He was able to sub – I was able to establish that the 
daughter did in fact study in China and she was present in China at the 
time according to her travelling records during this trip – when this trip 
was undertaken.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Just for the record V L Mdluli is that 
Vusi – Ms Vusiwane Lily Mduli? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you.  Please proceed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that General Mdluli’s wife? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   His wife at the time yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the time ja. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes. 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 46 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   What was the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The heading there says authorised trips.  Is that 
correct – authorised? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   In … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The heading? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair it depends on the definition 
– definition of authorised.  The paperwork was done and the signatures 
were there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if it is not authorised by the right person it is not 
10 
authorised. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   If that is the distinction Chair 
then it was not authorised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes because when you say authorised it gives the 
impression that it is proper. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So – so it is actually unauthorised. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   If you look at the facts it is 
unauthorised yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   We were able – I was able to 
establish that the trip amounted to R110 000.00 of which R60 000.00 
was funded through the SSA account.  It was based on General Mdluli’s 
travelling costs and accommodation.  A further R50 000.00 was 
allegedly donated by Atlantis Motors via the Beirut[?] account.  The 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 47 of 134 
 
motivation provided for the funds to be utilised from the SSA and this is 
now the – the motivation in respect of General Mdluli’s air ticket and 
accommodation.  In the case that General Mdluli would over – went to 
China in his official capacity.  That is what the document seek – seeks 
to present to the author.  I mean to the reader of the document.  I was 
able to confirm that General Mdluli did not submit any leave forms – I 
am sorry.  He supplied leave forms for that timeframe.  In other words 
he was on leave.  He… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry did you say he did submit leave forms? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   He did submit leave forms. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he could not have been on – at work. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   So he was on – he was on 
vacation leave yes.  In that timeframe for this specific trip.  General 
Mdluli also did not inform General Dramat who was his direct head at 
the time.  His – of his intention to take – to undertake an official trip.  
The – this is confirmed by General Dramat in an affidavit which I took 
from him.  There was also no application made via the office of the 
National Commissioner which is the norm.  If you go – if you go 
overseas you have to make an application through the office of the 
National Commissioner which then would forward it to the Minister of 
20 
Police where approval will be then attached to that document.  This 
specific document was approved by General Lazarus this specific trip in 
terms of the documentation that was presented to me.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And he would not be the right person to approve? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   He cannot be the right person to 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 48 of 134 
 
approve that – that expense. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [Indistinct]. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   And as I stated earlier I was able 
to confirm that Bosiswe Mdluli who is the daughter she departed South 
Africa on the 29 t h August 2009 and she returned from China to South 
Africa on the 30 t h January 2010.  That falls within the period that this 
trip took place. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And what is the relevance of the 
10 
evidence that she was in Ms Bosiswe Mdluli was in China at the time? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair the relevance of her – of 
her accompanying General Mdluli at the time as far as I am concerned 
gives credence to the information given by Colonel Naidoo that they 
went there to visit their child. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   But you – sorry I did not mean to 
interrupt. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   I just want to come back to the 
R60 000.00 that was – or the R50 000.00 that was advanced through 
the Beirut[?] account Atlantis Motors. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Well then before we address that 
R50 000.00 can I just get clarity from you because you mention that Ms 
Bosiswe Mdluli’s travel arrangements were also arranged through a 
Westville Travel to which you gave evidence about yesterday.  Is that 
right? 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 49 of 134 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair.  I could not 
find any indication of payment by the Secret Services Account in terms 
her air travel when she went over to China. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Okay.  If you could then please 
elaborate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I think you wanted to deal with what – is it 
R60 000.00 or R50 000.00? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   R50 000.00 yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair.  You will 
remember that I testified earlier I do not know if I have dealt with it in 
10 
detail but there was an account or a journal account or general ledger 
account depending on what you want to call it within the books of 
Atlantis Motors.  Money was set aside into that account for transactions 
relating to benefits that is paid to certain individuals.  The account is 
funded through payments through transactions with Atlantis Motors and 
Company X. The period concerned that I had – that I looked at was 
about three years and the value of the vehicles bought from Atlantis 
Motors was about R61 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  61? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Million. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   The total amount for vehicles 
bought from that company during that time … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Over three years? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Over three years yes Chair. 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 50 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you remember which years or not really? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   It was 2009 to 2012. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Or end 2011. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Thereabouts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And do you remember how many cars those were that 
were bought during that time to cost R61million? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair it was quite a lot of cars. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was quite a lot of cars? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Ja, ja.  I do not think the issue is 
the fact that the cars were not delivered or anything like that the cars 
were actually sold to SAPS. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   I mean to Crime Intelligence.  The 
– however the amount of transactions that took place or the value of 
the transactions that took place allowed Atlantis Motors to set aside 
funds which was utilised then by members of Crime Intelligence for 
their own benefit and for the benefit of others. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let me just understand.  The official position is 
20 
the official position that the setting aside of certain funds for that 
purpose and to be put in what you call the general ledger account that 
was – that is in order? There is nothing wrong with that on its own?  Or 
there was something wrong with that? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair there was extensive 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 51 of 134 
 
evidence led because this specific is not the trip to China but the Beirut 
account.  There was extensive evidence led in the trial which is still 
continuing against Mr Barnard and Mr – and General Lazarus.  We are 
now awaiting judgment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   On this specific account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   There was – there is not – the 
issue of a – of a – of the Beirut account is also called within that trade 
a provision account and how it was explained is that if you – when a 
10 
vehicle is sold to a third party the company sells a vehicle to a 
customer a portion of the profit is placed into the provision account.  If 
something happens to the vehicle they would use funds from the 
provisional account to deal with that specific vehicle.  Whatever the 
case may be then funds if there – if it is – if it is necessary then they 
will use funds from that provision account.  After the warranty or 
warranty or guarantee period is over that funds will then go back to the 
– into the books as – as a profit to the company.  It was not necessary 
to create a Beirut account.  The Beirut account was extra and it was 
separate from the provision account.  It only related to transactions 
20 
between Company X and Nissan Motors or Atlantis Motors and based 
on that according to the testimony of Mr Jan Venter who was the dealer 
principal at the company a portion of the profit of the vehicle was 
placed into the Beirut account as part of a book entry.  And that – and 
from that amount – that book entry they would then pay certain 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 52 of 134 
 
individuals and benefits to members of Crime Intelligence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the – the – would the wrong part be the payment 
to individuals or is that something you are not sure about whether the 
whole thing of having that account is also illegal or the – or having that 
account might not have been wrong but it might – maybe it is the actual 
payments to individuals that may have been wrong? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair it is the use of the money 
that was – that is where the – the illegal part is in terms of – in terms 
of that fund. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   As I said Mr Venter testified it is 
his funds.  He can do with it what he wants. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   He placed it into a Beirut account 
as part of a – as a portion of the – the – the profit and he is entitled to 
use that money as he – but the money was used by – not by him he was 
instructed by Barnard and by La – mainly by Barnard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   On the use of the funds.  In other 
words they would tell him or he would him he will be using the funds for 
20 
this, that and the other. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Now this is where this money 
comes from. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 53 of 134 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   And this money was paid via EFT 
to New World Motors and according the affidavit from Colonel Naidoo 
he received an envelope from Colonel Barnard to the value of 
R50 000.00.  He does not know – it was told to him it came from Jan 
Venter at Atlantis Motors but he does not – he cannot say that – he 
cannot – he cannot verify that.  That is the transaction that I was able 
to verify although I do not have the last part between New World Motors 
and the money getting to General – Colonel Barnard.  That is how this 
transaction took place Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Having addressed the scheme that 
was developed at Atlantis Motors is it to be understood that this 
scheme was then borne from the sale of vehicles from Atlantis Motors 
to Crime Intelligence? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair that is what 
– when I said that the total – the total amount of sales was to the – was 
an estimated R61 million over that period. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   I would like to refer you then in that 
regard although we will address it a little bit later as well to page 42 at 
paragraph 138. 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes Chair.  I do see it is R69 
million I made a mistake it is not R61 million it is actually R69 million 
over a period of four years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   And I have the documentation – I 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 54 of 134 
 
received the documentation the general ledger documentation from 
Company X showing the complete value of the transactions regarding 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And it was this separate account 
then which is called the Beirut account which was entered and 
accounted for as a journal entry into which the surplus monies were 
paid. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes that is true – that is true 
Chair. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And on whose instruction were 
monies paid out from or rather on whose instruction were monies from 
this account used? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   It was used in the instruction of 
Colonel Barnard and to a lesser extent General Lazarus.  According to 
the evidence of Mr Jan Venter Colonel Barnard was the person that he 
knew and the person that he interacted with.  Although he has spoken 
to – he has met General Lazarus.  General Lazarus has been to his 
office and they have – and certain benefits did go to General Lazarus 
which is part of that specific matter. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And so the use of this – of these 
monies were paid to third parties? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Some of whom or some of whom 
were outside the Crime Intelligence Department? 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 55 of 134 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And if I could then take you back to 
page 39 of your affidavit where you refer to the R50 000.00 which was 
donated by Atlantis Motors via Beirut account.  Is this then one of the 
third parties to whom this money was paid? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair according to 
– according to the investigation that I have done. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   How was the R60 000.00 referred to 
or rather your evidence is that the total cost was R110 000.00 of which 
R60 000.00 was paid with the use of SSA funds.  R50 000.00 was 
10 
transferred or as you have recorded it donated by Atlantis Motors via 
the Beirut account? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   How was the R60 000.00 obtained 
from the Secret Services Account, do you know this information? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes I do.  I think I did testify 
about it earlier.  It was – it was a claim first in advance I am not sure 
whether I have explained how you would receive cash from Crime 
Intelligence when you do an actual transaction. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   No you have not.  Please do. 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Because of the amounts involved 
the individuals from Crime Intelligence, the police officers they would 
not have that kind of cash. So there is a system in place but not only 
through the Crime – not only through the SSA account but also through 
the Open account that you can draw in advance before you leave for a 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 56 of 134 
 
trip for instance.  What happened is that Colonel Naidoo drew an 
advance in respect of the air ticket which he is now supposed to 
paying.  He then would take that advance, the cash he would go to the 
company involved, buy the air ticket and if there is any money that is 
supposed to go back to the Secret Service Account he would then pay 
that back together with the invoice that will cancel out the advance 
payment.  So that is – that is how this would work.  In respect of this 
this is exactly what happened here.  Colonel Naidoo went, took an 
advance, went the company, booked a ticket and then = and then later 
on he – he put an application for the – for the expenditure.  I think in 
10 
this instance no monies was paid back to the SSA.  In other words the 
– the additional amount that was not used was given to General Mdluli. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so you did say that General Mdluli had put in a 
leave application or he obtained leave?  Or did I misunderstand that 
part? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or he did not? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair.  The leave 
was signed by General Dramat. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now at an official level would not the fact that 
20 
he took this money in circumstances where the paperwork indicated he 
was not on official duty would it not raise questions as to why he took 
that money if he was on leave? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair and I – yes it would and I 
think this is where the – this is where smoke and mirrors starts to play 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 57 of 134 
 
a part.  The money was not – was not – there was not an advance on 
his name.  It was in the name of Colonel Naidoo.  So there is nothing 
tying him to the expenditure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.   
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   It was tied to Colonel Naidoo and 
he had to deal with that expenditure and – and that is why he would not 
– that would not raise the flag in respect of General Mdluli when an 
internal audit had to be done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh and as you understand the position Colonel 
Naidoo knew the whole scheme? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair according to 
him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  According to him. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   And in terms of the corroboration 
that I could – was for me possible to find… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You could find? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   It would then indicate that 
Colonel Naidoo at least in some of those respects. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   In terms of the corroboration is 
20 
actually telling the truth. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you understand from Colonel Naidoo why he 
would allow a situation where the paperwork would point to him having 
taken the money when actually it was taken by Mdluli why he would 
allow that to happen? 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 58 of 134 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair once again it points – it 
goes back to the scenario where people are being used. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Colonel Naidoo received a – he 
was – he was appointed as a Lieutenant Colonel with the assistance of 
General Lazarus which was an irregular appointment.  He also 
understands that. There is under those circumstances he is not going to 
– he is not going to question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   And instruction like that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   And that is exactly the reason 
when I spoke about the operational team or operational unit within the 
SSA.  That is what those individuals were used for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   So they were part and parcel and 
this – this plan. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   And they were all in a situation 
where they could not actually say anything about one another. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   On page 40 you deal with the next 
trip that Richard – General Richard Mdluli and his family benefitted 
from.  Can you please give us details in relation to it? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair the second trip that I am – 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 59 of 134 
 
that I am referring to is also on the back of the information given to me 
by Colonel Naidoo.  In that – in that I was able to establish that there 
was indeed a trip to Singapore between 21 November 2009 and 28 
November 2009.  That is six days after returning from China.  I am now 
referring to General Mdluli.  In this instance General Mdluli’s current 
wife which is Ms Lyons she accompanied him to Singapore.  At the time 
she was not a member of SAPS. She was a clerk at the Department of 
Home Affairs.  The travel cost in respect of Ms Lyons was funded 
through the Secret Services Account and he ticket was upgraded from 
economy class to business class and the total cost for that air ticket 
10 
was R46 809.00.  In respect of both of these – these trips which I have 
now just discussed we have investigated this quite extensively.  It is 
part of a charge sheet that is – that is still not before court – a case 
that is not – still not before court because of the fact that we cannot 
utilise the classified documents in my possession.  For this to continue 
further or to go further it needs to be declassified.  I cannot only rely 
on documentation from service providers because what is important 
here is the reasons given for the actual expenditure which as far as I 
am concerned is fraudulent in nature.  It is a misrepresentation. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   How was the Secret Services Funds 
20 
then unlawfully or illegally spent in relation to this trip following the 
investigation that you conducted? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair in respect of the 
investigation and the information given to me by Colonel Naidoo there 
was at least nine people on this specific trip.  It was Colonel Barnard 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 60 of 134 
 
and his wife, Colonel Barnard’s wife’s air ticket was paid for him – was 
paid by him.  It was not paid through the Secret Service Account.  
The… 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   So Colonel Barnard paid for his 
wife’s ticket? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   He paid for his wife’s ticket.  The 
same applies to General Lazarus he paid for his wife’s ticket.   In this 
regard… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry have you moved to another trip? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   No Chair.  It is … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you still on the same trip? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes.  I am just explaining the – 
Chair I am just explaining the people that went with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   And the reasons why.  In respect 
of a – two other individuals Colonel Venter, Colonel Naidoo who himself 
went on the trip.  There was no reason for them to go on the trip.  They 
could not add any value and that is according to Colonel Naidoo 
himself.  The question regarding Ms Lyons according to Colonel Naidoo 
20 
she was the girlfriend of General Mdluli at the time.  They were not 
married yet and that is the reason why she accompanied them on the 
trip.  There was no other reason for her to accompany them.  She did 
not add value to the trip.  So in that regard the motivation for their 
participants – participation was misrepresentation to the employer.  
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 61 of 134 
 
This – this specific trip was approved through the correct channels, 
went through to the commissioner’s office, was recommended and was 
approved by the Minister.  So the actual trip, official trip there was 
nothing wrong with it; it was about the people that accompanied them 
and the reasons given as to why they should accompany them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the – in terms of the official – so in terms of 
paperwork all the people who were on the trip were reflected on the – 
on paperwork but the reason given to – the reasons given to justify 
their being part of the trip were false, is that what you are saying? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair not… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or were not justifiable? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair not all of them.  It was 
separate transactions when it came to General Barnard and General 
Lazarus in terms of their spouses.  So that had nothing to do with the – 
with the expenditure in terms of the SSA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   I am talking about the expenditure 
relating to Ms Lyons, Venter and Colonel Naidoo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  But that trip to – to Singapore – that one you 
said it was official, is that right? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was official – it was just the particular individuals. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes and the reason given. 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 62 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The reasons given. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   For them to – to go with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   We now turn to the tenth 
investigation that you have highlighted to the commission which is 
reflected from page 40 of your affidavit.  It is titled General Mdluli 
promotions 
and 
appointments 
of 
family 
and 
friends 
to 
Crime 
Intelligence.  How did you learn about… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe – I am sorry let us – let me just go back.  You 
said that the cases that is in regard to the trip that we have just 
10 
finished discussing was that the investigation and the case has not 
moved to finality because certain documents that are important for the 
case have not been declassified, is that right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  This is part 
of the - of the comprehensive - these two allegations are part of a 
comprehensive chart sheet that was drawn up.  Unfortunately we 
cannot rely on some of the documentation which is mentioned in the 
charge sheet because of the fact that the documents are still classified.  
So we cannot go to court with - we cannot - defence cannot discover 
the documents. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now these are 2009 trips that makes them 10 years 
old? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now when - when - how long ago were the cases 
supposed to have been had if there had been no problem about lack of 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 63 of 134 
 
declassification?  If you are able to remember. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair to come back to the specific 
case which I - which falls under the - the looting of the SSA account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  The specific docket was opened in 
- in 2011 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  But it did not contain all the 
allegations because at the time I did not - have not spoken to - to 
Colonel Naidoo.  Later on when we spoke to him further allegations 
10 
were made … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  And based on that some of those 
allegations were - we were able to - to finalise the investigations into 
those allegations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  They were added to that specific 
matter.  The case - the SSA looting of the - looting of the SSA Fund and 
it was supposed to in terms of the judgment by the SCA to be placed 
back on the roll.  It was placed back on the roll.  It had to be withdrawn 
20 
again because we were not able to supply the defence with the 
documentation because the documentation was not declassified as - as 
was requested from SAPS. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was the issue that had gone to the SCA - but it 
was not about forcing the relevant authorities to declassify the 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 64 of 134 
 
documents? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  No.  That was not - that was not 
about that no.  That only came about later and I think it is - it is a 
matter between the IPID and the South African Police Service in cases 
that they have uncovered.  They are sitting with exactly the same - the 
same problem. 
SAPS do not want to declassify the documentation that is 
needed for the criminal investigation and I think on the back of the 
experiences that I had they decided to follow the route through the 
court system. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so I - so there is pending litigation to - to compel 
whoever is supposed to be compelled to declassify the documents so 
that that - that is underway or what? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair that is in terms of the - that 
is in terms of the investigations that - that IPID are conducting … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Which does not - although this 
matter falls within the purview at this point in time with - with - at the 
IPID and the ID.  This - the application that went to court related to 
another investigation within - within IPID … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  But I presume it will have an effect 
on this investigation as well when - when that litigation is finished. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Well I - I would not know at what stage your 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 65 of 134 
 
institution would handover matters or would - to the NPA or would 
invoke the assistance of the NPA but it just seems to me that - that 
there would not be a situation where a matter is dragging on for 10 
years because somebody is no declassifying documents that are 
important for the matter. 
It seems to me that if there are no other ways of dealing with 
the matter.  Courts should be approached because then they can deal 
with the question whether there are proper grounds to refuse to 
declassify. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, I - I agree but unfortunately 
10 
I am - I am still within the SAPS. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  So the SAPS - I do not think the 
SAPS is going to take the SAPS to court. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no.  I understand that.  That is why I am - I am 
bringing in the issue of the NPA.  That is why I am saying I do not know 
at what stage you would handover matters to the NPA or if you are 
faced with a situation like that and you feel that maybe the NPA as the 
prosecuting authority should see whether they would not go to court 
whether they - they would not be the people to - to ask to go to court 
20 
because otherwise you could easily have somebody who is actually who 
- who fraudulently classified documents that should not have been 
classified and is - may have classified them for illegal purposes and - 
and then there is no accountability. 
They are not charged because those documents are critical 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 66 of 134 
 
and they just say no we are not declassifying them and they might have 
absolutely no - no legitimate reason to refuse to declassify them and it 
is untenable if a matter that should have gone to court maybe five 
years ago might still just be lingering because there is this issue you 
know.  You - you understand where I am coming from? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  (No audible reply). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Being in the SAPS you - you might understand certain 
things that I might not understand but where - where I am is 
intolerable. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair if I may I agree fully with 
10 
what you said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  You will see later on in the 
affidavit I deal with how we tried to get the documentation declassified 
and the efforts that we put in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Together from SAPS side as well 
as the NPA’s side. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Short of going to court to force the 
20 
SAPS to - to make a decision on this matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  So - and you will - I am - in all 
honesty I have sometimes felt like the village idiot running from brick or 
running into this brick wall and into the next brick wall … 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 67 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Because there was only once that 
I am aware of that there was a - a definite no we will not declassify 
from the SAPS’ side. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  All the others were yes give us the 
documentation.  We will look at it and then you find yourself six months 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Six months to a year down the line 
10 
and then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  No I do not know what you are 
talking about and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  And then - then there is a change 
of command. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  So that is the kind of scenario that 
has taken place over the years which I deem as - it was done 
20 
deliberately and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  With the view of - of not 
declassifying the documents but that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 68 of 134 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That will - it comes out later in - in 
my testimony. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm.  Okay.  I think you - the legal team must 
apply their minds to this kind of issue because if a matter relates to 
something that is relevant for our investigation we - we have an 
interest in seeing those documents for purposes of any issues of 
corruption that we may be looking at.  So the legal team must apply 
their minds to - to that. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases Chair.  Will do.  If we 
could proceed then.  On page 40 Mr Roelofse you deal with the 10 t h 
investigation which is General Mdluli appointments and - promotions 
and appointments of family and friends to Crime Intelligence.  How did 
you learn of this information and to what extent did you verify it? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chairperson I learnt of this also 
through Colonel Naidoo.  Colonel Naidoo in his - what he has informed 
me is that he received a list of names which included family and friends 
of General Mdluli.  He was then told that he will be handling those 
agents and - and based on that on the back of his information I was 
20 
able to establish that as from FM24 to FM29 fit that category of family 
and friends. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And once again … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say …?  Sorry. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Sorry. 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 69 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  FM24 to FM29? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And once again this table is no 
different to the previous tables you have referred to which concerns 
appointments of - and the promotions of family and friends? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  By way of example can I ask you to 
address line item 2 please on table 5 page 40. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  It is a member that is still active.  
10 
The appointment rank in SAPS - in other words this person was in - was 
in SAPS prior to the - his or her appointment.  The rank was a 
Constable.  Her level was five and on 1 June 2010 this person was 
appointed as a Lieutenant-Colonel at a level of 10. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And that is then a difference of five 
ranks? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is - five levels yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Five levels, sorry. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I can ask you to turn to page 41 
20 
and please address line item which starts with FM29? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair this is a - as I said this is 
the same as the others.  This person is still in SAPS.  According to my 
verification to just prior to finalising my affidavit.  This person was a 
civilian.  Appointed on 1 June 2010 and appointed on a Level 8 which is 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 70 of 134 
 
a Warrant Officer at the time - which is a Warrant Officer. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And therefore your investigations 
revealed that it was a direct appointment to a Level 8? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The last investigation that you placed 
before this Commission relates to Atlantis Motors which you have 
already given evidence in relation to? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  If I just may 
in terms of paragraph 1 the table in 132 I have testified earlier 
regarding Colonel Naidoo and the production files.  This is exactly the 
10 
same as to what happened here.  In this specific instance he was the 
handler.  He had no production files. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And likewise just to complete that 
section this process was relating to the 250 appointment process in 
2010? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so at page 41 where you deal 
with the investigation which you have titled “Atlantis Motors” and to 
which you have already evidence let us deal with that parts which you 
have not addressed as yet.  You have already given evidence that a 
20 
Mr Jan Venter was the principal dealer of Atlantis - of Atlantis Motors in 
Centurion? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  What information did Mr Venter 
provide to you regarding the business relationship between Atlantis 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 71 of 134 
 
Motors and Company X? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Mr Venter provided me with the - 
with documentation which seeks to substantiate what he is - what he 
alleges in terms of where and to whom payment took place.  He 
provided me with a copy of the general ledger account reflecting 
Beirut (?) and based on that transactions or based on that account we 
were able to identify that - as the transactions were only available 
although this account exited before 8 April 2008. 
He only had records as from 1 April 2008 and on that day an 
amount of R175 040,00 - R175 045,15 reflected on the Beirut account 
10 
as available and then in the period - in the period 8 April 2008 to 
19 October 2012 an additional amount of R1 527 601,61 amount was 
allocated to the Beirut account for the use of members of CI and - and 
for the use in terms of their benefit and third parties. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  Did Mr Venter provide you 
with any information in regarding how this Beirut account was created? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair he did.  I would like to 
explain the name Beirut but unfortunately that will - that will put 
Company X at risk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  So I am not going to explain the - 
the name - the Beirut account … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  But the account itself the name is 
directly related to Company X. 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 72 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I can take you back to paragraph 
134 you explain some more details as to how the account was created.  
Is that right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Please elaborate. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  It was - according to Mr Venter it 
was created in 1994 and he became aware of Company X and the role 
that Company X plays within the Crime Intelligence environment.  He 
became friends with Colonel Barnard and then in 2006 - according to 
10 
Mr Venter in 2006/2007 he approached him with an idea to create an 
alternative account which could be operated outside the ambit of the 
SSA account and which he agreed to at the time. 
He thought at the time that he - he could play a role in the 
combatting of - of crime.  He subsequently realised that it was - it was 
not being used as envisaged but to the benefit of certain police 
officials.  At that point in time he was not in a position to get out of it 
because his company was benefitting from - from the transactions - 
from the turnover in terms of the sales of cars. 
So he had to keep the business and he testified as much in - 
20 
in the hearing or in the trial.  He … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And when you explained - sorry I did 
not mean to interrupt you yet. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  No that is fine. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  When you gave evidence earlier you 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 73 of 134 
 
explained about the scheme of operation on - of the - the Beirut 
account? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And it was also your evidence that 
certain third parties had benefitted from that account? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  One of which related to the benefit of 
R50 000,00 on the trip to China by General Mdluli and family? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  At paragraph 140 on page 42 you talk 
10 
to other third parties that you established benefitted … 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  From the Beirut account? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can you please provide the Chair 
with details of your investigation? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair before I - before I do so I 
just wish to - to mention that the investigation into Atlantis Motors did 
not originate from Colonel Naidoo.  It originated from the search and 
seizure that we had and I did look at the date.  It was 15 April 2011 
20 
when we did the search and seizure at the house of - of General Mdluli 
in - in Cape Town.  It emanated from that. 
Based on that we were able through Mr Jan Venter to 
establish various transactions that took place.  Colonel Naidoo’s role in 
this investigation regarding Atlantis Motors he contributed to the fact 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 74 of 134 
 
that there were certain transactions that he knew of and that he was 
part and parcel of - in which he played a role. 
So he highlighted certain events for us but in the main this 
investigation was done without - was done even before I got to know 
him.  In respect of the Beirut account if I can come back to that.  This 
is not an extensive list.  I am just highlighting a few of those - of those 
transactions.  The Beirut account included a total amount that was paid 
to New World Motors via an electronic transfer of 460 000 - 
R460 000,00. 
This 
- 
as 
far 
as 
I 
am 
concerned 
this 
confirms 
10 
Colonel Naidoo’s assertion that General Lazarus had to create cash in 
order to cover inter alia the shortfalls … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Roelofse.  Where are you reading from? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  140.1 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Thank you.  Oh, ja.  Okay.  Thank you. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  It confirms the assertion by 
Colonel Naidoo that General Lazarus had to create cash in order to 
cover inter alia the shortfalls in the SSA account.  Colonel Naidoo was 
not aware that these transactions took place in this manner.  That was - 
we found that out separately. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And how did you establish this 
detail? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE: 
 
This 
detail 
was 
established 
through bank accounts that we have subpoenaed and the - and the 
audit of those accounts where we are able to establish these transfers 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 75 of 134 
 
that took place.  The second instance that we - that we were able to 
uncover was an amount of R143 621,78. 
It was paid to - it was paid from the Atlantis Motors business 
account to WesBank Vehicle Finance Account in the settlement 
agreement of a vehicle registered in the name of Ms Ranjeni Munusamy 
and as far as I know she is a journalist.  This amount reflected as 
received - reflected as received on the same date in the WesBank - 
WesBank 
Vehicle 
Finance 
Account 
held 
in 
the 
name 
of 
Ranjeni Munusamy. 
This amount was debited - debited against Atlantis Motors 
10 
Beirut account on 30 July 2008.  In other words what had happened 
here according to Mr Venter is he was requested to pay over an amount 
of money into this WesBank Vehicle Finance Access Account or account 
and at a later stage he then debited the Beirut account against his - 
against the company account to settle the amount which has been paid. 
So effectively what it means is that the amount was covered 
by the Beirut account which is funded through the sale of vehicles to 
the SSA - to Crime Intelligence. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Before you proceed Chair we have 
received 
a 
letter 
of 
sorts 
which 
corrected 
the 
name 
of 
20 
Ranjeni Munusamy to Navarenjani Munusamy which is spelt N-A-V-A-R-
A-N-J-E-N-I.  Surname M-U-N-U-S-A-M-Y.  Mr Roelofse … 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the upshot of that? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Excuse me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the upshot of that?  Is it that the name as 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 76 of 134 
 
appears here is a wrong name for the account? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  It - it appears to be … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does Mr Roelofse know about the letter? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I have informed him of the letter. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair - ja.  I was informed of the 
letter but I did not know about the name - the difference in name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The - the difference in the names you did not know 
about that? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so maybe you will check later and talk and check 
10 
with him. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Will do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So at this stage we - we are not sure exactly who the 
person is. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And that was a query that I wanted to 
raise with this witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Until - until Mr Roelofse has had a look at the letter 
and maybe done whatever investigation to check whether the original 
information is correct or the new information is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  We will check that and revert on this 
20 
part … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Of the evidence later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Is it correct that there were certain 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 77 of 134 
 
discounts that were given to General Lazarus and other CI members on 
purchasing of vehicles? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And how was the difference then 
funded between the purchase price and the discounted price? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Are we referring to vehicles that 
they - that they bought?  I am - I just want to … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  At paragraph 139. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Correct.  This is - Chair this is 
correct.  When a - and I will use General Lazarus as an example and I 
10 
will call it still an allegation although this case is before court and we 
are awaiting judgment.  Judgment must be given.  So I cannot say 
whether it is - what the judgment is going to be. 
The allegation is that General Lazarus received a - a discount 
on - and I will just use one example - on a private vehicle which he 
bought.  The discount amounted to approximately R160 000,00 and the 
difference or to cover the discount because the actual value of the 
vehicle was R400-and - I think it was 450 000. 
To cover the difference - to make up the full amount the 
purchase amount an amount was taken from the Beirut account to cover 
20 
the difference in terms of the - the discount that was given to - to 
General Lazarus.  So that is money that Mr Venter used from his Beirut 
account to benefit General Lazarus. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That date 21 November 2019 must be wrong - at 
1-4 1.  When judgment was reserved.  You might still be going there.  I 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 78 of 134 
 
just do not want to forget it. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am saying I do not want to forget mention the - the 
paragraph you might still be going to it.  Paragraph 1-4-1, you say 
judgment was reserved on 21 November 2019.  I am saying that must 
be - the year must be wrong. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair actually what I - what I 
meaning or what I meant to say is that judgment is reserved for that 
date.  So there will be judgment will take place … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  It - it will be handed down on that date? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE: 
 
Sorry. 
 
That 
is 
my 
- 
my 
Russian/English sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  No, no, no.  Actually no, no.  Your - you 
are right.  You did say four.  So, ja.  No, no.  You - I think you - you are 
right.  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And to amplify on that judgment 
which is due to be handed on 21 November to which investigation does 
that relate? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE: 
 
That 
relates 
to 
a 
separate 
investigation that was initially - Chair maybe it - it needs a little bit 
elucidation from my part in terms of this investigation.  When 
Colonel Barnard - I mean Colonel Naidoo came to me and we started 
this investigation because of the various legs that was involved in 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 79 of 134 
 
terms of his information. 
We - I - I took the case to the SSCU as part of the Anti-
Corruption Task Team.  I was then informed that prosecutors S - at the 
SSCU is not going to or they got a reluctance of getting involved.  I 
was then - I was then referred - not referred.  Advocate Gerrie Nel was 
then brought on board by the NPA and he - and he said he will - he will 
do the prosecution provided that he is not prosecuting General Mdluli 
because of a prior incident that happened in the past. 
I was not privy to all of what happened in - prior to that.  I 
knew some of it but not all of it and then General - Advocate Nel said 
10 
that he would take part of that transactions which falls - which falls 
within the abuse of the Beirut account within Atlantis Motors.  He will 
take that and he will take that to court. 
So we had to split that specific leg from the - let us call it - 
the main investigation.  So that they can at least get that on the court 
roll.  The other advantage was - is that Advocate Nel reported to 
Advocate Mzinyathi the DPP of North Gauteng and not Advocate Mrwebi 
who was Head of the SSU at the time. 
So that - that in itself allowed for this matter to go forward 
and that is why it was done sort of piecemeal and that is why this one 
20 
went - went to court and not the other matters. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then lastly the Beirut account did 
it operate within or outside the purview of the Auditor-General? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair this - this operated outside 
the - the purview of the Auditor-General and I actually forgot to inform 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 80 of 134 
 
the Chair that the same applies to Westville Travel and One Stop Travel 
and Tours.  These accounts are held within the account of the service 
provider.  It is not audited by the Auditor-General. 
They would not know about this account and it was not 
disclosed to them and the - my assertion - I am of the opinion that the 
reason why it was done that way is exactly to avoid auditing by the - by 
the AG’s Office and it allows then the abuse of those funds. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The - the exclusion of the account from the oversight 
of the Auditor-General is that by law? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair you cannot exclude the 
10 
Auditor-General when it comes to the funds of the State. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  No the reason why I am asking … 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is because you know this is Crime Intelligence.  I 
understand that when it comes to intelligence even in Parliament the 
relevant portfolio committee does not allow the public to attend.  There 
are all kinds of secret things about letter relating to intelligence.  So 
that - that is why I am asking whether - because it is Crime Intelligence 
whether there - there might be an official position to say there is 
another way of - of making sure that things are - money is are not 
20 
abused or there is just - there are just no mechanisms but you are 
saying it should have been disclosed? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair it is a difficult question to 
answer because it could not have been disclosed, because the moment 
you disclose it you’re saying to the Auditor General that I am 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 81 of 134 
 
committing a crime.  So it cannot be disclosed by the people involved. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No but from the beginning, aren’t you saying that 
somebody decided, or some people decided not to be subjected to the 
oversight of the – or disclose it to the Auditor General but it should be 
subject to the oversight of the Auditor General? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   If it is allowed for it should be 
subjected to the oversight of the Auditor General Chair.  What I’ve 
testified regarding that is what was said to Mr Jan Venter as the reason 
for the setting up of this account, the additional account, that it will 
assist them in advancing the work of Crime Intelligence.  In other words 
10 
he thought at the time he is going to be of assistance in fighting crime. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja, then to realise later that ...[intervenes] 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   It wasn’t for – well it might have 
started up that way but it did not end that way and that is where the 
difficulty and the danger lies with this kind of arrangements because 
there’s no oversight on it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   In summary  then of the 
investigations can I – of the 11 investigations that you have presented 
here to the Commission can I ask you to turn to Bundle KK2.3, diagram 
20 
5.  So at diagram 5 of KK2.3 is it correct that this is a reflection of the 
status of investigations as at yesterday, which is the 17 t h of September 
2019. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And can I then ask you to address 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 82 of 134 
 
the status in respect of each of these investigations please? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair let me start with the ones 
that’s not – or let me start at the top of this diagram.  When I am 
referring here to Mdluli convicted that is in respect of the Vosloorus 
case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is in respect of? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   The Vosloorus case which started 
off this investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Then I have if you go from 
10 
clockwise then I have flight reservations, One Stop Travel & Tours, 
Westville Travel, that investigation was never finalised because we did 
not receive all the documentation.  The procurement of vehicles, Joe 
Marks and New World Motors was never finalised for the same reason.  
Lazarus’ promotion and appointments never finalised for the same 
reason, Lazarus abuse of safe house was – it was finalised to a certain 
extent but I cannot continue with it because the documentation is not 
available in the sense that it has been classified. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Are we to understand that it has 
been partially finalised? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   It has been partially finalised yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Then I have ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry what does it mean it is partially finalised? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair maybe you should ask the 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 83 of 134 
 
evidence leader, but I agreed with the answers so .l.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But an investigation is either finalised or not 
finalised. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair unfortunately it does not 
always work like that because as far ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Unless you’re dealing with different individuals 
...[intervenes] 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Different individuals that is 
correct yes and you sit with from my point of view as investigator the 
investigation is only finalised not even after – even if the court case 
10 
starts because there’s always something that you have to follow up on 
so an investigation is – you can get the bulk of the investigation 
finalised but there always pop up something that you need to follow up 
on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   So I would place it in that 
category, it has been finalised but I do not – there is certain things that 
is still outstanding, but the majority work has been done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Then Lazarus and the purchasing 
20 
of vehicles was never finalised. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   For what reason? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   It is for the same reason we did 
not receive all the documentation relating to the purchases, as well as 
the non-declassification of those documents.  Lazarus upgrade to 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 84 of 134 
 
private premises, that is – the same applies there.  Lazarus Marimuto 
that investigation was stopped, was never finalised.  Lazarus safe 
houses the same applies there, it was never finalised, we weren’t able 
to do it, apart from one instance where it deals with the house in 
Gordons Bay which belong to General Mdluli. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And what is the status of that 
investigation? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That forms part of the case that 
needs to be re-enrolled and then in terms of what needs to be re-
enrolled is the Lazarus trips abroad for Mdluli, Mdluli promotions and 
10 
appointments, Atlantis Motors, and those cases are pending.  It was in 
terms of the SCA judgment it was re-enrolled.  Unfortunately during that 
timeframe SAPS was required to declassify documents purposes of the 
trial, they did not and the magistrate decided to remove the case from 
the roll, and unfortunately we cannot place it back on the roll until the 
outstanding matters has been dealt with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was removed from the roll because there were 
some matters that still needed to be attended to before it could 
proceed? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Ja, the matter that – the matters 
20 
that needed to be attended to is the declassification of the 
documentation, so it had to be handed over to the defence which we 
could not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Well this issue of declassification needs to 
be sorted out without delay because it’s holding up too many matters. 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 85 of 134 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair.  We cannot 
use classification as a measure to – not to be investigated, firstly and 
secondly not to be prosecuted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And what is the status of the last 
investigation which is named Atlantis Motors? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   The investigation is finalised – 
sorry there would be two, I see there are two bubbles that goes from I 
didn’t – I missed that now, the Mdluli, the role of Mdluli and in respect 
of the investigation that is finalised that leg needs to be enrolled and it 
10 
is part of that charge sheet.  The Lazarus/Barnard which is pending is 
the one that’s being dealt with and it is a limited, it is only limited to a 
portion of the Atlantis Motors transactions. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Is it therefore to be understood that 
the finalisation of these matters or these investigations and matters 
depends on documents required to be declassified? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair, I am not a 
prosecutor but that is what I am also advised by the prosecutors in the 
matter, and I think it is clear to me as well that there is certain things 
that you do need to place before a court of law in order to prove your 
20 
case. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   For the benefit of your evidence 
going forward then in relation to the classification or rather the 
declassification of documents and the documents that are required for 
purposes of your investigation can we just clarify certain matters for 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 86 of 134 
 
the record as you actually explained to us.  It is understood that there 
are certain documents, as you have mentioned now, which are 
classified 
and 
which 
are 
relevant 
for 
purposes 
of 
finalising 
investigations, is that right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:    That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Now these documents which are 
classified who holds these documents? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair if I may explain it in the 
following way, during the period that General Hankel was available and 
assisted me I received quite a number of documents from him, as part 
10 
of the investigation.  In that process and as more information came out 
I asked for – I would require from him further documentation to either 
prove or disprove the allegation that has been made.  So he then 
provided me with those documents on a continuous basis, up until the 
point that he was transferred. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And when was he transferred, if I 
could direct your attention to paragraph 144 on page 43, as the date 
you have informed us it to be. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair he was transferred on or 
about the 22 n d of November 2011, out of Crime Intelligence together 
20 
with Major General Mtshatsi was the acting head of Crime Intelligence 
at the time.  He – in other words I had documents, classified documents 
in my possession which was provided to me by General Hankel.  Then I 
also requested more documentation, I received some of them, but most 
of them I did not receive, and I did not receive any other documents, 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 87 of 134 
 
classified documents or otherwise from Crime Intelligence since that 
period apart from an affidavit that I took from someone but it did not 
include any documentation, it included the Secret Service account but 
there was no documentation involved in respect of the affidavit that I 
have taken from him. 
 
So I – there are two sets of documents that is relevant here, 
the ones that I do have, that needs to be declassified, and the ones 
that is still in possession of Crime Intelligence that needs to be 
classified and then handed over in a declassified fashion for me to use 
in a court of law. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And so is it then to be understood 
that the – and I hope I am understanding you correctly, the documents 
that you have received through General Hankel and documents that you 
have requested from Crime Intelligence in a declassified form some or 
all of those documents are relevant for purposes of finalising your 
investigations? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair, but there is 
also I mean I have identified more documentation as we went along 
with the continued investigation but yes that is what the situation is. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And just for the sake of clarity have 
20 
you received any cooperation since General Hankel left the position he 
held in CI? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I did not – to me it 
culminated in no cooperation at all from Crime Intelligence, nor from 
SAPS 
management 
in 
respect 
of 
my 
request 
to 
declassify 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 88 of 134 
 
documentation, and as you will see later on in the testimony you will 
see the efforts that we have done or made to get documentation 
declassified and the barriers that were put up every time that you asked 
for documentation to be declassified, or asked for documents to be 
provided in a declassified fashion, unclassified fashion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And is the position that all the documents that have 
not been declassified which are responsible for certain of these 
investigations not being finalised or trials not proceeding are they all 
held by Crime Intelligence? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair in terms of the 
10 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or most? 
MR 
KOBUS 
DEMEYER 
ROELOFSE: 
 
No 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
documentation relating to the investigations where I said it is finalised 
pending the declassification of the documents, most of those classified 
documents are in my possession so I need to have to declassify it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   In respect of the ones that is not 
finalised it is documentation still in the possession of Crime 
Intelligence, they have not provided to me, which were requested on 
20 
previous occasions but it wasn’t provided. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And did you say that the reason why  you don’t 
have the documents is that in regard to some people that you have 
dealt with in regard to the issue of declassification they have told you 
that the documents will not be declassified, but in regard to others that 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 89 of 134 
 
you have dealt with they never gave you an outright no, you would send 
something and then six months later nothing has happened, is that the 
position? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair if I may answer it this way, 
my – the documents that I requested a declassification on from the 
onset related to the matters that I referred to as finalised.  I requested 
the other documents relating to other investigations, it wasn’t given to 
me, so at that point in time I already knew I am not going to get the 
documents, because Crime Intelligence said they are not going to give 
me the documents.   
10 
 
So my focus was on the documentation that I had in my 
possession to get it declassified and if you look at the correspondence 
that I sent to SAPS and Crime Intelligence it deals with those 
documents that held or that dealt with the matters that has been 
finalised and is supposed to go to court. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the matters that have not been finalised because 
documents have not been declassified is the position that in regard to 
those matters which have not been finalised which are reflected upon 
diagram 5 is the position that there is a stalemate, there is nothing 
happening in terms of a process that may lead to the documents being 
20 
declassified? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is the position Chair and the 
same position applies to the documents in my possession that needs to 
be declassified, the same position as the two there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, now is it the Head of Crime Intelligence who 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 90 of 134 
 
does the, who makes the decisions whether to classify or declassify? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair in terms of the missed 
document and the procedures that the South African Police Services 
follow it is the author of the document which in this instance I cannot 
ask, the author of the document are implicated persons in the 
criminality, or the alleged criminality, and the other person is the 
National Commissioner. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   I have seen in some of the 
documents, the confidential documents which was sent to not only the 
10 
Mugollo Commission as well as this Commission that Brigadier Van 
Graan was delegated on behalf of the National Commissioner to 
declassify those documents, so I would assume that the National 
Commissioner has that delegation power to delegate someone to do it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   It has not happened in this 
instance, not in any of the documents, only the documents that was 
required by the two commissions which does not necessarily take the 
criminal matter any further, it points to the non-cooperation or the 
inability of both the SAPS and end player not to investigate and to 
20 
prosecute, it relates more to that than anything else, not to the content 
of the documents used, needed for the criminal matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But where you needed document eight to be 
declassified and they refused but for argument sake the Commission 
approaches them and they declassify it, isn’t the position that it can be 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 91 of 134 
 
used for the purpose of the Commission and you can use it for 
purposes of the criminal matter as well once it has been declassified, 
in other words there is no saying it has only declassified for the 
Commission, it can’t be used in the criminal file, if ...[indistinct] 
classified it it is still classified. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair as I understood it once it is 
declassified it is declassified, there is no provision in this document of 
a document being provisionally declassified, I have not seen that, I 
have not ready it anywhere. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   So I would assume that if it is 
declassified then it is open for use in any – at any forum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   But – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in regard to your matters has the National 
Commissioner of Police been approached and has he refused? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair there is not a short answer 
to that, I deal with it in my evidence later on, but the sum total of my 
evidence comes down to the fact that all the National Commissioners, 
even the acting National Commissioners were approached and none of 
20 
them has declassified the documentation needed for the prosecution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm, mmm.  Okay, now that’s fine.  I think it will be 
important that the Commission be furnished with information that says 
what documents they are, at least insofar as they are relevant to the 
work of the Commission and if they are relevant for the work of the 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 92 of 134 
 
Commission and they have not been declassified and the Commission 
needs them the Commission will approach the relevant authorities to 
get them, and if they get classified, declassified and you need them I 
know of no reason why you can’t have them.  If there is a reason we 
will deal with – we will look at it at that stage if somebody says there is 
a problem, because I think when it is given, when it is given to us my 
understanding is as long as it is declassified anybody can have a look 
at it? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is how I understand it also 
Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja, okay I think then that information would be 
useful to the legal team.   They will indicate to you in terms of your 
statement what the documents that are relevant to the work of the 
Commission, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   At page 43 of your affidavit you now 
turn to the events from March 2012 and in specific you deal with 
disciplinary and criminal proceedings which were referred to the 
Inspector General of Intelligence.  What happened on the 29 t h of 
February 2012 Mr Roelofse? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair on that date and these 
20 
events if I may deals now more with the actions that we undertook to 
get 
the 
documents 
declassified 
and 
the 
roadblocks 
that 
we 
experienced, and I have a date there the events from March 2012. 
 
On the 29 t h of February 2012 Lieutenant General Julius Malefe 
instructed halting of all disciplinary matters relating to General Lazarus 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 93 of 134 
 
and General Mdluli.  He also instructed that all the documents relating 
to the disciplinary matters be handed to the IGI. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   IGI being being the ...[intervenes] 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   The Inspector General of 
Intelligence. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Maybe I should just put that into 
context, General – this was on back of a decision that was made by the 
then Acting National Commissioner ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  The then acting?  
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   The then acting National 
Commissioner who was General Nkunazi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   He, on our request, and when I’m 
talking about our request I am talking about the DPI’s request, we 
asked  him, I asked him through General Jamat to refer the question 
whether the investigation should be dealt with in IGI or investigation 
should be dealt with by the IGI or the South African Police Service to 
refer it to the IGI so that she can make a decision as to where this the 
mandate for this investigation lies.   
20 
 
And this follows from the decision that Advocate Magobi made 
that there is no case to answer and that it falls within the mandate of 
the IGI.  That is why this request was made, so based on that request 
General Molefe then asked that the documents relating to the various 
disciplinary actions as well as then through General Jamat I was 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 94 of 134 
 
requested to provide the IGI with the dockets relating to the looting of 
the SSA fund. 
 
It – this was then referred to – the documents were, the actual 
documents, because I had to give the actual docket to the IGI, it was 
referred to the IGI and after the referral was done and we received an 
answer from the IGI which basically said that they don’t have the 
mandate to do the criminal investigation, it does not fall within their 
mandate, it – the documents were returned to us for further 
investigation as well as to appropriate disciplinary action against the 
members involved, and according to my knowledge no departmental 
10 
investigations took place, apart from General Lazarus who was 
subsequently dismissed after a departmental hearing. 
 
I have been informed that there was a disciplinary hearing that 
dealt with Colonel Barnard, I do not know what the outcome was of that 
disciplinary hearing, I do not know whether it was finalised and I do not 
know if it was finalised what the sanction was, Colonel Barnard is still 
in the employ of SAPS, and General Lazarus ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  So does it look like the outcome was kept secret 
except maybe for people that were closely involved? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I would presume so, I do 
20 
not know what the outcome was, nobody – I have asked but nobody is 
in a position to tell me or nobody wants to say anything.  I don’t know. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Mr Roelofse you gave evidence 
earlier that it was Brigadier Madonsella and Captain Hiralal who were 
involved in the investigations relating to the appointments of the 250 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 95 of 134 
 
recruitment process in 2010. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And that it was through that process 
that it was – there were certain family and friends who were appointed, 
who were so related to General Mdluli, General Lazarus and Mr 
Marimuto. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is also correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Did – what information did you 
receive from Brigadier Madonsella or Captain Hiralal in relation to the 
outcomes of the investigations? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair as I explained earlier we 
exchanged affidavits and information on a regular basis.  I have – I 
have already dealt with the allegations that was investigated by 
Madonsella at an earlier stage in my testimony.  As part of their 
investigations into the 250 appointment process I was also in 
possession of copies of fourteen documents, fourteen criminal case 
dockets.  Now these criminal case dockets came into my possession 
after it was sent back from the IGI to my office, I then saw the criminal 
case dockets, I made copies of those 14 criminal case dockets, and I 
sent the originals back to SAPS. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   What did these criminal case 
dockets concern? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair those case dockets was 
opened by Captain Hiralal in respect of the non-disclosure of criminal 
convictions and civil judgments by the applicants for employment.  The 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 96 of 134 
 
National Commissioner is empowered to condone a disclosure of 
criminal convictions or civil judgments to favour the employment of the 
applicant.  I am not aware of any prior condonation by the National 
Commissioner regarding these appointments.  I have subsequently 
been informed that a condonation has taken place.  But unfortunately 
that condonation cannot include the misrepresentation made as in – as 
– as referred to by Captain Hiralal in the case dockets that he has 
opened.  And I have – I had a chance to look on the criminal CAS the 
criminal administration system which is the police’s CAS system in 
respect of these 14 dockets.  It did not fall within my [indistinct] in 
10 
terms of the investigation but I was interested in terms of what the 
outcome was.  And according to the SAPS criminal administration 
system two of those dockets were closed as undetected, one was 
withdrawn and elven were closed as false.  And as far … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Would – sorry what does the – what 
does undetected, withdrawn and false mean? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   It is used in different – in 
different – in essence it remains – it is the same thing in the sense that 
there is no investigation that is going to continue on the back of closing 
of a docket with these headings.  Withdrawn – a docket that is 
20 
withdrawn would mean that a docket was with the NPA and the decision 
was made whether to prosecute or not.  In terms of a docket that has 
been closed as false it would be a police officer that would close that 
docket as false in other words there is no substantiation for the – for 
the allegation that was made.  And the same applied to undetected.  In 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 97 of 134 
 
this instance there might have been a substantiation for the allegation 
but they cannot find anything or they cannot find the person that was 
implicated in this matter.  I have subsequently – I have given this – I 
have given this information to the commission and I was informed after 
enquiry I think on Monday therefore there is no – there is no mention of 
this that the South African Police Services did in fact give copies to the 
commission which then changes some of the information that I have on 
my – in my affidavit here.  As I was not privy to the – to the dockets 
before it came to the commission.  I did not – I did not receive them.  
And I will have to go through them to see whether paragraph 146.3 is 
10 
still relevant.  Although the ones that I did see there is certain 
questions that I have as to why that matter was withdrawn in the first 
place.  Because more than just the one docket as – as indicated in the 
CAS administration system has been with the NPA for a decision and 
not only the one.  So I will have to go back and have a look at exactly 
what had happened there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can I take you back to the matters that were referred 
to the IGI and they subsequently came back to you.  As I understood 
you; you said is it Colonel Barnard?  You understood that he was 
subjected to a disciplinary hearing but you do not know the outcome? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair.  I do not 
know the outcome.  If – Ja I do not know whether a disciplinary was – 
had taken place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   I was told one was taken – I was 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 98 of 134 
 
told that one took place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   So I do not – I cannot confirm 
that one has taken place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot say for sure, yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   But I do not know about the 
outcome either yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But with – is it with regard to General Mdluli 
that you were saying there was no disciplinary hearing that happened? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   No disciplinary hearing had 
10 
happened in – with regards to General Mdluli Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that one you know? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes that one I know because… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   I was never asked for the 
documentation by the SAPS. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   To prove or disprove his 
involvements in certain of these incidents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   So they could not have done it 
without the documentation that I have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  But in regard to him who would have been 
the person to make the decision that he must face a disciplinary inquiry 
or hearing? 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 99 of 134 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair at the time it would have 
been the Acting National Commissioner. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And at that time was it General Mkwanazi? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  And in regard to Barnard is it the same 
person – the Acting National Commissioner who would have had the 
decision – the part to make the decision as well? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair with regards to him it would 
have been the Divisional Commissioner it would have been sufficient at 
Crime Intelligence itself ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Chair I have been informed that we 
have exceeded the time on one o’clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   But guided by you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Roelofse I mentioned to Ms September this 
morning that I have some matter that I need to attend to and would like 
us to adjourn earlier than normal.  Normally I adjourn at four.   I 
understand that tomorrow is still another day that is scheduled for your 
evidence.  Is that correct Ms September? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I was thinking that if it is fine with you then 
maybe we could and also with Ms September we could take the lunch 
break at two and continue and cover some ground and then take the – 
adjourn for the day at two o’clock and then continue tomorrow.  But it 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 100 of 134 
 
may well be that there is more than enough time tomorrow I am not 
sure you would have a better idea. What is your sense? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   My sense is that we could. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We might need – or maybe we should… 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   We may – we may finish tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or we may even need to start early to make up for … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes I would appreciate that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For the time.  Mr Roelofse how does that sound to 
you, is that fine with you? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chairperson I am a civil servant.  
10 
If the boss say I can go home early I go home early. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But is it fine if we… 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   It is fine with me Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If we continue until two o’clock? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it fine with you? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You not starving too much? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You not starving too much? 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   If we can start early tomorrow I 
would appreciate it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes ja, ja.  Okay alright then let us – let us continue 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 101 of 134 
 
if that is fine then until two o’clock. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   As it pleases Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Mr Roelofse you mentioned that the 
National Commissioner is empowered to condone a disclosure of 
criminal conviction or civil judgment. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or a nondisclosure? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Nondisclosure of criminal conviction 
or civil judgment. 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   No I think it is the disclosure of 
criminal conviction in the application. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Okay.  And so to just then unpack 
that to make sure we understand? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I just want to make sure I follow.  Is it a 
condonation of … 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   The disclosure of… 
CHAIRPERSON:  An earlier nondisclosure.   
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in other words a disclosure is happening later than 
20 
it should have happened? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair it is a disclosure of a 
criminal conviction in the application for a current job within the South 
African Police Services.  In other words the person would disclose his 
previous conviction in that application to get – to be appointed within a 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 102 of 134 
 
specific post within the South African Services. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so – so it is – it is – it is not a situation where 
somebody was supposed to have disclosed at an earlier stage that they 
have a criminal conviction for example and only disclose it later.  It is a 
simply that you – when you are applying for a job you disclose that you 
have a criminal conviction and then you ask the commissioner to 
condone … 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   And then you get appointed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Condone I guess not the disclosure but condone the 
fact that you have a criminal conviction. 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   And what then happened in this 
instance there was no disclosure.  In other words they were appointed 
without the – without the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  A disclosure of… 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Employer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Knowing about the criminal 
conviction and that is the case docket that was opened because the 
20 
security – the vetting was done on the 250 posts this – these were the 
anomalies that was identified people having a criminal conviction but 
not disclosing on their application form. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   So then there has to a disclosure in 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 103 of 134 
 
order for there to be something to condone? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair.  And then 
based on that the National Commissioner can apply his or her mind 
whether this person is still a fit and proper person to be appointed 
within the South African Police Services. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   But if there is no disclosure such 
nondisclosure cannot be condoned? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Well it means that the 
nondisclosure is now – is now condoned Ipso Facto it is now condoned 
after the fact.  It does not erase the misrepresentation that was made 
10 
on the application itself of the nondisclosure and that is where the 
problem lies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Probably the condonation might be the term that they 
use but effectively from what I hear it seems that it is a waiver maybe.  
So normally you would not be employed if you have a criminal 
conviction 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – but if the National Commissioner says I have 
considered everything it is fine then you can be employed? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   But without the – that information 
the National Commissioner cannot apply his/her mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because he or she would not know. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Did not know and it was not 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 104 of 134 
 
disclosed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   In relation to the fourteen criminal 
dockets you have highlighted two matters in paragraph 146.4. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Can you please take the Chair 
through these two that you have highlighted? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair the two that I highlighted 
deals with Mr Nkosama Ximba as well as Ms – I do not want to be 
disrespectful but I am going to butcher this – the first name. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Nonhlanhla. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Nonhlanhla Portia Mhlatlozi [?].  
These two individuals are related.  Mr Ximba was promoted – resigned 
from SAPS he was appointed on the 6 t h April – sorry he resigned from 
SAPS on the 26 t h April 2018.  He was promoted from Constable Level 4 
to Colonel Level 12 in the 250 posts – 250 appointment process.  He 
did not disclose his criminal conviction or the civil judgment that he had 
in his application.  His – as I said his sister Ms Mhlatlozi [?] she was – 
she also had a criminal conviction and she did not disclose same. 
However I want to refer back to 140 – paragraph 146.3.  This is now 
20 
subject to me having a look at the actual – because I have not been 
able to – have not had time to have a look at the actual dockets.  It was 
sent to SAPS.  I sent to the commission to see whether these two case 
dockets was actually referred to the NPA for the decision.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   But where is the underlying 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 105 of 134 
 
documents relevant to these two – or rather where are the dockets?  
These are criminal dockets, is that correct? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair.  I am – I 
based my affidavit on the copies of the documentation of the dockets 
that I had in my possession. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And you received those dockets – 
when did you receive those documents? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   I received – I made copies of 
those dockets at the time when it was returned from the IGI to my office 
for the IGI to make a decision whether this – whether the mandate for 
10 
the investigation lies with the SAPS or with the IGI, the Criminal 
Investigation. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And so the… 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   So I had copies of that – those 
dockets in my possession for that timeframe. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And so the current status of the 
investigation in relation to Colonel Nkosana Ximba and Ms Nonhlanhla 
Portia Mhlatlozi [?] is unclear to you as at today? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Exactly Chair.  As I said I 
provided the commission with the relevant case numbers.  They 
20 
requested it from SAPS and I was advised that it was given to the 
commission so I just want to have a look at it to make sure that the 
information that I have now is the same as the information that I had at 
the time when I copies these dockets. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   In this regard what is the current 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 106 of 134 
 
status of these investigations? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE: Well Chair from the little bit that I 
see I only saw the front part of the docket.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   It would seem that as I said I will 
have to go through each one now to see what the outcome was but it 
would seem from what I – from my first glance that more dockets went 
to the NPA for a decision than – that was in – that has been indicated 
in the SAPS Criminal Administration System. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Okay. 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   So the question regarding the 
matter being withdrawn is important because if it was before the NPA a 
decision might have been taken regarding the fact that there is not 
sufficient evidence to continue which then deals with the application 
itself.  In terms of that misrepresentation.  So I will have to have a look 
at that. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you.  We are on page 45 now 
of your affidavit where you now focus two specific investigations. The 
road map however to the rest of your affidavit really talks to the 
interference that you have encountered in your investigations, is that 
20 
right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And is it to be understood that this 
interference was not only through individuals representing institutions 
but also through people that you were investigating at the time? 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 107 of 134 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Is it also to be understood that the 
interference was specific to certain matters or into the bigger matter of 
your investigation into the abuse of Secret Services Account? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair it was – it related to the 
bigger matter of the Secret Service – investigation to the Secret 
Services Account and I – and I am of the opinion that the reason why 
that had happened is the fact that if it was only – only affected General 
Mdluli and General Lazarus I do not think we would have had the 
pushback that we had in terms of this investigation.  Because it goes 
10 
beyond those two individuals. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   If we can then look to the first 
investigation and that is at paragraph M which is titled The Specialised 
Commercial Crimes Unit, Criminal Proceedings, General Mdluli and 
Colonel Barnard.  Please remind the Chair to which investigation this 
refers? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   I will do so.  Chair just before I 
answer that question I just want to inform the Chair that the allegations 
that I refer to in the previous part what I testified now is in domain – is 
in the domain of the South African Police Service.  I have written many 
20 
memorandums.  I informed the senior management regarding these 
allegations.  It is not a question that this is new.  These allegations are 
known to them.  So it – that is why this is – to me it is a very important 
issue.  It is the fact that this has been known it not something new 
within the circles of the South African Police Force. 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 108 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   And I think this is just – this is 
the precursor for the evidence that I am going to – to give now 
regarding what we did and what we tried to do to get the documentation 
or the investigations finalised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no that is fine.  No I think the legal team will 
need to get all the information from you in terms of where exactly you 
have not been given cooperation on matters that are you know you 
should be getting cooperation and as long as they are definitely 
relevant for us the commission will seek to get those documents and if 
10 
somebody believes that there are proper legal grounds why the 
commission should not get them then they will have to tell us those 
grounds.  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The context of your evidence now is 
specific to this investigation. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And you are about to just clarify 
what this investigation concerned? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair if I may? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you do that may I just check whether this falls 
20 
under the – that judgment of Judge Murphy that is in the – in the 
bundle. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That went up to the Supreme Court of Appeal. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair. 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 109 of 134 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes Chair it falls under that ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes. In fact thanks to you Judge if 
we could then talk to what happened on the 17 November 2011. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am sorry.  Those matters where there are 
judgments there would be certain findings that have already been made 
which stand – I think the way you deal with them need not be as if it is 
a new matter that has not gone through the courts.  There may be 
certain perspectives that are important for the commission that may not 
10 
have been important for the courts.  But I think it is important just to 
know where there are findings that have made and there is no 
controversy about those findings so that we do not spend too much time 
on matters where findings have been made and there is no controversy 
about them. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   As it pleases Chair.  My 
understanding of this part of the evidence is specific to the interference 
that Mr Roelofse encountered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   When investigating this matter. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   But now… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the focus is more on the interference? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   On the interference. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 110 of 134 
 
ADV 
VERUSCHKA 
SEPTEMBER: 
 
 And 
specifically 
that 
that 
interference was borne out of the office of the NPA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   As compared to interferences he 
encountered elsewhere. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that is fine.  That is fine. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And so thank – through your 
direction Chair is it correct that on the 17 t h November 2011 General 
Mdluli made representations to Advocate Lawrence Mrwebe who was 
the Head of the Specialised Commercial Crime Unit at the time? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair that is correct. He made 
representations to Advocate Mrwebe. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And did you have sight of… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I think in order so that everybody 
understands and those who will read the transcript understand.  I think 
just connect the issue.  What was – what charges were pending or – 
before the Mr Mrwebe – Advocate Mrwebe in respect of which Mr Mdluli 
was – Jerome Mdluli was making representations.  Let us hear that first 
then we can understand what the representations were about. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair if I may break it into three 
20 
categories?  The first category relates to the Vosloorus case which is 
the murder case.  It stands separate.  The second category is the - 
what I would call the looting of the SSA fund. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   The looting of the Secret Services 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 111 of 134 
 
Account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes, ja. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   But that one is – is split into two.  
Initially when we started the investigation into this – into the account it 
related to the vehicle – the vehicle that General Mdluli – his private 
vehicle that was sold and traded in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Traded in. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Traded in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   So the – the investigation or the 
10 
criminal matter was focused in terms of that specific transaction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   And that is what went to court so 
the representations that we talking about here would have been relating 
to that transaction only and the – and the trade in of the vehicle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Because we did not have at that 
time the complete picture. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The other matters. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Because we have not spoken to 
20 
Naidoo at that point in time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Okay.  And – and in regard to that 
transaction was it a charge of fraud or what? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   The charges were as far as I can 
remember fraud and corruption Chair. 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 112 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  You may continue then. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you Chair.  So it is on the 
17 t h November 2011 that the representations were made to Advocate 
Lawrenc Mrwebe? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right?  And it is common cause that Advocate 
Mrwebe recommended or rather directed that the charges be withdrawn 
which was the subject of court decisions that was subsequently taken? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I do not know if common cause is accurate or do 
10 
you not want to say it was a finding made by the courts?  Because I 
think Mr Mrwebe was saying something else if I recall correctly. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   It was – thank you Chair.  Then to 
correct for the record it was a finding that the decision to withdraw was 
in fact overturned by the courts. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   If we look to Advocate Mrwebe’s 
memorandum which substantiates the decision that he took to withdraw 
the charges can I ask you to turn to page 140 please.  Is this the 
memorandum that was drafted by Advocate Mrwebe? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   It does inform that the date of this 
memorandum is dated 4 December 2011? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Is it also correct that there was an 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 113 of 134 
 
issue around this date which was interrogated in the Mokgoro 
Commission? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair.  The 4 t h 
December is on a Sunday and as far as I can remember the testimony 
of Advocate Mrwebe it should have been on the 5 t h which is the 
Monday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. Oh. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   But there was also an interrogation 
during the Mokgoro Commission. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   On whether or not the consultation 
he did was done so timeously? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   If I could ask you to turn to page or 
rather just for the record that the – this memorandum subject title is 
Consultative Note in terms of the Section 24.3 of the National 
Prosecuting Authority Act 32 or 1998 NPA Act on the representations of 
Lieutenant General Mdluli case number 111//137/2011.  If I ask you to 
turn to page 141.  Second paragraph third line. Can you please read 
that – the rest of that paragraph into the record? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   It starts with the representations? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Correct. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:    
“The representations are for the withdrawal of the 
criminal case against their client based on the 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 114 of 134 
 
grounds that the institution of an investigation and 
prosecution against him is an abuse of the Criminal 
Justice System.  Constitutes a gross abuse of power 
and authority and that their client will not receive a 
fair trial. The purpose of this document therefore is 
to deal with and record a decision on the matter.  It 
is the further aim that the document shall serve as a 
consultative document with the Director of Public 
Prosecutions North Gauteng as required by Section 
24.3 of the NPA Act.” 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   At paragraph 3 it is documented that 
a certain Lieutenant Colonel Peter Janse Viljoen was the investigator in 
this matter. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair he was one of the members 
– he was the member that – that came with me to Gauteng.  He was the 
one that drafted the affidavit in respect of what Mr Mrwebe – Advocate 
Mrwebe are referring to yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   So this is certainly a matter that you 
were involved in as well? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes, yes Chair that is – that is 
20 
our matter if I can – if I can put it like that. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   After dealing then with the 
background to the matter to which you have already given some of that 
evidence and after addressing the basis for the request for the 
withdrawal of the charges which you have just summarised Advocate 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 115 of 134 
 
Mrwebe deals with the prosecutor’s report and docket before turning to 
an analysis and his conclusion at page 145 of this document.  Can I ask 
you to read paragraph 13 and 14 please into the record? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair paragraph 13: 
“The representations in the first part suggest that 
the investigation and prosecution of Mdluli in the 
matter is for - is for an ulterior purpose.  In this 
regard and without expressing any opinion where 
this has to be true or not I think our law is very 
clear in this regard as the courts have stated that in 
10 
the - that the motive behind the prosecution is 
irrelevant and such an improper or ulterior - ulterior 
motive does not affect the prosecution against 
person.  Such prosecution will be wrongful if in 
addition there are - there are no reasonable and - 
and probable grounds for such prosecution - if in 
addition there are no reasonable grounds - no 
reasonable and proper grounds for such in the 
prosecution.  I refer in this regard to the case of the 
NDPP vs Zuma (SCA) 573/08 - (paragraphs 37 to 
20 
38).  The second part/basis of the representations 
which relates to fairness of the trial is one - is the 
one that seems to suggest that there were no 
reason and - and probable grounds for such 
prosecution against Mdluli.  In my view this is the 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 116 of 134 
 
part that merits close attention.  Clearly from the 
affidavit from L Viljoen which was used as the basis 
for the warrant of arrest as well as in the docket 
there is no evidence against Mdluli.  The only thing 
one finds is the opinion expressed by Viljoen in his 
affidavit that the inference is irresistible that 
Barnard and Mdluli transpired to use this money to 
cover Mdluli’s debt.  This in itself amounts - this - 
this in itself amounts to fraud and theft.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And of importance is paragraph 17 
10 
which I ask you to read as you have actually referred to in your 
affidavit as well. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair it states the following: 
“However because of the view I hold of the matter I 
do not propose to traverse the merits of the case 
and the other questions - and other questions 
further.  Whether there was evidence in the matter 
or not is in my view not important for my decision in 
the matter.  The proposition which I allude - allude 
to below should alone and without any further ado 
20 
be dispositive of the matter.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then lastly at paragraph 18.  It is 
with your leave it reads: 
“Mdluli and Barnard are members of the Crime 
Intelligence Division of the South African Police 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 117 of 134 
 
Service which is part of the intelligence structures 
of the country and as their conduct and activities 
are subject to the laws, regulations, policies and 
procedures governing the intelligence community.” 
At paragraph 20 the final decision in this regard is recorded 
to be that: 
“It will be noted that the offences for Mdluli as 
charged fall squarely within the mandate of the 
Inspector-General as quoted.” 
And paragraph 21 talks about: 
10 
“The practical and policy considerations for the 
Inspector-General to be the one to deal with the 
matter.” 
If I can ask you lastly or rather on this point what was your 
concern in relation to the office of the Inspector-General or rather what 
was 
your 
concern 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
involvement 
of 
the 
Inspector-General in this matter? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair I had no concern about the 
involvement of the Inspector-General in this matter.  In fact the 
Inspector-General after this information came to light we - I was 
20 
interviewed extensively by the Inspector-General but this was after 
Naidoo - Colonel Naidoo’s information came to light but prior to that I 
did not have a - a view on the Inspector-General itself or whether it is 
their mandate or not. 
For me it was a question is this going to be investigated and 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 118 of 134 
 
are - the people are going to be held accountable.  So when Mr Mdluli - 
Mr - Advocate Mrwebi stated that it falls under the - the auspices of the 
Inspector-General I did not agree with that because I thought it was 
wrong.  It - it does not state within the IGI Act or the Oversight Act that 
the mandate to investigate a criminal matter lies with the IGI. 
So - but I - I did not have a problem that the matter be 
referred to the IGI for a decision and hence that we requested that the 
IGI be involved and that - and that she make - makes a decision on - on 
the assumption that or on the - based on the reason that 
Advocate Mrwebi advised and that is why the documentation or the 
10 
dockets was referred to the IGI for - for exactly that. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I can ask you at page 1-4-8 
paragraph 22.  Notwithstanding your understanding of the involvement 
of the IGI Advocate Mrwebi did not share your view in that at paragraph 
22 six lines down beginning with any investigation can I ask you to read 
that part into the record please? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  “Any investigation of the 
crime as in the present case would be futile without 
the involvement of the Inspector-General as the 
transactions which Mdluli is charged with can only 
20 
be explained in terms of the internal applicable 
procedures, policies, processes and systems which 
the ordinary investigator has no access to.  One 
may ask why the police failed to execute search 
warrants.” 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 119 of 134 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then at paragraph 1-4-9 - 
paragraph - page 1-4-9 paragraph 26. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  “I am afraid that on the 
face 
of it, it 
appears 
that 
the 
manner 
the 
investigators went about dealing with this matter 
assisted 
by 
the 
members 
of 
the 
National 
Prosecuting Authority may possibly be in breach of 
the Security Legislation.  However as it appears 
that everybody concerned in this matter must have 
committed a bona fide error of law in this regard.  It 
10 
is not too late to remedy the situation by referring 
the matter to the Inspector-General in terms of 
Section 7 of the Act.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And accordingly the - it was his 
instruction 
that 
the 
charges 
be 
withdrawn 
against 
both 
Lieutenant-General Mdluli and Colonel Barnard immediately? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
Did 
you 
have 
sight 
of 
General Mdluli’s representations? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair I did have sight of those 
20 
representations. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And we are back at page 45 of your 
affidavit. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  I just need to clarify I did not have 
- I did not have sight of the representations at the time.  I only had 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 120 of 134 
 
sight of it afterwards. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And were there any … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You only - I am sorry.  You only had sight of …? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Of the representations afterwards. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh later. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  After a decision was taken already 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is the only time I - I had sight 
of those … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Representations. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is the - I am sorry. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is the - is the normal procedure not that before the 
NPA would make a decision such as that they would favour you with 
representations and ask for your comment or does that sometimes 
happen but sometimes does not happen? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair it - it happens sometimes 
20 
but I mean there is still a decision that - that has to be made by the 
NPA.  I can - I can merely comment on it but what I do expect and that 
is - that is - that normally - that is what normally happens.  Is that in a 
matter like this which is a - a high profile matter that at least the 
prosecutor as well as the investigating officer in the matter needs to be 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 121 of 134 
 
contacted and needs to be - what is the word I am looking for.  Not talk 
to.  It needs to be interviewed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Transferred? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Ja.  It needs to be consulted … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, consulted.  Ja. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  With respect to a decision that is 
going to be made in this regard … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Because the - the prosecutor 
10 
already made its decision that there are enough grounds to prosecute 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  And it is a prima facie case and he 
has drawn up a - a charge sheet to effect that and then you get a 
finding like this and it has not been discussed with you because 
basically what Advocate Mrwebi is saying is that both my - both 
Advocate Smith who was the prosecutor and myself committed a - a 
crime. 
We did something illegal and so I would have expected him to 
20 
discuss that with us.  It never happened. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
Your 
consideration 
of 
the 
representations at a later stage did it highlight any - did you - do you 
have any observations when comparing or reconciling the memorandum 
of Advocate Mrwebi and General Mdluli? 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 122 of 134 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE: 
 
Chair 
there 
- 
I 
made 
two 
observations.  The one is that General - General Mdluli in his 
representation never referred to the IGI as having oversight and the 
mandate 
to 
investigate 
the 
matter 
and 
secondly 
the 
- 
their 
representation dealt with the fact that he is being let us call it targeted 
and he is being victimised in terms of this specific investigation. 
That he is the target of a - a plot and it did not - it does not 
deal with the IGI.  So when Mr Mrwebi states that that was part of the 
representations it was not part of the representations that I saw and 
which he based his decision on.  So I do not know where he actually 
10 
get that from.  I cannot - I cannot comment. 
What I do know is that the question of the IGI was raised in 
the representations made to SAPS with regards to disciplinary 
proceedings.  So it might be that Advocate Mrwebi had sight of both.  I 
do not know. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  What did you as the investigator do 
then once you received the decision of Advocate Mrwebi? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair I actually did not even - I 
was informed on the - I think the day before that the matter had to go 
back to the court for further - had to appear - General - General Mdluli 
20 
had to appear in court.  He and Colonel Barnard.  I think it was the day 
before they appeared. 
I was informed that the matter is going to be withdrawn.  I 
was not given a reason because I think at the time the prosecutor also 
did not have a reason but what did transpire and this I learnt 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 123 of 134 
 
afterwards.  Is that Advocate Mrwebi has already informed the legal 
representative of General Mdluli that the matter will be withdrawn. 
That was prior to him having a consultation with the DPP - 
Advocate Mzinyathi because that is what Act says.  He must have - he 
must do - it is a consultative process with him.  So he informed him 
already prior to that.  So at the - they had a decision as I was informed 
the decision was made to withdraw the matter and to place it later back 
on the roll because they - the defence already had a letter stating that 
the matter will be withdrawn. 
So we - the NPA did not have choice but to withdraw the 
10 
matter on that day. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And as the investigator what did you 
do when you received the decision of Advocate Mrwebi?  Did you 
interrogate 
any 
authority 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
Office 
of 
the 
Inspector-General? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair as I - I think I have already 
testified to this.  I - I requested General Dramat to approach the 
National Commissioner or the Acting National Commissioner at the time 
so that the matter can be referred to the IGI for a decision whether it 
falls within their mandate or not. 
20 
I strongly believe that it did not fall within their mandate but I 
was not going to give this - I was - I was going to - I was still going to 
refer it because if it is an issue then we need to deal with it and need 
to decide who is - who is actually involved in the investigation or who 
actually has the mandate. 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 124 of 134 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And on page 46 paragraph 153.  Is it 
correct that you received a response from the IGI or rather the IGI 
responded to General Mkhwanazi’s letter on 19 March 2012? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  The IGI did 
respond to that letter.  The IGI advised that the reasoning followed by 
the - and - and in this regard Advocate Mrwebi was fundamentally 
wrong and that the SAPS must refer the matter - the matter back to the 
NPA.  A copy of the letter is attached to this affidavit as Annexure 
KDR09. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I ask you to turn to page 1-5-7 
10 
please?  Is this the letter that you refer to? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  For the record can I ask you to read 
paragraphs 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 into the record please? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair it starts at 2.1: 
“The 
Inspector-General 
of 
Intelligence 
(“IGI”) 
derives a mandate from the Constitution of the 
Republic of South Africa 1996 and the Intelligence 
Services Oversight Act of 1994 Act 40 of 1994 
which provides for the monitoring of the - of the 
20 
intelligence and counter intelligence activities of 
the 
intelligence 
services. 
 
Any 
investigation 
conducting by the Inspector-General is for the 
purpose of intelligence oversight which must - 
which must result in a report containing findings 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 125 of 134 
 
and recommendations.  The mandate of the IGI 
does not extend to criminal investigations which are 
court driven and neither can the IGI - and neither 
can the IGI assist the police in conducting criminal 
investigations. 
 
The 
mandate 
of 
a 
criminal 
investigation lay solely with the police.  As such we 
are of the opinion the reasons advanced by the NPA 
in support of the withdrawal of the criminal charges 
are inaccurate and legally flawed.  We therefore 
recommend that this matter be referred to the NPA 
10 
for the institution of criminal charges.” 
Signed by Ambassador Advocate F D Radebe. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And thus it was as at 19 March 2012 
and from that date going forward that there ought to have been no 
misunderstanding or query in relation to what the mandate is of the 
Inspector-General of Intelligence’s Office? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And further through the clarity of the 
office of the IGI it also ought to have been - it was clarified that it fell 
within the mandate of the police to investigate criminal matters? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  It is correct that this letter refers - is 
a response to the letter received from Lieutenant-General Mkhwanazi.  
Is that right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 126 of 134 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And that letter is to be found at page 
1-5-4.  Is that right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In particular on page 1-5-5 in the 
second paragraph mention is made of the importance of this clarity as 
to who holds what mandate.  Can I ask you to read the second 
paragraph into the record please? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  The one that starts with: 
“It must be mentioned …” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Correct. 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  “It must be mentioned 
that 
an 
investigation 
in 
respect 
of 
Major-
General Lazarus which may rise - which may rise 
from same - from the same concerns as in the 
Mdluli matter has also been finalised and it is 
proposed that we are - that we also engage on that 
matter in the same fashion as in - as is proposed in 
respect of the Mdluli matter.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then the last sentence of the 
next paragraph.  It - which begins … 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  “It is however important 
that you express yourself clearly on the contents of 
the arguments contained in the letter of the Special 
Director of Public Prosecutions as it not only 
relates to the matters at hand but also how similar 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 127 of 134 
 
situations need to be dealt with in future.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And in your consideration of the 
letter that was received from the Office of the IGI did this - did the 
contents of this letter give the clarity so requested? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes Chair.  There is no confusion 
as to what their mandates are. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If we could go back to page 46.  
Once this clarity was received by letter of the IGI what steps did you 
take on 23 March 2012? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair I asked that the matter be 
10 
referred back through the Office of General Dramat to the Office of the 
Acting National - Acting National Director of Public Prosecutions the 
NDPP which was in Advocate Nomgcobo Jiba at the time. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Nomgcobo Jiba. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Nomgcobo Jiba.  I am truly sorry 
and the SSU for a decision following the opinion of the IGI.  A copy of 
this letter is attached as Annexure KDR10 without the annexure - 
without the annexure referred to therein. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And without referring to it Chair.  It 
does appear at - at page 160.  Unless you wish us to refer to the letter 
20 
itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is that? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The letter that was requested by Mr - 
by General - by Colonel Roelofse to be sent to the NDPP’s Office - 
Advocate Nomgcobo Jiba. 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 128 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page is it? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  It is on page 1-6-0. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1-6-0? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  This letter is dated 23 March 2012.  
Is that correct? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  At paragraph 2 of this letter it 
informs to attach the response from the Inspector-General of 
10 
Intelligence’s Office? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Is that the document that you had 
referred to earlier which is dated 19 March 2012 and which you read 
into the record? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So then at least insofar as the date 
of 
the 
letter 
is 
concerned 
on 
receipt 
of 
this 
letter 
Advocate Nomgcobo Jiba would have been aware of the clarity on 
mandate? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  That is why 
I specifically asked General Dramat to write to the - the Acting NDPP 
due to the fact that she has to review a decision made by 
Advocate Mrwebi and that is why it was addressed to her. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Who responded to this letter? 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 129 of 134 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair Advocate Mrwebi responded 
to this letter.  I do not know - there is a copy.  He was also an 
addressee on - on the letter itself but he responded and not - not 
Advocate Jiba. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And if I can then take you to page 
1-6-2 is this the letter that you refer to? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And this is the letter that was sent by 
Advocate L S Mrwebi 
dated 
30 March 2012 
to 
Lieutenant-General Dramat and copied to Advocate G Breytenbach, 
10 
Advocate S Mzinyathi. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The subject title being Silverton CAS 
155/07/2011, investigations against Lieutenant-General R N Mdluli? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  It is correct though that although it is 
specific to General Mdluli there was another accused in this matter? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And what is the essence of this 
letter? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair if I may I will start with 
paragraph 2 and I will read into the record: 
“I wish to advise that the Office of the Inspector-
General of Intelligence has no oversight functions 
and powers of review with regard to prosecutorial 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 130 of 134 
 
decisions.  I also wish to remind that the NPA is an 
independent institution and prosecutorial decisions 
are its sold prerogative.” 
Paragraph 3: 
“The view of the IGI following your solicitation - 
solicitation of an opinion on the NPA decision on 
the matter based on a document which the police or 
anybody were not even legally entitled to possess 
is for your consumption and does not affect the 
decision taken on the matter.  The NPA took a 
10 
principle 
decision 
- 
principle 
and 
considered 
decision on the matter with fear or favour or 
prejudice as it - as it is required to do so in terms 
of the law.  That decision stands and this matter is 
closed.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
Is 
this 
letter 
addressed 
to 
Advocate Jiba? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  No Chair.  It is not addressed to 
Advocate Jiba.  It is only addressed to the addressees that you have 
mentioned 
earlier. 
 
It 
is 
Lieutenant-General Dramat, 
20 
Advocate Breytenbach and Advocate Mzinyathi. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So do you know whether or not this 
letter ever came to the attention of Advocate Jiba? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  I do not know Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I could ask you to go back to then 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 131 of 134 
 
page 47 of your affidavit? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Sorry.  To page? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  47.  Did you receive any internal 
memorandums that were prepared in relation to the decision of 
Advocate Mrwebi? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes Chair I did.  I received an 
internal memorandum dated 13 April 2013 - 2012 that was prepared by 
Advocate Breytenbach and Advocate Jan Ferreira Deputy Director SSU 
Pretoria both from the SSU in Pretoria.  The memorandum is addressed 
to Advocate Jiba, Advocate Mrwebi and others. 
10 
It 
requests 
Advocate Jiba 
to 
review 
the 
decision 
of 
Advocate Mrwebi and to - to allow them to reenrol the matter.  A copy 
of this internal memorandum is attached to this affidavit as Annexure 
KDR12. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then can I ask you to turn to 
page 1-6-5 please?  Do you recognise the document at page 1-6-5? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE: 
 
I 
do 
Chair. 
 
This 
is 
the 
memorandum 
that 
was 
prepared 
by Advocates Breytenbach and 
Ferreira. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And what are the key observations 
20 
that you have in relation to this document before there are certain 
aspects to be highlighted? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair the key observation or 
observations would - would be that they do not concur with 
Advocate Mrwebi that there is no prima facie case and secondly that 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 132 of 134 
 
the matter must be placed back on the roll for prosecution. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I can … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the memo at 1-6-5? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From G Breytenbach and Ferreira? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
For 
the 
record 
this 
- 
this 
memorandum is dated 13 April 2012? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I ask you to turn to page 1-6-8 
please?  Is it correct that this memorandum records that? 
“We would argue that there is no empowering 
provision in the NPA Act that gave the SDPP the 
power to take the decision to withdraw the 
prosecution.” 
If one then continues or rather the memorandum continues to 
address the withdrawal of the case against Mdluli and Barnard and in 
so doing at page 1-7-0 paragraph 14 it records in the first line that: 
“We hold the view that the instruction to withdraw 
20 
the case against the two accused was bad in law 
and in fact illegal.” 
Three lines from the bottom the sentence begins that: 
“In any event the agreement at the time was a 
provisional withdrawal with a distinct intention of 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 133 of 134 
 
re-enrolling the matter once the concerns of the 
SDPP had been addressed.  It has now transpired 
that the SDP views the matter as closed.” 
Having considered the merits of the matter comprehensively is it 
correct that at page 187 paragraph 42 this memorandum concludes to 
call for the decision of the acting NDPP to consider the withdrawal 
decision of Advocate Mugwebe. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair, to 
reconsider this issue. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Reconsider and the acting NDPP at 
10 
the time was who? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Advocate Jiba. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms September to the extent that you are dealing with 
the contents of a document such as this it is not going to be 
controversial what the document says so you don’t really have to get 
him to confirm what he says because what he says it says we can see, 
you can just tell me what the conclusion is and unless you want him to 
comment on something that is there but not just to confirm what he 
says. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   As it pleases Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are at one minute to two, do you still have a 
question? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   I’m happy to stop at this stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you want to finish it is fine, if it is one or two 
questions. 
18 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 166 
 
Page 134 of 134 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   There is still a bit, there is still a bit 
of correspondence at least to work through on this aspect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, then maybe we should stop here and then we will 
continue tomorrow. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we at page 46 of his affidavit now? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   We are on page 47 Chair, and we 
have just completed paragraph 158. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and his affidavit goes to page 72 so we’re left 
with about what, is it 32 pages or 22 pages?  How is your arithmetic? 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:  How is your arithmetic, are we left with 22 or 32 
pages? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Not great at this time of the day 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, Mr Roelofse we will stop at this stage, and we 
will continue tomorrow, maybe we should say half past nine tomorrow 
rather than nine o’clock, so let us start at nine thirty tomorrow. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Nine thirty it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, we adjourn for the day.  We adjourn. 
20 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 19 SEPTEMBER 2019
