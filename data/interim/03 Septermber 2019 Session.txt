PROCEEDINGS ON 3 SEPTEMBER 2019 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good Morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  This morning I am going to hand down my 
decision or deliver my decision in an application that was brought by 
Ms Jabulela Elizabeth Sishuba for certain relief that I will deal with 
shortly.  Before I do so is there anything you wish to say Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and I… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I think notification was given to Ms Sishuba’s 
attorneys.  Thank you.  When Mr Angelo Agrizzi testified before this 
commission earlier this year on one or two of the days part of the 
evidence that he gave related to or included persons that he said had 
received bribes from Bosasa within the Department of Correctional 
Services and he mentioned or suggested that one of those persons was 
Ms Jabulela Elizabeth Sishuba who was employed by the Department of 
Correctional Services at a certain time.  Since then Ms Sishuba has 
brought an application to this commission in terms of which she has 
asked for an order that Mr Agrizzi should be called back to the 
20 
commission to give evidence and to state that she that is Ms Sishuba 
never received any payments or bribes from Bosasa or any of the 
entities relating to Bosasa or if he is unable to say so then she sought 
leave to cross-examine him. Ms Sishuba’s application was given to Mr 
Agrizzi who deposed to an affidavit subsequently in which he made it 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 3 of 150 
 
quite clear that he had made an error in suggesting that Ms Sishuba 
had been paid any bribes or any monies from Bosasa or any entities 
connected with Bosasa.  He said that this had been a result of 
confusion and indicated that he was apologising to Ms Sishuba and that 
if he came back to the commission he would make it clear that Ms 
Sishuba had not received any bribes from Bosasa.  Subsequent to that 
Ms Sishuba deposed to another affidavit where she acknowledged the 
admission made by Ms – Mr Agrizzi but took issue with the fact that Mr 
Agrizzi had said that he had made a mistake as a result of a certain 
question that he said – he had said Mr Pretorius had asked him and she 
10 
suggested that Mr Agrizzi was not taking full responsibility and also 
sought that the apology that Mr Agrizzi should make should be in 
specific terms that she formulated.  Written submissions have been 
made by both sides and Ms Sishuba persists in her application but now 
I understand her not to seek any cross-examination of Mr Agrizzi but 
only seeks to have an order – to be granted an order that will compel 
Mr Agrizzi to come back to the commission and make an apology in the 
terms that she demands.  I am satisfied that Ms Sishuba was justified 
in bringing an application for leave to cross-examine Mr Agrizzi.  I am 
not sure about the relief of compelling him to come back to the 
20 
commission but it is not necessary to decide that issue. The fact of the 
matter is that the plans of the commission are such that Mr Agrizzi is 
going to come back to the commission in order to give evidence and to 
be cross-examined and he has already indicated that on that occasion 
he will be prepared to repeat what he has said in his affidavit namely 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 4 of 150 
 
that he made an error in suggesting that Ms Sishuba had been paid any 
bribes by Bosasa or any entities from Bosasa and that he apologises 
for his error.  He has even indicated in a later affidavit that he takes 
full responsibility for that error.  Therefore it is clear that there is really 
no dispute of fact between the version put up by Ms Sishuba namely 
that she never received any payments or bribes from Bosasa and Mr 
Agrizzi’s version after this issue was drawn to his attention.  That 
therefore means that there is no basis for me to grant Mr Sishuba leave 
to cross-examine Mr Agrizzi in relation to the issue of whether or not 
she had received bribes from Bosasa.  So the only issue is whether I 
10 
should make an order compelling Mr Agrizzi to come back an whether I 
should order that Mr Agrizzi should give his apology in the specific 
terms that are being sought by Ms Sishuba.   
1. Since Mr Agrizzi has undertaken to make the admission or to 
repeat his admission and to repeat his apology when he comes 
back and since he is going to be back in the commission and he 
has said he takes full responsibility for the error that happened I 
see no reason why I should make an order compelling Mr Agrizzi 
to come and do what he is going to do anyway.  There is no basis 
to think that he is not going to come back because  
20 
1. The commission does plan to get him back to the commission 
to give further evidence and 
2. Because he is prepared to come back and clarify the issue.   
With regard to whether or not I should order him to make an apology in 
the specific terms sought by Ms Sishuba I am unable to accede to that 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 5 of 150 
 
request.  I think it is enough that Mr Agrizzi has said: 
1. He made an error by suggesting that Ms Sishuba had received 
bribes from Bosasa. 
2. He said he takes full responsibility for that. 
3. He said he apologises to Ms Sishuba for that. 
4. He said he will repeat all of this when he comes before the 
commission next time. 
In those circumstances I do not think that there is a need for an order.  
I must just make it clear as I have said that I accept that Ms Sishuba 
was justified in bringing the application but I believe that the 
10 
developments that have happened since then make it unnecessary for 
me or inappropriate for me to make an order to the effect that he is 
sought.  In these circumstances although Mr Agrizzi will come before 
the commission and publicly apologise to Ms Sishuba in due course and 
make it clear that he was mistaken when he said she had received 
bribes it is not necessary to grant the orders that Ms – or inappropriate 
– it is inappropriate to make the orders that Ms Sishuba asked for.  In 
these circumstances the application is refused. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair noted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  We are going to adjourn now and we will 
20 
resume at ten for the hearing of evidence.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.

20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And I see no date was put in when

MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  On the 14 t h August. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  14 t h August? 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 10 of 150 
 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Where did you do it? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  I did it in Johannesburg. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and an attorney administered the 
oath? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Then if you go to page 49 to 63 that 
is a supplementary statement which you submitted to the commission. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes it is. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and I would like you to go to the last 
10 
page of that statement and identify it?  This was done yesterday 2 n d 
September. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Which page is it? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I beg your – page 62.  If you go to page 
62.   
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes I am there. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay do you see that? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes I do. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And the date there is the 2 n d September 
2019? 
20 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And it was commissioned here in 
Parktown? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  These statements that you 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 11 of 150 
 
made both of them to the commission did you make them voluntarily? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes I did; 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And are they contents of both the main 
and the supplementary true and correct? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  The only thing if I may on page 9 there 
is a typo there.  It says from 2012 to 2018 it should read from 2018 to 
2019. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  To 2019.  
10 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Maybe just to [indistinct] the defect on the 
commission – on the oath one would have to do a supplementary where 
you can confirm that this statement, the initial one that you submitted 
was signed on the date which is not reflected on it and also we will do 
a supplementary dealing with the dates that you are asking the Chair to 
amend. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and then Ms Norman. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just – I see that the commissioner of oaths in regard 
to Mr Mxakwe’s supplementary affidavit was somebody connected with 
the commission.  I think normally what is required is that the 
commissioner of oaths should not be connected in any way with your 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 12 of 150 
 
attorneys or the institution.  So I think just – I think commissioners and 
other members of the legal team must be advised that as far as 
possible witnesses when they depose to affidavits that will come before 
the commission the commissioner of oaths should not be anybody 
connected with the commission. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I will see that signature yes I will – we will 
advise them accordingly Chair.  This is a constable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think it is the second one. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh the constable alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That I – that I notice has got a commissioner of 
oaths. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who is connected to the commission. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  We will do that Chair.  Thank you.  Thank 
you Mr Mxakwe could you just briefly tell the Chairperson about your 
qualifications? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Chairperson good morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Mxakwe. 
20 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  I hold a Masters Degree in Global 
Political Economy from the University of Sussex.  Also an Honours and 
a Masters from UCT and Post Grad Diploma in Business Admin from 
GIBS as well as Executive Leadership Development Training from the 
London Business School. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 13 of 150 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No thank you.  I – I notice Ms Norman that I must be 
old fashioned because I see that Mr Mxakwe when he states his 
qualifications he starts with the most recent. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The highest and goes down and I think Mr Mahkathini 
did the same yesterday. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Did the same yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I from time to time I see CV’s where people start 
with the latest developments in their lives. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And go back.  But… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  To matric. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Some of us are used to starting at the back and 
coming this way. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Start with your matric certificate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So maybe it shows that some of us have been around 
for a long time. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  For a long time yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And are not changing. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will try and adapt. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Mr Mxakwe is it correct that 
you are currently the Group Chief Executive Officer of the SABC? 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 14 of 150 
 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes it is. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  When did you join the SABC? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  I joined the SABC on the 1 s t July 2018. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Maybe just briefly could you just 
give the Chair – Chairperson background about your work experience 
before you joined the SABC? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Before I joined the SABC Chairperson I 
was the Executive Director for a multinational company for the 
Southern as well and the Eastern African region.  After that I then went 
to work in Europe as the Vice President at the Head Quarters of the 
10 
same multinational.  And then I then came back spent after being there 
for four years I moved to Lagos Nigeria where I was the Commercial 
Head for Lagos and in 2015 I returned home and I was then the Country 
Head responsible for the commercial operations in five countries and 
after that I then joined the SABC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Norman before you proceed. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I went to Ms Mxakwe’s supplementary affidavit and 
20 
then when I – were supposed to go back to his original affidavit I got 
lost.  Which divider must I go to? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair this one CC15. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because that is the one you are dealing with now. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is the one we are dealing with yes 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 15 of 150 
 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Is there no divider between 15 and the 
supplementary?  Between the main. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no you must just remind me the divider is at 16. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It is 15 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  15 okay.   Okay I have got it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Thank you.  May I 
proceed Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may proceed. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  Thank you.  Then as the 
Group Chief Executive Officer could you just tell the Chair what is your 
role within the SABC briefly? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  My role Chairperson as the Group CEO 
of the SABC is to ensure the strategic direction of the organisation.  
Very importantly to make sure that every single individual and every 
single division is geared towards the fulfilling of the public mandate of 
the SABC.  I am also responsible for as the Accounting Officer for the 
financial management of the organisation but also to provide leadership 
to the different divisions within the SABC. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  The – you were present 
when the Chairperson of the board testified yesterday, is that correct? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes I was. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And most of the strategies he had covered 
but I would just take you to some of the things that would relate to you 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 16 of 150 
 
as the Group CEO.  First of all could you just turn to page 2 and where 
you deal with the revenue streams of the SABC in paragraph 4.1?  
Could you just mention those to the Chairperson please? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Chairperson our revenue base from a 
commercial point of view is divided into three streams.  The first one is 
84% of our revenue is generated through advertising sponsorships. The 
second one is through TV licences about 15% of that and then from the 
government grants we get about 3%.  Just to give you a sense last year 
and these are unaudited financials but last year the total revenue was 
at 6.5 billion and 200 million of that was from government.  The rest 
10 
was from the revenue generated for advertising and then a billion of 
that was from TV licences. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  The Chairperson did 
mention yesterday and as you have mentioned in paragraph 6 most of – 
some of the documents that you found at the time of your appointment 
being the Public Protector’s Report, Ad-Hoc Committee Report of 
Parliament and Internal Audit Reports that were there and the Special 
Investigation Reports.  
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   You confirm that those are mainly the 
20 
reports that you were working from? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I beg your pardon sorry.  And what I would 
like to take you to is what appears at page 3 because these are matters 
that would fall within your knowledge and that of the Financial Officer 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 17 of 150 
 
who is going to come later.  The – you deal in paragraph 8 with the 
Auditor Generals Reports that had indicated collapse of governance 
within the SABC.  So how have you now – having been now at the helm 
of – of the SABC how are you dealing with those? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Chairperson the SABC for many years 
was subjected to a systematic collapse of governance as well as 
financial processes.  And you see this in the manner in which there was 
a complete disregard for SABC policies as well as SABC processes but 
also a huge lapse when it comes to internal controls and governance 
processes.  And what we have done and we have been on record on 
10 
these we have looked at all of the recommendations of the Public 
Protector.  The recommendations from the Ad-Hoc Committee as well as 
internal forensic investigations by the SABC.  In my career I have never 
come across an organisation where in one fiscal you have close to 186 
reports and those reports would be documenting maleficence, fraud, 
corruption. And I think if you say 186 the tendency is to think that is 
individual employees that 186 refers to cases because 1 case can 
actually focus on a group of people.  So what we have been doing we 
have doing and I say the mantra that we use is to always [intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean I am sorry Mr Mxakwe when you refer to 186 
20 
you talk about 186 cases of wrong doing? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Based on the internal investigations 
that have been done, correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And those investigations amounting to the same 
number 186 or not really? 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 18 of 150 
 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  They do not amount into the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  But the cases but the individuals and 
more. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The cases that they deal with. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes the cases that they deal with are in that region? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay yes.  Thank you. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  So what we have then being doing and 
10 
in every single thing and in every single case we have ensured that we 
follow due process, disciplinary measures had to be enacted in every 
single case that is concerned and I have said this we have to do what 
is right for the SABC.  And the manner in which we do this is very 
transparent.  You go through the necessary disciplinary processes and 
it does not matter who you are and we have been subjected to a lot of 
backlash as a result of this. And as I said to the team every single 
investigation and every single case needs to be dealt with in line with 
our internal processes.  So to answer the question we are dealing with 
all of those cases but at the same time we are strengthening internal 
20 
corporate controls when it comes to these particularly in as far as 
adherence to the SABC policies are concerned. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  And then in paragraph 9 
you deal with irregular expenditure which stood at 4.98 billion as at 31 s t 
March 2018.  So the question is now if you from the time you were 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 19 of 150 
 
appointed you were trying to do the right thing why – where does this 
4.98 billion come from as constituting irregular expenditure? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms Norman please do not forget your 
question. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Mxakwe – Mr Mxakwe on this 186 cases are you 
able to say at this stage how many have been finalised in terms of 
dealing with them – in terms of your internal processes to deal with 
them in so far as they may relate to employees who have been involved 
in wrong doing and so on?  Or is that something that is not easy to say 
10 
right now? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  No it is – it is easy to say Chairperson.  
There are two streams.  There are investigations that are done by the 
SIU and when they report back to us in terms of their findings we 
institute the required consequence management processes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Based on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  And overall internally we have had 
about 86 of these cases dealt with and there is about 38 that are still 
20 
outstanding and the processes continuing.  I do know that the HR GE 
will be here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  To give specifics. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 20 of 150 
 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  But there has been a lot of progress.  
But I think also Chairperson if I may add? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  It is a never ending process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Every single day I am confronted with 
reports that date back to 2012, 2011, 2014 on cases that were not 
attended to deliberately sometimes.  And we have also a duty as the 
SABC to do what is right and in the process we have to ensure that we 
follow due process in all of these cases.  So we do have different 
10 
numbers and different cases where we know that we have completed 
these. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Maybe I could mention 
to Chair that most of those are in the files of Mr Zgode [?] the ten lever 
arch files. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you we will deal with them 
when he comes.  Thank you. The question was, how then does one find 
so much irregular expenditure I know it was before your time but this is 
20 
as at 31 s t March 20128? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Chairperson the paragraph 9 depicts 
the rot and the maleficence that has taken place at the SABC in the 
past number of years.  Those irregular expenditure figures they date 
back to 2012.  You will see herein year on year there is an increase on 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 21 of 150 
 
this and there if four reasons why.  The first reason is that there was a 
blatant disregard for the supply chain processes of the SABC.  The 
second one which was really common place was the – the payments of 
certain contracts of certain deals without having a proper contract in 
place.  The third one was deviations and these deviations were 
deliberate because they were not even in line with the criteria when it 
comes to emergency for sole source or they were not even approved by 
Treasury.  But the fourth one was the sense or rather the fact that there 
was a practice of ensuring that the management then would go through 
the request for quotation instead of going through a competitive bidding 
10 
process.  So the accumulation has been year on year.  It is something 
that started in 2012.  You will see there is an attachment that we have 
included here where it actually specifically shows which contracts were 
not done properly why is it as we stand we have there 4.98 billion.  In 
terms of the second question that you asking we have applied for 
condonation to Treasury of 2.7 billion of all of these and this is based 
on the fact that some of these cases may have been concluded, some 
of them are going through litigation with the SIU and so forth. So there 
is a system in place where we ensure we apply.  But at an operational 
level we have put together a team that looks at automating all of these 
20 
irregular expenditure items and the idea there is to ensure internal 
controls are place. There is a framework that can properly monitor 
where we are in terms of these.  And the third point because of the high 
number in fact year to date it is at 5.2 billion in terms of irregular 
expenditure.  The standing committee on public accounts has asked us 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 22 of 150 
 
every single month to submit progress reports on how we are dealing 
with these irregular expenditure. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And this irregular expenditure you 
have got to reflect it in your books year in on – on a yearly basis and 
you cannot now say look because it was not part of our term it will not 
be reflected. So it continues reflecting as irregular expenditure even 
though you were not involved in it at the time? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Correct.  As leadership you inherit both 
the good and the bad. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  And in this case the assets as well as 
the liabilities. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Yes.  And then… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am sorry Ms Norman. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now that Mr Mxakwe has made reference to SCOPA. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just need to mention this and you and the legal team 
can take it forward and we can discuss in due course.  I would like in 
due course to have documentation that will tell me what was happening 
20 
over the years. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whenever the SABC went to the relevant Portfolio 
Committee in Parliament whether it was the Communications Portfolio 
Committee or SCOPA I would like to see what was said about issues 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 23 of 150 
 
relating to matters that we are dealing with.  Because one of the things 
that I want to understand is to what extent did Parliament play its 
proper role in terms of oversight to the extent that matters have really 
got to a completely unacceptable level in terms of things of wrongdoing 
and – and corruption and fruitless and wasteful expenditure over years?  
Where – was Parliament probing those matters?  What were they doing 
about the information they were getting or were they not being given 
correct information by the management and the board over the years or 
the boards.  So at some stage we – I need to have that information. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you Chair we have noted it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But let us continue. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  Thank you Chair.  Then in 
paragraph 10 you confirm what the Chairperson confirmed yesterday? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Indeed the SABC is technically 
insolvent and I think Chair the way you would need to look into this is 
to look at the short term liabilities that exceed our current liquid 
assets.  Simply put we cannot and we are not able as the SABC to pay 
our creditors.  To date we are standing at 1.8 billion and if I may also if 
you go back to the previous fiscal at the end of March 2018 that 
number was standing at 1.2 billion.  But it got – it increased because 
20 
we have not been able to pay Syntax we have not been able to pay 
Multichoice and some of our creditors.  The biggest issue with that 
paragraph is then the issue around the solvency and the liquidity test 
of the SABC.  We run an organisation Chairperson where every single 
month employees are very depressed.  They do not know whether they 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 24 of 150 
 
are going to be able to get their salaries or not.  And the only thing that 
we focus on every single month is the 265 million that is dedicated 
towards paying salaries.  Once we have done that we actually have 
absolutely nothing left.  We then have to get into engagements, into 
arrangements with all of our creditors and they have been extremely 
understanding but you cannot go on like that.  Despite the solid 
strategy that we need I mean we have and I must admit also when I 
took this job on the 1 s t my understanding was that there was capital re-
injection that was expected.  Because Chairperson it does not matter 
how robust and solid a strategy you have if that is not re-capitalised 
10 
and there is no financial injection it cannot work.  And the only reason 
why the SABC has been able to stay afloat as it has it is thanks to the 
commitment and the hard working and the passion that has been 
displayed by many of our employees.  So the – this statement is indeed 
correct that the company is technically insolvent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know it is – it is very worrying.  It is very 
worrying. I mean the Chairperson of the board was saying exactly the 
same thing yesterday and we all know that it is not just SAA – SABC.  
There are issues with SAA, Eskom, Denel.  I mean there have been 
over the years Ministers responsible for – for these entities.  There 
20 
have been CEO’s.  There have been CFO’s.  There have been boards.  
Parliament has been there to oversee, to exercise oversight.  How did 
this - all of these things happen when there were all these people?  
How did we get to a position where state entities have reached this 
level?  It is a very, very worrying thing.  I guess I am just asking a 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 25 of 150 
 
question that many of us are asking but it is - it is a sense of 
frustration to say what is it that as a country we got wrong if the 
position is that so many structures appear to have failed to make sure 
that we did not - these SOEs did not reach the level that they have 
reached now.  (Intervenes). 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Chairperson … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Mxakwe I guess I am just saying things and 
you do not know what to say in return. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Chairman, we - we inherited the mess.  
An organisation that was really in - in financial ruins but or what still 
gives me comfort is that you have an executive management team with 
the 
required 
business 
acumen, 
with 
the 
required 
commercial 
astuteness, ethical leadership, a passion to serve the country and the 
only reason why the SABC despite the lack of financial injection has 
been able to be - to stay afloat in the past couple of years is because 
of the competence that we have in the team. 
The strategy that we have put in place has already begun to 
show positive green shoots and - and I can assure you Chairperson that 
20 
if you look at our funding model we - we as an organisation if we were 
to get the required funding which by the way we believe we have met 
the preconditions for. 
We have a team that is solid that can be able to turnaround 
the SABC and I think the biggest question that needs to be asked 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 26 of 150 
 
politically are we the right people. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see that - that is part of the issue because I was 
about to say to you it is critical to have the right management, the right 
people at management and it is critical to have the right people at 
board level but that is not the end.  You have got to have the executive 
that is prepared to do what is required to be done to get things right. 
You have got to have Parliament which has a constitutional 
obligation of oversight that will make sure that it exercises its oversight 
obligations properly and we - in due course one will have to look at has 
it over exercised that obligation properly over the past number of 
10 
years.  If it did why are we where we are. 
What about the political heads, political leaders of these 
SOEs over the years.  Have they done their job properly?  Where did 
things really go wrong?  What do we need to do to make sure that we 
never get back to this situation and we cannot get to that without 
knowing where we went wrong but thank - thank you Mr Mxakwe. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair and then you mention 
that over the past 10 years SABC had managed to make profit in those 
three years that you mentioned - 2011/2012, 2013 and 2014 but then 
the very next paragraph you say those - that is misleading.  How is that 
20 
misleading? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  So if I may explain.  In the past 10 
years the SABC has not been profitable.  The only years is 2011/2012 
and 2013/2014 where there was a certain level of profitability and the 
only reason this was the case is because there was low investment in 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 27 of 150 
 
content. 
You will also note that in 2016 and 2017 where we registered 
huge losses this was at the time where there was the high investment 
in content.  So - so that is - that is the explanation for those two 
paragraphs. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Alright, okay and then in paragraph 13 you 
deal with the (indistinct) of content at 1.95 billion.  Could you just 
explain to the Chair that whole concept that you deal with - you deal 
with it at length in your supplementary statement? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Right. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  We might just deal with it now in full the 
whole issue because you have got quite a number of paragraphs 
dealing with that.  You can put it here. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  So Chairperson like in any other 
business the business of broadcasting is about content and there is a 
need to invest in content.  For us to also see the return on investments 
as the Chairperson was saying yesterday you need to invest between 
18 to 24 months and - and it is critical because the - the content drives 
audience and audience is very linked to generation of revenue. 
So if you not investing as much as you are doing when it 
20 
comes to content as we are now we are doing a lot of repeats in some 
of our programs and what it does is it affects our ability to attract 
revenue because advertisers and clients then say but why should I 
invest on a content that is not compelling that is not relevant that is not 
fresh. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 28 of 150 
 
So in 2016/2017 the year where we made huge losses was 
the year in which there was huge investment in content and 2011 to 
2014 that is the years - those are the years that we did not invest much 
in content and it showed better profitability as a result. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and then the Chairperson 
yesterday did mention the figures that you deal with in paragraph 14 
that deal with the losses over the 2014/2015 years 2018/2019.  Do you 
confirm that - that paragraph?  It is exactly - and the improvement of 33 
percent.  He testified to all of that yesterday. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes indeed.  If you look at the - the 
10 
losses that have been registered in the past three years.  You - you 
moved - in the past three fiscals you moved from over a billion straight 
to 644 million and the previous one is at 483 and that still are not 
deterred but it does indicate a 33 percent improvement in terms of 
driving down losses and this is also in line with the strategy that we 
have implemented when it comes to organisation wide cutting measures 
when it comes to costs but I also need to mention because there has 
been a narrative that the SABC had money that was left. 
In the past three years if you look at cash balance as at 
every end of each year we had 130 - 131 million.  Sorry.  We had 82 
20 
million and then we had 131 and the past fiscal we have 72 million.  So 
these past three years that is what we had as at the end of the fiscal. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you and then you - the 
Chairperson of the board dealt with the employee costs and currently 
sitting at 45 percent.  Is that …? 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 29 of 150 
 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Correct.  It is just over 45 percent and I 
think this is another issue that concerns us as executives because 
when you are asked to turnaround an institution the first thing you need 
to look into in fact there are three things.  You look at revenue 
generation. 
What additional income can you ensure you bring in as well 
as additional revenue streams?  The second point you look at where 
can you cut costs.  Currently the SABC is at over 45 percent when it 
comes to, to costs.  The second highest line when it comes to costs is 
the signal distribution. 
10 
That accounts for about 12 percent of our total expenditure 
and it is sitting just over 1.1 billion.  Indeed we need signal distribution 
but the issue is with all the technology that we have now surely we can 
do better.  So when you - when we walked in as executives last year 
that is what the board said to us. 
Look at a way where we can ensure you reset basic business 
fundamentals and that includes looking at all of the cost items but also 
looking at revenue generation streams.  This is why Chairperson if I 
may also indicate in a very difficult financial year the team has been 
able to deliver a 6.5 billion revenue despite all of advertisers 
20 
withdrawing when it comes to budgets because in any economic 
recession the first thing - the first budgets that get cut would be 
communication marketing and advertising but despite that we have 
been able to try this. 
So it is a worry that we still have employ costs that are at 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 30 of 150 
 
over 45 percent and it is something that needs to be looked into. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and the Chairperson of the board also 
dealt yesterday with the exorbitant sports rights costs.  You also deal 
extensively with that in your supplementary affidavit.  Could you just 
explain to the Chair and then just deal with your submissions to ICASA 
that relate to this matter and I will take you through some of the 
legislation that is relevant as you do so.  Thank you. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Chair - Chairperson we - we have a 
very interesting situation.  Our mandate expects us to broadcast sports 
of national interest and the biggest issue with that is that it is an 
10 
unfunded mandate.  Essentially it means that we need to cross 
subsidise the mandate using the commercial revenue that we made 
every single year. 
To give you a sense in the past five years we have spent 
about 3.8 billion on the costs of sports rights and the problem with 
costs of sports rights is that it is the rights holders that decide on the 
price.  That is the first point and of the 3.8 billion that we have spent 
the only revenue and income we have made is 150 million. 
So you can imagine you put in 3.8 billion and all you are 
getting is a mere 150 million and this is in line with what we have then 
20 
decided as part of our strategy.  Any deal that is not commercially 
viable for the SABC we will never sign and this is not just isolated in 
terms of what we are doing on sports rights. 
Even when it comes to production the production of our 
content on TV has been hugely disappointing in the sense that we have 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 31 of 150 
 
had to pay millions - hundreds of millions but if you look at the returns 
on investments it does not warrant that.  So the - the decision we took 
every single contract we get into notwithstanding our commitment to the 
public mandate. 
It has to make sense for the SABC.  So it is a similar thing 
that is happening in sports.  We - we have - we have decided that going 
forward any deal even when it comes to sports rights certainly we are 
committed to our mandate but our mandate does not say the SABC 
should get into deals that are not commercially viable. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  One question taking you back to the previous 
question on the evidence about staff salaries taking 45 percent of your 
budget.  Is there a percentage in terms of staff salaries that generally 
is accepted to say well if you are running business your staff salaries 
should not be above a certain percentage? 
Is there anything like that and if there is how does 45 percent 
compare to - to what is accepted as a norm? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  It - it depends on - on sectors.  Where I 
come from in the private sector you would look at least at nothing more 
than 25/28 percent. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Another very aggressive company may 
say it should be less than 20 percent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  So … 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 32 of 150 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  So it will really depend on which sector 
but where we are as an organisation … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  It is - I mean just to give you a sense of 
the 6.5 billion in revenue year - last fiscal. It means that we are going 
to have to pay just over three billion … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Towards salaries … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  And that is not sustainable … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  And I think to Chair’s point this is one 
of the tough decisions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  That I think we need to look into. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes and then with regard to the question of 
sports rights and so on.  You must have looked at what other public 
broadcasters and other nations do.  Do they find themselves in this 
situation where the stakeholders basically tell you what you are going 
20 
to have to pay them for the sports rights? 
Is there any - I am sure there is a comparison that has been 
done somewhere but you might or might not be able to speak to it. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  What we have said Chairperson is that 
for years SABC has been paying for a property that it does not even 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 33 of 150 
 
know its value.  As the SABC our stance has been very clear.  
Whenever we engage with our partners when it comes to these 
commercial deals let us first do a proper valuation of the property. 
So that we can look at pricing.  We can look at commercial 
viability and as well as how we are going to be able to sell this because 
for every single content that we get.  It is important that we have a 
sales pipeline for the next nine months to say we need to approach our 
clients and this is the focus that we need to do going forward.  So it is 
different in other places. 
I think we have allowed a situation where we engage in deals 
10 
that do not make any commercial sense for the SABC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Maybe - and then in the 
same paragraph you deal with national sporting events of public 
interest and you make reference to Government Gazette No. 7 of 2010.  
Chair, may I refer the witness to EXHIBIT 26 which is the legislation 
bundle. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry to - to … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  EXHIBIT CC26. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  EXHIBIT CC … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  26. 
CHAIRPERSON:  26, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you Chair and then it will be 
under divider marked 2.  Have you found it Mr Mxakwe? 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 34 of 150 
 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes I have. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  This is the Sport 
Broadcasting Services Regulation of 2010 … 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Huh-uh. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And I would like to take you to page 40 
marked on the right hand corner in red and I was looking at the list of 
all these sports that are regarding as sports of national interest and I 
do not see netball there or am I missing something? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Ja, it is not there.  I do not know. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It is not there. 
10 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Because we have it … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So it is really not regarded as a matter of 
public interest. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Gender discrimination. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Gender - serious gender discrimination 
Chair and at the end of the Commission we will make submissions on 
that.  Thank you.  So these - these matters that you have - that are 
listed here these are the matters that you referred to in that paragraph? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And - and what is expected of you as the 
20 
SABC insofar as these events are concerned? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  There is an expectation for us to 
broadcast sports of national interest.  The biggest issue with this 
Chairperson is that much as there is an expectation in law the biggest 
issue is when it comes to the financial imperative.  I will give you a 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 35 of 150 
 
sense.  We did a projection. 
In the next three years the public mandate - unfunded public 
mandate is going to cost SABC 6.8 billion.  So essentially we are 
expected to broadcast all of this without any financial support.  That is 
one but the second point is that we - we also get to a stage where we 
ask ourselves these unfunded mandates if they are so critical why is it 
then that there is no portion of funding allocated in order to help us. 
I have said earlier on Chairperson we are fully committed to 
fulfilling our mandate but there needs to be a reasonable expectation of 
what can be done. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now the expectation you talk about is it the 
expectation from the national executive.  Is it - are you talking about 
the expectation from the public or it is both? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  It is - it is actually - the regulations 
stipulate that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is in the regulations? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  Actually I guess if it is in the regulations 
it probably is more than an expectation.  Is it not an obligation? 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  But it also … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know.  I have not looked at the actual 
wording. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes.  Indeed it is - it is an obligation 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 36 of 150 
 
Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Intervenes). 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  But also says free-to-air. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  It says free-to-air and you must also 
appreciate Chairperson … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  The SABC is not the only free-to-air. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  And the regulations do not even 
10 
specifically mention the SABC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Chair and then in 
paragraph 18 you deal with - you have mentioned signal and linkages 
… 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Sorry.  Where are we? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are back to the … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I beg your pardon Chair.  Yes.  I am back 
to - to your statement.  I beg your pardon.  The big file, okay.  EXHIBIT 
5. 
20 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes.  I am there. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Oh, so paragraph 18. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Then you deal there with linkages and - 
and those signal costs - broadcast costs but there is something that I 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 37 of 150 
 
would like to just talk to you about which one of the witnesses is going 
to deal with who dealt with the TNA Agreement.  I see you mention in 
that paragraph that: 
“There are other ad hoc costs incurred by the 
corporation such as satellite feeds and telephone 
lines used during outside broadcasts.” 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Huh-uh. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I think - correct me if I am wrong.  A 
typical example would be the - the breakfast shows that SABC was 
hosting because one witness says well TNA was not going to charge the 
10 
SABC anything for doing that but the SABC had to follow with all of its 
equipment, its staff wherever there is going to be a live broadcast. 
So can you just explain to Chair how then these costs come 
about because then they would prepare us for the - for that witness that 
is going to do deal with the TNA matters. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKE:  Okay.  So as - as I had said earlier on 
Chairperson the second business - the second biggest cost line item in 
our PNL is the signal distribution.  As you may know we operate 19 
radio stations.  At any given week we reach close to 28 million people 
and then also we have TV stations wherever single month we reach 
20 
close to 29 million people. 
Now I think it better explains why the SABC is such a 
contested terrain.  The - the issue with the signal - with signal 
distribution is that we have a responsibility to ensure that in every 
single place where we are the transmission of our signal to the public 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 38 of 150 
 
is done and this is costing us about 1.1 billion every single year - every 
single month - I mean every single year and is the second business - 
biggest contributor in terms of our - and SENTECH is obviously our 
signal distribution partner that we have not been able to pay in the past 
couple of six months purely because of the situation that we are in. 
The - the issue that you are mentioning on outside 
broadcasts - I will make an example.  If there is a Government 
department what has particular project that they want to run in some far 
flung rural area.  What we would normally do is we would actually send 
one of our trucks to that place. 
10 
So all of those outside broadcasts as well as satellite feeds 
that is basically what - what it is referring to. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay.  So you would incur those costs? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So even if an entity comes to the SABC 
and says I am offering this service.  I am not going to charge you for it 
but when you look at these costs then it becomes quite expensive for it 
to run (intervenes). 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  We - we charge those entities.  When - 
when any Government department or any organisation approaches us 
20 
for a particular event.  We do charge but the biggest issue is that from 
a distribution point of view the - the outside broadcasts are quite 
expensive. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, okay.  Thank you and then you - you 
give us the figures - the percentages on - on signal - signal distribution 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 39 of 150 
 
and you also - are you benchmarking it with the international one? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  In terms of the cost of signal 
distribution internationally it is at seven percent and we are at 12 
percent as the SABC and it is one of the things that we are looking 
into. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I - I - I am sorry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you been able to establish the reason for the 
discrepancy or not yet?  Why … 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  We … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are at 12 whereas the international average is 
seven percent? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  We - we - there - from a policy point of 
view … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Chairperson there is a need for the 
SABC to have a mix of both DTT … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  As well as DTH … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  And we believe that if we can have that 
healthy mix … 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 40 of 150 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  We would be able to deal with some of 
the costs that are quite high … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  From a signal distribution point of view. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you.  In paragraph 19 you deal 
with some of the commercial deals which you believe that they were 
unsound - financially unsound.  Can you just deal with that and why you 
think that those deals are not good for the SABC? 
10 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Well all of those deals on paragraph 19 
they have been investigated by the - by the SIU.  The biggest issue 
there was that there - there were a lot of maladministration when it 
came to these deals.  Either there was no contract in place and there 
were not payments made or there was an issue of deviations that was 
deliberate to accommodate certain of these and it was just really the 
typical malfeasance. 
It is - it is an indication of what happened at the SABC in the 
past.  All of those deals that are shown there. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and then you tabulate them in 
20 
Annexure B to your statement.  Chair, may I refer the Chair to page 18.  
Your Annexure B and at page 21 you have actually listed those 
companies. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  18.  Where is it? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  20 - if you go to 21.  That is where - 18 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 41 of 150 
 
that is where your annexure starts but … 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Oh yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I would like to refer you to paragraph 20 - 
to page 21. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So you say these matters have been 
referred to the relevant prosecuting authorities? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And you have mentioned there - you have 
listed them. Names of the Directors …  
10 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And various companies listed in there and 
you have … 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You have tabulated even those that you 
referred for disciplinaries at page 23. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Huh-uh. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay.  I see those that have been … 
CHAIRPERSON:  There are so many. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  There are so many, yes.  I see those that 
20 
have been referred for prosecutions.  You are looking at about three - 
five.  There are individuals and … 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And companies there and then those that 
have been referred for disciplinaries you have a lot of those.  They go 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 42 of 150 
 
right up to page - up to page 24.  I am sorry.  Item 24, page 26. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Is that correct? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  That - that is correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  All of those you - you will see 
chairperson for every deal that was corrupt there is a corresponding 
individual.  So all of these individuals that are mentioned there those 
are SABC employees.  Most of them they are no longer in the employ of 
the SABC. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Sorry.  The - the Chair had asked 
you a question about salary range and benchmarking of salaries.  Can I 
just take you back to - on that point?  Page seven - page 17 which is 
the estimated employee compensation.  Are you there? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes I am there. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Although it does not reflect individual 
salaries but how does one assess those - those figures?  When you say 
Directors and GEs are those their annual or gross salaries?  How does 
one look at those figures? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  My understanding of the Chair’s 
20 
question was we said that the percentage of the SABC vis-à-vis 
expenditure on employee compensation … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE: 
 
Is 
over 
45 
percent. 
 
So 
my 
understanding was how does it compare to other organisations that are 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 43 of 150 
 
in a good financial health.  So … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh you quite correct. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  So this one it basically shows internally 
the different levels and how much each of those costs the company. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and then the Bargaining Unit will that 
be your Labour Department? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  So - so the Directors and the Group 
Executives it would include the non-executives the fees paid to the 
10 
board.  It would also include the three Executive Directors as well as 
Group Executives that are members of Exco.  So that is the total cost 
to company. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  What you see there. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  What does it mean?  The item non-
guaranteed for permanent.  What does that mean? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Sorry where is that? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It is just - just below guaranteed 
compensation for permanent positions and then you have got 
20 
non-guaranteed for permanent. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Oh.  Non - non-guaranteed for 
permanent.  That - that effectively means one of the things we are 
doing Chairperson if I may explain.  We are running an organisation 
where you have about 300 Managers acting in different positions. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 44 of 150 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Acting? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Correct.  We - we have about 300 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  300? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes.  We have reduced that number 
significantly.  We are now standing at 227 but it does give you a sense 
of the organisation you running because if you have Acting Managers 
and they need to do - we do it for a three month period.  You also have 
people who have been acting for close to seven/eight sometimes nine 
years at the SABC and it makes decision making difficult.  The sense of 
taking responsibility.  So to your question the 280 would then refer to 
10 
the amount, for example, that we need to pay for acting positions. It’s 
costing us current about R2million every single month for all of the 
people that are acting in those managerial positions. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Is that in terms of acting allowances? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:    Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay ja because otherwise if you were not paying 
acting allowances and where, for example, just paying them what a 
permanent incumbent in that position would be getting, then it wouldn’t 
make much difference ja.  Okay but of course maybe an acting 
allowance will mean that, that employees or that managers normal 
20 
salary in his or her original position plus the acting allowance still 
keeps them lower than the rate at which a permanent incumbent would 
have been paid.  So from that point of view it’s better that way 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:    But the issue, Chairperson is when it 
comes to stability because one of the things we wanted to do is to 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 45 of 150 
 
stabilise the SABC and it does not give room to do that particularly if 
you have so many – I mean permanent we have about 3 000 permanent 
employees and if you have close to 300 of those acting it does create a 
lot of instability. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:    From a decision making point of view 
or [indistinct] execution and all of the thing we should be doing to take 
the organisation forward. 
CHAIRPERSON:     No, no it’s unacceptable that’s about what, 10% of 
employees and guess if you look at the management it’s much more – 
10 
it’s a higher percentage of management who are in acting positions, 
correct? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     So I’m sure then given your high wage 
bill cost it’s difficult to fill those positions and the situation you find 
yourselves in not having money. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:    Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:     But – well I’m not sure whether one can say 
financial challenges are a justification or an excuse for not filling those 
positions when you are paying acting allowances.  In other words, isn’t 
the problem somebody failing to make a judgment call to say, is it 
20 
sustainable to have somebody or so many managers acting for a year, 
two years, you have mentioned some instances of seven years, nine 
years, I mean you can’t be saying, well we can’t fill this position 
because there is no money and yet you are paying a lot of money over 
a long period? 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 46 of 150 
 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:    Indeed Chairperson, this I an issue 
that we’re dealing with.  In the past couple of months, we’ve been able 
to advertise critical vacancies particularly those that we know are quite 
key to the running of the business, whether you’re talking about the 
need to get highly skilled people within the sales division.  We’ve had a 
lot of radio station managers that were acting and we now have 
advertised those positions in order to bring the right calibre of talent. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Thank you Chair, shall we move on, 
Chair I’m advised that it’s five past eleven…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    We can go up to quarter past ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Thank you.  Then in paragraph 20 this a 
matter that deals with the infrastructure and the buildings – paragaph20 
of your statement, back to your statement please thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:    It’s divider 15. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:    Oh thank you, sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Ja page four. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:    Got it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Thank you and then there you deal with 
the maintenance of your various building, the Chairperson of the Board 
20 
did indicate yesterday, mentioned the oil spills and the problems that 
you’re having in that regard.  So what would you like to highlight in 
what you’re saying in that paragraph, briefly? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:    I think, Chairperson, this one is very 
close to my heart because it affects the safety and the health of the 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 47 of 150 
 
employee at the SABC.  The truth of the matter, we are not able to 
invest in the upgrading maintenance and refurbishment of more 
infrastructure.  Just a couple of months ago we had a huge concrete 
steel in one of our reception areas that just fell and endangering the 
lives of more employees.  You may have seen the diesel spillage, lots 
and lots of our employees were hospitalised  due to diesel – inhaling 
diesel fumes.  Recently we had a fire incident, you must also 
appreciate these are old buildings, if you look at our lifts, you know, we 
should have upgraded or changed them 15 years ago and we’re still 
using them and this poses a huge risk, not only to the employees but to 
10 
the organisation.  You can imagine what it does from a staff morale 
point of view, if you wake up in the morning you go to an organisation 
where your safety and healthy is not guaranteed and I think as the 
accounting officer, it’s something that I do not sleep well at night 
thinking what may happen and I’m also not talking just about Auckland 
Park it’s the same if you go to our buildings in KZN there’s been a 
historical legacy where all of these buildings were not maintained and 
unfortunately one of the things we had done for the funding that we had 
applied for, we had earmarked a certain portion of that money to the 
maintenance of our building across the country.  If you go to  Limpopo, 
20 
it’s the same thing, if you go to Free State our buildings have not been 
maintained for many, many years. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Alright in paragraph 21 we highlight 
some of the SABC group executive members were highlighted in – or 
implicated rather in wrong doing and their names will appear in 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 48 of 150 
 
Annexure B that you’ve just – I’ve just taken you to where the SIU had 
listed those names and companies, so are those – what I’d like to know 
are those executive members still serving within the SABC? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:    Chairperson when I started this job on 
the 1 s t, I think the Board did not disclose this that almost half of my 
Exco members were implicated in wrong doing and they were subject o 
SIU cases.  Some of them were implicated in the wrong doing within the 
SABC, and I think from the ability of a leader to lead, you need to have 
a certain moral authority and I think it was a big issue because you 
lead an organisation that you want to stabilise, strengthening internal 
10 
controls but the very people that you want to do this with are actually 
implicated.  So we have had to go through a very vigorous process 
when it comes to disciplinary hearings with the individuals concerned.  
Some of them left the organisation instead of going through the 
disciplinary process, some of them are still going through the 
disciplinary processes and as I’ve said earlier on, in all of these 
matters we were guided by the recommendations from the SIU, from the 
Public Protector and I do know that there has been a narrative that we 
are purging people, and he truth of the matter is that it does not matter 
who you are even if you are part of Exco if there is any wrong doing 
20 
that has been identified is the right thing for the SABC to act.  So some 
of them are still with us, they’ve gone through the proper processes 
and some of them are on suspension and some of them have left the 
organisation. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Thank you, you have dealt with the 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 49 of 150 
 
morale generally of the employees and in paragraph 22 and 23 you deal 
with the low level employees having witnessed or even been aware of 
some of the corrupt deals that the senior managers were involved in. 
So then, other than the morale that look, they’re worried that they’re 
not going to get paid, possibly at the end of the month, what other 
issues relate to the matters that you highlight in paragraphs 22 and 23 
insofar as leadership and management concerned? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:    I think the biggest issue is the 
element of trust, there’s been a huge issue around trust and what we’ve 
done with the different Exco members is to, every week, dedicate time 
10 
to make sure that we have these cross-functional teams in the 
organisation that we can meet and engage and talk to but also to listen 
to their concerns.  People, of example are concerned how a lot of 
people were promoted without any basis from a merit point of view 
without the required competency, without the required skills and it does 
create a certain issue when it comes to trust when it comes to pursuing 
careers within the SABC from that point of view.  In fact, it’s one of the 
reason why we have had to take action against the irregular 
appointments because a lot of people that are qualified and competent 
within the organisation. They looked at these colleagues who are 
20 
actually occupying higher level positions and yet they’re also there with 
their own skill set as well as their own qualifications but they were 
overlooked in the past.  So we’re trying to normalise the environment to 
stabilise it and to ensure that we instil a sense of belonging to the 
employees that are there. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 50 of 150 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:      Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:    How are you dealing with that are you, firstly talking 
to the individuals concerned to say, look for A, B, C, D reasons it would 
appear that your appointment – promotion was irregular and reflect on 
it, we would like to change the situation maybe this how we would like 
it to be done, what do you have to say with a view to reversing the 
promotion or how is it being handled generally speaking? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     The manager in which it has been 
handled, because this was also part of the recommendations from the 
[indistinct] committee and the Public Protector, we did not want to take 
10 
the law into our hands because, Chairperson, you must also remember 
SABC has clearly defined policies when it comes to selection and 
appointment.  As an individual professional you would know if you are 
being appointed irregular at any given time.  The excuse that we’ve had 
over the past was, oh no so and so did it, I was appointed but it takes 
two, you were not forced to be appointed in a particular role.  So our 
approach has been to approach the Court to help us set aside these 
appointments and declare them invalid but also the point that you’ve 
made, Chairperson, to say could they go back to their original 
positions, the problem is that those positions have already been filled 
20 
and I think for us is the matter of justice to ensure that we take this to 
Court and not take the law in our own hands.  By the way we started 
with 27 employees what has since happened is we’ve now been 
inundated with a lot more.  People coming forth to say we know that 
this – when it comes to this person processes were not followed, even 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 51 of 150 
 
in that we’re going to go through the comprehensive process of 
investigation that went through with the 27 and we’re going to then 
come back with a phase 2 when it comes to these processes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay thank you.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Thank you Mr Mxakwe it’s now quarter 
past…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes I think we can take the tea adjournment we’ll 
resume at half past eleven, let’s adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:     All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS     
10 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us proceed. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chairman Mr Mxakwe can you just go back 
to the question that the Chairperson had asked you because it is just 
something you spoke about tea about you not filling the vacancies that 
is the SABC when I say you not filling the 300 acting positions or 
appointing people permanently to – so to speak.  Could you just tell the 
Chairperson the reasons you had – I had put in the reason to you by 
saying because you did not have money you thought then you would not 
appoint these people permanently but what are the reasons for that? 
20 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh just switch on the microphone. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja thank you. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Oh thank you Chairperson.  There was 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 52 of 150 
 
a ministerial directive in December saying that the entity should not fill 
in some of the positions because there was a process of integrating two 
departments.  As a result we are not able to fill those – that is why we 
were only able to do this last month when the – the moratorium was 
then declared we could now fill the other positions.  So it is not just an 
issue of money but the reason was that there was a directive from the 
ministry that we should not fill in the positions until such time that 
integration process has taken place.  So that – that has now been 
partially lifted that is why we are able to advertise for the 91 positions 
that I mentioned earlier.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Thank you.  Can 
we go to page 6 of your statement now?  We deal with the Auditor 
General’s Report.  I would like to take you to some aspects of that 
report.  This is for the 2017/2018 financial year and that report appears 
at page 30. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Here the Auditor General it is 
written it is entitled Disclaimer of Opinion.  My understanding is that 
the AG would make a disclaimer only when the AG is not given 
20 
sufficient information in order for him to be able to formulate an opinion 
about the financial status of any entity, am I correct? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Partially. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  So the biggest here was the Auditor 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 53 of 150 
 
General raised concerns in terms of the status of going concern for the 
SABC. They looked at the short term liabilities visa vie our assets and I 
think the biggest issue also there was the cause for concern around 
reckless trading or trading under insolvent circumstances.  So that was 
the biggest issue that they had.  And once again the idea there was we 
were hoping at the point – at that point that there would have been 
financial injection because they wanted certainty to say, are you going 
to be able to proceed as a business in the next twelve months?  And 
owing to the fact that we could not get any confirmation that was the 
biggest issue when it comes to going concern. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And then has – what is the position 
now? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  The position has… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Because I – sorry – sorry just to just ask.  
Because I would imagine although the AG has flagged that look there is 
a disclaimer of opinion but he would have gone back to the entity to 
say that you need to satisfy A, B, C, D and E I would imagine. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And your management statements or 
accounts that you would submit to him would also deal with those 
20 
aspects.  I just want to understand in terms of compliance what – what 
has been done since the time that AG Report came to the fore? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  I know the CFO is going to talk to this 
but we have been able to ensure that all of the statements that are 
submitted reflect the completeness that was required.  But the second 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 54 of 150 
 
point when it comes to going concern regrettably we are actually where 
we were last year owing to the fact that there is no capital injection for 
the SABC.  And in the engagements with AG they have once again 
raised a concern on this matter. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  The matters that you 
raise you have touched upon them in paragraphs 29 right up to 
paragraph 32 but then the Chairperson had dealt with the reconstitution 
of the board in 2017 and we do not have to deal with that.  But what I 
would like you to testify to is the strategic road map.  Is that the same 
as that strategy – turnaround strategy that the Chairperson of the board 
10 
spoke about yesterday? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And you have attached it to your 
statement? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes I have. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  If I may just direct the Chairperson 
to the relevant page.  You will find it – Mr Chairman it is at page 38.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  And it is SABC strategic road 
map. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I think the Chairperson of the board dealt with 
what he considered were key. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Were critical matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Key fissures I think three of them. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes Chair. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 55 of 150 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I do not know whether you … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I just want you to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are going to ask Mr Mxakwe to identify those that 
he regards as key himself or … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes are they – the Chair had identified 
them yesterday could you just if he has left out any other important 
aspects of this strategy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or if he might not agree he might have a different 
10 
view. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Or maybe … 
CHAIRPERSON:  He might have a different view as to … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  What he regards as important. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which ones are key fissures? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You must not assume that they agree. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes no I am fully aligned with 
Chairperson but I think … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  If I may comment when we – we joined 
in July 2018 the board mandated us to develop a strategic road map for 
the SABC and indeed we developed this.  We engaged with all the key 
stakeholders, the Department of Communications at the time.  We also 
got inputs from organised labour and the next point was to ensure that 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 56 of 150 
 
we cascade this throughout the different levels in the organisation.  
And Chairperson spoke about this but just to reinforce the point.  There 
is a couple of pillars that it is based on the first one is to accelerate 
and maximise revenue generation.  The second point is to deal with 
cost cutting measures across the organisation.  The third point is to 
deal with governance issues and I think what is very key for me 
Chairperson because of this strategy which by the way has clearly 
outlined turnaround plans.  Whether you talking about financial 
sustainability what we need to do there.  Whether you talking about 
platforms and content.  Whether you look at digital.  We have a solid 
10 
digital strategy.  HR we want to ensure that we have a competent 
workforce that is geared towards – that is feed for purpose.  Then on 
terms of governance to produce and instil a solid governance 
framework internally.  And the last past is on partnerships.  And I think 
Chair I need to hasten because when people talk about these 
partnerships there is this narrative now that SABC needs to strip some 
of its assets.  We will not do that.  And for the simple reason if you look 
for example there is a station called XKFM that serves the Coo and the 
Kwe people in the Northern Cape.  We pump in millions in that station 
and from a return on investment we have nil financially.  But in terms of 
20 
our mandate which is really to inform all South African people it is 
actually key for us. So there has been that.  But coming back to this. 
Because of the solid turnaround strategy and plan the SABC has been 
able to stay afloat for the past many months despite not having any 
form of financial injection.  And you can imagine Chairperson what then 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 57 of 150 
 
would happen if the strategy that has taken us where we are today 
could actually be properly recapitalised. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  The matters that you raise 
from paragraphs 34 relate to this turnaround strategy which you have 
dealt with quite in detail this morning and the capital injection matters 
and the forensic reports right up to paragraph 40 and then paragraph 
41 these are matters that the Chairperson of the board dealt with but 
then the next witness is going to deal with matters relating to editorial 
interference.  If I may then just take you unless there is something in 
that – on that page that you want to emphasise but these are the 
10 
matters that you have already testified to.  Fruitless and wasteful 
expenditure all of those matters.  But I would like to take you – you 
have dealt with advertising and how it forms part of the stream for the 
SABC.  There is something that I would like you to deal with which we 
dealt with yesterday.  Unfortunately that exhibit I have not asked the 
Registrar to place before the Chairperson.  That is CC23A.  Mr 
Chairman if it is – but if it is difficult to find we – I can leave the 
questions for maybe after lunch.  That is where – it has not been 
placed.  Can you just find that it is in that pack – in the bundle there?  
Yes.  It will be a – it is small that is the media statements that you 
20 
referred to yesterday.  Yes thank you.  CC23 could you just take it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will it be written Media something on the spine? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No, no it is written Chair it is these small 
ones that I handed up yesterday.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 58 of 150 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Exhibit C23 A.  Thank you Chair. Could – 
Thank you Chair.  Could you please turn to page 6 of that bundle?   
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say 6? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Page 6 yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  That is the article by the Star, 
am I correct?  The one that … 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Where they are quoting you?  Sorry.  
Thank you I have got it.  Thank you.  I just want to find out where you 
10 
were quoted – am I – Oh thank you.  This is the issue that we 
canvassed with the Chairperson where the Star had reported that the 
SABC board has refused to be drawn on allegations of discontent 
between the board and the SABC top executives.  And the Chairperson 
of the board did touch upon this matter yesterday.  Do you want to talk 
to that briefly to the Chairperson as to what sort of interference are 
these – are some of the members of the board engaged in insofar as 
the executive roles are concerned? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Chairperson the – there are certain 
members of the board that are making it difficult for us to do our job.  I 
20 
would not want to get into much details but  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:    But suffice to say indeed there is 
interference from some board members particularly when it comes to 
editorial independence of the SABC.  And we have raised this with the 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 59 of 150 
 
board but even more concerning now is the interference in some of the 
commercial operational deals that we are dealing with.   And we have 
raised this with the board and frankly Chairperson we have reached a 
point as especially the three directors and some of the EXCO members 
where the manner in which we are supposed to do our job is being 
stifled by these non-execs and I do think that and I know that the 
Chairperson and the board would look into this because it is really 
untenable.  We cannot continue as executives as long as these issues 
continue from these members.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Now when you say the – wanting to 
10 
get involved in the deals does this mean that having to report to them 
about the deals that you as management you are involved in contracts 
that you are busy with, the tenders that you are going to issue I just 
want to understand? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  If I may?  I would not want Chairperson 
to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  To go into details. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  To get into details. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  But I just want to confirm that there are 
board members within the SABC board. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Making our job difficult. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  They are interfering when it comes to a 
editorial issues as well as some of the commercial deals. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 60 of 150 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I think I can understand your reluctance to go into 
details given the fact that the board is still seized with the matter as I 
understand it. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have raised the matter with the board. So I – but 
I think that it may well be that at some stage in the future consideration 
could be given to whether somebody would come back and give the 
commission more details at a time when the board might have finished 
10 
its processes and so on.  At this stage I am not saying it must be done 
but I am saying maybe consideration should be given to that.  If at that 
stage it appears that there might be difficulties then the commission 
could be informed and the reasons could be given and one can consider 
whether it should be more than simply a suggestion.  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you very much Chair.  Then if you 
would permit me I think most of the matters that run up to paragraph 65 
you have dealt with. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you back – are you back in the statement? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I beg your pardon Chair yes I am back in 
the statement sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I just that I leave mine open all the time 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 61 of 150 
 
so it is easy to just move to it.  If – that is page 13 Chair, 13. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The one matter that I would like us to talk 
about which the Chairperson did touch upon is the operating model and 
the structure of the SABC which you deal with from paragraph 66 
onwards and the rehabilitation and all those.  Could you just talk 
roughly about those matters? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes if I may? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  I think the – the biggest issue on this 
10 
which for us as executives that it is really concerning is we inherit an 
organisation that is in a mess and we are now undergoing a process of 
rehabilitation and renewal.  And would have expected a – would have 
expected an engagement and willingness to help the SABC.  That is 
still not happening Chairperson.  And I do think that the lack of support 
from a funding point of view the issue of interference from some of the 
board members they put us as executive directors in a very difficult 
position in as far as continuing in these roles.  Because frankly we feel 
that we are in the way of the bailout and I do not think it is fair for the 
SABC.  So you can talk about all of the things that we have done in a 
20 
fair and just world.  If you look at the achievements that we have been 
able accomplish in the past twelve months it should be a no brainer for 
anyone to want to do capital injection in the SABC.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  are you able to – when you analyse the situation are 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 62 of 150 
 
you able to identify what the reason is for this situation where you have 
not been given the funding or is that something that you would prefer 
not to deal with at this stage? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  All I can say Chairperson is that as the 
executive team – as employees of the SABC we have done everything 
and anything humanly possible to take the SABC where it is now.  We 
therefore do not understand justifiably why we would not get the 
support that is required.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And you have not been told why? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Well we have been told that we need to 
10 
meet preconditions which we have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which you have met? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  We have met those preconditions but 
besides without any capital injection we have been able to ensure that 
the SABC stays afloat this far. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know sometimes in these situations the problem 
could be lack of political will. Sometimes it might be lack of 
appreciation of the urgency of a situation.  But it is quite clear from 
your evidence and the evidence the Chairperson that the matter is 
urgent and needs to be attended to urgently.  Yes. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Maybe whilst the Chair is on that point 
maybe we should just jump to your supplementary statement because 
you deal with the issue and you attach the conditions that have been 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 63 of 150 
 
placed before the SABC for it to fulfil.  Chair may I direct the 
Chairperson to page 105?  That is an annexure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before – I am sorry before – before that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I maybe I should have asked this to the 
Chairperson.  I am wondering whether the – the board has and the 
Chairperson will forgive me if I did ask him and he did respond and I 
have forgotten whether the board has – has said to the shareholder of 
to the Minister of Finance why are not being given funding in the light 
of the compliance that is there for everybody to see with the conditions 
10 
that were given to us?  And if so is there an answer that has been 
given or is there silence?  I am saying I do not know if I did ask the 
Chairperson anything along those lines but you may or may not be able 
to say? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  I think that question is above my pay 
grade. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  But what I do know is that there was a 
response that the board sent to both Ministers Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I guess that is the one where the Chairperson said  
20 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe the two ministers were not given the correct 
information about compliance. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:   Correct.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  As far as you recall how long ago was that? 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 64 of 150 
 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  This letter was written last week on 
Friday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  So there might not have been enough time 
since then? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes.  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For reaction.  Okay no that is fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair may I take the witness to 
page 105?  This is the letter that the Chairperson referred yesterday 
10 
but said you will deal with the details.  It was addressed to the 
Chairperson from both ministries that is the Ministry of Communications 
and the Ministry of Finance.  If you have a look at page 109 both 
Ministers signed the letter on the 27 t h August 2019.  Do you see that? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes I do. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  And then this is the letter that 
seems to deal with each of the conditions that were put on the table for 
the SABC to comply with.  Yes.  For the record could you just highlight 
these conditions to – to the Chairperson but before you do that maybe 
it is important because there is something definite that the Ministers 
20 
say.  It sounds quite definite that they say in the body of the letter.  If 
you look at – if you could read paragraph 3 of that letter?  It is brought 
– let us start with – it is brought – at page 105.  Are you there? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  I am not sure if this would be proper 
Chairperson.  Because this was from my Chairperson to the political 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 65 of 150 
 
heads would it be proper for me to go through this? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if it is placed here and I am sure your 
Chairperson knows it is here it would be fine. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes the Chairperson is present Chair.  We 
could just swop places with him if he does not want to talk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I do not think it is really necessary because all he 
– all you will be doing is reading what the letter says. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That what is contained yes. 
10 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Oh alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know it is not like what you are saying.  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Paragraph 3 it begins with “it is 
brought” 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  What page? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Page 105. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  105 okay.  Yes I am there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And paragraph 3 of the letter. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  It says: 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The paragraphs are not numbered but it is paragraph 
3. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you Chair. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:   
“It is brought to the attention of the SABC that the 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 66 of 150 
 
National Treasury will not release any part of the 3.2 
billion earmarked funding allocation for the SABC 
until the two departments are satisfied that the 
Public 
Broadcaster 
has 
fully 
complied 
or 
demonstrated a commitment to comply with all of the 
previous conditions to the funding.  The 3.2 billion 
funding will be released in tranches as and when the 
SABC produces satisfactory evidence in response to 
the preconditions.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and this is where both you and the Chairperson 
of the board are certainly in agreement that the position is that either 
all the conditions have been complied with or there has been a 
substantial compliance with most of the conditions.   
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And therefore to the extent that one of the – you 
either must show compliance or demonstrate a commitment to comply 
with all preconditions.  You say both you and the Chairperson say 
clearly you have demonstrated – SABC has demonstrated a commitment 
but you say actually you have complied. If not with all with substantial 
20 
portion of them. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you Chair.  I would like you to 
just place all… 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 67 of 150 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But – I am sorry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But maybe to be fair on those who may be 
responsible for giving the funding.  Insofar as they may only have had 
for the first time that SABC has complied or substantially complied that 
would only have been last week?  And therefore there has not been a 
lot of time for them 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For SABC to see whether they are acting or not. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I am not sure now if you – would you – are 
you prepared to place all the preconditions on record or would you 
rather leave that for the Chairperson to deal with? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  I can do it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Just read in the headings of all the 
preconditions so that they are on record? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I do not know if we need to go through them 
20 
because they are in the letter. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Because they are here Chair.  Yes thank 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And can I… 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 68 of 150 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I think the – at this stage we do not understand 
there to be any dispute. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  They are clear.  No true Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they are not saying there is any difficulty with 
complying with all of them. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Yes thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe we can just say confirm on record. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That the conditions are in this letter. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  Do you confirm that these 
10 
are the conditions that were placed before the SABC? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes they are. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And that your responses to the conditions 
on compliance they appear from page 112 right up to page 119 if I am 
correct.  Sorry Chair.  122. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then the attachments that go with that 
right up to the last page of your statement – of your annexures. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Correct.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That will go up to page 130 
20 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So that is all the responses that you had 
furnished to the Ministers? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 69 of 150 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  With regard to the conditions only if there is 
something that you particularly want to draw my attention to – if there 
is such you can mention but otherwise as long as we know where they 
are that should be enough because you are not saying we have 
difficulties with condition A, B, C, D you say will – have complied with 
most if not all.  But if there is – there are some that you want to draw 
to my special attention that – you may do so. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes Chair if I may on page 110.  The 
third paragraph there.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes do you want to read it 
10 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes.  It says: 
“It is our understanding that we have either 
complied 
or 
substantially 
complied 
with 
each 
precondition which has been demonstrated by the 
substantive documentation supplied over a period 
of eight months.  We have attached to this letter 
details on the SABC’s compliance with each 
condition.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You - you maybe wanting to - do you want to 
complete a same point you want to make out of that … 
20 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or you just wanted to read that? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Indeed I just wanted to emphasis 
Chairperson that we - we have demonstrated with all of the attachments 
how we have been able to comply … 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 70 of 150 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Or substantially comply with each of 
these conditions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No that is fine but another point which arises for 
me out this paragraph you have read is the reference to eight months. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I said a few minutes ago to the extent that the two 
Ministers might not - might only have had for the first time last week 
that you have complied with all the preconditions.  So you have 
complied substantially.  There might not have been enough time for 
10 
them to make the necessary decisions but there is this reference to 
eight months and the question that arises is whether this amounts to 
saying there have been eight months during which - in which we have 
complied … 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With all or substantially and therefore they ought to 
have known we had complied and the letter of last week was simply 
stating something they should have known for the past eight months 
anyway or is the position that look they might not have known that 
there has been compliance or they might have known that there has 
20 
been some compliance but they might not have known the level of 
compliance until last week when they - the letter was sent.  I think it is 
that clarification which I would like if possible. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  That eight months Chairperson refers to 
the time when we submitted all of the documentation that was required 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 71 of 150 
 
for the funding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  And we then have had to fine-tune 
some of our submissions throughout these past eight months … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  And working very closing with GTEC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  So it refers to the - to the period when 
this - the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The compliance? 
10 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was in place? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So - so therefore it would be fair to say there 
has been more than enough time for decisions to be taken if what 
prevented certain decisions from being taken previously was to allow 
you an opportunity to comply with the conditions? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and - and you do not know - you do not know the 
reason why the decisions have not been made? 
20 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Not at all Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think that was an important clarification. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 72 of 150 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Then I think that is all 
then in the main statement.  I think you have covered all the important 
aspects in your main statement.  Could you then move to page 49 which 
contains your - your supplementary and bearing in mind that you have 
just covered the issue about the funding now? 
Yes, page 49.  You have already testified to the correction 
that you wanted to make in paragraph 3 … 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Huh-uh. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  About the cash balances during those 
10 
financial years. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You did testify to that.  Am I correct? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes I did. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you and then if we - you have 
dealt with the amortisation of content … 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Huh-uh. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Which appears at page 50 and then you 
have - what I would like us to just go back to although you touched 
upon it slightly but I would like you to explain what you explain at page 
20 
53 paragraph 17 - from paragraph 17 onwards about the PSL rights 
acquisition because it is an important matter that affects the public and 
the public need to know how this all - all works and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am - I am sorry.  What page are you? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  At page 53 Chair. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 73 of 150 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is what he has to say there any different from what 
both he and the Chairperson have told us about the sports rights … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or is there something specific? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Something specific about … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Some licencing Chair which … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Which we have not touched … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Touched upon.  Yes could you please just 
explain briefly what you state in paragraph 17 right up to 21? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Basically we are saying there we used 
to - SABC was - it had an exclusive agreement at the time in terms of 
the PSL matches.  However we have then had to sub licence these from 
SuperSport.  I am not sure if you want me to get into the details but 
suffice to say the deal that we have now signed with SuperSport in 
20 
terms of PSL matches it does meet the mandate in terms of 
broadcasting all of the - most of the key matches but underlying that is 
the - which is very critical for us is that it is commercially viable for the 
SABC.  We - we have had to move away from a historic contract that - 
that resulted into a lot of losses into one that allows us to fulfil our 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 74 of 150 
 
mandate but in a manner that even those losses compared to the 
previous ones are the ones that we - we can be able to manage. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not think he needs to go into details. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No, no Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No.  It is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  We … 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I beg you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Whispering).  Can you ask the Reverend to put on 
the air con?  Yes continue. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Can we then jump 
because most of the matters you have covered?  Just your key 
submissions to the SABC - of the SABC to ICASA.  Just highlight those 
20 
topics that you wanted ICASA to deal with in its review and its 
regulations.  You have dealt largely with the must carry concepts. 
Just - because these that you are - suggested to ICASA I 
would believe are relevant.  Now you would like the Chair to take note 
of what is it that you propose going forward, am I right? 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 75 of 150 
 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  Could you then start 
from page 58? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Huh-uh. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Just - you have highlighted those key 
submissions which you made to ICASA. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Well the (intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Just on the topics, yes. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  The first one Chair is the issue of 
competition.  We - we feel there that the - there is a need for a proper 
10 
valuation of these sports rights to ensure that what we are paying is 
fair but there also is a need for transparency because the SABC then 
gets locked into these long contracts that are not necessarily 
commercially viable. 
That is the first part and the second part that we have 
submitted to ICASA is the unbundling of sports rights.  This is quite key 
because for us we feel that the right holders currently they can do as 
they wish.  There needs to be a regulation that will help us to deal with 
some of these.  So - so all of these that you see from page 58 … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Right.  These are submissions because 
ICASA requested all the key players to submit submissions in terms of 
the sports rights regulations. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and recently you testified on behalf of 
the SABC before ICASA? 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 76 of 150 
 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  That was around May 2019? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And you made these submissions to 
ICASA? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes I did. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and that - there is an annexure which 
would have formed part of your submissions that appears at page 98. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Huh-uh. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Those are the submissions - the 
10 
submissions that you made to ICASA when you testified before it? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes.  Correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Is that correct?  Yes, thank you.  Is there 
anything else that you would like to mention to Chair because I think 
we have reached the end of your two statements now? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes certainly. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Chair just to thank you for the 
opportunity to share what we found and what we are doing in the past 
12 months but I also need to state that we - we at a point where you 
20 
know as a leader as you can only inspire and give hope to a certain 
level but I am reaching a point now where every single week I actually 
have to ask key members of my team not to resign precisely because of 
the precarious situation we find ourselves in and I also cannot really 
give hope to the 5 000 employees of the SABC who keep every single 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 77 of 150 
 
day thinking something better is going to happen. 
I said to you earlier on Chair I feel and that is how the three 
executives feel - and by the way that is one of the reasons why we lost 
a key member of the executive team the Acting CEO - is we feel as the 
team we are standing in the way of this bailout and I do not know what 
will happen after this but the truth of the matter is that we cannot 
continue the way things are.  In the interest of the SABC certain tough 
decisions need to be taken. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No what you have said is very important and is 
concerning.  I do not know whether this is what you mean but it may 
10 
well be - it may well be that what you mean is that the three executives 
feel that they are not wanted. 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what you mean? 
MR MZWAMADODA MXAKWE:  Yes that is what I mean. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is extremely concerning.  I might not know 
the whole story about the SABC.  I am still going to hear a lot but I 
certainly did see yesterday documents that showed improvements that 
have been happening in terms of losses over the past three years that 
the Chairperson said and I think confirmed the improvements that 
20 
happened because of the implementation of the turnaround strategy 
that the executive and the board have come up with. 
I - I guess that the - maybe the best that one can say is that 
this is quite a serious situation and some - something quite drastic 
needs to be done to try and make sure that the right decisions are 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 78 of 150 
 
made to - to which would be in the interest of the institution.  I can just 
say at this stage it is - it is quite concerning and I am not sure exactly 
what if anything the Commission can do but I hope that the - the right 
people will become aware of this - the evidence you have given and 
this part of it in particular and what the Chairperson of the Board said 
yesterday and will also take note that I - I think it is something that is 
quite concerning and that needs some intervention but I - I think as 
many people as possible must be encouraged to stand when they 
believe they are doing right. 
Sometimes it can be difficult - the situation can be quite 
10 
difficult and sometimes it might be easy for somebody who is not in that 
person’s shoes to - to say do not do this.  Do that and so on but thank 
you for sharing that part with me.  It is quite concerning and I am 
hoping that the right intervention is going to happen soon. 
Thank you very much and thank you for coming to share with 
the Commission what you know in terms of the SABC since you joined 
and what the executive team and board have put in place to try and act 
in the best interest of the SABC.  Thank you very much.  You are 
excused. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  
20 
Mr Chairman may I ask that the Chair places away that bundle CC5 to 
16 and I would like to call the next witness Ms Magopeni.  Her 
statement appears in EXHIBIT 16 - CC17 to 18.  That should be on - 
next to Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you want me to take a five minutes adjournment … 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 79 of 150 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair, yes please. 
CHAIRPERSON:  While you put everything … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Together. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I will appreciate that.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  We will take a five minutes adjournment.  We 
adjourn.

CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you Chair, Mr Chairman in respect 
of this witness Rule 33 notices were issued to four persons that were 
implicated being Mr Matthews, Mr Mtzoneng, Ms Faith Mthambe and Mr 
Simon Thabele, and they were issued on time.  Mr Matthews has 
responded but he has responded largely to some of the witnesses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   And not to the evidence of this witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that’s fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Chair we now wish to call Ms Phatiswa 
20 
Magopeni, could she be sworn in? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, please administer the oath or affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:   Thank you.  Please state your full name for the record? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     Phatiswa Magopeni. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you have any objection to taking the prescribed 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 80 of 150 
 
oath? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
conscience?  Do you swear that the evidence that you will give will be 
the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, if so please raise 
your right hand and say so help me God. 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you 
PHATISWA MAGOPENI   (duly sworn, states) 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Thank you Mr Chairman.  Ms Magopeni 
10 
is it correct that you are the Head of News for the SABC? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     That is correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes, is it also correct that that you are 
the first female to Head news at SABC? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     Apparently yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Could you just raise your voice a bit or 
pull the mic closer. 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes she may have to raise the voice too, I’m 
struggling to hear, please do raise the voice as well. 
20 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     Thank you, I’ll do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We had a witness, was it last week or was it this 
week, who tried to raise his voice but in the end I gave up, I think he’s 
voice was just very soft by nature. Okay, alright thank you.      
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes thank you Chair, could you just 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 81 of 150 
 
place – or before you place your qualifications on record, let’s just 
quickly identify the statement that has been opened before you, that is 
contained in Exhibit CC17 to 18, Chair the witnesses statement had 
asked the registrar to place it before you, it’s CC18 it starts from page 
one up to page 15. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes that’s under divider CC18? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     That is correct Chair.  Have you got it 
Miss Magopeni? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     Yes I’ve got it thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Would you please turn to page 15 of that 
10 
statement – 14 rather, is that your signature that appears on that page? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     Correct, it’s my signature. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes and this was commissioned on the 
12 t h of August 2019? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     Correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Are the contents of this statement true 
and correct? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     Correct yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     And did you make this, or dispose to 
this affidavit voluntarily? 
20 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     Yes Voluntarily. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes thank you, now let’s go back then, 
we’ll start from page one of your statement but before we do that could 
you please just place your qualifications before the Chairperson? 
MS 
PHATISWA 
MAGOPENI: 
 
 
 
 
I 
matriculated 
in 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 82 of 150 
 
[indistinct]…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Well you have to be careful because doing it that 
way might make people think that you are not as young, yes. 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     Alright so I have a matric that I got in 
1989 in [indistinct], I have a bachelors of arts degree from UWC, 
University of the Western Cape, I have a bachelor of honours – 
bachelors of arts honours from the same university, University of the 
Western Cape, I have an integrated marketing communications diploma 
from the AAA school of advertising, I have a business studies post-
graduate diploma from the Gordon Institute of Business Science in Wits 
10 
of Pretoria, I have a masters philosophy degree from the University of 
the Western Cape and a master of business administration degree from 
GIBBS at the University of Pretoria. 
CHAIRPERSON:      Well that’s the way I’m used to, yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Thank you Chair. You heard in one of 
the most components of what the SABC is really all about heading the 
news room, could you just tell the Chairperson what you deal with – 
sorry before I do that, when did you join the SABC? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     I joined the SABC on the 1 s t of March 
2018. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes and before you joined the SABC 
where were you working? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     I was with ENCA, when I left I was the 
head of terrestrial news services and a business and economic editor. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes and before you went to ENCA did 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 83 of 150 
 
you work for any other news channel? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     Yes I was at SABC before, it was for two 
years I left just as ENCA was launching it’s 24 hour channel and prior 
that I was a lecturer at the University o the Western Cape and 
University of Cape Town. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     And when, for the first time did you work 
for the SABC, the first time that you worked and left, when was that? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     It was 2006/2007 and then I left in 2008. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes and then you re-joined in 2018? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     Yes. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes thank you and then you first deal in 
your statement with the culture as you found it upon your appointment 
could you just tell the Chairperson about what you found in the 
newsroom and what you deal with in those paragraphs? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     The first…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:     I’m sorry just to – clarification, your position is 
head of news, is that right? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:    Yes I also have executive responsibilities 
as Group Executive in the corporation. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes what I wanted to find out is whether head of 
20 
news is head of both radio and TV news or? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     It’s TV, radio and digital platforms. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Oh all of them? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     All of them yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Thank you, yes you may continue. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 84 of 150 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Maybe just to get the structure as head 
of news who reports to you? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     It’s the General Manager for television 
news, General Manager for radio news, General Manager for strategic 
planning for the division and there’s another General Manager for 
special projects, those are the four people that report directly to me. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Thank you and what is your role then as 
head of news? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     My role is to provide leadership 
oversight in terms of strategy, in terms of operations and in terms of 
10 
editorial responsibilities. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes, so then let’s go back to what you 
then found and then you will tell the Chairperson about what you found 
and how easy it was or difficult it was for you then to implement the 
mandate that you believe you have in terms of your obligation as head 
of news? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     It’s just starting with the functions 
within the division itself, it provides news content to 19 radio stations 
and three free to air television channels SABC 1, 2 and 3 and the 
dedicated channel which is 24 hour news channel SABC news channel 
20 
and [indistinct] platforms.  So that’s the service that we provide across 
all the platforms as the news division and in addition to that we have, 
what has been referred to here before, the radio station in the Northern 
Cape, XKFM which serves the two communities there and the 
languages that we serve it’s [indistinct] so we provide news content 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 85 of 150 
 
there in current affairs.  So as part of the work that we do getting into 
that environment I found decay…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:     You found? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     Decay, serious state of decay in the 
newsroom.  The newsroom was subdued but you could sense that the 
kind of equilibrium that companies would be hoping for is not the kind 
of equilibrium that I found there, it was something else.  There was 
something bubbling underneath even though it looked like things were 
normal.  The newsroom was on auto pilot even though there were 
managers in the system who was supposed to take responsibility in 
10 
terms of giving directions and the nature of the leadership that existed 
did not assist the organisation to do what it was meant to do and it is 
often said that any contribution by managers, that does not assist to 
impact the capacity of the organisation to deliver, to achieve it’s results 
and to attain it’s objectives, it’s not supposed to be there, but that’s 
exactly what existed in that environment and this is where failure of 
human resource processes, it’s a failure of leadership, the fact that it 
was allowed to happen.  So this is the environment that I found and 
also the fact that you had people who were leading or were supposed to 
lead the newsroom who were not trusted by journalists within the 
20 
newsroom, what’s the problem?  Those people had no legitimacy and 
they did not command any authority to be respected by the journalists 
within the newsroom because they were associated with a period where 
things happened that were not supposed to be happening in a 
newsroom.  With the serious editorial drifts that happened during that 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 86 of 150 
 
period. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the lack of trust by the journalists in that 
leadership wasn’t necessarily because the leadership didn’t have the 
right qualifications but it was because of what the leadership was 
perceived to be associated with in terms of what had been happening or 
was it both? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     It was a toxic combination of both and 
as a result of that what you would see at the point I was joining the 
organisation there were serious problems in terms of decision making 
because the journalists within the newsroom were used to being given 
10 
instructions and they would have to wait to be told what to do because 
previously whatever they tried to do in term of journalistic practice was 
changed, either at the point of broadcasting or at the point where the 
content was being produced and therefore they had to wait to be given 
instructions to be able to do what they were meant to do. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Can you just talk about that structure – 
the reporting structure at that time because I believe there was a point 
where journalists if they had to refer anything upward they had to go to 
the COO at the time and I just want to understand now, currently what 
are the reporting lines.  If I’m a journalist and I have a story to tell and 
20 
I believe, there’s some form of criminality and I need to run this by my 
superiors who would that journalist go to? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     Ordinarily the reporting lines are such 
that you will start with your editors, your line manager and if there’s 
something else that needs to be dealt with that cannot be dealt with at 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 87 of 150 
 
that level it gets escalated to the next level and at a point where it gets 
to me, I then try and deal with whatever has been raised and if I feel 
that there’s a point that I need to raise, that would go straight to the 
Editor Chief, which is the current Group Executive, the current Group 
CEO.  At the point I was joining the SABC that had been restored 
because there was a stage when the reporting lines were changed for 
the Group Executive of News and that person was supposed to report to 
the COO instead of the CEO but when I joined it had already been 
taken back to the [indistinct]. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes you may continue, you were still 
10 
highlighting those…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:     I’m sorry Miss Norman, maybe it might help to give 
us a picture of the structure in the – I don’t know if newsroom is the 
right word, to say that you would have the journalists in the field and 
then the next level before it comes to you so one has a sense of the 
various levels. 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     The current set up is that you have 
journalists that report to – if you are dealing with general news you 
report directly to the National Assignments Editor, if you report to the 
specialist desks, you would be reporting to your Editor either your 
20 
economics Editor or your foreign Editor or your sports Editor or your 
politics Editor and we also have Editors in the regions that we call 
Regional Editors the ten offices that we have across the country, it’s 
nine plus ten which is our Pretoria office that it’s own Regional Editor.  
So in that environment the Regional Editors would report to one of the 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 88 of 150 
 
general managers which is radio news head and the specialist desks 
Editors would be reporting to your TV new head and the current affairs 
Editor who deals with the long form content that SABC produces also 
reports to one of the two, either your television or your radio head and 
the digital news Editor reports to the television news Editor and it’s 
these heads of the units that report directly to me and then I report to 
the COO in terms of my operational responsibilities and for [indistinct] 
editorially I report to the GCO. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Thank you still continuing with the 
10 
environment other matters that you want to highlight when you arrived 
at the SABC? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     Where I make reference to the 
leadership not being trusted and having no legitimacy I make reference 
to lack of sense of ownership in the newsroom.  So in an environment 
where you have breaking news stories on a frequent basis it wasn’t 
clear who was supposed to direct the process because people were 
walking on eggshells.  No-one wants to make a decision because it’s 
not – no-one is sure if I take this decision especially on political stories 
you are not sure whether you are doing the right thing or you will be 
20 
reprimanded for making the decisions you make.  So as a result of that 
there was a serious lack of ownership, lack of ownership in the 
newsroom as a result of that environment. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Was your understanding or your sense when you 
arrived that for a long time journalists may had decisions that they 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 89 of 150 
 
needed to make themselves, professionally interfered with by people 
who had no business interfering with them to the extent that they may 
have had to make a decision, if I want to continue working here I must 
forget about trying to do what I believe I’m supposed to do because I 
will be  - somebody will override what I am saying and therefore I must  
just wait for them to tell me and then I’ll do what they tell me because 
that’s the only way I can continue to be here? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     There was a strong sense of that in the 
system and you would be talking to journalists and they would be 
telling you that there were times when you’d be sitting as a producer in 
10 
the newsroom – no in the control room which is more like our cockpit if 
you think about a plane and these are the people who are responsible 
for taking news content to air, which is your broadcast, your live 
broadcast.  So you are sitting there as a producer and then comes a 
call, ordinarily calls that go to the control room are calls within the 
system in the newsroom it’s either the person who’s siting in the 
newsroom who’s telling you that there’s an update on a script or 
something else has been added to the bulletin but these would be calls 
from external parties, telling the producers not to put certain content on 
air or to change stores that are currently running. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes. 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:    And that is in a world where things are 
organised that wouldn’t happen because that person, whoever called, if 
I were to call from outside directly into the production room or whatever 
you call it, so that is not normal because I should, at least be calling 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 90 of 150 
 
you or calling a journalist or calling an Editor but not your producers. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     It’s very abnormal to have external 
parties having access to the control room? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Your reference to external, is that a reference to 
external to the control room but in internal within the SABC or external 
to SABC or both? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     Both. 
CHAIRPERSON:     So people from outside the SABC could just phone 
through to the control room and say, don’t do this, don’t do that or do 
10 
that? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     Yes correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:     And sometimes people within SABC but who should 
not really be given instructions to the control room would do that? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     Yes they would be giving instructions to 
the newsroom and yet the editorial prerogative resides with the 
newsroom. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes and of course, certainly those within the SABC 
would be knowing what the right thing is, they will be knowing the 
policy? 
20 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:     And they’d be going against it in full knowledge of 
what it is? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     Correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     And I think you’ve covered up to page 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 91 of 150 
 
88, I’m not sure whether I’ve left out anything there, playing safe and 
all that, I think page 8.9 you’re dealing with no clear lines of command 
to journalists at page 4 of your statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Does 8.9 look like – it’s two sentences put together 
without a full stop, no clear lines of command as journalists on and off 
the field were getting instruction from everywhere, internal and 
external, it’s the point you have just made hey? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     That’s correct that’s what I’ve 
just…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes so there were no clear lines of command for 
10 
journalists, that’s one. 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:     The second is journalists were getting instructions 
from everywhere internal and externally? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes okay.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Could you just deal with what you deal 
with your overall assessment of what was happening where you deal 
with that in paragraph 10 where you deal with battered news brand with 
no credibility, this is something that one of the witnesses for the SABC 
20 
once dealt with, how does news lose credibility? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     Credibility with audiences and with 
citizens in this case because that’s our primary stakeholder as a news 
service, it’s lack of trust in our content and with all that has been 
reported about the SABC the instructions that were given about some 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 92 of 150 
 
cottoned content or certain visuals that were not supposed to be shown 
for whatever reason was given at that time, all of that goes against 
SABC’s  editorial policy because we’re supposed to report truthfully 
and we’re supposed to reflect our content with accuracy and part of 
that obliges us not to conceal information that we’re aware of as 
journalists.  So the issue of credibility comes with a lot of that and 
adherence to journalism ethics which were violated in this case.  So 
where you don’t have transparency and your content can’t be trusted 
your credibility goes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Thank you and then at page five you 
10 
deal now with the policy environment, you’ve touched upon the editorial 
policy but just tell the Chairperson how…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:     But maybe before that she – I think she makes the 
point – you make the point that the situation was so bad that journalists 
were actually afraid to disclose who they worked for is that right? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     Yes that’s a sense of shame people had 
working…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:     That’s how bad it was? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes thank you, could you then deal with 
what you deal with at page five, the policy environment. 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     Let me start by making reference to the 
Editorial Policy itself and the mandate of the SABC newsroom.  We 
exist, primarily for the benefit of the citizens of the country, our work 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 93 of 150 
 
talks to their needs in terms of information and news content and when 
I came in I couldn’t find a sense that the purpose of our existence had 
influence in the decisions that we were making as a newsroom and you 
couldn’t find a sense that as the stories were being discussed in 
[indistinct] sessions  there was reference to why we needed to do the 
stories that we were doing and the transgressions that were in the 
systems editorially were because there is no system that holds anyone 
to account for such.  You know that the Editorial Policy exists, you 
know that we are violating it, but there’s nothing that says should you 
transgress this is what’s going to happen to you or these are the steps 
10 
that you have to go through.  There’s nothing specific to that effect. 
CHAIRPERSON:     There’s no mechanism? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     There was no mechanism to hold anyone 
to account or to assure and ensure adherence to the policy. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Does saying there was no mechanism include 
saying you couldn’t go to anybody who, in terms of the policy, was 
supposed to be informed if there were transgressions and that person 
was given power to take action, does it include saying that or there 
would always be somebody to go to but whether anything could be done 
might be something else? 
20 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     It’s something that was spoken of 
casually but there was never any action taken for things that are known 
to be against the SABC Editorial Policy. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Is that because of the level of seniority of the 
transgressors in the organisation or is that simply because there is no 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 94 of 150 
 
– there was no mechanism.  So I mean sometimes if you reach a 
certain level you might say, well there is nobody to report so and so to, 
is that the kind of situation or is the situation that there might have 
been somebody to report to but maybe the journalist knew that it 
wouldn’t bring any results because that person was himself or herself 
compromised and was not trusted as a person that could enforce the 
policy, or is that something that you never got to understand whether it 
was applicable? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     There were people who were supposed 
to hold people to account for transgressions but it was not happening.  
10 
Sometimes it’s because they were not themselves aware that this was a 
transgression because this is what I found in the newsroom that in the 
Editorial Policy that we are supposed to adhere to as journalists within 
the news division, it’s something that we never took time to understand 
and how it relates to the daily decision making that we get involved in 
as editors.  So the people who were there who were supposed to hold 
the people to account were either not fully knowledgeable about what 
needed to be done or when the issues were raised with them, they did 
nothing about it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Thank you, and the next point you make 
20 
in paragraph 13 that there was no way of measuring the performance of 
the employees of the SABC and could you just tell the Chair about that 
and why you felt it was a necessary point to make and to perhaps put 
measures to make sure that it happened? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     The issue of performance management 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 95 of 150 
 
it’s a – this is how you assess the performance of your staff, when  you 
realise that there are gaps in their skills or what they are required to 
know to do the job you provide interventions but the fact that the 
performance management system does not exist is a problem because 
you are not able to assist staff that’s meant to be assisted because you 
don’t even know what they don’t know so you can’t provide the kind of 
support that’s required even when you can see that there are glaring 
gaps in the performance but there is nothing you can do because it’s 
not systematically recorded, you have no way of saying, based on A, B, 
C and D I am able to provide the support because I have seen the gaps 
10 
and they are visible in the performance of the employee. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     And is that linked to the point that you 
make that there was then no productivity monitoring because you don’t 
know how the performance is measured, you don’t know what your 
employee are doing, its difficult to even measure productivity levels? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:   It’s not only about individual productivity, 
it’s also linked to the quantity that’s required for all our systems on any 
day.  So if you have journalists that are sitting in provinces you should 
know that for two journalists that are on duty today or let’s say this 
week if you’re going to take it over seven days, this is the level of 
20 
productivity that we expect from these journalists for the next seven 
days.  You are not able to do that because there is no monitoring 
mechanism and as a result we end up with content slippages in the 
system because there are stories that get gathered from all over the 
country that never get broadcast because no-one knows where are they 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 96 of 150 
 
– where the stories are sitting as they come from the provinces and no-
one tracks that when they land in Auckland Park this is the process to 
be followed these stories are going to SABC1, these stories are going 
to SABC2 or these stories are going to SABC3 depending on the 
languages that are requiring the content and these stories are going to 
be on our radio stations depending on the language requirements as 
well or these stories are going to be residing on digital only because in 
the way they are – they have been gathered they are mostly suited to 
that platform but there’s also content that’s going to come from radio 
and TV that goes online.  So there is no monitoring of that sense so it 
10 
affects the entire system.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Thank you and you deal again with 
something that, I think the next witness is going to deal with also 
relating to recruitment and remuneration of freelances but can you just 
talk to that, why is it a problem if it is a problem? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     The problem with not having a filtering 
recruitment mechanism for freelances is that – so you get to see 
Editors or Executive Producers that bring people into the system 
because they trust them they’ve met them elsewhere or they’ve seen 
them doing work but when they get into the system there are no checks 
20 
as to whether these people are even qualified for the roles they get to 
fill.  These people are expected to perform to the same standards as 
permanent 
employees 
and 
therefore 
you 
expect 
some 
filtering 
mechanism to get them into the system, either through qualifications, 
all the checks that we do for permanent employees, they don’t exist for 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 97 of 150 
 
our freelancers.  So they get into the system in a different way but 
linked to that, the way they are remunerated is also not similar to the 
way they get into the system is also not linked to any mechanism as to 
the grading of their payments as in, this one is at entry level, this one 
is at professional, this one is at expertise level, there’s no such so 
there’s a subjective process in how these people are paid.  So you’d 
find a person who  performs at entry level earning very high and a 
person who’s performing at very high standard earning very low 
because it’s a subjective process and it depends on who brought you 
there.  
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Thank you and then you deal with the 
invitations of Editors and journalists by Government departments and 
agencies and you list them, Embassy’s and businesses.  What is 
expected of a journalist if a journalist gets an invitation that there is 
something happening in the department…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:     I’ve lost you Miss Norman…[intervenes]. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     We are on page six Chair starting from 
the last paragraph six of 16, page five it goes on to page six.  Are you 
there Miss Magopeni? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     Yes I am. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Thank you could you just talk to that, if 
a journalist gets and invitation that we’d like you to come and cover a 
wedding or something what are they expected to do or maybe cover an 
occasional event that a particular department is hosting? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     In a normal environment such invitations 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 98 of 150 
 
should come straight to Editors, to the central system because it is in 
that system where we assess the editorial value of honouring this 
invitation and how it is going to assist us to serve the public but in the 
way things were happening, individual journalists were getting 
invitations and I’m expected to approve these invitations because they 
are sent to them and what this means is that you could easily have 
influences that are coming from different directions an with no control 
to ensure that there is no interference in the way these journalists are 
invited and not only journalists some of the invitations go straight to 
Editors and the danger with that is that it weakens our editorial controls 
10 
because we have no say in how this journalist was hand picked by 
either a department or an agency or an Embassy or any other structure 
that is outside the SABC system.  So this is not a story that is assigned 
from within where you would know that this story needs to be dealt with 
by the economics desk or this story needs to be dealt with the politics 
desk.  It’s coming from outside prescribing who should cover it and this 
is where our problem lies because the different forms of interference 
come through these invitations which is not only political interference, 
commercial interference also comes through these invitations. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     So if the journalist wants to make more 
20 
money gets invited to a wedding goes to cover that and makes more 
money from that, what is wrong with that? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     It goes against our editorial system and 
he’s in violation of journalistic ethics. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Thank you. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 99 of 150 
 
CHAIRPERSON:     Because the choice is made by somebody outside 
the newsroom and certainly outside the SABC and that person could be 
having certain interest in the story and may well do certain things to try 
and get the story to be told in a certain way, whereas if they simply 
request that a journalist be sent and it’s the Editor or whoever within 
the SABC who chooses which journalist should go there, then there is 
less room for any undue influence, is that right? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     Yes, correct sir and in fact in some of 
the cases it’s not only about managing controls it’s also to do that we 
have journalists who are sitting in provinces who never get these 
10 
opportunities to be invited to these international trips.  So by saying we 
need to centralise the system it’s also to open up the system to other 
people who are sitting in other provinces.  So we would know that so 
and so is very strong on covering arts and culture and pick that person 
from a different province and say, you should take this trip if it comes 
through our centralised system but if a person is hand picked from 
outside that makes our job difficult and in fact we have started rejecting 
some of them. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Thank you.  Thank you Chair I see that 
it’s time for the long adjournment. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay we’ll take the lunch adjournment and we’ll 
resume at 2 o’clock, we adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 100 of 150 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us proceed. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Thank you.  Ms 
Magopeni when we adjourned you were still dealing with journalists but 
there is something that you want to add about journalists and their 
safety currently.  Maybe it is something that you need to talk about it is 
since we were talking about journalists now and you can just put that 
in. 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  Some of the challenges that our 
journalists are faced with are not only related to being intimidated by 
politicians on the stories they cover.  They also relate to the public and 
10 
how – as in yesterday we had one of our vehicles attacked during the 
protests in Johannesburg and the journalist who was covering a story 
was also attacked.  So this is a problem for us.  But as far as the 
financial situation of the SABC and how it applies to this case.  When I 
joined last year I asked for hostile environment training for our 
journalists.  That has not happened because we cannot provide that 
service.  And protective gear because it – it is going to happen one day 
that one of them gets exposed to a situation where I would be found 
wanting when I have to explain what happened.  So this is a problem 
that we are facing.  So it is not only the fact that they intimidated when 
20 
they cover stories it is the fact that we expose them to risk by not 
offering them the right protection.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  In such environments. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  And then going back to your 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 101 of 150 
 
statement page 6 at paragraph 17. So you say the matters that you 
highlight they are in need of – of strengthening you making sure that 
you have [indistinct] controls and you ensure quality.  Maybe before we 
proceed on the – as to how you are trying to whatever it is that you 
have highlighted as having been problems how you are trying to work 
on those and to make sure that those do not happen before you move 
on to other processes and systems. 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  What we have tried to do so far is 
starting the editorial issues and journalists and the management of the 
newsroom.  One of the things that have happened despite the fact that 
10 
you have this complex operation as SABC News that provides news 
services to all these platforms there is no forward planning editor.  And 
that is the first thing that we had to address.  That there is a person 
who has to account for forward planning for that area.  And this does 
not only apply to short range planning.   We need to plan for long term 
events.  And that means also managing the costs of our coverage when 
we deal with big events.  Because you would be able to book your 
accommodations in advance, book your travel flights in advance and 
hire cars in advance if you have to travel to Cape Town or to any other 
place that is not Johannesburg.  But because that forward planning 
20 
function was not there so it has always been a problem because we 
wake to stories literally.  You wake up to a story that you have to 
deploy resources to without even interrogating the editorial rationale 
for covering that story.  And the second part was again you look at the 
service that we are – we were supposed to provide to the South African 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 102 of 150 
 
public in terms their news and information needs.  You have audiences 
that consume their content in African languages.  There is no African 
languages editor in our newsroom and this is despite the fact that this 
is your biggest audience as SABC news.  Just looking at TV alone your 
7pm bulletin on a daily basis is going to give you more than three 
million viewers but there is no dedicated person who looks at the needs 
of those audiences in terms of content.  And you can apply this across 
the languages on television.   And as a result of that lack you have 
audiences that are being served content that is generated for English 
audiences.  So it is not tailor made and it does not talk to their needs 
10 
and it is not regional enough to address the needs of the audiences 
that we are talking about.  Radio is different because our radio stations 
are spread across the country.  So the local flavour is reflected in the 
content of our radio – of our radio facilities.  But digital is similar to TV. 
There is no dedicated person who looks after the needs of the people 
who consume their content in African languages and this is a big 
problem for us.  The other part is looking at how the system is 
designed.  We had a situation and in fact still exists but we are in the 
process of addressing it now.  We have a news operation that has 
morning bulletins but there is no overnight editor who looks at the 
20 
content that gets produced until 12 midnight and look at what has not 
been used but that was generated.  And look at content that is not time 
bound that could serve as morning stories.  That did not exist.  So 
these are the things that we are trying to address.  But also when I 
came in what we have is a 24 hour news channel, the SABC news 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 103 of 150 
 
channel had no editor.  Literally a free for all depending on who is 
available to lead it or who is interested in putting [indistinct]. And you 
would have people moving in and out and shouting at executive 
producers as to what they want to see on TV.  So this is the 
environment that I found but we are also in the process of addressing 
that because we are now only hire a person who is going to be 
responsible for that area.  Not that we would not have done it earlier 
but because of the several moratoria that have been imposed on the 
SABC and SABC news we were not able to fill those positions.  And 
again talking to the inadequacies that we have had to deal with in the 
10 
system just before elections we went to covering elections with 
eighteen reporters out of the system and these are people that we lost 
to either retirement or people resigning, looking for greener pastures or 
people who just decided that they no longer want to be with SABC. So 
we have not been able to fill those roles.  So the problems and the 
issues are multifaceted so it is not one thing that you would say this is 
why you are here.  It is a lot of problems that have been allowed to 
fester in the system. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. And – thank you.  And then you deal 
in paragraph 19 with coordination of the work of the SABC or the news 
20 
division.  Could you just take us through that as to what do you mean 
by that and how is that going to enhance the workings of the SABC? 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:   When you talk about coordination you 
first look our mandate as a news division.  We are supposed to provide 
content that is untrammelled to the public with no interference of any 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 104 of 150 
 
nature.  So you get into this environment where there are no controls in 
place and I want to go back a bit and talk to the point when I was 
joining the SABC.  I got into the system as a journalist primarily and 
the second point is that I am a business management professional.  
Politics have got nothing to do with me.  I never signed up for political 
activism within the news division of the SABC and I was never asked to 
lead a political branch within the SABC.  So when we talk about the 
absence of processes 
1. You look at the fact that over the years the first question when 
you come in is to ask how does this division does its work?  How 
10 
does it do its work and how from the point of story ideation to the 
point where the story gets to air how do you account for the 
processes in between?  That is not documented. 
If you were at any point to wipe out a division you would have to go 
elsewhere to find a way of re-establishing it because it is not written – 
the work is not documented anywhere.  The processes that drive the 
work of that division news gathering, news processing and news 
dissemination not a single one of those processes is documented.  So 
this is the environment that I found and it is only now that we are 
starting to work on documenting work flows.  But none of those are 
20 
documented. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  How is that different from what the one 
witness from the SABC who is an archivist Mr Scott he was a senior. 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes a senior personnel who came to 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 105 of 150 
 
testify and told us about the archives that the SABC keeps.  Is what 
you talking to different from that? 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  It is not different it is part of the same 
problem. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.   
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  Our archive system – I am trying to find 
the right word for it.  But as it is you have a system that still operates 
on tapes.  We are probably one of the last few broadcasters that are 
still operating on a tape system and that costs us about R6 million a 
year because we are paying for those who are no longer using the 
10 
system.  So where things are – so these tapes are stacked in Auckland 
Park and you will find them across the country in the different regions.  
And some of the content that is in these tapes has deteriorated in 
quality.  You not even sure if you will find anything if you had to try and 
use those tapes looking for whatever that concerns you at that point.  
And as a result of the tape system no one knows for certain that what 
we had in 2013 is still available because some of these tapes get lost 
and I had been told that some of them walked out of the building and 
that is the terminology they walked out of the building.  So we cannot 
even say with certainty that we have the material that we think we 
20 
have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So when you say this is not documented you mean – 
do you mean processes that are followed in the production of news or 
do you mean if I – if somebody says on the 15 t h February 2013 you had 
this news item I would like to go back to it you mean you would have no 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 106 of 150 
 
guarantee that you can find it or is it both? 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  It is both.  The material is not 
catalogued properly and you can attribute that to either people working 
there not knowing how to do it properly or because there is no proper 
archiving system that is digital.  We are still working on analogue and 
old modes of doing things. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you Chair.  And then you deal 
with commercial opportunities.  How do these relate to all the gaps that 
you have dealt with from paragraph 30 at page 8? 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  The commercial opportunities that I am 
10 
referring to here it is generally known that because of the mandate that 
we carry as the news division it is difficult to commercialise news 
content because the SABC policy prohibits us from doing so.  But there 
are things that we can do and there – in fact let me make the first 
reference to us being here.  This is part of the public mandate that we 
are supposed to carry that we broadcast these commissions.  The cost 
of broadcasting these commissions is not taken care of in the sense of 
the public mandate.  We do not have money that accounts for the public 
mandate that we – that we are expected to deliver on.  So this 
commission has been running for more than a year now and the 
20 
arrangement that we have as broadcasters – so you would have ENCA 
doing one week we take their feed and us doing another week they take 
our feed that is how we manage the costs. But the reality is it does not 
matter how you do it we still have to foot the bill despite the fact that 
this project is a public mandate.  So you look at this and you look at 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 107 of 150 
 
other things that we are expected to cover.  For instance host 
broadcast services.  When we are asked by government and agencies 
to provide host broadcast services again I am going to use a recent 
example.  When the former President appeared here we were the ones 
who were providing feat that day and the expectation is that every 
media house that wants a feed is going to come to us.  We had more 
than 15 media houses including international media houses that had to 
plug on our feed.  We are the ones who have to carry the cost they get 
away without paying anything and because it is a public mandate but no 
one is taking care of it.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I would have thought that the arrangement with 
other stations would be you can get this but you have to pay because 
we cannot be the only ones paying and you just get the benefits? 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  That is exactly what we are supposed to 
be doing.  That we start charging for people who want a feed from us 
because we have to foot the bill for the deployments that we have to 
make to cover these big stories. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But why – why would it not have been done from 
the beginning to say well – because I do recall when we started here I 
was informed that there was an arrangement that could be made in 
20 
terms of which one you know station SABC it was – it could be here and 
then other TV stations would get from them and I asked if that was 
acceptable to all concerned and I was told yes and I said okay that is 
what will happen.  But I – I would have assumed that SABC would say 
well if you want this this is what we are – these are the costs 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 108 of 150 
 
associated with us and you cannot just come and get the benefit you 
will have to pay as well. 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  It is only now that we are thinking along 
those lines but previously it has been the case that because we are a 
public broadcaster and we therefore have to provide the facilities 
without any compensation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. Just one – there has to be a 
distinction am I correct between a state broadcaster and a national 
10 
broadcaster or is there no difference at all or a public broadcaster as 
you put it? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You mean state and public? 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  There is a difference and the difference 
is huge. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  Our editorial policy is clear about who 
we are and it is actually explicit about us not being a government 
mouthpiece and serving political interests.  It is very clear in that 
regard.  We cover government but we are not the mouthpiece of 
20 
government.  Just one example that I know does get people angry.  
That when I go to work I do not announce that I go to work because I 
get paid for what I do.  So if you are going to invite a public news 
service when you switch on a tap or when you cut a ribbon that is a 
problem and there is a problem with the people who take editorial 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 109 of 150 
 
decisions to do such.  You can still cover the story.  You cover it from 
the perspective of the communities that are affected by whatever is 
happening.  You getting water after 25 years or you getting water after 
a year.  But the fact that a tap has been switched on cannot be a story.  
As a public broadcaster and as a public news service we decide how we 
apply what is our mandate to our editorial decisions and our stories 
have to reflect that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Talking about the SABC’s 
mandate could you please turn to page 19 this is one of your annexures 
10 
to your statement which is the SABC Editorial Policy?  But – page 19 
that is where the mandate is outlined. 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay. 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  Correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Are you there 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  Yes I am thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. Could you just place on record briefly 
the bullets that are there and how its functions, rights and obligations. 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  Okay.  Reflects South African attitudes 
20 
… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Or maybe you should start with the 
charter. 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  Start with the – 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Even the first sentence is fine yes. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 110 of 150 
 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  Okay. 
“The SABC’s mandate as a public broadcaster comes 
from the charter which defines its objectives.  The 
charter is laid down in chapter 4 of the Broadcasting 
Act as amended and requires the SABC to encourage 
the development of South African expression by 
providing in the official languages a wide range of 
programming that reflects South African attitudes, 
opinion, ideas, values and artistic creativity.   
That displays South African talent in educational an 
10 
entertaining programmes.   
That offers a plurality of views and a variety of news, 
information and analysts from a South African point 
of view.   
That advances the national and public interest.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Yes and those are the objectives that 
you say you subscribe to? 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. Thank you and then may we then go 
back to your statement.  You have – have you finished explaining these 
20 
financial commercial opportunities that you dealt with. But I think if you 
– if – you have but I would like you – to take you to paragraph 30.2 
page 9 where you deal with the pricing system of your archival 
material. 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  Okay. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 111 of 150 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And this is one of the matters that Mr 
Scott dealt with and it relates to content that was given to ANN7.  So it 
is a matter that is important for the work of the commission.  So could 
you just tell the Chairperson what – what is it that you want to convey 
there? 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  What we have here even outside the 
material that links to what happened with ANN7.  The pricing structure 
of archive material when we licence it to parties that are interested in 
the content is such that there is no discrimination in the content.  
Whether the content is unique.  Whether the content is exclusive to the 
10 
SABC and looking at the age of the material, the novelty of the material 
there is a flat structure.  So it is a flat price that we charge.  It is 
R2000.00 per minute.  Regardless of the fact that some of that material 
cannot be reproduced.  And this is something that we are now 
addressing with our intellectual property unit because it cannot be 
allowed and there is a lot of value that we lose as a result of the 
current arrangement.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay.  Thank you.  And then you deal with 
another opportunity at paragraph 30.3 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  Yes. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Dealing with outside broadcasts. 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  Okay.  Outside broadcasts the Group 
CEO did make a reference to these arrangements.  These are stories 
that we cover and above our general deployments.  For instance if you 
have to cover a story you would deploy a reporter, deploy a video 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 112 of 150 
 
journalist if it is radio you deploy a radio reporter, if it digital you 
deploy a person who is going to take care of those needs.  Or assign 
the two from radio and TV to make that content available for our 
[indistinct] platforms.  So in this case the projects or broadcast projects 
that we would charge for as outside broadcasts are those that are 
beyond our general coverage. They require bigger deployments in 
terms of resources and this is where we start charging for our coverage 
which is not necessarily the content but it is the deployment, the costs 
of deploying resources to cover these stories.  The number of 
journalists that you are going to send. The multi camera requirements 
10 
for the story that you would be covering so you look at all of that and 
then you would say this is how much it is going to cost us. If we were 
to hire out these facilities this is what we would get and therefore this 
is what it costs us to cover the story.  And in the way it has been done 
it was handled by executive producers who would decide and it has 
always 
been 
around 
R50 000.00 
regardless 
of 
the 
extent 
of 
deployments and the arrangement that we have now it is with 
commercial enterprises because it is not only about the resources that 
are deployed it is the airtime that the client would have derived value 
from by us putting the content on air.  And in some of the cases it is 
20 
more than an hour but you pay R45 000,00 which only covers part of 
the deployment costs. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay.  Thank you.  And then the next 
paragraph you deal with advertising in the news – I am not sure 
whether it is in the newsroom or what do you mean by saying that 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 113 of 150 
 
generally advertising there is not allowed?  Does it mean that when 
there is news you cannot show clientele, what does it mean? 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  Again this is a policy issue.  We are not 
allowed to advertise news and it is out of fear of commercial influence 
in our content.  The only advertising that is allowed it is during ad 
breaks – commercial ja we call them commercial ad breaks or the time 
we take a break and go elsewhere.  So this is the – these are the slots 
that – that you would use for advertising but for some reason there was 
a point within the SABC when there was an understanding that 
advertising is not allowed.  You are not supposed to place any 
10 
commercial content on our news programming.  Which is not 
necessarily the case we have ad breaks.   Because even if you look at 
our free to air channels SABC 1, 2 and 3 there are ad breaks and this 
is how we generate revenue.  The only thing that is prohibited is 
sponsorship of news content of current affairs content.  You can do 
sponsorships around informal knowledge building programming which is 
your shows like Travel Trends. In this case you would look at 
interesting places to go to or to visit in South Africa and it is your 
health tips shows, it is your personal finance tips, it is things that have 
– that are not necessarily hard core news that you would covering that 
20 
require hard editorial treatment.  So there are opportunities to generate 
revenue but again it is a space that we are only getting into now. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And you – by the way just on 
advertising just as a matter of interest.  How does it work because you 
will find that one company gets exposed more than any other company?  
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 114 of 150 
 
Does it go according to the cost that that – or the money that that 
company pays the SABC or does it depend on the reaction of the public 
to that particular advertisement, how does that work? 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  The scheduling of adverts depends on 
the airtime bought by the client.  That is how it works.  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay.  So the more money you have and 
the more adverts – more airtime you buy the more you get shown? 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  Correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  You have already dealt with – 
you used this commission as an example when dealing with 30.6, am I 
10 
correct? 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  Yes correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  And then – so now you get 
there you find the state that you have already described to the 
Chairperson so what are the interventions then? 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  The – the – sorry – the kind of 
interventions that we have had to make the first thing that I – that we 
had to do was to look at the set up in the newsroom.  Our mandate, 
what had gone wrong?  What we needed to do differently.  So that was 
our starting point.  And related to that we had to think about the fact 
20 
that we say as a public news service our duty is to provide critical 
watchdog journalism.  Not just information about what is happening, 
that is our duty.  And part of our mandate is to ensure that we enhance 
the democracy of the country by doing the things that we are doing and 
providing information, assisting citizens with the right information so 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 115 of 150 
 
that they make the right decisions.  But there is something that we 
always say, while it is okay for us to say we are the eyes and ears of 
the public in how we do things holding authority to account whether it is 
politicians, government or business what we are not is the voice of the 
voiceless.  We like to make that claim and it sounds right when we do 
so.   
 
There is - there is an Indian author Arundhati Roy who talks to 
this issue and her view is that there is no such thing as the voiceless. 
It is only those who are deliberately silenced or those who 
are preferably unheard.  So our task as a public news service it is not 
10 
to be the voice of those people.  They have the voice.  We need to find 
those voices.  We need to go to the areas where these people are and 
elevate their voices.  Get them to talk about their issues not us 
speaking on their behalf. 
It is not our job to do that.  We do not want to interpret - 
interpret their views.  We do not want to interpret their opinions and - 
and in this case when you look at what had happened and what we 
needed to fix.  We needed to go back there and say if our task is to 
ensure that there is plurality of views in our news content and there is 
inclusivity in our coverage. 
20 
How do we do that and these interventions were meant to 
address the how do we do so.  So the first thing was to say looking at 
the lapse of editorial controls if they were ever there what are the 
things that we would have to say are the filters for editorial decision 
making and this how we ended up with the two values independent and 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 116 of 150 
 
impartial which are part of our value system in our editorial policies 
and we look at those for these very reasons of interference that has 
been seen as a problem within the SABC news system. 
So in doing this we were trying to say to journalists in every 
decision that you make in your own space because everybody is a 
decision maker in a news gathering system.  From the person who 
decides how the - which story is going to be told or that this is even a 
story to the person who decides to take the story to a - the video 
journalist how decides to film this part and not the other part to the 
video editor who decides that this is what I am going to show and not 
10 
this one. 
Everybody in this chain is a decision maker.  So it was 
important to say to the newsroom in the context of these two editorial 
pillars as filters this is how you make your decisions.  Are you going to 
be able to say this story has been produced independently?  There has 
been no influence in how I decided on how I did this story.  Is there 
political influence. 
Is there commercial influence.  I - my personal prejudice - 
prejudices in the way of me deciding on how I do the story.  So that 
also included introspection from the point of view of the journalist who 
20 
are doing the stories.  So it is helpful for us to say with these two 
pillars we are able to guide editorial decision making.  You cannot be 
referring everything upwards when you know that if I test my story 
against these two pillars I am comfortable that I have done the right 
thing or if I am not comfortable what are the things that I need to do. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 117 of 150 
 
At the level of impartiality am I fair enough in the way I have 
covered the story.  Do I have all the sides that need to comment on the 
story or if I am not finding all the voices what are the opportunities that 
I have to present the other voices when they become available.  So our 
starting point was in this area and because we are also expected to be 
inclusive in our coverage we had to say what does that mean. 
It is not only being inclusive in terms of the people who are 
around you or the voices that are always available for commentary.  We 
hardly see women as expert voices in our news coverage as economics 
as researchers or anything that you want expert advice or counsel on.  
10 
So we had to think about how as a newsroom are we going to include 
these voices in our stories and it is conversation that takes place in 
editorial meetings. 
What are the voices that we are going to use to make sure 
that this story is resourced properly and we are comfortable that it is 
go - it is - it is ready to go to air and not only the fact that we are 
looking at women.  We are also looking at women in rural areas and in 
this case you would say if (African language) needs access to 
information I will provide (African language) the kind of information that 
requires where she is or are we telling this woman about brown rice 
20 
and lentil issues that are fact. 
People are sitting in Sandton and the middle class.  So these 
are the conversations that we now get involved in our - in our editorial 
decision making but it is all driven by what is it that the Editorial Policy 
requires us to do in the way we cover stories and we have gotten to 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 118 of 150 
 
that mode where on a daily basis we would say but what does the 
Editorial Policy say. 
What does the Editorial Policy say?  So it is no longer about 
just assigning stories and this also includes the allocation of resources 
to stories.  You can sit here and say we do not have a live facility which 
is the - which are the devices that we use to do live coverage that are 
portable.  We do not have a live facility to go to the story but there is a 
live facility that is allocated to a different story and we look at these 
two stories and say which of the two stories is likely to have more 
impact on the public or that has more people being affected by this 
10 
issue. 
It could be something that is happening in one of the informal 
settlements but it is only an example of an issue that could have a 
national scale if you look at other areas in the country.  So you treat 
your stories and your allocation of resources in that context.  So these 
are the conversations now that are taking place in our newsroom but 
the other part to the answer is I got in an environment where we had 
three platforms that were running parallel. 
You had diary meeting for radio, diary meetings for TV, diary 
meetings for digital and you would find instances where radio gets 
20 
surprised when they see a story on TV.  TV gets surprised when they 
hear a story on radio.  Digital is the same because they do not talk to 
each other.  So the plan was to say looking at technological 
conversions that is taking place already and looking at how people are 
consuming news and saying we need to do that at the point of 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 119 of 150 
 
production starting with story ideation. 
How do we look at the story idea as a starting point and not 
the platforms as a starting point - TV, digital and radio.  How do we as 
SABC news say this is our story for the day?  How do we make sure 
that this story is reflected adequately across all the platforms and we 
got to a point where we now integrate diaries?  We have two diary 
meetings where everybody sits- digital, radio and - and television and 
we say we have this story idea. 
How are we going to treat it?  We discuss that part.  How 
does it relate to the work that we are expected to do as a public news 
10 
service?  We deal with that part.  What are the resources that are going 
to be deployed?  How many reporters are going to go to the story and 
who is going to cover the story for radio, for TV and digital but it is a 
single conversation for everyone within the news service and we took 
the approach of a news service instead of the different platforms that 
we have been using. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then talks to improvement of the 
systems that are going to work going forward? 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  Yes.  It is - it is the efficiencies within 
the system but editorially it is also to ensure consistency in quality and 
20 
tone because the stories are likely to be different depending on the 
audiences but the quality has to be the same and it is the kind of 
quality that you want the audiences to say I have been listening to this 
story or I have been watching this story.  I can tell that this is an SABC 
news story. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 120 of 150 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  So this is the point that we are trying to 
get at … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  But in terms of managing efficiencies we 
are able now to say reporters A and B especially now that we have not 
been able to fill the positions of reporters that we have lost - the 18 
reporters that we have lost.  We are able to say there is a reporter who 
can also do radio.  Let us deploy this person because this person is 
multi - multi skilled. 
10 
So we do not have to deploy the three reporters that we 
would deploy or two reporters that we would deploy to a story.  So it 
also assist us manage our efficiencies. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay and then just one thing that you 
omitted to mention in paragraph 31 is the commissioning of the 
investigation that was done by Mr Joe Thloloe which you make 
reference to in that paragraph.  Am I correct and that is annexed - that 
report is annexed as - annexed as M - PM002 and it appears from 
pages 71 right up to page 1-3-6? 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Is that correct? 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Then we then - you deal with 
the steps that you took.  This is what we are dealing with.  You mention 
something that you did between March and May 2018 going through all 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 121 of 150 
 
the stations and - and what - what results did that - what did you 
achieve by doing so? 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  In March - between March and May … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  I visited all the offices across the 
country and the intention was to assess the state of health of the 
offices because if I was to do any work or we were to do any work as a 
division to try and change things I need to understand if the system is 
going to support the change that was required.  So going to the 
different offices some of the challenges that were there related to 
10 
infrastructure issues, technological infrastructure. 
You had reporters who would to go stories with notebooks.  
No one does that in this day and age.  They have to come back to the 
newsroom and script their stories.  They have no laptops or iPads to 
ensure that as they are sitting there the information is sent to the 
newsroom for broadcast.  So their counterparts from other media 
houses by the time they leave the room the story is already on air. 
Ours have to go back to the newsroom before our stories get 
to air and in some of the cases you had instances where reporters have 
… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well may … maybe that helps me understand why 
sometimes I hear a story today in one or other TV station or radio 
station and I only hear tomorrow in SABC and I wonder what is wrong 
with SABC.  They are telling us old news.  Maybe that is why. 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  I am traumatised. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 122 of 150 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  Quite truly I have wondered.  I say really we had 
this - I mean - yesterday and they are only telling us now.  Okay, 
alright. 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  It - it - ja it is - it is a number of issues 
but that is also part of the problem. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you. 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  And you would have instances where 
reporters have to travel long distances.  A province like KZN if you are 
going to take inclusivity seriously you are going to cover the countries 
rural provinces and you are going to cover those (indistinct) that are 
10 
sitting in those provinces.  So you drive 500 kilometres for your story 
cover the story come back because you have to drive another 500 
kilometres to the office in Durban. 
That is 1 000 kilometres on the road in one day.  You still 
have to get to the system and process the story and the system is not 
reliable or some of the facilities have fallen apart to the extent that you 
have to queue to edit your stories.  By the time you leave the office it 
is almost midnight and this what we have done to our reporters and not 
only that people have to find themselves working long hours which is 
not out of the norm in our area but the fact that people have to drive 
20 
such long distances. 
We cannot book them to sleep over because we do not have 
money.  So you expose them to danger by expecting them to drive to 
and fro in such long distances and they have to do so because they do 
not have editing facilities that are mobile where they could be booked 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 123 of 150 
 
over, process their stories, send them to the newsroom drive back the 
following day. 
We do not have that luxury.  We want to meet the mandate 
but at the cost to the journalists who are out in the field. 
DV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  You have dealt already with the 
values of independence and impartiality and repositioning the SABC.  I 
think that takes care of what you deal with in paragraphs 32.2 right up 
to 32.5 because you also dealt with the diaries - single diary.  Although 
you have - where you dealt with the meetings that you now have twice -
twice a week … 
10 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Of all the stakeholders.  Then we - I think 
we should move on if you are comfortable that you have covered 
everything there.  We could move on now to the impact of the changes 
that you have effected so far.  When I say you I mean you and your - 
your - those that work with you in - in improving the systems. 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  Yes we can move. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  From an editorial point of view the one 
thing that I had to do was to demonstrate the change I wanted to see in 
20 
the system.  I remember one instance during the period when we were 
covering the late Ms Madikizela-Mandela’s funeral.  Walking into the 
control room. 
Just observing how the work was being done and I picked up 
a spelling error and I am pointing out to the person who is dealing with 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 124 of 150 
 
that part in production and this person says can you please do it for me 
and I pulled the chair and she moved and I got into the chair and I 
typed out the word I wanted changed and it is not a case of a person 
who was saying do it yourself. 
It is someone who did not know the right spelling that needed 
to be reflected.  So these are instances where you had to say I am 
serious about the things that I am asking you to change.  We have a 
very interesting set up.  You would have the executive producing 
deciding on what needs to be done but it the technical crew that gets 
all the material to air and some of the people who are sitting in the 
10 
control room are not editorially strong and some of them are not even 
people that you can rely on if you talk about spelling errors on air and 
it has been a perennial problem and there are serious issues around 
that because these are the people you have and this is the quality that 
you have in the system and you still have to work with them because 
there is nothing you can do. 
You found them in the system and you are going to work with 
what you found in the system.  So we had during the same period and it 
is something that I have come to be known for and we joke about this in 
the newsroom.  There is a phrase I do not even know whether to call it 
20 
a phrase when an event is happening.  So we will be talking about the 
event being underway. 
So the fight over this underway whether it is one word or two 
words is a big fight within the newsroom and it took time for us to settle 
on whether it is two words or one word and you basically have to go to 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 125 of 150 
 
a point where you say when you have a noun following the word you 
literally explain how it is one word in a sentence and how it is two 
words in a sentence. 
So these are things that you have to demonstrate because 
you are not going to change a system by shouting instructions.  You 
have to part of the things that you want to see changed and this is - I 
know it is - it is very granular but it is a big issue if you have problems 
at that level and as part of the impact at an - at an editorial level. 
I have asked everyone to stand up and be courageous to do 
what is right and what the Editorial Policy says in the interest of the 
10 
citizens who rely on us for information and I had demonstrate - 
demonstrate that myself.  The first instance was when we were taken to 
the BCCSA by the Democratic Alliance for a clip that we played.  It 
came from an address by President Ramaphosa and in the way it was 
processed in the system again this talks to the quality that we have in 
the newsroom. 
The way it was labelled it said the President addresses the 
nation and yet the clip was about an outcome of an ANC lekgotla.  So 
he was addressing an ANC issue not as the President of the country 
and it was obvious in the tape because you see the flags of the ANC 
20 
behind him and he was wearing ANC regalia but we said the President 
addresses the nation and it became a big problem and we were taken to 
the BCCSA because there was a view from the Democratic Alliance that 
we were again being used to carry the - the - we were carrying 
instructions from - from the ANC which was not necessarily the case. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 126 of 150 
 
It was a fault of our system that we ended up with that and it 
is something that we corrected within the first seven minutes or first 10 
minutes of us airing that because we picked up the problem but it was 
already late at that point and added to that it was about the fact that 
we did not give the other side an opportunity to respond because this 
was an issue of national concern. 
It was about land, employment and other issues that were - 
that were part of that address.  So us being taken to the BCCSA it was 
about - we had violated the BCCSA Code by not giving the other party 
its - its - an opportunity to respond - to respond and the fact that we 
10 
had called what was an ANC issue - a Presidential issue as in the 
President of the country but where the problem was the BCCSA is the 
right mechanism to address the issue and which is what I stuck to. 
I was then called names including being referred to someone 
is not different from the Hlaudi era which is what was said in - in the 
statements that were issued or the comments that were made.  What 
was the problem was the fact that we were then given a tape as a 
response to what the ANC had put out by the Democratic Alliance that 
we should play it because we had played the ANC one. 
Under normal circumstances and in the context of the 
20 
Editorial Policy of the SABC that cannot be done.  We cannot be taking 
instructions from external parties.  The editorial prerogative resides 
with the newsroom.  We make decisions as journalists within the SABC.  
We cannot be told what to do and this is where the problem was 
because I was not going to give in. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 127 of 150 
 
I remember there was even a countdown to 12 midnight that I 
was left with so many hours to play this tape and I was not going to 
give into that and it was also to demonstrate to the journalists within 
the newsroom that you will not buckle under political pressure when 
you know that there are mechanisms to address issues and we went to 
the BCCSA and the BCCSA ruled in our favour. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Hm. 
MS PHATHISWA MAGOPENI:  The - the second instance related to the 
impact of the changes that we also had to demonstrate how we need to 
do things.  There was an incident in February - February this year and 
10 
it was a public - and it was a public incident.  When the Minister of 
Communications interfered with our coverage in the Eastern Cape. 
It was the launch of a provincial manifesto of the party and 
when that incident happened the reporter posted the message on the 
group.  We have WhatsApp groups.  So we have a reporters group and I 
am in all of them.  You have a WhatsApp group for reporters.  
WhatsApp group for TV management. 
WhatsApp group for radio management and executive 
producers and I exist in all those spaces because I want to understand 
the things that people are concerned about because that is - those are 
20 
the platforms that at times people express what their concerns are 
when they are out in the field whether they are being intimidated and it 
is things that never get to reach me or would never get to reach me if I 
was not part of the discussions and by being part of those groups I am 
able to address issues on the spot. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 128 of 150 
 
So when that incident happened the reporter who was 
covering the story posted the message on the groups and I responded 
and said do you have it on camera and she said yes and I thought this 
is a remote area from our office in Umtata.  So how do we get this story 
quick enough and then she indicated that she could do a live crossing 
and I said put it on record and I had to say it in the group so that 
everyone understands that this is a decision that I have taken and this 
decision is within our Editorial Policy. 
That we will not conceal information that we have knowledge 
of and even worse that it included an incident of censorship.  Just one 
10 
thing on censorship it is despicable.  You can rationalise it.  You cannot 
negotiate your way around it.  There is no way you can justify 
censorship.  It is anti-democracy and it goes against the right of the 
public in terms of access to information. 
There was no way that that incident was not going to be aired 
and it was also to strengthen the courage of our reporters in the 
newsroom and our journalists in the system that pushback when you 
feel that there are things that are being done and you are aware of and 
you know that they are against the Editorial Policy of the SABC and we 
had to take that stance and I - I am aware of the fact that the kind of 
20 
changes I am - the impact of the changes I am talking about relate to 
editorial issues. 
Those are the most pernicious and that affect our - our 
integrity mostly.  We had another - another incident in January.  This is 
the same week that the country or the IEC was going to conduct the 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 129 of 150 
 
final registration week - voter registration week which was the 
25 t h/26 January.  This is a Monday and the previous week we had 
discussed how we were going to tell the story of the final voter 
registration in an impactful way. 
There is a graphics unit that would deal with on air elements 
what you would be seeing on air on the day, what is going to be our 
promise leading up to the day about why it is important to go and 
register and that.  This is your last chance.  So as we are discussing on 
the elements on the previous week then on Monday I am sitting on the 
internet sending message - message to the person who is supposed to 
10 
design the on air elements. 
How far are we with this because we had touched on it in 
preparation for the weekend and leaving the meeting I went to the floor 
where the graphics department is located and the person says oh I was 
a bit delayed.  There was something else I was doing that required my 
urgent attention and I asked what is this about and he says oh no, no 
there is a - there is an opening stint for a new segment that is being 
introduced.  This was 21 January. 
It is a new segment that is being introduced by one of the 
desks and I look at it because I asked him to play it and then he plays 
20 
it.  The President’s office.  This is the new segment that is being 
introduced.  I am not aware of it.  I have no knowledge of this thing 
being introduced.  No one has said anything to me.  So I then get to 
ask you saying that this thing is urgent. 
Then he says this show is supposed to be or this segment is 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 130 of 150 
 
supposed to be on air at 10.  This was just before 10 o’ clock in the 
morning and the show that is supposed to go on air it is on the 3 r d 
Floor.  Immediately I walked to the 3 r d Floor.  Getting there, talking to 
the desk what is this thing about and then I get told no, no this is a new 
segment and we thought that it is okay that we are going to invite 
people from the Office of the President on a weekly basis every 
Monday.  So this is a dedicated slot to come and talk about the program 
and the engagements and the work of the Office of the President.  I 
have no knowledge of this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm, how does that happen?  How does something 
10 
like that get to be – how do the plans get finalised for something like 
that to be aired without you knowing? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     This is what puzzled me to this day, 
because I don’t know how we ended up with that, but all I got from the 
Executive Producer at that time was that no it is an idea that we came 
up with and we thought that it was okay to do it.   
 
Because it was very close to the time, and the person who was 
supposed to speak at ten on this settlement was already in the 
building, on the floor, make-up done, ready to go to air, and I am still 
standing here trying to find out what happened, and I had no way of 
20 
saying we are not going to do it, as I was still seeking answers myself.  
Then I went to my office, got to my office, I could not get myself to 
watch it, because I knew at that moment that we would have, by having 
that material on air it was a violation of the editorial policy of the 
SABC, it went against everything that the Public News Service stand 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 131 of 150 
 
for.   
 
And besides the fact that it was against the editorial policy of 
the SABC it had implications for the regulations by ICASA in terms of 
our elections coverage, because we already in that period.  So what 
you have in the regulations by ICASA is that broadcasters, in particular 
in this case, as a public news service, we have to be mindful of the 
advantage of incumbency.  So we would have to explain why before 
elections we’re having this segment which is a weekly dedicated to the 
office of the President, because despite the fact that it’s the office of 
the President and not of a party there are issues of the advantage of 
10 
encumbrance that we let it deal with, and ICASA is explicit about how 
this plays out, that there is always a chance that the seating, I mean 
the party that’s in power could use resources of the State to enhance 
its electoral prospects, it is in the regulations, it is not something that I 
am making up, and I was mindful of that at that point, so there was no 
way that I was going to allow that to go on air. 
 
So that was the first and the last episode of that segment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Norman it looks like we have covered quite a lot 
of ground.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes Chair, we actually ...(intervention)  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I don’t see anything else that I think we haven’t 
covered. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Maybe just to allow her to gloat about 
the Reuters Institute, yes you mentioned that in paragraph 38. 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     Yes this is our bragging rights, we as a 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 132 of 150 
 
result of the changes that we have effected we have for our coverage of 
the elections been acknowledged for providing fair coverage, and of 
more than 3 000 items than we analysed, on our three platforms, on 
radio, 99% of them were found to be fair, which was a big thing for us, 
as a news division and the report by Reuters, they run a digital survey 
and what happened in this case they test news consumers and I mean 
with regards to how they trust the news content, the consumer and the 
media houses they would be consuming the news content from, out of 
30 we were number four, which is a big thing for us coming from our 
past, which is very recent and the things that have happened. 
10 
 
So this is what we found joy in that here is an international 
institute that has done a digital survey in South Africa, out of 30 media 
houses we rank four.   It is a big thing for us, it was a big thing for us. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     And this happened when? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     June, it was June. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     June this year? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Thank you, so with the turnaround 
strategy and the interventions that you have put in place are you happy 
with the way forward that the SABC is embarking on insofar as editorial 
20 
matters are concerned and newsroom affairs are all concerned? 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     I am happy but there is serious work to 
be done, we still have to put in strict editorial controls and we still need 
to get everyone to understand the work of the public news service, not 
a State broadcaster, and in terms of our cost containment measures 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 133 of 150 
 
which perform part of the strategy that my principals were talking about 
coming out of elections and the fact that we went to elections without 
money for a national project and for a sensitive project like our 
democracy we started with a budget of about R80million when we were 
discussing the budget, but we then had to say to ourselves if we were 
to do things differently how would this assist us to bring the costs 
down.   
 
We then went and looked at things that we could cut out and 
we’re down to 54, and this is more or less where we were in 2016 in our 
elections coverage, and it started to feel comfortable at 54, but we then 
10 
said what are the things that are not core to our elections coverage 
that we can rid of again but also looking at the fact that we have 
invested in technology, we have these hybrid vans that we are using 
that each province has now and other things that assist us in doing 
ours differently and better, so what was not going to happen is to have 
us investing in technology heavily but still seeing the price of covering 
elections going up, so we needed to see the benefit of our investments 
and technology, and we revised down our budget and settled it to 
R9million to cover elections. 
 
But still we had to look at things that didn’t make sense in the 
20 
budget, that didn’t have to be there, because all we needed to do was 
to tell the South African story, the story of this election and how it 
relates to citizens and the role of citizens and deciding who becomes 
the sixth administration and say what is it that we don’t as part of this 
budget, but this is now in the process of delivering our elections, we 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 134 of 150 
 
had to look at a lot of things but as we were closing the account about 
two weeks ago we spent less than R10million in covering elections but 
the question you are still asking yourself if we were sitting at 54million 
in 2016 where did that money go, what was done with that money, if 
you produce an election with less than R10million. 
 
It is part of that project, I remember in my first months, 
because the process of budgeting had started already, there is a 
system that is called an election result system which is meant to pull 
data from the elections portal, the IC portal and process it for our 
storytelling, so a document comes to me, it lands on my desk, it is form 
10 
our Media Technology Infrastructure unit.  It is a business case to 
procure the system for R21million. 
 
Having been outside the SABC system we knew that that thing 
never worked.  We admired it when we were told that oh SABC is going 
to have this thing, but we knew that at the point where the results had 
to be processed that thing never worked.   2014 we spent about 
R8million in that system, 2016 we spent close to R10million in that 
system, it never worked.  It never worked, but we were going back to 
procure the same system and on the two occasions it was from the 
same company and as this business case was presented to our senior 
20 
meetings our supply chain management pointed out that it looked like it 
was tailor made to the same company that provide the 2014 and 2016 
systems that never worked. 
 
Just to go back a bit how it got to the senior management 
committee, looking at this knowing that it never worked my response 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 135 of 150 
 
was I am not going to sign this document, the news division doesn’t 
need it, we don’t need the system.  It went away but came back, and I 
still said we don’t need this system, we will find other ways of telling 
the South African story differently for television and for our on-line 
platforms. 
 
Then it shows up during the senior management meeting 
without my signature, without my signature!   Now I have to say I had 
said that we don’t need the system, and I’m sitting with people who are 
trying to persuade me that you actually need this system because this 
is what it is going to do, this is what we are going to need it for. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the point should not even arise. 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you have the power to decide whether you need it 
or not and you said you did not need it and somebody went against that 
the there must be consequences. 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know somebody is not going to try and persuade 
you after they have defied you to say you need it, particularly if there 
appears to be breaches of procurement processes. 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     Yes, and the question that I raised at 
20 
that point was when the system failed at that critical moment what did 
you to process your results?  Oh we had worked on a graphic system, 
and it was like we have enough time now to start working on the 
graphic system and use that for our elections 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I hope that it’s something that is being 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 136 of 150 
 
investigated as to whether everything was done the way it should have 
been done in that regard. 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that the investigators of the Commission are 
taking note, ja. 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     Ja, when I realised that we had made 
payments in 2014 and 2016 for something that never worked, and we 
were trying to procure the same system the question I asked why is this 
not on the SABC’s asset database, why are we procuring the same 
system that we have bought twice previously and we then referred it to 
10 
our internal forensic investigation, yes it is being investigated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, well that process is still underway. 
MS PHATISWA MAGOPENI:     Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Thank you very much Mr Chairman, that 
is the evidence from this witness, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, thank you very much for coming to share 
your evidence with us, we appreciate it.  If we need you to come back 
we will ask you to come back but thank you very much, you are 
excused.

twenty five past three.  We adjourn.

MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  It is the 21 s t May 2019 Sir. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes thank you and in deposing to this

MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  I did thank you Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  Is it correct that you are 
the Chief Financial Officer of the SABC? 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  Yes Chairperson I am. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  When were you appointed? 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  25 t h June 2018. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. Your – you were asked by the 
investigators to deal with specific matters, am I correct? 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  Yes Chair I was. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Before then we deal with what you 
dealt with could you just for consistency place your qualifications 
before the Chairperson? 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  Chair I am a Chartered Accountant and I 
have got a Masters Degree in taxation. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And before you joined the SABC 
where were you employed? 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  I was employed at Denel and then at the 
Road Accident Fund and then for a few months at a place called Glad 
Africa. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 140 of 150 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  At the? 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  A place called Glad Africa. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Glad Africa. 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you. Then you were asked 
specifically then to deal – one of the entities that you had to deal with 
or maybe let me just put the question to you.  What was it that was 
asked by the investigators? 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  I was asked to consolidate transactions 
with three entities being Infinity Media Networks, TNA Media and 
10 
transactions with other similar clients international and local. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  What exactly were you looking for in 
compiling that information? 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  Payments made or received from or to the 
specific entities. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you. 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and is it correct that all of these 
transactions happened before your time? 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  Yes Chair they did. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And you relied on records that are within 
the SABC? 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  Yes Chair I relied on our financial system 
and the records that we could find. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And – thank you.  Let us start then 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 141 of 150 
 
paragraph 7 you deal there with Infinity Media Networks and you had 
concentrated on a particular period, is it – am I correct? 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  Yes Chairperson I concentrated on the 
period October 2013 to March 2014. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So that is on – yes.  And then where would 
one then find those documents that you rely on in that page?  You have 
a reference YB1. 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and that is where you deal with 
revenue. 
10 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  From – when you say revenue from Infinity 
Media this is revenue received by the SABC from Infinity Media? 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  Yes Chair it was. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And then at paragraph – sorry 7.2 
you testify – ag you deal with the fact that you are aware of the 
agreement between Infinity Media and the SABC? 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  I did obtain information to that effect yes 
Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Relating to the agreement? 
20 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And then you control – can you just 
go back then to YB1 and then see and look at the amounts that you 
were dealing with there in that paragraph – in that statement?  You 
have a consolidated page of all the payments, am I right at page 8, is 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 142 of 150 
 
that correct? 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  Yes Ma’am – sorry just a second.  Yes 
Chair I do. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You do okay.  Where are the amounts 
reflected there? 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  It is the last four amounts starting with 
R159 600.00. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and at the end you have got 00, what 
does that mean? 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  That means it was invoiced and then 
10 
subsequently paid.  So the account is then 0. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that in page 8? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes page 8 Chair. 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  008. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there a way of making these figures bigger. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Bigger. 
CHAIRPERSON: And therefore more legible. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Do you – could you be able to extract a 
20 
more legible copy?  We can replace it some other time? 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  We should be able to because I guess the 
number of times it has been copied degraded the quality of it in any 
case.  We should be able to. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Correct. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 143 of 150 
 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  Must I read it out perhaps for the sake of 
the record? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes please for the record, yes please. 
MS 
YOLANDE 
VAN 
BILJON: 
 
So 
the 
first 
one 
would 
be 
R159 600 000,00 
for 
2000 
minutes 
to 
launch ANN7 
and 
then 
R123 102.00 for 27 minute footage ANN7 agreement SABC copyright.  I 
am reading the text Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  The next amount is R91 200.00 for 20 
minutes of footage used for mail SABC copyright.  And the last amount 
10 
is R31 920.00 for 7 minutes footage January to February 2014 as per 
declaration received. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you. And these – they relate 
to the purchase of archival material, am I correct? 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  According to the records? 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  Yes Chair they do. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  And then you have the 
total amount which you reflect at page 3 if you go back to your 
statement. 
20 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Ys what is that total? 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  R405 840.00 including VAT. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  And then you moved onto 
the second entity which is TNA Media.  Could you just talk to the 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 144 of 150 
 
Chairperson what were you looking for there?  You can read from that 
paragraph the areas that you looked at? 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  Chair I was requested to consider the 
transactions the SABC entered into with TNA Media – TNA.  We 
concluded that we – they supplied us with newspapers on a weekly 
basis per paragraph 10.1.1 and the SABC provided the New Age with 
certain 
broadcasting 
services 
and 
more 
particularly 
outside 
broadcasting services which were then conducted at various venues 
across the country. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay. And then where do we find that A – 
10 
YA – YW2 it will be under – it starts from page 28. 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  Yes, yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  Could you just read into 
the record those – but these are quite legible.  I do not know whether 
they are with you Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page is that? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Page… 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  29. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  28 is the covering letter but page – the 
figures are at page 29. 
20 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  So Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  On page 29 the very last line item is TNA 
Media.  You will see transactions recorded from 2011 to 2018 
amounting to a total of R908 035.57 for newspapers that were supplied 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 145 of 150 
 
to the SABC over that period. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that – that covered which years? 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  2011 to 2018. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And then you decided to put other 
newspapers, were you doing just a comparison? 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  Yes a comparison and possibly it is in the 
same account in the general ledger in our financial system.  It is 
allocated to the same GL account.  Potentially that is why they are 
10 
together there. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay so if you had to print you cannot just 
print for TNA you would have to print for all? 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  I would imagine so.  I see all the SAP 
printouts attached but it will be very difficult for me to identify TNA but 
again it is something that we can certainly explore at the office. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And you have already put the total 
there 2018 – that is – that total includes all the years 2011 to 2018 of 
R908 000,00. 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  Correct Chair. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And then the documents that follow 
from page 30 are those – what are those? 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  That would be Chair the supporting 
documentation that would make up the totals there what – it is not clear 
because there are no visible totals is – I presume it makes up the R908 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 146 of 150 
 
but I – because the totals are not visible or not reflected. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  We will have to check at the office. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay but they will talk to the totals that 
you have on that page? 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  Yes, 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you. 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  And it stretches a number of years.  If 
one can look at the posting dates for example so I take it it makes up 
the values that is reflected in that table. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And then in paragraph 2 10.4 – sorry 
if you go back to your statement. 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  Hm.  In – in this paragraph. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  And the information provided here it is 
clear that the SABC or we state that the SABC was never paid nor did 
the SABC invoice New Age for any of the so called breakfast shows or 
any other outcast broadcasting services which were rendered by the 
SABC to the New Age. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So the outside broadcasting services 
20 
that is where the journalists as Ms Magopeni has testified if a journalist 
goes out equipment and the airtime and everything else.  So they were 
never invoiced for that? 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  No.  It is a combination of services. 
Everything from the rental of the premises, technical equipment, 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 147 of 150 
 
satellite feed, travelling, transport and a host of other things that is 
necessary to ensure that we are able to broadcast exactly like Ms 
Magopeni stated. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so the – TNA Media was invoicing the SABC for 
the New Age and SABC was paying for the newspapers but SABC was 
not invoicing TNA for these outside broadcasts and therefore TNA was 
not paying anything they were having those for free? 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  Yes Chair that is what one can deduct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  Thank you Chair.  And 
then in 10.5 you have some figures there and you have totalled them 
and you deal with them in YB3.  What is reflected in YB3? 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  So in YB3 is a collection of the costs for 
these outside broadcasters that was provided to New Age.  It amounts 
to a total of R4 268 887.00 excluding VAT.  There is a table that was 
prepared and it stretches from 2011 to 2017. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  I am on YVB030 page 38.  And in terms of 
the types of costs are the things that I have just referred to from the 
20 
rental, technical equipment etcetera. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So all these rental of facilities as 
reflected from page 39 onwards so these are all the costs that the 
SABC incurred but never recouped those expenses? 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  Correct Chair. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 148 of 150 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I hope that the – we will have a witness who will say 
who was supposed to make sure that this was not for free to TNA. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Because it is important and I assume at SABC it 
ought to be easy to know. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who would have been the person who should have 
made sure that no  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That they are billed. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That no free service was provided for which should 
not have been provided for. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you.  Thank you.  And then you 
also were asked by the investigators to also deal with other commercial 
clients. 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  Indeed Chair I was asked to also review 
our records relating to any other transactions between commercial 
clients that have been buying news archives.  It was my understanding 
20 
that the rationale was to determine whether the pricing which was 
provided to Infinity was below the market rate. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  And as such we did put together a table 
that speaks to some of our commercial clients we could identify. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 149 of 150 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and what did you find in your 
comparison? 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  So the table which is reflected on page 
169. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  Reflects a number of organisations 
between years 2011 to 2015 and the kind of values that they paid.  
Companies include Aljazeera, ZEF, German TV, Reuters Television, 
Associated Press TV as well as some local broadcasters. We include 
the values there.  My task was however not to do the comparison of the 
10 
pricing it was merely to record that there were sales in this respect. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And that is basically the evidence 
that you tendered as requested at the time by the investigators? 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  Correct Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And you were not other than those 
requests you were not asked to analyse anything further than what you 
have put up? 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  Not with respect to the transacting with 
these entities no. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  Thank you Mr Chairman 
20 
that is the evidence from this witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much for coming to give your 
evidence you are now excused.  Thank you.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman that – those are 
the witnesses for the day. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 155 
 
Page 150 of 150 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  For today? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  How many have we got tomorrow 
witnesses for tomorrow? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I think there is four that we have on the 
list for tomorrow Chair.  Four witnesses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Four? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes four. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Four. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess they are all short? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes there is one who might be longer but 
the others are not long witnesses yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But I think we could – others are fairly 
flexible if we find that we finish those early we could move one or two 
of the witnesses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Up yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  We are going to adjourn for the day and 
20 
tomorrow we will start at ten o’clock. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 4 SEPTEMBER 2019
