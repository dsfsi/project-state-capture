MS DANIELS:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Daniels thank you 
again for making yourself available.  Chairperson with the 
arrangement made with Ms Daniels coming up today is that 
10 
she will deal with certain aspects of her evidence which 
will exclude the last item we were dealing with with her 
which was the penalties and the details on the penalties, 
the calculations, the concerns that were raised by CDH 
what – she will deal with that on Friday when she comes 
back at two o’clock again. 
 
For present purposes there are certain items of her 
evidence that she will deal with and that Ms Daniels 
emanate mainly from the allegations made by Mr Koko in 
relation to yourself and then we will deal lastly with the 
20 
McKinsey Trillian matter insofar as it pertains to your 
involvement.   
 
You follow that? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes.  Yes I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  So even though we are not 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 5 of 163 
 
going to deal with the – the penalties Ms Daniels we were 
busy in your last appearance leading your evidence on the 
penalties but I would like you to by reference to your 
affidavit explain to the Chairperson and I will give you’re 
the reference now. 
 
Chairperson 
that 
will 
be 
her 
affidavit 
on 
the 
transactions which is Eskom Bundle 18(a) it is Exhibit 
U34.1 on page 236. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have got it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Daniels deals 
10 
specifically with the – with the transactions from page 264 
with the penalties.   
 
Ms Daniels what I would like you to explain to the 
Chairperson as you said last time that the concerns that 
were raised by CDH were communicated to the Executives; 
could you be specific in regard to the Executives with 
whom those concerns were raised and what was the 
attitude of the Executives in response to those concerns? 
MS DANIELS:  Mr Chairman just to give you context I – I 
took over the – the matter in late 2016 when I started 
20 
acting as Head of Legal and Compliance.  There had been 
a number of opinions as you will – we will go through on 
Friday.   
 
There were a number of concerns raised by CDH 
and I started – I also asked him to do an assessment on 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 6 of 163 
 
the merits and I started discussing these with Mr Singh and 
Mr Koko.  The reason for discussion with Mr Singh he was 
in his capacity as CFO he was my immediate superior and 
as Mr Koko was the acting Chief Executive at the time we 
discussed it with him as well. 
 
I took them through the various concerns that were 
raised in the assessing the evidence I had asked them you 
know particularly Mr – Mr Koko because he had been 
operationally involved and I think it was early December 
when he changed from you know the litigation posturing to 
10 
saying that he would be quite comfortable if we settled the 
matter at around R500 million. 
 
I was quite surprised because you know the posture 
up until that point or Eskom’s position had been quite 
strong about litigating and going to arbitration on the 
matter. 
 
Thereafter when we were sort of going through the 
evidence I once again go to him and said you know we 
have these issues with the evidence as presented.  At that 
stage the person who had calculated the penalties, the 
20 
original sheets had actually left the employ of Eskom.  
There were technical reports that showed that you know 
the substance – the substance of the claims that Optimum 
was making may – may have merit.  We did not have the 
technical evidence to sort of counter it at that stage. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 7 of 163 
 
 
So these are all the issues that we were discussing 
in this period.  And the – the attitude was well you know we 
might as – we should work towards settling the matter. 
 
I was quite hesitant to do that given the publicity 
that we had – Eskom had made about this matter and I 
suggested that I was not going to make this decision on my 
own.  I went – I wanted to take the matter to the board 
Tender Committee. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Can you recall the basis on which Mr 
Koko suggested that the claim be settled at R500 million? 
10 
MS DANIELS:  He actually had no basis other than he 
wanted the matter to go away.  You know there was not a 
technical basis or a legal basis or a response to what I was 
saying.  It was actually in a meeting that we had and where 
I was briefing him on the issues that we have had in the 
matters – in the litigation matters they said he would be 
comfortable settling the matter at around R500 million that 
was the figure that he could live with. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And what was Mr Singh’s attitude or 
reaction? 
20 
MS DANIELS:  Mr Singh was – was more you know looking 
at the figures and – and he said if you know identify this 
and 00:10:17 the figure would be around R577 million and 
that he would also – he would be able to – to live with that 
as well. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 8 of 163 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You said you refused the proposal to 
settle at R500 million what was your basis for refusing? 
MS DANIELS:  I think my basis was not from you know 
objectively 
it 
would 
– 
that 
would 
come 
out 
later.  
Objectively it would have been – it would have been 
prudent to settle.  
 
My position at that point when I had just taken over 
in late 2016 was that we had made such a big publicity – I 
do not want use the word stunt but it had been a very 
public statement that Eskom was going to claim R2 billion 
10 
from Optimum. 
 
We 
had 
just 
now 
gone 
through 
a 
change 
of 
ownership, new owners and it seemed sort of an abrupt 
turnaround that we would now be willing to settle the 
matter at R500 million. 
 
My reasoning was that we should at least go 
through 
a 
legal 
process. 
 
It 
should 
not 
be 
Eskom 
withdrawing the claim and then settling at this stage. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No.  Could you please tell the 
Chairperson about the memorandum that you and amongst 
20 
other Mr Snehal prepared and signed I think you submitted 
it to the board – to the BTC. 
 
In that memo if you please can tell the Chairperson 
whether you recommended settlement at any particular 
amount and I say this because Mr Gert Opperman has 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 9 of 163 
 
given a figure of R740 million and in Mr Snehal’s affidavit 
we came across reference to R1.17 billion as the potential 
claim that Eskom would have had against Tegeta. 
 
So in your memo if you could tell the Chairperson 
what is it that you told the BTC? 
MS DANIELS:  Just – I actually – what I did in the memo to 
the BTC Mr Chairman is – is extract the relevant bits from 
the CDH opinion which was attached to the memo.  It was 
quite in detail.  We also ex – we also explained at the 
meeting of I think it was – it was February the minutes are 
10 
in the – in the bundles the – the issues involved. 
 
I think the reason that the claim – there were 
various 
basis 
for 
calculation 
and 
as 
time 
went 
by 
depending on the formula that you used one would get to a 
different – different calculation. 
 
So the – the amount varied from about R479 million 
to R1.17 – R1.7 billion and you will see that later once the 
entire exercise had been done we were comfortable with 
recommending the R577 million. 
 
On my own estimation and based on my experience 
20 
I had also estimated around R700 million would be the 
claim but because of all the various inputs into the spread 
sheet there was no consistent approach to how it was dealt 
with and you know while we each had opinions there had to 
be an objective verification and CDH had at one stage had 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 10 of 163 
 
the R1.17 – R1.17 billion as a figure. 
 
And then as – as time went by we did not have the 
technical evidence to support that nor did we have people 
that had been consistently involved in the matter to 
actually give this bad kind of evidence to support it.  And it 
was on that basis you will see that we went to the BTC 
explained in detail; BTC was actually quite I would say 
irritated with me for wanting to take them through that 
detail but I wanted the board to be absolutely clear and 
informed as to what we had – what the decision was based 
10 
on and what the – why we were asking for a mandate to 
settle instead of just you know accepting the settlement. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  When Mr Molefe was here; Mr Brian 
Molefe he mentioned that the figure of R2.17 billion was 
properly documented.  Your comment on that? 
MS DANIELS:  I – I disagree with him there was – there 
has not been in my experience; in my tenure at Eskom 
there has not been a consistent contract management 
approach to Optimum to coal contract so the evidence that 
we had there was a lot of documentation but it was 
20 
consistent and would stand the test of – of legal rigour that 
para would dispute and because as you will see from the 
CDH opinions there was not a consistent approach to how 
these penalties were calculated or applied and you know I 
– I do not agree with him. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 11 of 163 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Hm.  Yes I think you should make it 
clear  whether the ultimate view which you submitted to the 
BTC to settle the claim at a lesser amount than you had – 
than you had in mind either the R740 million, either the 
R1.1 billion that had been suggested by CDH give us a 
senses of whether the factors that motivated the settlement 
arose only in 2016 when you took over or were they there 
from the very beginning when the claim was instituted 
against OCM under Glencore? 
MS DANIELS:  Mr Chairman the issues were – were there 
10 
from the beginning in terms of the basis for calculation of 
the claim.  You will see from the opinions submitted 
attached to Mr Moodley’s affidavit from CDH that in 2015 
there were already issues before the issuing of the 
summons, before the mention of the claim.  I think even Mr 
Bester testified that there was – he was sceptical as to the 
amount.  He raised the risks with Mr Molefe and these were 
ignored. 
 
I was not you know around at that time I was not 
involved in the matter that time.  I recall being called into 
20 
one meeting with myself, Mr Bester, Mr – Advocate Silanko  
who was the Head of Legal at the time and Mr Moodley and 
we – they did explain – the three of them explained to Mr 
Molefe and Mr Koko that you know these were the issues.  
And notwithstanding that explanation from three people 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 12 of 163 
 
involved in the matter they were adamant to go ahead with 
the institution of the claim. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Hm.  Can you recall exactly when was 
that meeting? 
MS DANIELS:  That meeting was in 2015 I think it would 
have been around early 2015 because there was a meeting 
scheduled with Glencore around about either that day or 
the next day. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  Now in regard to the emails that 
Mr Koko sent to Infoportal from the 25 – no the 20 t h of July 
10 
2015 when he comes back from suspension Mr Koko has 
said that – has in fact conceded that this email address 
belongs to a person 
outside of Eskom 
but he has 
nonetheless maintained that after every email that he sent 
to Infoportal you and him and Dr Ngubane would have a 
meeting 
about 
the 
document 
attached 
to 
the 
email.   
 
What do you say about that version of his that you 
had meetings every time after he sent the email to 
Infoportal? 
MS DANIELS:  Mr Chairman that is un – untrue.  I mean 
20 
there was at no stage that that – those meetings happened 
in the manner – there were no meetings subsequent to 
emails.  I did not – I did not print out the information for Dr 
Ngubane.  Dr Ngubane was not an Executive Chairman so 
he would not get involved in the matters that were on those 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 13 of 163 
 
– those emails in transactions in the manner that Mr Koko 
is trying to present to the commission. 
 
Also you know I noticed that one – one of those 
emails was about the R1.68 billion guarantee.  We – Mr – if 
that was sent to him we would not meet there was no time 
at that time to meet about those guarantees and we would 
not have gone into the detail that the – that Mr Koko seeks 
to present to the commission. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The emails that Mr Koko was talking 
about in this context do you have any recollection whether 
Ms Daniels was copied on them by Mr Koko so that they 
would go to the Infoportal email address and to her?  Do 
you have any recollection of that or some of that may have 
been? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I have – I have the answer - ah no 
Chairperson.  The emails were not copied to her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  There is only one email it is not even 
copied it is a forwarding to her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The one which she has just mentioned 
of the guarantee. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 14 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It came from Infoportal on the 10 t h of 
December 2015 setting out the terms of what should be the 
guarantee.  That email Mr Koko forwards to Ms Daniels’ 
email address and Ms Daniels then instructs CDH on the 
basis of that email. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am just thinking about Mr Koko’s 
version. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which you have – out of which you have 
10 
just restated because it is common cause that he sent 
those emails to the Infoportal email address. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is to be accepted that it seems that 
therefore those emails would go to whoever was using the 
Infoportal address. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At this stage the evidence does not 
suggest that it was Ms Daniels who was behind the 
Infoportal address.  In other words that whoever was 
20 
sending 
emails 
to 
the 
Infoportal 
email 
address 
was 
communicating with Ms Daniels. I think the – so far there is 
no evidence to that effect. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – and except for what Mr Koko said 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 15 of 163 
 
he was told by Ms Daniels. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Namely that the Infoportal address was 
Dr Ngubane’s address. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Factually the evidence does not suggest 
that Dr Ngubane was the person to whom correspondence 
was directed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By whoever was sending emails to the 
10 
Infoportal email address. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Therefore if that is all correct the 
question that would arise is on Mr Koko’s version and I 
mention that because he probably is listening or watching 
so he and his lawyers may know what I am thinking. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes 
CHAIRPERSON:  On his version how would Dr Ngubane 
and Ms Daniels have received those emails of his? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because they would not have gone to 
them.  He accepts too now that the Infoportal email 
address for somebody else. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So whatever emails he sent using that 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 16 of 163 
 
email address those emails were going to somebody else 
not to Dr Ngubane and not to Ms Daniels.  So when he 
says he had meetings with them and they had those emails 
how could those emails have landed in their hands? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that – that is one of the questions he 
would have to deal with. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On his version. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright.  You understand that Ms 
Daniels?  You were following me? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes Mr Chair.  Yes Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MS DANIELS:  I was following.  We did not have those 
documents Mr Chairman when he – when he sent those 
emails. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS DANIELS:  Some of – some of those transactions I do 
– I do recall but that was based on the fact that Ms Mtetwa 
20 
mentioned them and also that they appeared before the – 
the board sub-committees. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS DANIELS:  It is in that context that I recalled it but not 
from an email from Mr Koko or not from a meeting from – 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 17 of 163 
 
with Dr Ngubane, Mr Koko to specifically discuss those 
transactions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay you must just remember Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At some stage Dr Ngubane would need to 
be questioned about this part of Mr Koko’s evidence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To see what he knows about this version. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chair I – I have already long ago 
reached out to his attorney and asked him to provide us 
with an affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And I have also recently asked him – 
followed up on that.  I understand from him that the draft is 
ready but the client is going through it which is Dr 
Ngubane. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So we will … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Hopefully give you 00:29:00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 18 of 163 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Ms Daniels talking about your 
knowledge of the – some of the transactions you see in 
those emails we have when Mr Koko was here tried to 
compare those transactions to the list that you have 
attached to your affidavit – I mean you superimposed on 
your 
affidavit 
but 
you 
also 
attached 
it 
to 
your 
supplementary submission to the Parliamentary Portfolio 
Committee.  Are you able to take us through that and see 
the extent to which there is a comparison between the two? 
MS DANIELS:  Just that I can … 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I can tell you where the list is. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, do that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  It is in Eskom Bundle 8.  I will 
use your supplementary submission to the Parliamentary 
Portfolio Committee on page 87.88. 
MS DANIELS:   87 point...? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   88. 
MS DANIELS:   88.  Okay I found it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   SMD ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, I...  Sorry. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry.  SMD-4. 
MS DANIELS:   Ja, I have it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, I submitted this to the 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 19 of 163 
 
Parliamentary Portfolio Committee in 2018 already but its 
significance grew when I listened to Ms Matshepo’s 
evidence and as well as some of the evidence of Mr Koko 
in relation to the emails.   
 
So I then went through the list again, and you 
know, 
Mr 
Koko 
tried 
to 
distance 
himself 
from 
the 
transactions but it is quite important for the Commission to 
note that in these transactions Mr Koko was either the, 
what in Eskom terms, is the end-user, was the recipient of 
the service or was the driver or, you know, the person 
10 
responsible for those transactions to take place.   
 
So when he talks about this list, I was quite 
taken aback by the manner in which he distanced himself.  
I, at no stage, came to him with this list.  On his own 
evidence, he says that, you know, I would not have at that 
stage, been able to have so much detail, which is true, 
because I did not know this.   
 
This would not also originate from the board’s 
side 
because 
these 
transactions 
were 
extremely 
operational transactions.  The once that are of significance 
20 
for the purposes that I could – of this Commission that I 
could tie in with the evidence of other people, was 
especially when Ms Matshepo testified, was the Duvha 3 
which is now Item 1 on the list. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes? 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 20 of 163 
 
MS DANIELS:   And you will see that is valued at 
R 5 billion.  Now the reason the figures are of significance 
for what I, you know, my assessment when I relooked at it, 
because she was very specific in saying that this for – you 
know that Eskom did not need these services. 
 
And when you look at the Duvha 3 transaction 
itself, it was an engineering transaction.  The Duvha 3 
boiler exploded and needed to be replaced.  At one stage, 
Mr Koko was the Engineering Manager at Duvha.  At the 
stage when this transaction was in the process, he was 
10 
Head of Engineering.  He was also the Head of Group 
Technology and Commercial which then took part – which 
then – in his capacity he oversaw the engineering, the 
procurement of, you know, the replacement boiler. 
 
So he would have been intimately aware of this 
transaction.  You know, I would not be able to go to him 
with this kind of paper and give him this value and ask him 
for an explanation.  That is absolute nonsense.  
 
He would have had intimate knowledge, given 
his position in the organisation and what he had control 
20 
over.  So, you know, when she points out that there was 
work asked by – of Regiments or Trillian or McKinsey, I am 
not sure because this was an engineering issue.   
 
There was an insurance component as well 
through this matter which was dealt with by Mr Singh as 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 21 of 163 
 
the CFO and there were issues regarding – the underlining 
issue here was around the contract, the manner in which it 
was procured.   
 
Mr Koko had insisted on using a non-BEE 
qualified supplier and those were specific instructions that 
he gave to the Procurement Team which caused issues 
later on for Eskom.  
 
So that is the big overviews.  So all these 
issues, all these transactions had some significance of 
which Mr Koko had some role to play for example the next 
10 
one was the McKinsey which I highlighted ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, Ms Daniels. 
MS DANIELS:   ...because ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, just before you go on to 
McKinsey.  I just want to read to you.  You have mentioned 
Mr Matshepo.  In her affidavit where she says:   
“Mr Matshela Koko and Mr Anoj Singh added 
initiatives...” 
 
Now at this time she said Regiments.  This is 
now in 2015, late 2015.

“They have had meetings [according to her] 
with Mr Singh and others at Eskom and they 
were making a proposal to Eskom...” 
 
She says: 
“Matshela Koko and Anoj Sing added initiatives 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 22 of 163 
 
that 
were 
not 
originally 
on 
the 
proposal.  
These were Online Vending and Duvha 3 
insurance claim and rebuild, Hitachi insurance 
settlement...” 
 
So Duvha 3 insurance is specifically mentioned 
there which is one of the things you mentioned.  Could this 
be – you think this is the same as the Duvha 3 that we see 
on this list? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, it is Mr Chairman.  When she talks 
about the Duvha insurance claim and the rebuild, the one 
10 
were – the one component was to get the money from the 
reinsurer to actually replace the boiler at Duvha.  And then 
also the other part was to recover the normal insurance 
claim.  So that is – that would have been dealt with by 
Eskom insurance. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   We had our in-house Insurance Division. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  You have said that this list, 
Mr Koko had it with him on the 20 t h of July 2015 as a list of 
transactions his principals have told him to focus on.  
20 
When Mr Koko was here we put that version to him and in 
response he said the list, actually, it was given to him by 
yourself.  What is your response to that? 
MS DANIELS:   Well, that is – I categorically deny that and 
that is why I say to Mr Chairman that it is not possible that 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 23 of 163 
 
I would have come up with this list because of the nature 
of the transactions, the value of the transactions and the 
knowledge of this. 
 
And if I recall his testimony, he also said that, 
you know, I said it came from the board.  That is just not 
plausible because the detail here, the Non-Executive Board 
would not know.  I would not be able to come to him to ask 
for information to this degree. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   This list was provided to – he discussed it 
10 
with me when he came back from suspension.  I said at – 
in 
my 
supplementary 
to 
the 
Parliamentary 
Portfolio 
Committee and I stand by that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  He has also said that he recalls 
the list and that the handwriting on the list is his.  I do not 
know whether you are able to tell?  I mean, if he concedes 
that is his handwriting, I suppose that is what it is.   
MS DANIELS:   Well, Chairman I would ask you if he 
conceded that it is his handwriting, he must please explain 
to you a couple of issues that I have identified on the list.  
20 
I would like to draw your attention to the notes that he has 
there.  Next to Project Libra Anglo which is Item... 
CHAIRPERSON:   I can see it. 
MS DANIELS:   Seven. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I can see it. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 24 of 163 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS DANIELS:   He says: 
“We could buy.  Give me a fixed price.  I will 
give you the partner...” 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS DANIELS:   That is illogical for someone within Eskom 
to say that, you know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
10 
MS DANIELS:   In terms say:  Okay you, you know, we will 
buy it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS DANIELS:   Now this project in itself, Mr Chairman, is 
the coal supply to Fusile Power Station which was 
problematic because of the nature of the coal, the price of 
the coal, et cetera.  So at that stage, there was no BEE 
partner for Anglo, you know.  Anglo was doing it through its 
holding company.   
 
It had not – that is why it is called Project Libra 
20 
at that stage.  You will find that in the Eskom documents, 
you know, when the project start out, they are called 
Project Alpha, Project Libra and those things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS DANIELS:   Ms Matshepo also testified that is how we 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 25 of 163 
 
did things.  So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you see ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   He would have to explain to you why he 
would say to someone:  Give me a price now and I will give 
you a partner. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you say that that sentence where he 
says give me a fixed price, I think he says, I give you the 
partner...  That TBC there, what is that? 
MS DANIELS:   If I look at the others, I think it is the Rand 
value to be confirmed because you will see the other ones 
10 
all have Rand values. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS 
DANIELS: 
 
 
And 
then 
there 
is 
TBC. 
 
So 
in 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MS DANIELS:   ...you know, in the normal ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, then ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   ...standard terminology, that would be To 
be Confirmed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, that would tie in with the fact that no 
20 
price is given next to Project Libra Bundle? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the fact that he writes:  Give me a 
fixed price.  So the price has not been agreed yet? 
MS DANIELS:   To be determined.   
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 26 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that sentence is there to ensure that 
somebody gives him the price, the fixed price, that would 
go in there, in that price. 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  So ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   And he would have explained why someone 
would say – why he would say “we could buy”.  He is at 
Eskom. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS DANIELS:   You know.  Eskom would be purchasing 
coal from a supplier.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  So when he says “give me a fixed 
price” that would be for coal or for what? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that would be for coal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   “And I give you the partner.”  A far as 
you understand, what partner would he be talking about in 
this context? 
MS DANIELS:   I would assume that that would be the BEE 
20 
partner. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS DANIELS:   The request – the requirements of Eskom 
at the time was that coal be supplied by you know, BEE 
compliance companies or at least they must be working 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 27 of 163 
 
towards being BEE compliant in terms of the Mining 
Charter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [Indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   At that stage, I know or was aware that 
Eskom – that Anglo was not yet BEE compliant.  It was 
looking for a partner. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But did Eskom have the parties of giving 
service providers or product providers – service providers 
giving them partners, BEE partners?  Did they not come 
with their own BEE partners? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS DANIELS:   Exactly, Mr Chairman.  Sorry.  Exactly, 
Mr Chairman.  That is why I say, no, Eskom did not have 
the practise of giving partners to suppliers.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   That was – he must explain to you why he 
would be giving the partner and why he would be asking for 
a fixed price ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MS DANIELS:   ...from internally ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   ...at this stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now who was this note directed to, if 
you know?   
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 28 of 163 
 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, what ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Who was meant to read this? 
MS DANIELS:   Who...  I am sorry, I did not hear the last 
bit? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who was this meant for? 
MS DANIELS:   From my understanding and the discussion 
that we had.  This was meant for Mr Koko and he had 
indicated 
to 
me 
that 
this 
was 
instructions 
from 
his 
principals.  Those were his words.  And at that time, my 
understanding was, that this referred to the board. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So your issues with his note is 
one, the fixed price, and two, the partner? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   [Indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   ...that is the one issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   Then, as I identified, you will see these 
transactions 
Ms 
Matshepo 
talked 
about, 
the 
load 
management, the five release cash unlock and the Online 
Vending cash unlock as well.  There is also a note here 
20 
that says:  Stop paying T-guys(?). 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that at the part where the 
...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   No, the T-guys...  At the bottom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes? 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 29 of 163 
 
MS DANIELS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, proceed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, proceed. 
MS DANIELS:   So this T-guys, in my understanding, this is 
T-Systems because at that stage there was an issue with 
the payments of T-Systems. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where is the T-guys? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is right at the – after the 
...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   At the bottom. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   After the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The last one is Komati replacement.  
The one above is that ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   Well ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is below the table. 
MS DANIELS:   In... ja.  In handwritten notes Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, in handwritten notes “stop paying T-
guys.” 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
You 
say 
you 
understand 
– 
you 
20 
understood T-guys to be a reference to T-Systems? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And the alphabet F that is written 
below that, do you know what that is supposed to mean? 
MS DANIELS:   I am not sure what that is.   
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 30 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Do you know if that is still 
...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   What that is Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you know whether that is still the 
same 
handwriting 
as 
the 
handwriting 
above 
or 
you 
...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   It is looks like it is - Mr Chairman, but I am 
not a handwriting expert ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   ...specialist. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS DANIELS:   But what I am saying is.  Mr Koko needs to 
explain to you what does this mean? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS DANIELS:   Because this does not look like an 
instruction from an Eskom person. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS DANIELS:   You know, a person of his position.  And 
then there was – and it ties in with what Ms Matshepo said 
that there was this, you know, fee instruction.  If you look 
20 
at the calculation and – I mean, fee extraction.   
 
If you look at the calculation and the values and 
so there was a concerted effort here to evaluate what could 
be extracted.  That is what made me relook at this list in 
that light of her testimony and what I had submitted earlier 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 31 of 163 
 
to Parliament.   
 
I could, you know, clarify more and it also gave 
more significance having relooked at this list.  The other 
issue is.  This word here, to the left, this Zeselor (Zestilor). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MS DANIELS:   Of the document.  It has been widely 
reported in the media, and one would have to check this, 
that Zeselor (Zestilor) is the company that Mr Salim Essa’s 
wife was the shareholder and owner of.  So Mr Koko would 
explain – have to explain how, you know, these elements, 
10 
how he was tied up in this at Eskom.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Now Ms Daniels, can you 
give us the spelling for that name or the name of that 
company. 
MS DANIELS:   What is that? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The one of that company. 
MS DANIELS:   Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, it is on the page. 
MS DANIELS:   It think it is Zeselor or...  Z-e-s-e-l-o-r.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it looks like z-e, either R or S, and 
either t-l-o-r or h-o-r.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, Zeselor, l-o-r? 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 32 of 163 
 
MS DANIELS:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Or Zestilor or something.  You 
know, I just remember from the Eskom media reports that 
that company belonged to Mr Essa’s wife. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you see it on page 87.88 Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  No, I am there.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I just wanted certainty on the spelling 
10 
of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Then Ms Daniels, there is 
McKinsey, the third item.  Do you have anything to say on 
CPI Investigations? 
MS 
DANIELS: 
 
 
[No 
audible 
reply] 
[transmission 
interruption] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think it is frozen. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   Can you please repeat that Mr Seleka?  I 
had to close that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Do you have anything to say on 
CPI Investigations? 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 33 of 163 
 
MS DANIELS:   I was not sure what that was Mr Chairman.  
I 
checked 
the 
reports 
but 
as 
it 
says 
there, 
again 
R 150 million per annum.  You know, so there was an 
estimation of what kinds of revenue this would bring.  And 
this would not be to Eskom.  So, you know, Mr Koko would 
have to explain how he, why and on what basis he would 
do that kind of calculation.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Alright.  I see what you are saying.  So 
the revenue ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   ...here.  At various stages during... 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, the sound seems to be distorted 
and delayed.  Can you hear me now? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So what you ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I can hear you know. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  In regard to the revenue, you are 
saying these are revenue projections, not for Eskom, but it 
would be revenue projections ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, it would be revenue projects for 
20 
whoever wants these transactions to be procured for them. 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct Mr Seleka.  I am tying it to 
specifically – because Ms Matshepo, when she was talking 
about Regiments and Trillian, she mentioned, you know, 
how they established the fees.  I think even Ms Goodson 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 34 of 163 
 
mentioned some of it.  And if you look at this list, it ties in, 
it makes it more clearer what this was actually about, was 
those revenue projections as to what could be extracted 
from Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  Do you know, subsequent to you 
seeing this list - and as you said made a copy of it – do 
you know whether a party or parties were given contracts 
in relation to some of these transactions? 
MS DANIELS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, I do not know ...[intervenes]  
10 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, they were given contracts. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, proceed. 
MS DANIELS:   These matters did serve before the Board 
Tender Committee and the various sub-committees in 
Eskom at given times Mr Chairman.  So it would be, you 
know, easy to check.  Like I said, I remember that the 
Duvha 3 contract was problematic because of the supplier 
that was...  [break in intermission].   
 
We know about McKinsey.  The other one that I 
could identify was the Project Libra.  The Online Vending 
20 
was another issue.  That contract served before the BTC a 
number of times.  There were issues that were involved.   
 
And I think the whole IT Support Services was an 
issue.  That contract – Eskom’s position and strategy 
changed a number of times during 2015/2016. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 35 of 163 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  The Online Vending cash unlock, 
do you know what does it entail or did it entail? 
MS DANIELS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you hear Ms Daniels? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think she is frozen again. 
MS DANIELS:   [Interruption in transmission] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you back?  I think you froze for a 
few seconds.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think she is back.  
10 
MS DANIELS:   Oh, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You can ask your question. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can you hear us? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MS DANIELS:   Can you hear me? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, we can hear you now. 
MS DANIELS:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Daniels ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka is going to repeat his 
question. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you, Chair.  I asked whether 
you know what Online Vending cash-unlock entailed? 
MS DANIELS:   It was very technical but I can just tell you 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 36 of 163 
 
high-level.  It was to put in place an electronic IT support 
system for purchasing of electricity. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Do you know whether McKinsey 
was contracted to render that service? 
MS DANIELS:   They may have been involved.  I think you 
should look at the Steering Committee of the – what is that 
– this – the services agreement or there might be a 
separate agreement. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  You do not know personally? 
MS DANIELS:   I do not recall specifically.  I just know 
10 
that, you know, the Online Vending was an issue.  It 
appeared a number of time, as I said, during the period 
2015/2016.  It appeared a number of times before the 
board committees. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  So then, just to finalise on this.  
Is – what is your testimony on this, what is your evidence 
on this?  Is it that this list - just to be clear, this list would 
have been a list from a third party outside of Eskom given 
to Mr Koko, showing a list of transactions with projections 
of revenue that the third party outside of Eskom would 
20 
have wanted to procure for their own entity for themselves 
with Eskom? 
MS DANIELS:   That is my evidence Mr Chairman.  In 
listening to what I know and what I said, this represents 
what was given to Mr Koko and what he had to execute in 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 37 of 163 
 
terms of... revenue from Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, that ties in with the question I 
wanted to ask you.  I see that those figures on that 
document represent revenue not for Eskom but for the 
entities, for certain entities, now it would be quite strange, 
would it not be, for Eskom to be preparing a document to 
see how much revenue somebody else would be making.  
Would you agree with that? 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct, Mr Chairman, that is why I 
10 
say to you I reject Mr Koko’s view that this is, you know, a 
document prepared by me on basis that the board wanted 
this.  This is a document that he came with that he came 
with that he said this is what – these are the transactions 
that my principals want me to focus on and this is what he 
started asking his subordinates for the information and it 
ties in with the emails that he sent. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  And lastly, Ms 
Daniels, because what took us here was the emails, Mr 
20 
Koko’s emails.  We have seen they do give us free features 
in those emails, online vending, cash, unlock features in 
those emails but there was also an email regarding his 
visas travelling to Dubai with two members of his family 
and he said that was arranged by you.  Your response? 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 38 of 163 
 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, I would like the opportunity  
to categorically state here that I did not under any 
circumstances moonlight as a travel agent (indistinct – 
recording distorted) unlike my seniors I had a job at 
Eskom, I did not organise his travel visas at any stage, he 
did not request me to do so, he did not pay me R5 000 to 
do that, I did not (indistinct – recording distorted) of Dr 
Ngubane in this matter.  As I said before, procuring of 
visas or…. 
(Break in recording) 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, the connection is quite unstable.  It 
looks like you are back, Ms Daniels.  Can you hear me?  
Can you hear me? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I can, Mr Chairman.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I just want to repeat what I 
understand 
you 
to 
be 
saying 
because 
as 
you 
were 
speaking, the connection was unstable, we could not hear 
parts of what you were saying.  One, did you say that you 
deny having arranged visas for Mr Koko and his family? 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct, Mr Chairman. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, did you also deny – do you say 
you deny that he gave you R5 000 in regard to the 
arrangements for those visas? 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you said you were not moonlighting 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 39 of 163 
 
as an Eskom employee as a travel agent at the same time. 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so you never arranged or you 
were never involved in any arrangements to help him get 
the visas. 
MS DANIELS:   Not at all, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Ms Daniels, there is 
another – oh, then I asked you – yes, that was about the 
visa, that is right.  There is a statement you made – and I 
10 
will come back to this later on, but I want to read it to you, 
your last affidavit, talking about the BTC which approved a 
transaction with Trillian, the payment to Trillian.  We will 
come back to it but let me read to you and see whether it 
relates to some of the items you have read on the list.  It 
reads: 
“It was this approval that was then utilised, the BTC 
approval of August 2016, utilised as authority to pay 
Trillian approximately R207 million.  The activities 
referenced 
were 
project 
search, 
private 
sector 
20 
participation, 
online 
vending 
services, 
Hitachi, 
Duvha, short term funding facility, long term funding 
facility 
and 
programme 
management 
office, 
as 
procurement, primary energy, claims, generation.  
These items were mentioned in this Ms Mothepu’s 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 40 of 163 
 
testimony.” 
You heard that?  We will come back to it later.  Did you 
hear that? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I did hear that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Does this by any means relate – or 
some of these items related in list that we have just gone 
through? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, Mr Chairman, you will see there is the 
funding restructure that I have highlighted.  There is Duvha 
3 and there is online vending cash unlock, those are the 
10 
direct cross-references that I could make. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  So we will come back to that BTC 
approval.  That means McKinsey did get  - to be paid in 
relation to some of these translations on the list.  I mean, 
Trillian. 
MS DANIELS:   Trillian, yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I beg your pardon.  Maybe we 
should go into the Trillian matter.  So according to the 
testimony of Ms Mosilo Mothepu, there is proposal to be 
made firstly by Regiments which is thought to be teamed 
20 
up with McKinsey.  They are making those proposals to 
offer services under the master services – the master 
services agreement, the service level agreement.  And as I 
read from a paragraph in her affidavit, some of the projects 
were included to the original or initial proposal by Mr Koko 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 41 of 163 
 
and Mr Singh and she specifically mentioned online

CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Seleka, have you moved 
away from bundle A or are you still with it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   From which one, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Eskom bundle 8. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I am moving away from it.  I want 
to …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are going back to Eskom bundle 18? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I want to go to Eskom bundle 14C and 
10 
E, 14B and C in Eskom – I think the files have been 
regularised, the affidavit I would be referring to, Chair, is 
in 14(B) of Moodley, Mr Moodley specifically from page 
941, Eskom bundle 14(B).  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think we need just to take a short 
adjournment so that the registrar can get my pen, it has 
fallen too far.  We are going to adjourn for five minutes.  
We adjourn.

CHAIRPERSON:   I am grateful, the registrar has retrieved 
my pen.  Okay, now we can continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ms Daniels, you can hear us? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I can. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  I would like you to deal with the 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 42 of 163 
 
matter, now that we have gone through the list and 
McKinsey is mentioned and reading from the affidavit of Ms 
Mothepu, that paragraph and your paragraph relating to the 
approval by the BTC in August 2016 to make a payment to 
Trillian in the amount of R207 million in respect of some of 
the transactions we have mentioned.   
Mr Moodley of CDH has submitted an affidavit to 
the Commission in which he deals with certain aspects 
relating to McKinsey and Trillian that involves you in the 
instructions to CDH and recommendations made to the 
10 
board.  Now we know from the evidence before the 
Commission that huge amounts of money were paid to 
Trillian to the tune of 1.2 billion.  In fact the BTC had 
approved R1.8 billion to be paid to Trillian.   
There is a submission made in December 2016 
which deals partly with some of the payments to Trillian 
and then ultimately the decision made by the BTC in 
February 2017 that deals with the last payment for Trillian 
and McKinsey.  
Now it is alleged that you also played a role in 
20 
ensuring that the BTC approved those payments.  I would 
like you to give your version to the Chairperson and if you 
want me to give you more information I could do so but to 
the extent that you would have read Mr Moodley’s affidavit, 
can you please deal with firstly the termination of – 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 43 of 163 
 
purported termination of the MSA agreement by Eskom and 
how these payments to Trillian and McKinsey were made. 
MS DANIELS:   Okay.  Mr Chairman, I confirm that I have 
read the affidavit of Mr Moodley and that I have submitted 
my own version.  I also got involved in the tail end of this 
transaction in late 2016.  Some of the facts that I am going 
to put before you I know because I was involved in my 
capacity of head of legal.  I had to do the 48 hour reports, 
as it became known.  It was reports to Minister Brown on 
the payments to McKinsey and Trillian and that involved 
10 
going back to 2015 when the matter came.  So some of my 
knowledge is from that, some of my knowledge is from the 
investigations that Bowmans did and in compiling that 48 
hour report, which is part of the bundle, CDH, Bowmans 
and the auditors assisted with the information so I am 
going to rely on that body of information to give you the 
facts which I do not personally know.  Is that okay? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you can continue. 
MS DANIELS:   Alright.  So insofar as the cancellation of 
20 
the McKinsey contract one needs to go back to around July 
2016 in the Eskom records and it is a BTC meeting in July 
that the authority to cancel the contract is provided to the 
team and it is noted that Eskom might have to pay up to – I 
think it was about – it was over 2 billion that the team – 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 44 of 163 
 
and when I talk about the team, it was represented by Mr 
Prish Govender and Mr Edmund Mabelane.   
Mr Prish Govender was the project manager for the 
McKinsey/Trillian project.  I do not know what to call 
because at one stage it was the engineers, the top 
engineers 
programme 
and 
then 
it 
became 
the 
McKinsey/Trillian project, though I am not sure what they 
called it.  But at one stage Eskom identified that it may 
need to pay up to 2.84 billion to – I think it was up to 2 – 
ja, 2.8 billion to cancel the contract.   
10 
At the meeting in July they indicated that they had 
negotiated a figure of – a settlement figure of 1.8 billion 
and this was approved by the BTC subject to certain 
conditions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Can I – Chair, I …[intervenes] 
MS DANIELS:   Is that okay?  Does that give you context 
to…? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, no, that is alright, I just want to 
find out from the Chairperson something.  Chair, I could 
refer to the documentation in order for the Chairperson to 
20 
follow the evidence or she could, you know, go freehand 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I would like you to refer to the 
document. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To the documentation. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 45 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Well, for that reason, 
Chair, we will have to change the file to 14C.  Eskom 
bundle 14C and we will start on page 829.25.  Ms Daniels, 
have you found that page? 
MS DANIELS:   Let me just… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is a submission document. 
MS DANIELS:   I just have one bundle 14. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, no, that is alright.  Just follow the 
page numbers, 829.25. 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Okay.  Yes, I have it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You have that.  Now I know you have 
talked about the period in July 2016.  We see in this 
submission the figures that you are referring to. 
MS DANIELS:   Okay.  I may have the date wrong, if that is 
8 August, I would go with this submission. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, I think you are correct about the 
termination which is made in July or in fact it is June 2016 
but please identify the document to the Chairperson? 
MS DANIELS:   Okay, this is a submission to the board 
20 
tender committee Mr Chairman and it is feedback on the 
McKinsey and company top consultants programme MSA 
settlement process. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So who would have compiled this 
document? 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 46 of 163 
 
MS DANIELS:   This document was compiled by – I will tell 
you now – I think it was Mr Govender.  Yes, Mr Prish 
Govender.  As you will see there, his signature on page 
829.32. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   With Mr Mabelane, the Chief Procurement 
Officer and approved by Mr Anoj Singh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The first signature you said whose is it? 
MS DANIELS:   It is Mr Prish Govender. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, because unfortunately …[intervenes] 
10 
MS DANIELS:   In terms of the – yes, in terms of the 
Eskom procurement process, Mr Chairman he was the 
delegated official, the project manager for the McKinsey 
project. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  It is unfortunately they did not 
write the names of the signatories so you either have to 
know their signatures or try and make it up – or rather, try 
and make out what it says.  So like that one [indistinct – 
dropping voice] that seems to be …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It should be there, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The names should be there, just above 
their designations. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, the names are above, ja.  Okay, I 
think I expected them to be below. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 47 of 163 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  No, no, ja, now I see it, thank 
you very much. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair.  Ms Daniels, do you say it 
was approved by Mr Anoj Singh? 
MS DANIELS:   Well, you will see Mr Anoj Singh signed the 
documentation and in Eskom delegation of authority the 
people 
who 
sign 
the 
submission 
document 
take 
accountability for the contents and presenting it to the 
relevant board committee.  And this is the reporting line, 
10 
you will here, just to give it more context, Mr Chairman, the 
reporting line was that Mr Govender would have reported to 
the Chief Procurement Officer, the Chief Procurement 
Officer reported to the Group Financial Officer. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes and what …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why does it say at page 829.31: 
“Other approvals required, none.” 
Do you know? 
MS DANIELS:   This was a standard submission format 
that Eskom had for submissions to board so if there were 
20 
other approvals, regulatory approvals, external approvals 
that were required, this is where the executives or the 
compliers of the submission documents were expected to 
note that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka? 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 48 of 163 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you.  Ms Daniel, we go back 
to page 1 of – the first page of this document, which is 
page 829.25 and explain there the resolution which is 
required in the submission, the submission document dated 
8 August 2016. 
MS DANIELS:   Okay.  Just before I explain this, I just 
wanted to mention one thing that in the submission in June 
or July, I just cannot remember the date, the reason for the 
cancellation was provided to the board tender committee is 
that there could not – the parties could not reach 
10 
resolution on the terms and conditions of the contract.  So, 
you 
know, 
that 
was 
just 
– 
that 
was 
stated 
in 
the 
documentation at the time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, the termination letter.  Sorry, just 
mention the page reference is on page 877.26, it is a 
termination letter by Eskom to McKinsey dated 16 June 
2016 and it says: 
“The letters serves to officially notify McKinsey and 
Company of a board decision taken on 9 June 2016 
to terminate the McKinsey risk-based contract.” 
20 
Was that a board or BTC?  Do you recall. 
MS DANIELS:   It was a BTC decision.   You will find, Mr 
Chairman, that in the Eskom documentation there is not a 
distinction between board and subcommittees so when 
people talk about a board decision more often than not it 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 49 of 163 
 
would be the board subcommittee that they are referring 
to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did the committees not need their 
decisions to be approved or ratified by the board? 
MS DANIELS:   Nothing ratification but what happened on 
a quarterly basis is that we would prepare committee 
reports and they would go to the board for notification.  
Those that required ratification would be ratified or those 
that required decision would then be tabled for decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Daniels, insofar as you say the 
reason for termination was, I think you said, due to the 
parties’ failure to reach an agreement on the terms and I 
want you to come back to this because CDH was advising 
you on whether or not this master services agreement ever 
in fact came into being and my question, just before you 
move on, is this.  If the parties could not agree on the 
terms was there in law or in fact an agreement to 
terminate? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, this is what we were 
20 
grappling with at the tail end with CDH and myself.  By the 
time – I just need to put it into context, by the time I got 
involved in December, I was presented with an email from 
Mr Govender, he provided me with a copy of the MSA, he 
provided me with the letter of demand from McKinsey and 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 50 of 163 
 
the letter of demand from Trillian and at that point factually 
about over 900 million had been paid out to the parties and 
but those are the three documents that he presented to me 
and it was on that basis when I looked at that, I did not 
have any context, he asked that I must please review the 
documents and that he was discuss it with me.  I remember 
he driving up from Durban or somewhere and I had a look 
at those documents and I thought it quite peculiar the 
agreement was signed – I think it was early in the year and 
then in June there was – Trillian’s demand came before the 
10 
McKinsey demand.  They were like a month apart and it 
was on that basis that, without context, that I asked for the 
legal review and you will see that is why I specifically 
asked for that in an email and I actually wanted to know 
from Mr – when I discussed it with Mr Moodley, what 
exactly was Eskom’s rights in this regard.  At that point I 
did not know specifically of like, you know, there was the – 
the terms and conditions was the reason or the failure to 
reach the terms and conditions was actually the reason 
presented to the board tender committee.  It took us quite 
20 
a while to get the documentation from the project team. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay and by the way you will see that 
– I just want to mention this because you mentioned the 
agreement was concluded early in the year.  The affidavit 
of Dr Weiss says that he received a copy of a signed – as 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 51 of 163 
 
signed 
by 
Eskom 
of 
the 
MSA 
towards 
the 
end 
of 
September/early October 2016 when he signed it and 
backdated it to January 2016.  So just to mention that to 
you, are you aware of that? 
MS DANIELS:   I was not aware of that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So what it means is …[intervenes] 
MS DANIELS:   Because the document that I … 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Carry on, sorry? 
MS DANIELS:   I mean, I was just going based on the 
document that I received, you know, that it was dated 
10 
earlier in the year, I was not aware that it was backdated. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   What it means is that at a time the 
agreement was purported to be terminated in June 2016 
when the BTC takes a decision on 9 June 2016 in fact 
there was no agreement signed at least by McKinsey.   
MS DANIELS:   Ja, that would be correct and if he says it 
was backdated. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, we will take you to his affidavit in a 
short while but let us go through this.   
MS DANIELS:   Okay. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   What is required in the submission? 
MS DANIELS:   Say that again please, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Explain the submission to the 
Chairperson. 
MS DANIELS:   Okay.  What they are doing here is asking 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 52 of 163 
 
– they are saying to the board tender committee, and when 
I say they, it is the submitters, Prish, Mr Govender, Mr 
Mabelane 
and 
Mr 
Singh 
are 
saying 
that 
they 
have 
negotiated a lower settlement fee of 1.8 billion.  They 
needed to pay out 800 million because these would cover 
costs to date and then the current consultants, which I 
assume is McKinsey, made an offer to reinvest 1 billion to 
cater for a transition period and so it sort of a settlement 
plus a renegotiation of terms kind of arrangement that 
appears here and that McKinsey and partners decided to 
10 
take some sort of let me say – yes, a new contracting 
mechanism 
and 
this 
involves 
that 
the 
Group 
Chief 
Executive Officer, now the Group Financial Officer and the 
Group Executive Generation and Technology are authorised 
to negotiate more favourable terms on conditions to the 
settlement process and at this time in August 2016 the 
Group Chief Executive Officer is Mr Molefe, the Group 
Financial Officer is Mr Singh and the Group Executive 
Generation and Technology is Mr Matshela Koko. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so the agreement – this follows 
20 
after the agreement, if you take the sequence of events, 
there is a termination or purported termination of the 
agreement.  There is then submission to the BTC that 
according to CDH it follows after a letter of demand from 
McKinsey.  After Eskom terminates, McKinsey sends a 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 53 of 163 
 
letter of demand saying pay me x amount.  The executive 
then make the submission to the BTC that Eskom would be 
liable to 2.8 billion but they have negotiated an amount of 
1.8 billion and they want the approval of the BTC for that 
payment to be made to McKinsey and a BEE partner, is 
that correct? 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you play any role in regard to the 
submission? 
MS DANIELS:   No, I did not, at that stage I was the 
10 
company secretary, Adv Silanko was the head of legal and 
he was dealing with the matter directly, he was not 
present, if I recall, at this meeting of the 8 August but he 
did send a legal representative.  They did not raise the – 
Mr Chairman, the company secretariat and the legal 
department were separate departments so the head of 
legal used to attend the  - or a legal representative from 
his department would attend the board tender committee 
meetings to deal with the legal issues.  At this particular 
meeting there were no issues raised when this matter was 
20 
discussed 
from 
those 
parties 
although 
it 
would 
subsequently emerge that they did have concerns and they 
did raise them and there were actually opinions about the 
McKinsey settlement agreement or the master services 
agreement that were ignored by the parties mentioned in 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 54 of 163 
 
the submission. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, the BTC resolution is to be found 
on page 875.2 in respect of the submission.  875.2.  Let 
me know when you are there? 
MS DANIELS:   I am there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now it is a resolution, it is an extract 
from approved minutes of the special Eskom board tender 
committee on 8 August 2016 at 15h00 and I see the extract 
is signed by you.  Do you see that on the 8 November 
2016? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And it says: 
“Resolved that the board tender committee noted to 
date the initiatives under the top consultants of 
programme MSA have achieved more than R18.6 
billion of annualised impact for Eskom.  Applying 
determination and settlement clauses within the 
MSA, Eskom may need to pay up to R2.84 billion 
inclusive of payment to the BEE partner of the value 
achieved to date.  The board tender committee 
20 
approved: 
4.4.3 
 An already negotiated lower settlement of 
1.8 billion inclusive of payment to the BEE 
partner. 
4.4.4 
The 
R1.8 
billion 
settled 
negotiated 
will 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 55 of 163 
 
consist of an initial cash payment of 800 
million 
to 
cover 
the 
utilisation 
of 
the 
consultant’s resources to date. 
4.4.5 
The current consultants have made an offer 
to reinvest the risk premium (R1 billion) from 
the settlement to cater for the following.” 
And then they give 4.4.5.1.  Now I understand 4.4.3 read 
with 4.4.4 but I do not understand 4.4.5.  So there is a 
settlement – an negotiated amount of 1.8 billion, Eskom 
has agreed to pay R800 million of that as a cash payment, 
10 
an initial payment to McKinsey and the BEE partner but 
then they say: 
“The current consultants have made an offer to 
reinvest the risk premium, R1 billion.” 
Are you able to explain that to the Chairperson? 
MS DANIELS:   I will attempt, I will try, I am not sure if I 
will get this right but what I think it is saying is that Eskom 
agrees to pay R1.8billion in settlement fees.  We will pay 
the R800million now.  The consultants will not take their 
one billion, they will set it off against initiatives or savings 
20 
initiatives that we identify and we will put another contract 
in place. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, but what does that mean when you 
were parting ways with them, you terminated their – or at 
least insofar as Eskom is concerned, has terminated the 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 56 of 163 
 
MSA, what further engagement was there to be made with 
the supplier? 
MS DANIELS:   Well, in real terms it was actually not a 
disengagement, well it was styled as a disengagement 
process because it would take them six months to exit 
Eskom but also during that time they would re-negotiate 
another contract. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Did 
that 
happen, 
the 
re-
negotiation…[intervenes]. 
MS DANIELS:   Not, I don’t recall, to my knowledge that, 
10 
that happened during the time that I was there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, so you know that, that 
R800million was paid? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, it was paid, in fact more than 
R800million 
was 
paid 
because 
they 
added 
the 
VAT 
component when they paid it, so in December when Mr 
Govender send me the contract and the letters of demand, 
R943million 
had 
been 
paid. 
 
So, 
I 
assume 
that’s 
R800million plus VAT. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, so that – the payments were 
20 
made on the 12 t h of August , two payments to Trillion 
directly and one payment of R596million to McKinsey on 
the 15 t h of August.  Let’s go, specifically, to what happens 
in December.  So, this is in August 2016, let’s go 
specifically to what happens in December where you are 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 57 of 163 
 
directly approached by Mr Prish Govender.  Now, Mr 
Moodley in his affidavit has said, you approached – you 
wanted him to give advice and you need to tell the 
Chairperson what that advice was which you wanted from 
them.  A submission was being drafted which contained an 
insertion that legal review had been obtained from CDH 
and you have been criticised for having including that 
insertion in that submission and thereby caused the BTC to 
make a decision for further payment to Trillion. Would you 
please explain to the Chairperson your – your role in that 
10 
matter? 
MS DANIELS:   I will do so, Mr Seleka, can you please just 
give me the reference to Mr Moodley’s affidavit again? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Moodley is Eskom Bundle 14 (b) on 
page 941. Now, in December, while you go there, a 
payment of  R134million was made to Trillion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do I need to have a look at it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No okay. 
MS DANIELS:   Alright, Mr Chair, my reasoning for asking 
20 
for the legal review at that stage, was because of the 
contract and the two letters of demand that I had been 
emailed by Mr Prish Govender and he had asked me to 
have a look at it and to give him an opinion.  I looked at 
the date of the contract and the letters of demand and I 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 58 of 163 
 
thought this was quite peculiar, I didn’t have all the facts 
at that point, I didn’t have any other documentation and for 
me I wanted to understand what Eskom’s rights were. I see 
from Mr Moodley’s affidavit that I did ask him more detailed 
questions in a subsequent telephone call.  So, I must have 
then gotten, you know, the facts but in terms of payments 
because that – I confirmed in my – that 48 hour report that 
we had actually paid over R900million at this stage and for 
me, I wanted to understand if we could – if we could 
recover any of that money, if – you know what was the 
10 
situation.  At the same time there was a BTC meeting in 
December, I had anticipated the legal review would be a 
quick desktop exercise and that it would not be as complex 
as it turned out to be.  So, in anticipation of that, I had 
written the clause that was inserted in the submission that 
the legal review – that I’d briefed CDH and that the legal 
review had been completed. 
 
I did send that to Mr Moodley, as he states in his 
affidavit and I did ask him to opine on that, I think, by the 
time he got back to me I had already submitted the 
20 
submission because of the time requirements and I think 
the submission was already late, so I was pressured for 
time but we had a discussion and he told me that he did 
not have the necessary documentations to do the review to 
the limit that I required and that we would need to – you 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 59 of 163 
 
know, we would need that documentation before we could 
opine on that and the person that we needed that from was 
Mr Govender.  We did go to the BTC meeting of – I think it 
was – I just can’t remember the date now let me just check 
it – the 13 t h of December 2016 and …[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, Ms Daniels, because I think you 
need to explain to the Chairperson, the advice that had 
been sought from CDH because part of that – it did not 
relate to whether you could defend the claim or the 
demand that was being made by McKinsey and Trillion. 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, based on – I wanted to know, the 
demands that they set-out in the letters respectively, 
because both of them – the respective organisations 
approached it from different angles.  I wanted to know how 
defensible is it, how arguable are their claims based on 
what Eskom had done to date and I wanted a more, you 
know, detailed view, than just saying, we will fight his 
because 
having 
already 
paid 
out 
money, 
would 
that 
prejudice us, how did it actually work, is what I wanted to 
understand.  Because remember at that stage I had no 
20 
context 
from 
the 
legal 
perspective 
as 
to 
what 
had 
transpired beforehand. In fact, what I recall from the 
McKinsey process, it was actually a very protracted 
negotiation so one would have needed to have understood 
what had taken place and we were presented with a signed 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 60 of 163 
 
contract, so I needed to understand, what are the terms 
and conditions of what we had in place. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, and Mr Moodley says, they did not 
advise Eskom on the conclusion of this contract so they 
required the contract to be provided to them. Upon 
studying the contract, they saw that the contract used the 
terminology that was foreign to them, they were not 
familiar 
with 
the 
concepts 
and 
they 
asked 
for 
documentation from Mr Prish Govender and I think, also, 
from yourself, is that correct? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that’s correct because that was the 
one problem because this is the first time that a risk based 
contactor had been concluded in Eskom in this manner.  
We were – subsequent to getting the documentation we 
would find out that, you know, there were all sorts of other 
advice – it is correct that CDH was not involved.  I, 
personally, was not involved either so it was a learning 
experience for us because now we actually had to – we 
literally, Mr Chairman, had to hunt for the documents 
because they weren’t forthcoming and readily as one would 
20 
have expected.  I think Mr – you know, Mr Govender 
expected us to give an opinion based on what he had put 
before us and we said that’s not possible, given the 
terminology 
that 
was 
used 
and 
the, 
you 
know, 
the 
calculations etcetera. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 61 of 163 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And – now we are in December when 
they ultimately got the documentation and were in a 
position to provide you with a final opinion on the matter.  
That 
opinion 
indicated 
 
that 
there 
were 
suspensive 
conditions in that agreement that appeared to them not to 
have been fulfilled on the due date and the due date was 
the 31 s t of January 2016, the opinion was given in 
February 2017, you recall that? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I recall that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You confirm that? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I confirm that, in fact, we only got the 
documents in early – I think it was early February, Mr 
Chairman, it must have been the first week in February, we 
had 
to 
literally 
hound 
Mr 
Govender 
to 
get 
the 
documentation.  I, in fact, insisted that Mr Moodley meet 
with Mr Govender, face-to-face to take him through the 
issues that we were having and I remember that they met – 
I couldn’t attend that meeting but I insisted that they go 
ahead and meet so that we could get to the bottom of the 
issues 
because 
the 
non-fulfilment 
of 
the 
suspensive 
20 
conditions was actually a new factor, that we had not seen 
before. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can you then…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka I see it’s 4 o’clock, let’s take 
a ten minute break and then we continue. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 62 of 163 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  Ms Daniels with that 
explanation or feature or facts in mind of what CDH was 
required to do CDH ultimately advised that the suspensive 
conditions appear not to have been fulfilled, now you can 
take the Chairperson into the meeting of the 13 t h of 
10 
December 2016 because that meeting, that is where the 
submission was made and the significance of what was 
said to the BTC in respect of that submission, and that 
CDH’s services were retained. 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Govender led the discussion, Mr 
Chairperson so I cannot remember I would have to rely on 
the minutes of the meeting in terms of what he said about 
the transaction.  In terms of the review, I did tell the 
committee that we had not completed the review, and that 
it was still in progress and that would still have to come 
20 
back to the committee.  There was a further report, also 
presented by Mr Govender. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, Ms Daniels just before that 
report. Are you saying despite the insertion, in the 
submission, that conveyed the message that the legal 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 63 of 163 
 
review had been obtained, in the sense that CDH had been 
retained to advise Eskom on whether or not to proceed with 
payments to McKinsey you advised the Board that that 
legal review had not been received? 
MS DANIELS:   But it was still in process, yes Mr Seleka 
you will remember, sorry, Mr Chairman, you will remember 
that I said that I had, we had prepared the submission in 
anticipation that it could be done.  But by the time we got 
to the meeting, it had not, I do not even think we had 
started, we had only just asked for documentation.  So I 
10 
did bring it to the committee's attention that we were still 
busy with the legal review. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But I understand that that message 
was in fact not conveyed to the BTC, what is your response 
to that? 
MS DANIELS:   No, I did tell them that it was in progress.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So why then did the BTC approve the 
payment of R134million to Trillian? 
MS DANIELS:   The BTC approved R134million, based on 
what Mr Govender said and as part of the settlement 
20 
process, and that was a decision that they had already 
taken in August, as we had earlier discussed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So are you saying the legal review was 
of no significance with the BTC decision? 
MS DANIELS:   Not at this stage, I think that they saw it as 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 64 of 163 
 
part of the settlement process, we were still busy with our 
legal review.  So I would not say that it was of no 
significance, but it was still in process.  So I would not 
have asked them to base it on that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The reason I am asking you that is 
because that legal, the insertion that was made in the 
submission, says that Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr was retained 
to conduct the review and the conclusion is that Eskom 
needs to enter into a termination agreement with the 
parties to bring the matter to finality.  This will absolve 
10 
Eskom from any further liability once the termination 
agreement is in place.  Now, that was not correct? 
MS DANIELS:   No, it was not correct and that is why I 
brought it to their attention at the meeting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, but it was also never correct 
because when CDH ultimately gave the legal review, if you 
like, they said something opposite to this, they advised 
that in fact, it appears that there is no agreement to 
terminate. 
MS DANIELS:   Well, we did not know that in December 
20 
2016, Mr Seleka or, Mr Chairman, that would only come out 
in early February, Mr Moodley and I had then had the 
opportunity to look at all the documents, and he and his 
team did a very extensive analysis. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes…[intervene] 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 65 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The last I heard you read out was 
through the resolution of Board and the committee but I do 
not think that is where you are now. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, Chair, we…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you gone back to an earlier 
bundle? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Not even an earlier one we are – ja it 
is one of the earlier ones in Mr Moodley’s affidavit Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because I missed you referring us to it, 
did you get another bundle. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, 14B. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is 14B. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not think both my registrar and I 
would have missed it, maybe I may have missed it.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   14B, page 943. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just want to have a look at what you 
were reading. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, page 943. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am not sure that I follow Ms Daniels, I 
followed the logic of Ms Daniels answer but maybe it is 
because I am not looking at the document, when she says 
the legal review was still out but the decision had been 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 66 of 163 
 
taken.  So I just want to have a look, I have been shown 
page 944 of Eskom bundle 14. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Go to the 943 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   943. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The one before, paragraph 96, you will 
see a quotation with eight external legal review, the 
number eight external legal review.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Ms Daniels, I may have missed 
something.  It did not seem to make sense to me that the 
decision would be taken to make payment while it was 
10 
known that a legal review was to happen, because I 
assumed that a legal review would give legal advice which 
would be necessary for the decision whether to make 
payment or not. Do I misunderstand something? 
MS DANIELS:   No, you do not Mr Chair this is where the, 
sort of the what actually happened and what is on paper, 
you know, gets fuzzed and this is how – for want of a 
better word the officials manipulated the process, because 
at that meeting, we did state that legal review was in 
progress, okay.  I did make it clear that we had not 
20 
completed the legal review. 
However, what the officials then relied on, there 
was a draft report by Oliver Wyman, which was not a legal 
review. It was an assessment of the monetary claims and it 
is in that report, that they also talk about a legal review 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 67 of 163 
 
that needed to be done which, you know, I had not initiated 
the CDH review for want of a better word based on that 
report. 
I had done it because I was presented with a 
contract and two letters of demand and I wanted to 
understand what Eskom’s position should be in that regard.  
What the officials did subsequent because the BTC said 
that the R134million should be paid as part of the 
settlement process they relied on the August decision to 
make the December payment. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So - but was your understanding that the 
legal review was important for the BTC to have in order to 
make the decision whether or not any payment should be 
made? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, because it was it was too - it actually 
was to deal with what further payments Eskom should be 
making, if any and that is why I asked for the legal review 
if there were any payments that Eskom still had to make 
and should we be in a - are we in a position to recover 
what had already been paid?  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And…[intervene] 
MS DANIELS:   You know because that was the - my 
apologies Chairman, that was the sort of the when I got the 
contract plus the two letters of demand, you know, I was 
stepping into something that I had no context about at that 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 68 of 163 
 
point and we needed to get the documents and CDH said 
look, this contract is the terminology is different, it was 
different to what we had dealt with before. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But going back to the discussions at the 
meeting, was there anybody who said something to the 
effect despite the fact that we are here to receive the legal 
review we should authorise payment as the BTC, was their 
anybody who said that, or something to that effect? 
MS DANIELS:   There was actually a resolution that the 
R134million should be paid as part of the settlement 
10 
process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Despite the fact that the legal review 
had not yet been received? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the BTC, as could be expected was 
aware that there was a legal review still pending? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are able to say that, and are you 
also able to say, they also knew that the legal review would 
deal with the question whether any payment should be 
20 
made at all or any further payment? 
MS DANIELS:   Any further payment that should be made? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that they knew that? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you recall any reason that was 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 69 of 163 
 
advanced by anybody to say that legal review, we should 
not wait for, why they should not wait for the legal review.  
You say they based that on their 8 August decision, you 
say? 
MS DANIELS:   The legal review was not discussed in that 
detail Mr Chairman, from my recollection. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am trying to understand why a 
committee of the Board would say authorise payment in 
circumstances where it was aware that there was a legal 
opinion/review that was pending, which would advise on 
10 
whether 
there 
be 
further 
payment. 
 
I 
am 
trying 
to 
understand that and you have already said that as far as 
you are concerned, they were fully alive to the facts that 
one, there was still a legal review pending, two, that the 
legal review would deal with the question whether there 
should be any further payments. 
So I am trying to understand why they would not 
say let us wait for the legal review.  
MS DANIELS:   I am not sure Mr Chairman, that meeting 
was quite, quite rushed because it was the last meeting of 
20 
the of the year.  You know, so I am not sure but what I 
remember it was - we did not really go into too much detail. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, as the company secretary, you 
were a company secretary at that time, is that right? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 70 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say to the BTC, but it does not 
make sense to authorise payment before we know whether 
legally they should be further payment, or anything to that 
effect? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I did tell them that caution needed to 
be exercised because the legal opinion had not yet been 
received.  What I am saying is I do not think it is 
necessarily at the Board Tender Committee but, you know, 
the way that the resolution is crafted, I do not think that 
they actually gave payment authorisation at that meeting. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, then I may have missed something. 
Did I miss something Mr Seleka, I thought we are talking 
about them having authorised payment of R134million or 
something? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   They authorised that payment, Ms 
Daniels. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, do you want to take it from there? 
MS DANIELS:   Did they? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, the submission – that is what the 
submission request - but now it is in a different file Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay, but you can continue.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I thought that was…[intervene] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let me read the resolution, the 
resolution of 13 December 2016.  Which, again Ms Daniels 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 71 of 163 
 
is an extract you signed: 
“It was resolved that approval be and is hereby 
granted.” 
And I skip to the right paragraph: 
“For a payment of R134million to finalise payments 
up to August 2016 to the BEE partner that was due 
as per the words split agreed with McKinsey.” 
So that approval is made in unequivocal terms. 
MS DANIELS:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You accept that now? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   I accept that, okay, but as I said, it is 
made as part of the August 2016 decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But what does that mean?  What I am 
looking for - just to remind you, what I am looking for, is 
whether there were sound reasons why the BTC decided to 
authorise that payment, even before they could get a legal 
opinion that they knew was pending on whether any further 
payments should be made, because it does not sound 
sensible, it does not sound logical for them to authorise 
payment in circumstances where they accept that they 
20 
needed a legal opinion on whether there should be further 
payments.  
It does not sound - it does not make sense to me.  
So I am trying to understand whether something somebody 
said something at the meeting, which would make sense to 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 72 of 163 
 
say 
no, 
let 
us 
authorise 
this 
payment 
nevertheless, 
because of A, B, C, D and you are saying they authorised 
this as part of the settlement in terms of the decision of 
the 8 t h of August.  
 
So my question is, what does that mean, in the 
context of what I am looking for? 
MS DANIELS:   Okay, let me give you that context was Mr 
Chairman, there was another report that another review 
that 
was 
happening 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
Oliver 
Wyman…[intervene] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Legal review? 
MS DANIELS:   No, this is a management consulting team. 
They were part of the Marsh & McLennan Group was doing 
a review on assessing the veracity of the claims submitted 
by the partners, the McKinsey and Trillian in the project, 
and at that stage, there was a draft report available and in 
that report, it said that an amount of approximately 
R134million was owing, or can be said to be owing to the 
sub-contractor which was Trillian. 
And it was - and that report also recommended that 
20 
any further payments, that should be subject to a legal 
review.  They do make the disclaimer that it is not a legal 
opinion and they set out the basis for their calculations, 
the methodology that they used to check the claims that 
McKinsey and its partner made, and that is the basis for 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 73 of 163 
 
me of that you are looking for on which the BTC then made 
that decision and said, okay, because it is still outstanding, 
it can be made as part of the settlement process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But was it excluded from the ambit of 
the legal review?  In other words, was the legal review not 
going to include whether such a payment, that payment 
should be made? 
MS DANIELS:   That was how it was interpreted at the time 
subsequent to that we would then you know, change our 
view. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The – yes and I understand the 
Chairperson question.  Ms Daniels, I think just clarify to 
the Chairperson, what happened Chair, Oliver Wyman and 
Marsh does that draft report in which there is a - after they 
have reviewed the invoices of Trillian and McKinsey there 
appears to be this R134million that has to be paid.  But 
they say: 
“Note that this does not constitute a legal opinion 
on the share due to the BEE partner, that that is out 
20 
of the scope of our work.” 
So they saying well get a legal opinion.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   This falls outside of our scope. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 74 of 163 
 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct, Mr Chairman, but what I 
wanted to say to you it might also have been fear at BTC 
level.  What happens factually in the operations is that Mr 
Mabelane writes to Trillian and says: 
“We did a contract review we owe you R134million, 
please invoice us.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   Which is aside from what is happening, the 
decision as the legal opinion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, they were not aware of that or were 
10 
they aware of that, that is the BTC of that correspondence? 
MS DANIELS:   At the time they were not because that 
happened immediately after the meeting.  I am not so sure 
about the timing, but it was in that period, that letter went 
out very quickly, Trillian invoiced Eskom, Eskom paid I 
think within a day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Are you talking about the letter of 16 
February 2017? 
MS DANIELS:   No, that is…[intervene] 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because we do not have the letter you 
are referring to. 
MS DANIELS:   No, that is something - because there was 
a specific letter about the…[intervene] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The R134million? 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 75 of 163 
 
MS DANIELS:   The R134million. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But if it is made or issued after BTC 
meeting, it was then consistent with the BTC decision 
which I have just raised or I read it earlier.  They are 
approving a payment of R134million to the BEE partner 
who is not mentioned in the resolution, but we know it is 
Trillian which is owned by Mr Salim Essa as the majority 
shareholder, we do not have that letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would you have that letter in your – 
among your documents Ms Daniels? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, I should have it, I will 
provide it to the Commission.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MS DANIELS:   It should be attached to that report that I 
was mentioning as well, so I should have it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but before Eskom would pay such a 
large amount of money, allegedly in terms of some 
contract, would the legal department not first have had the 
matter brought to them to say, can we go ahead and pay - 
would it be lawful if we pay or would that not happen?  
20 
I am wondering whether before Mr Mabelane sent 
that letter you would not have sent it via or rather first 
raised the issue with the legal department to say, we are 
about to pay, is it okay, legally? 
MS DANIELS:   No, Mr Chairman, it is not always the case, 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 76 of 163 
 
that would have been within his delegation of authority to 
pay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   So it does not always, not all payments 
would come to the to the legal department. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Even if it is a large amount or maybe 
R134million was not regarded as large. 
MS DANIELS:   In the Eskom context R134million was not 
large Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was not a large amount, ja.  Okay, 
10 
alright Mr Seleka.  Oh, you wanted to add something? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, Mr Chairman, I just want to – I will 
also give you the approved minutes to say that the 
payment of R134million was to finalise payments up to 
August 2016.  So I will just double check with Mr Seleka 
because that is the minute that I have. 
MS DANIELS:   Ja, we have those minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you mentioning that with a view to 
saying it would not fall under further payments? 
MS DANIELS:   That is why I said, that is how the BTC 
20 
understood it, if I have the correct extract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, no, we have those – the minutes 
and that extract, that extract I read to you Ms Daniels, it 
reads, they read the same. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 77 of 163 
 
MS DANIELS:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Well, subject to what 
somebody else might say on the face of it, it seems to me 
that either the BTC did not apply their minds properly to 
what they were doing before making this authorisation or 
they may have some understanding that I have not been 
told about, what do you say to that?   
From your point of view, does their decision make 
sense?  That is what I want because you were at the 
meeting, you are the group company secretary, are you 
10 
able to say you think it does make sense because of A, B, 
C, D? 
MS DANIELS:   It is very difficult hindsight to say that Mr 
Chair for just one reason is that, you know, the information 
put before them but what I can say is that the meeting was 
incredibly rushed.  I do not think that the BTC applied its 
mind to the extent that it normally did, because it was a 
December meeting it was quite rushed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair Ms Daniels that was 
20 
not the last payment because there is another meeting 
which was pending – well maybe not pending but would take 
place in the following year in February 2017.   
 
And another payment was made in fact two payments; 
one to Trillian and the other to McKinsey R176 million to 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361

Trillian and R348 million to McKinsey.   
 
Can you tell the Chairperson how that came about 
because it still ties in with the legal review that you are still 
waiting for.  That legal review has not been received and a 
decision was made again to make these two payments; one 
to Trillian and the other to McKinsey. 
 
Well let me – let me say this to you because you 
would have seen from the affidavits of Mr Moodley affidavit, 
what Mr Koko has also testified about that you signed the 
memorandum I think on the 20t h of February 2017 which 
10 
again they say caused payment to be made in February 
2017. 
 
So 
they 
blame 
you 
again 
for 
signing 
that 
memorandum.  Now please tell the Chairperson what 
happened? 
MS DANIELS:  Mr Chairman Mr Koko has been gloating 
about this memorandum since the Parliamentary Committee 
days and ja it actually just quite a deflection of what actually 
happened at the time. 
 
I cannot quite remember the meeting of the 8t h of 
20 
February 
but 
what 
I 
can 
tell 
you 
was 
around 
the 
circumstances around the – the memo if that is – if that is 
okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes please. 
MS DANIELS:  In early February we still did not have the – 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 79 of 163 
 
the full documentation and we had to really – really hound 
Mr – Mr Govender to provide the documentation that was 
required.  I think Mr Molefe provided a list to Mr Govender’s 
secretary as to what was required.  And it took some time to 
get back.  I think the meeting only took place on the 7t h of 
February 
between 
Mr 
Moodley 
and 
his team 
and 
Mr 
Govender and the team that was managing the McKinsey 
project. 
 
So the documentation and the rigour review was not 
done by the 8t h of February when the meeting took place. I 
10 
would have said that it – it was not done.  I think then what 
happened is Mr Moodley and his team went away and worked 
on the documentation and it was only subsequent to the 
meeting that – that the findings were that we actually may 
not have a contract.  You would have seen it in Mr Moodley’s 
documents in his affidavit. 
 
He raised quite a – a number of issues and the fact 
about the suspensive conditions only came – came about 
subsequent to the meeting of the 8t h of February. 
 
I think it was then that – that we… 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No sorry Ms Daniels just sorry, sorry I am 
interrupting you but the suspensive conditions how is it that 
external lawyers saw the suspensive conditions but Eskom 
and the internal lawyers did not appreciate the need for the 
fulfilment of those conditions? 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 80 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that – and that of course would 
include you because as Company Secretary as I understand 
the position you are required to advise the board on 
compliance is it not?  The compliance with the law. 
MS DANIELS:  Mr Chairman it is a – I cannot answer for the 
lawyers at the time because there were – there were – I was 
not involved when the contract was put in place and by the 
time I got involved to all intents and purposes the contract 
was cancelled. 
 
And the only issue that we were talking about was 
10 
settlement and payments to the parties.  So it was from that 
perspective because the – the issue of the suspensive 
conditions 
only 
arose 
once 
we 
went 
through 
all 
the 
documentation. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja which – which makes it all the more 
important to wait for the legal review.  Were you – you had 
two meetings during the time Eskom was awaiting a legal 
review and those two meetings in two separate – on two 
separate occasions decide to make payments without the 
legal review.  
20 
 
And when the legal review ultimately comes out it 
tells you that that this agreement does not seem to have 
even come into being.   So it is more troubling.  You follow: 
MS DANIELS:  I follow but you must understand I did not – I 
did not read the 8 t h of February meeting as approvals for any 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 81 of 163 
 
payments because we were still busy with what we – what 
we were doing and it was only during that process that I – I 
think a more thorough investigation into the contracts and 
how it came about was actually taking place. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
MS DANIELS:  If you look at the documentation before that I 
cannot remember the advocate who – there was – there was 
actually a senior counsel opinion who said that Eskom 
should not get into this contract the operations people 
ignored that.  But that – that only surfaced much later so that 
10 
is why I am saying there is – you are assuming a well-oiled 
system here but the documents were fragmented and not 
presented together so it was very hard to see the full picture 
until after the fact. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The – the 8 t h of February 2017 meeting 
we have the minutes and we have the extract again signed 
by you.  It is definitely a payment approval.  So and I will 
read for the record it is in Eskom Bundle 14(c) page 875.3. 
“It was resolved that the feedback on the 
settlement reached with McKinsey and the 
20 
payment of R460 million by Eskom as part 
thereof in full and final settlement of all 
claims 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
Master 
Service 
Agreement be noted and supported by the 
BTC.” 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 82 of 163 
 
And then the Chairperson was asking a question whether 
this is going to pay McKinsey and the BBEE partner the 
answer was: 
“It was confirmed that all sub-contractors to 
McKinsey would be paid from the R460 
million to be paid by Eskom.” 
And then the last two payments were made.  This is on the 
8t h of February those payments were made on the 22 n d of 
February.  And can you remember the date when CDH 
provided its opinion? 
10 
MS DANIELS:  On the 17t h of February I think it was. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So on the 17t h.  And they gave the final 
one on the 28t h of February 2017.  By that time Eskom had 
paid all the – all the money that it had undertaken to pay. 
MS DANIELS:  That is correct.  And in that time CDH was 
instructed to draft the settlement letter.  It was signed by 
McKinsey and Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But anyway the facts Chair are just the 
same in respect of the December payment the same applies 
December 2016 the same applies in February 2017.  The 
20 
legal review had not been obtained and decisions were made 
to make this payment.  It is 00:11:10 that is the Chairperson 
on that – the minutes of the meeting? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of what – what page are they? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh.  You have… 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 83 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh bundle – start with the bundle 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Eskom Bundle 14. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Page 875.3.  Oh 14(c). 
CHAIRPERSON:  875. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  875. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it not the Eskom Bundle. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  .3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So 875.3 is an extract again from the 
10 
minutes which is signed by Ms Daniels.  The minutes 
continue on the next page.  But I just read the resolution to 
her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you just read the resolution part? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the one that is says the feedback 
on the settlement? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The feedback on settlement reached with 
20 
McKinsey and the payment of R600 and R460 million by 
Eskom as part thereof in full and final settlement of all 
claims in terms of the Master Service Agreement be noted 
and supported by the BTC.  It even seems Ms Daniels as if 
the BTC was simply rubber stamping or noting what had 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 84 of 163 
 
already been done or decided to be done.  Did you hear me? 
MS DANIELS:  I am – I am just trying to – ja I am just 
reading again Mr … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because they note and support. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes they noted and supported it and I am just 
trying to think what were they – what were they supporting? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The payment of R460 million.  Do they 
say in 00:13:33 during December – in December 2016 the 
same as in February 2017 there is no legal review Ms 
Daniels and these decisions are made.  The legal review 
10 
when it ultimately comes out it says but the suspensive 
conditions are not fulfilled.  You may not even have been 
liable to the – for this amount to McKinsey and Trillian. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – And quite frankly when it comes to 
suspensive conditions it does not seem to me that you need 
a lawyers only.  I would image that people who are at 
management level, senior management level even if they 
were not lawyers they would know that if their department or 
their entity concluded an agreement with somebody and they 
were suspensive conditions they would know that until the 
20 
suspensive conditions were complied with then they would 
have been under no obligation.  Well do you want to deal 
with what I have just said now before you go to what Mr 
Seleka said? 
MS DANIELS:  I – I.. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 85 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you have a different … 
MS DANIELS:  I – I agree with Chairman and I think that that 
is why there was that move to cancel – well to cancel the 
contract or the purported cancellation way back in June 2016 
when they said there was a failure to meet the terms and 
conditions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but was that not after some payments 
had been made? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No. 
MS DANIELS:  I do not think payments had been made just 
10 
yet Mr Chairman.  They actually made payments starting 
from I think August 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well that would make it worse is it not? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If – if June they were aware that 
suspensive conditions had not been met and they knew the 
effect of the non-fulfilment of suspensive conditions and 
nevertheless a month or two later they went along with the 
authorisation of payment and the payment that it just makes 
it worse.  Would you – would you – would you not agree? 
20 
MS DANIELS:  Yes I agree with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes because I was raising this issue of 
saying well you do not have to be a lawyer really to know the 
effect of suspensive conditions.  You might be – if you are a 
senior manager; if you are at a certain level you would know 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 86 of 163 
 
or you should know as far as I am concerned.  Now if they 
knew but nevertheless went along to make payment or to say 
payment must be authorised then – then certainly one is not 
dealing with an issue of oversight then.  One is maybe 
dealing with something much more serious than that.  You 
would go along with that? 
MS DANIELS:  I – I would go along with that Mr Chairman 
that was the conclusion that we came to after going through 
all the documentation.  I had very, very lengthy discussion 
with Mr Moodley once I had the chance to read his opinion.  
10 
We had then – well I did I cannot remember if Mr Moodley 
was on the phone or what but I went and spoke to Mr Singh 
and said that we had actually – we had actually made a 
mistake by making these payments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr – well of course on the basis of 
what I said if they knew that suspensive conditions had not 
been compliant with and they knew the effect of suspensive 
conditions then it was not – it could not have been a 
mistake.  They made payments knowing that they should not 
be 
making 
payments 
or 
they 
authorised 
payments 
in 
20 
circumstances where they knew that they should not have 
done that. They must have had some other reason for doing 
so.  You -… 
MS DANIELS:  I would agree with you knowing what I know 
now Mr Chairman you know at this – at that stage I was 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 87 of 163 
 
wanting to give  
CHAIRPERSON:  The benefit of the doubt. 
MS DANIELS:  The benefit of the doubt to my colleagues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS DANIELS:  But from what I know now I would agree with 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So what did Mr Singh say when you 
approached him? 
MS DANIELS:  I want to be perceived 00:18:44. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  What did Mr Singh say? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he say something you cannot say in 
public? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh is that what she is saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is what she is saying.   
MS DANIELS:  I would even – I would be – I would be 
swearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whatever it – whatever it is. 
MS DANIELS:  I would be swearing. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whatever it is that he said what did it 
reflect about how – what he thought about what you had 
raised? 
MS DANIELS:  He said oh my word we are … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then the word that you cannot say? 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 88 of 163 
 
MS DANIELS:  That I cannot say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Did – did it – do you think he was 
making you to think that it may have been a genuine 
mistake? 
MS DANIELS:  Knowing what I know now Mr Chairman I 
think he was trying to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  But at that time that – is that the 
impression you got that he was – he had – he was accepting 
that the – he was saying that we made a mistake – we made 
a genuine mistake? 
10 
MS DANIELS:  I do not think I would go as far as that I just 
think what he was saying is oh my gosh we have screwed up 
you know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS DANIELS:  In colloquial terms. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
MS DANIELS:  But it was at that stage I saw it – when I said 
to him – because Mr – Mr Moodley I have taken at – then 
taken me through in a very lengthy process the – the thought 
process behind how they got to the conclusion.  And I – and I 
20 
immediately went to see Mr Singh about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you also take him through the same 
process? 
MS DANIELS:  The reasoning’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja the reasoning okay.  Mr Seleka. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 89 of 163 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Ms Daniels but was he not 
already aware that there was no legal review yet when 
decisions were – when these two decisions were made in 
December and in February? 
MS DANIELS:  I am not sure Mr Seleka I do not recall Mr 
Singh being present at the meetings.  We would have to 
check the minutes but Mr Govender was in – in contact with 
him. But like I said just for the – for the benefit of my 
colleagues at the time that is – that is so I just assumed it 
was bona fide. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Singh was at the meeting of the 8t h of 
February. 
MS DANIELS:  Okay then he would have known. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Then he would have known.  Ja I can 
immediately see whether he was in the December meeting as 
well.  But anyway you said earlier that the Executives were 
manipulating the – the situation in order to make the 
payment.  Are you saying this now on reflection or did you 
observe this that time when this was taking place? 
MS DANIELS:  It was not – it was not immediate at the time 
20 
because Mr Chairman the – my attention at that stage was 
between the McKinsey Trillian issues, the nuclear issues, 
Eskom was being sued in terms of municipal debts and all of 
those things or we were suing and there was quite a bit 
happening.   
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 90 of 163 
 
 
When I had the time to reflect and I testified about 
this in Parliament that this is – this was my conclusion 
having then put everything together because subsequent to 
February 2017 we then did our own investigations.  There 
were – there were quite a number of investigations into the 
McKinsey Trillian matter. 
 
There was the Pre-9 Forensic Services Report, there 
was the Bowmans Investigation and there was my – my own 
teams’ investigation into it and we put all of this information 
together so we then could see that the processes were – 
10 
were manipulated. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So Mr Singh was at – had tendered an 
apology in respect of the meeting of the 13t h of December 
2016.  But he was one of the officials authorised in terms of 
the resolution to negotiate and conclude the settlement 
process with McKinsey.  So I suppose you would have told 
him after this meeting. 
MS DANIELS:  Or Mr Govender he would have gotten it – 
that is why they – I would have prepared the extracts. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So – okay.  So your answer to my 
20 
question is you knew already then – you observed then that 
they were manipulating the situation to make this – to make 
this payment? 
MS DANIELS:  No, no after. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Only after. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 91 of 163 
 
MS DANIELS:  Yes.  It was – it was not obvious at that stage 
Mr Chairman because like I said there was – what was 
happening at committee level and then the processes that 
were – the payment processes that were happening, the 
letters that were being written etcetera. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS DANIELS:  At operational level which we – which we not 
ordinarily have sight of.  And Mr Govender had full delegated 
authority in this matter. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Just the one last thing Chair.  Ms Daniels 
10 
we have just been emailed a letter that you referred to.  The 
letter of the 13t h of December 2016.  I will read it to the 
record.  It is a letter from Eskom to Dr Eric Wood Group 
Chief Executive Officer Trillian Capital Partners Melrose Arch 
Sandton. 
“Dear Dr Wood, McKinsey Master Service 
Agreement.  Further to your letter dated 27 
August 2016 Eskom would like to inform you 
of a decision taken by – by board of Eskom 
on 13 December 2016 in relation to the 
20 
McKinsey MSA Contract settlement process.  
It is our understanding that you were the 
BEE partner on this contract.  Upon an 
external 
review 
of 
the 
program 
benefits 
including payment made to date it has come 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 92 of 163 
 
to our attention that the BEE partners portion 
has not been fully settled.  To that end an 
amount of R134 million is due to yourself.” 
The last paragraph reads: 
“In 
relation 
to 
any 
further 
payments 
associated with the McKinsey MSA contract 
Eskom is currently considering the outcome 
of the external benefits review and legal 
advice.  We will provide you with further 
correspondence in this regard in due course.  
10 
Yours 
sincerely 
Edwin 
Mabelane. 
13 
December 2016.” 
Now it seems to convey a message R134 million is 
due to you but any further payments we still await the 
outcome currently considering the outcome of external 
benefits review and legal advice.   
 
So there seems to have been knowledge on at least 
the part of Mr Mabelane that you would consider a legal 
advice in regard to making any further payments.   
MS DANIELS:  Yes at that stage but it was subsequently 
20 
disregarded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Mabelane in that letter seems to write 
on the basis that the R134 million is excluded or was 
excluded from the – or – ja was excluded from the pending 
legal review.  I think this is something that you seemed to 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 93 of 163 
 
have said – to have said earlier on in response to one of my 
questions too.  Is that your understanding of his letter as 
well? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes Mr Chairman that is my understanding of 
his letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was the basis for excluding any 
payments from the legal review as you understood the 
position? 
MS DANIELS:  As at that time they utilized or let us say the 
officials utilized the decision of August 2016 and together 
10 
with – when he talks about the external benefits review in 
that letter he is talking about that report that I mentioned the 
Oliver Wyman Report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS DANIELS:  And it is in that report that they say there 
may be R134 million to the BEE partner to the sub-
contractor. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  But the – it had been decided by 
whoever it was who made the decision that there was a need 
for a legal review on whether or not payments should be 
20 
made or further payments should be made.  When was that 
decision taken by whoever took that decision? 
MS DANIELS:  I took the decision on the 5t h of December. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS DANIELS:  2016 – the Oliver Wyman Report that came 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 94 of 163 
 
out on the 15t h of December also recommended that Eskom 
conduct a legal review. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that was a decision that you took and 
you took it in December 2016? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Way after the meeting of 8 August? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and Mr Mabelane’s letter is dated 
...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   But ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   13 December 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   13 December?  Was that – was that after 
– that would be after you had made a decision? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But when you made the decision, did you 
exclude the R 134 million from the need for a legal 
opinion? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, my decision was not based 
on figures or payments or anything.  It was – it would 
included the R 134 million in – if I look back now because 
20 
my decision was based on that that I was presented with a 
contract and two letters of demand, one from McKinsey and 
one from Trillian ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   ...regarding payment from Eskom. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 95 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   Yes.  So it was not yet related to, for a 
want of a better word, the nitty-gritty of ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   ...which payments were there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But was your decision this.  We need to 
have a legal opinion on whether any payments should be 
made to Trillian or McKinsey?  Was that the ambit of your 
decision? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, Mr Chairman. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which seems to be – which seems to me 
to have been all-embracive? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, because firstly, the contract was 
dated January.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS DANIELS:   I think the first letter of demand was dated 
June 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MS DANIELS:   The other one was dated August.  They 
were – you know, it was so quick. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS DANIELS:   Those were the red flags for me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS DANIELS:   And that is why I emailed Mr Moodley and 
said we need to do a legal review here. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 96 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS DANIELS:   Because I had no knowledge of the other 
issues at that point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  But earlier, on the 8 t h of August, 
the BTC had said some payments needed to be made.  Is 
that correct? 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  And did that decision – did the 
R 134 million fall within the payments that the BTC said 
should be paid on the 8 t h of August? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   The ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   As you understood the decision. 
MS DANIELS:   On the 8 t h of August, the amount was 
R 800 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   So what the officials did, is that 
R 134 million was then calculated into that R 800 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you understood the officials who, 
including Mr Mabelane, who said that R 134 million was 
owed by Eskom, you understand them to have regarded the 
20 
R 134 million as part of the R 800  and something million 
that the BTC talked about? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So Ms Daniels, even on that 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 97 of 163 
 
basis, on that score, the draft report of Oliver Wyman 
which I have read earlier did say in respect of the 
R 134 million that we are not making a legal opinion in 
respect of that share of the BEE partner.  That is out of our 
scope.  You need to obtain legal advice on that.  Even on 
that R 134 million.  So how could they ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   So...  [break in transmission] 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
  
Ja-no, 
I 
am 
just testing 
this 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I am just testing this reasoning.  Why 
would they still say this amount of R 134 million should not 
be subjected to legal review.  It should be taken as part 
and 
parcel 
of 
the 
decision 
that 
was 
made 
on 
the 
8 t h of August 2016?  And...   
 
Ja, why exclude it when the very aspect you 
have obtained to give you an assessment on the work that 
was given, he is saying to you it appears that amount 
20 
might be due but I am not giving you legal opinion on it.  
Please obtain legal opinion. 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Seleka, I cannot speak or the officials 
involved in terms of their thinking because they had not 
consulted me.  What I am saying is, based on the way that 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 98 of 163 
 
the manner in which the letters and correspondence is 
phrased, that is how the system was manipulated.   
 
I accept that, you know, Oliver Wyman did not 
give a legal opinion on that but if you look at the 
documentation, that Oliver Wyman report was used as the 
rational basis for making that payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Also, do you know of any reason why 
anybody who knew that you had said that there was a need 
for a legal opinion on whether a further payment or 
payments should be made by Eskom under this contract, 
10 
why they would have gone ahead to have payments made 
without saying to you, your issue relating to legal opinion, 
does this affect this as well or not?  Do you know why they 
would not have done that? 
MS DANIELS:   I am not sure Mr Chairman.  They – you 
know, in the manner in which the Eskom Executives worked 
is, when they – it was not consistent.  So they would 
consult the legal team when they needed to or when they 
thought it was necessary or when they created issues but 
in this instance, I think it was not to bring it to my 
20 
attention. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because I think that even with the fact 
that the BTC may have made a decision in August, that 
certain payments should be made, once you raise the 
issue, I would have thought that anybody who was aware 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 99 of 163 
 
that you are raising the issue of whether Eskom was legally 
obliged to make any payments, I would have thought that 
they would say, hang on, let us wait for this opinion, even 
about whatever the BTC may have decided because they 
may have made that decision without the benefit of a legal 
opinion, and if the legal opinion came, it might persuade 
them to rethink their own decision. 
MS DANIELS:   I agree with you Mr Chairman.  You know, 
it did not happen in this case. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Chair, the last question.  But 
Ms Daniels, you know when the Executives come here, 
they are going to blame you.  They are going to say you 
did not advised them or that you signed for something to 
be done which should not have been done.  And even the 
memo – Mr Koko has said you told the Parliament – or you 
said in your supplementary, it was an error of judgment.  
So you need ...[intervenes]  
20 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, Mister...  [laughs] 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
You 
need 
to 
address 
those 
...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...allegations. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 100 of 163 
 
MS DANIELS:   Okay.  I think the first one is.  I think one 
needs to be aware of the hierarch of power and authority 
within Eskom and you know these Executives must take 
accountability for the decisions they made.   
 
My tenure or 
during my time as Company 
Secretary, Compliance Officer, Legal Advisor – when it 
suited 
the 
Executives, 
they 
would 
get 
the 
opinions.  
Unfortunately – and then, you know, conveniently say to 
us:  Well, we take the risk.  So we can ignore them.   
 
Mr Chairman, I think one of the things in the 
10 
Eskom Delegation of Authority, you know, legal advice is 
not binding.  The Executive does have the authority to 
override and actually take the risk.  So that is something 
that one has to look at.   
 
So, you know, when they say that the lawyers 
did not advise them, they either did not ask or they did 
things that said, okay, I am going to override you which 
happened in this instance often.   
 
And so I think that is the first part.  So they need 
to take their accountability for making those decisions 
20 
because they have signed off.  They had the full delegated 
authority from the board and they decided to act against 
legal advice.   
 
Secondly.  I had indicated that I had signed that 
memo and I said it was a lapse of judgment.  At the time, I 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 101 of 163 
 
thought that my signature on that memo and that memo had 
actually triggered payment.  It, actually, was not so.   
 
So I think Mr Koko is using it.  And it is 
unfortunate for me that he is using it as a great deflection 
from what actually went down at the time.  That memo was 
sent to me on the 20 t h of February.  So that was quite some 
days after payments have actually been made.   
 
The instruction to settle, to draft the settlement 
letter had been provided to CDH and bypassed me.  
Mr Moodley’s affidavit says that the instruction came from 
10 
me.  It actually did not.  It came from Mr Govender 
because I put them – they were in direct contact with each 
other.   
 
And that changes to the settlement letter with 
even the proposed draft, that CDH had made so that Eskom 
was protected, was overridden by Mr Govender.  And Mr 
Mabelane sent the letter to Dr Weiss and it was signed, I 
think, on the 16 t h of February. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Yes, that is correct. 
MS DANIELS:   Ja.  So by the time when I get the memo, 
20 
you know, payments are already in place.  So payment – 
the processes are already in place, the settlement has 
been signed and ja...  The reason I say it was a lapse in 
judgment Mr Chairman is.  Mr Govender came to my office.  
I had external parties.  He waited outside until I signed. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 102 of 163 
 
 
And I actually – I did sign it without asking for 
the supporting documentation.  So that is where I took the 
accountability of saying I did not actually apply to my mind 
to that but I think Mr Koko must not mislead the public and 
you by thinking – by saying that, you know, look here, I 
was responsible.   
 
I did not sign this – that the payments had 
already been made or were in the process of being made.  
So the signature or non-signature of that document is 
actually irrelevant.  The fact remains that Trillian and 
10 
McKinsey were paid the balance of the payments.   
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 The 
payments 
were 
made 
on 
22 February 2017. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the letter is on? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The letter ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or the memo or whatever.  The letter or 
memo that she says she signed? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh.  She said she received it on the 
20 t h of February. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And but it was signed on the same day?   
MS DANIELS:   No ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Was it signed on the day you received 
it?   
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 103 of 163 
 
MS DANIELS:   No, mister ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or when did you sign it? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, I signed it late the next day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   21? 
MS DANIELS:   Because I was in meetings.  And then it 
still had to go to Mr Koko and it was not... [break in 
transmission].  So, you know, that document – he refused 
to sign it.  He said I forwarded it to him.  I did not.  It went 
through – Mr Govender was the one that... with the memo.  
And it really – it was not signed by Mr Koko.  He was then 
10 
Chief Executive at that time.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay.  We stop there...? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair.  That is – but let me just 
add what she was saying by this time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
By 
that 
time 
already, 
the 
16 t h of February 2017, Mr Edwin Mabelane had sent a 
letter to McKinsey saying, we are going to pay you the final 
amount.  That is - we will stop here for today. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay we will stop here, Ms Daniels, for 
20 
today but of course you will be coming back on Friday at 
two o’clock. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is two o’clock the earliest you can make 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 104 of 163 
 
in terms of – from your side in terms of the difference in 
time or is one o’clock also doable? 
MS DANIELS:   It is doable Mr Chairman.  I will just have 
to go to bed earlier.  It is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MS DANIELS:   ...five o’clock in the morning here 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS DANIELS:   ...if it is two o’clock in the afternoon. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no.  That is fine.  Let us leave it 
10 
at two o’clock.  It is just that, Mr Seleka, I am thinking we 
might finish earlier with the morning witness of Friday.  Is 
it Mr Pamensky? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, it is the former Minister Lynne 
Brown. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no.  The ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, no.  No, no.  I thought it was 
20 
Mr Pamensky.  No, no.  Let us leave it for two o’clock 
because... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But we might finish early. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We might finish early. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   With her. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 105 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   With her, we might finish early. 
CHAIRPERSON:   With Ms Daniels? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, okay, let us leave the 
arrangement at two o’clock.  Say you will testify at two 
o’clock.  Okay alright. 
MS DANIELS:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you.  I am going to take a 
short adjournment before the next witness takes the stand. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To give you a chance to settle. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay we adjourn.

Page 106 of 163 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Shall I first take the oath or...? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes-no, that is fine.  I understand she is 
legally represented.  Shall we ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...have her legal representatives to 
place themselves on record first? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You can do it from where you are if your 
mic is working. 
ADV GOOSEN:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  Deirdré Goosen 
10 
from the Johannesburg Society of Advocates.  I have got 
with me, Mr Padayachee, my instructing attorney, to my

REGISTRAR:   Please state your full names for the record?

REGISTRAR:   Do you have any objection to taking 
...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry.  I am not sure if that was loud 
enough.  Please, just speak up more. 
WITNESS:   My name is Nonhlanhla Dahlia Kraai. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you have any objection in taking the 
prescribed oath? 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361

but the truth?  If so, please raise your right hand and say, 
so help me God. 
WITNESS:   So help me God. 
NONHLANHLA DAHLIA KRAAI:  (d.s.s) 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  You may be seated. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Just by way of 
background information for the next witness and I will refer 
to the files in due course.  Ms Kraai is a former employee 
of Eskom.  Her testimony to the Commission is on a very 
narrow aspect.   
 
This is the person who Mr Masango said was 
supposed to meet with way back on the 10 t h of March 2015.  
He could not meet with her because of the meeting he had 
with Melrose Arch on that day. On his way back to – what 
20 
is it? 
MS KRAAI:   Kusile. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Kusile. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Kusile. 
MS KRAAI:   Kusile Power Station. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 108 of 163 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   On the way back to Kusile, he 
telephoned Mr Kraai and told her about this strange 
meeting, as he calls it, that he had at Melrose Arch.  They 
then had another meeting on the 11 t h, early morning on the 
11 t h of March 2015 and in respect of both the conversation 
and that meeting, Ms Kraai will give her recollection of 
what happened.  She might at the end also be given the 
opportunity to respond to Mr Koko’s allegation in regard to 
her.  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, basically, Ms Kraai is the person that 
10 
Mr Masango says he told or informed her about the 
meeting that he says he attended with Mr Koko and 
Mr Salim Essa at Melrose Arch ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...on the 10 t h. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So Ms Kraai’s evidence will seek to say 
whether that is so but if it did happen, it happened in the 
telephone conversation that Mr Masango says he had with 
Ms Kraai ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...after that meeting on the 10 t h as well 
as in another meeting or in a meeting the following day. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But Mr Masango may have talked about 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 109 of 163 
 
a meeting on the side of the road and so on but Ms Kraai 
will deal with all of that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is correct, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You may proceed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  The affidavits – 
Ms Kraai has provided the Commission with two affidavits 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And maybe just to mention because not 
10 
everybody might remember the meeting of the 10 t h as much 
as we do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The meeting of the 10 t h of March 2015 
that Mr Masango testified about, is the meeting where he 
says he was told about the suspension of the Eskom 
Executives even before they were suspended and Mr Koko 
has said no such meeting took place. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Ms Kraai has 
provided the Commission with two affidavits.  They are 
found in Eskom Bundle 14(a).  The first one is on page 52.  
Ms Kraai, you will have the same bundle in front of you, 
Eskom Bundle 13(a), page 52. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 110 of 163 
 
MS KRAAI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   If you...  Ja, page 52.   
MS KRAAI:   [Speaker unclear – voice very soft.] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Ja, she will help you.   
MS KRAAI:   [Speaker unclear – voice very soft.] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Follow...  okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, just explain the black numbers to 
her. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, that is her first time Chair.  We 
follow the black pagination on the page that is right at the 
10 
top left-hand corner.   
MS KRAAI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And...  So are you there on page 52? 
MS KRAAI:   Yes, I am. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There is an affidavit there.  I, the 
undersigned, Nonhlanhla Kraai.  The affidavit runs up to 
page 59 ...[intervenes]  
MS KRAAI:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...where there is a signature.  Do you 
confirm that to be your signature? 
20 
MS KRAAI:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The affidavit ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the signature on – just above the 
words “signature of deponent”.  Is that your signature? 
MS KRAAI:   On page 59? 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 111 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes ...[intervenes]  
MS KRAAI:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There are two signatures.  So I just 
wanted to make sure that you know which one we are 
talking about. 
MS KRAAI:   That is correct Mr Chair.  That is my 
signature. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  The affidavit is 
dated 24 November 2020.  Just go back to that page with 
10 
your signature on it, page 59. 
MS KRAAI:   Okay just wait.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, have you moved ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   59, the black numbers on the top left-
hand corner. 
MS KRAAI:   Dated 2012/11? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that page where your signature is, the 
one we were talking about just now.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   On what page are you now? 
20 
MS KRAAI:   I am on page 59.14. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   If you go back. 
MS KRAAI:   Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS KRAAI:   24 November 2020. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 112 of 163 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  You confirm the date so? 
MS KRAAI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   You confirm the correctness of the 
contents of your affidavit? 
MS KRAAI:   Yes, it is correct although I had to correct 
some errors. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
MS KRAAI:   Yes, after I submitted my initial affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay so those corrections will be 
apparent in your supplementary affidavit. 
10 
MS KRAAI:   In my supplementary affidavit that I signed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay we will go into it.  Chairperson, I 
beg leave to have this affidavit on pages 52 to 59, dated 
24 November 2020, admitted as Exhibit U-26.1.

10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It has a date stamp.  On the

signed it. 
MS KRAAI:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you see that? 
MS KRAAI:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Other than that, do you confirm the

your profession or your qualification? 
MS KRAAI:   My qualification is Bcom Honours in

Accounting and I just obtained my master ’s in Development 
Finance. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Congratulations. 
MS KRAAI:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Congratulations. 
MS KRAAI:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  You – and when did you join 
Eskom? 
MS KRAAI:   I joined Eskom in 1994 as a graduating 
20 
trainee because they were sponsoring my studies.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see.  And you would have progressed 
in your career, I suppose, or positions within Eskom? 
MS KRAAI:   Yes, I did progress.  And if maybe I can take 
the Chair to that progression at high-level. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 115 of 163 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m? 
MS KRAAI:   As I have said, I started as a graduating 
trainee in one of the power stations.  Then I was appointed 
as a Management Accounting Manager in 2002 in another 
power station.   
 
And I moved to the Middle-Manager in 2006 also 
in different power station.  And in 2009, I moved to Kusile 
Power Station Project as a Middle-Manager, Project and 
Financial Accounting Manager.   
 
Then in 2016, I was appointed as a Senior 
10 
Manager in Oversight and Monitoring Assurance in the 
portfolio delivery of the project.  Then my last was – my 
last job was Senior Manager for Procurement Primary 
Energy in Eskom.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So between 2009, April 2009 to 
October 2016, you say you were the Project and Financial 
Accounting Manager? 
MS KRAAI:   Accounting Manager.  That is correct 
Mr Seleka.   
CHAIRPERSON:   At Kusile? 
20 
MS KRAAI:   At Kusile Power Station Project.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  So it will be fair to say you are a 
learned person? 
MS KRAAI:   I am? 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 116 of 163 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   A learned person. 
MS KRAAI:   I think it is fair and I am also very 
knowledgeable.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Very knowledgeable.  [laughs]  So if 
you had an encounter at work which was different from 
normal, you would notice that, you would remember that? 
MS KRAAI:   I do so. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MS KRAAI:   I will remember.  I think so. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now Mr Masango has testified before

the Commission and has provided the Commission with an 
affidavit.  We have given you that affidavit.  And I know 
from your affidavit that you have listened to his testimony.  
He talks about given you ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, before you go there Mr Seleka.  Do 
you want to ask her what her duties were in her position in 
2015?  What were your duties, generally, insofar as they 
may be relevant to your interactions with Mr Masango at 
work? 
MS KRAAI:   Mr Chair ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   In other words, what connected you with 
Mr Masango. 
MS KRAAI:   Okay.  I belonged to Group Capital Finance or 
I will say the Finance Division and when I was appointed, 
you get seconded to your project where we signed, we call 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 117 of 163 
 
it a Service Level Agreement, to say you will be providing 
the services in terms of Financial Accounting, Project 
Accounting, just making sure all your accounting entries 
are taken care of.   
 
But I was also responsible to make sure your – 
we call it Short-term Budget, Medium-term Budget, the 
preparation thereof and the submission, responsible for all 
your financial audit within the project.  Your cash flow 
management from your monthly, quarterly, yearly and your 
cost to completion.  Your overall business case of the 
10 
project.   
 
I think it is important that I mention that the 
delegation of the business case which was your 169 billion 
including your ITC was delegated to Mr Masango.  My 
delegation was only limited to my Finance Cost Centre but 
I was there to make sure that there are processes in place, 
that the business case is executed within the budget that 
was allocated to the project. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was...  So were both of you based 
at Kusile Power Station, that is yourself and Mr Masango? 
20 
MS KRAAI:   That ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   In 2015. 
MS KRAAI:   Yes, that is correct Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what was Mr Masango’s position or 
title at Kusile at that time if you are able to remember? 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 118 of 163 
 
MS KRAAI:   Mr Masango was a Project Director for Kusile.  
Basically, he was responsible for the project. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KRAAI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Had the two of you been working at 
Kusile Power Station for quite some time by March 2015? 
MS KRAAI:   Yes.  I joined Kusile Project, Power Station 
Project on the 1 s t of April 2009 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Did your duties require you 
to have meetings with Mr Masango at certain intervals or at 
10 
all or not really? 
MS KRAAI:   Yes, my duties required that I have meetings 
with Mr Masango except for our standing meetings.  We 
used to have a Steering Committee which used to sit on 
Tuesdays where we would discuss the progress of the 
project but from different stakeholders.   
 
But as a finance person, it was important that 
from time to time we engage ourselves – we will engage, 
sometime on a weekly basis f it is necessary if I foresee 
the risk. 
20 
 
Because part of my responsibility was to identify 
the risk and say from the financial point of view how can it 
be mitigated because your numbers, they talked to the 
scope of work, they talked to the milestone, what needs to 
be executed at the project. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 119 of 163 
 
 
Therefore, I cannot just take a financial decision 
without Mr Masango and other project manager in the 
project.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  And when you talk about the risk 
to the project or risks to the project, you talk about the 
Kusile Project or ...[intervenes]  
MS KRAAI:   The Kusile Project, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KRAAI:   The financial risk of us going beyond the 
allocated budget, approved allocated budget, the business 
10 
case, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MS KRAAI:   Because that was my role to make sure that I 
identify those risks.  We put mitigation in place and say 
what are we going to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS KRAAI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, you want to take it from 
there? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Thank you, Chair.  So 
20 
Ms Kraai, 
you 
– 
I 
was 
going 
into 
the 
telephone 
conversation that Mr Masango has testified about and 
wrote about in his affidavit, that he gave you that call, it 
was a return call on the 10 t h of March 2015, to tell you why 
he could not answer your calls to him and why he was 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 120 of 163 
 
unable to be available for a meeting. 
 
I would like you to give the Chairperson your 
recollection of what transpired on that day and how it came 
about that Mr Masango spoke to you about this meeting he 
had. 
MS KRAAI:   Thank you, Mr Seleka.  Mr Chair, before I can 
give a ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   A recollection. 
MS KRAAI:   ...recollection of the events that happened 
over the phone with Mr Masango.  I think it is important 
10 
that I just give the background to that.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KRAAI:   What led to Mr Masango calling me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KRAAI:   Making the call. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS KRAAI:   Yes.  I prepared a presentation, looking at the 
cost to completion or should I say, we call it the MYTD-3 
which was the target.  It is your Miles To Year Price 
20 
Determination that Eskom use when they apply the tariff 
increase to...   
 
Once it was approved, you are get given the 
target to say this was the target, you work within that 
target.  There was a meeting that was scheduled to take 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 121 of 163 
 
place on the 11 t h of March 2015 but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And what meeting was that? 
MS KRAAI:   Yes ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   [Indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
MS KRAAI:   ...the meeting was to discuss the presentation 
and highlight fuel contracts or we used to call them 
packages that we are going to overspend and we had to 
make decision to say, yes, as much as we were still within 
the business overall budget for the project but those 
specific contracts are beyond their allocated budget.   
10 
 
So you need to make a decision and say:  Do we 
draw the money from the constituency?  We had the 
constituency that was approved, given to the project but 
you also need to follow the process but you cannot just 
make 
that 
decision 
just 
because 
a 
package 
is 
overspending, you just go and withdraw from the project.   
 
You have to follow, justify, understand what 
happened because some of these risks to find out that it is 
just a once-off risk.  The consequences will – once you 
mitigate the risk, then the budget will realign itself.  That is 
20 
the importance of the meeting.  And in that meeting already 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Was that meeting a meeting of a certain 
committee that has got a name or ...[intervenes]  
MS KRAAI:   No, no, no.  It was not a committee.  Ja. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 122 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was ...[intervenes]  
MS KRAAI:   Because if you check the subject on the 
email, it was saying MYTD-3 Discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS KRAAI:   So we were going to discuss with specific 
project 
managers 
whose 
contract 
or 
packages 
were 
overspending. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who were going to attend that meeting? 
MS KRAAI:   It was going to be myself.  I think and two of 
my colleagues were invited.  And those specific project 
10 
managers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What were their names? 
MS KRAAI:   Okay I will try to recall.  Can I...? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or ...[intervenes]  
MS KRAAI:   Okay.  It was myself, there was Thumelo(?), 
there was Dudu from the Finance side and I can recall a 
Ruben Mamorabe(?) was - Azihn(?) was going to attend 
and ...[indistinct] was going to attend.  There was a B&B 
guy.  I cannot remember the name. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you do not mention all of them. 
20 
MS KRAAI:   Ja, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But at least those or some of the people 
...[intervenes]  
MS KRAAI:   Basically, it is your multi-discipline from 
construction, contract management facilities. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 123 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you said one of them was Dudu who? 
MS KRAAI:   Dudu Nthonghema(?) 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS KRAAI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you mentioned another one, the first 
one ...[intervenes]  
MS KRAAI:   Thumelo.  Those were my finance managers 
reporting to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, reporting to you? 
MS KRAAI:   Yes, they were reporting to me. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And was there somebody not reporting to 
you that was going to attend? 
MS KRAAI:   Yes, the others I have mentioned Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have mentioned two ...[intervenes]  
MS KRAAI:   They were reporting to Senior Project 
Managers or contract – they were – I would say technical 
people.  They were not finance people. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mention the two of them for me? 
20 
MS KRAAI:   It was Ruben Mamorabe. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MS KRAAI:   It was Awe Deyase(?). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KRAAI:   If I can recall. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 124 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KRAAI:   And there was a construction manager 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine. 
MS KRAAI:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is fine.  By the time you left Eskom, 
were they still there?  Were they still employed by Eskom? 
MS KRAAI:   Yes, they were still employed by Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
MS KRAAI:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you have any reason to believe that 
they would remember the issue of that meeting? 
MS KRAAI:   Oh, okay.  I think I was still going to explain 
to say – but the meeting was going to take place on the 
11 t h Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS KRAAI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MS KRAAI:   But I think they can recall that because the 
meeting did continue ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KRAAI:   ...although without Mr Masango. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MS KRAAI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay continue.  I interrupted you. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 125 of 163 
 
MS KRAAI:   Yes.  That is the background I wanted to give 
Mr Chair to say the importance of that meeting because it 
was – we are already highlighting the risk that these 
packages were going to overspend by, like, two billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS KRAAI:   Yes.  So it was important that Mr Masango 
becomes part of that meeting to attend.  But normally what 
happens.  He would request that me and him will meet so 
that I brief him of the challenges, what are we seeing at 
the Finance Department so that when he meets the Project 
10 
Managers, we all align and he will say:  How do I help 
finance, you know, to achieve what we want to achieve?  
So there were really critical and crucial decisions that had 
to be taken.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So are you saying that whenever there 
was to be a meeting such as the one that was planned for 
the 11 t h ...[intervenes]  
MS KRAAI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...he would want to have a meeting with 
you ...[intervenes]  
20 
MS KRAAI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...ahead of that meeting? 
MS KRAAI:   Yes, ahead of that meeting.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So that you would brief him on 
...[intervenes]  
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 126 of 163 
 
MS KRAAI:   I brief him on ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...on issues. 
MS KRAAI:   ...on finance issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KRAAI:   Correct Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MS KRAAI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
MS KRAAI:   Okay.   
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Uhm ...[intervenes]  
MS KRAAI:   So on that day, he said he has got work 
commitments, that is on the 10 t h of March.  He said he has 
got work commitments but when he comes back from 
Megawatt Park ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay before he said that.  What 
gave rise to him saying that?  Did you phone him?  Did you 
meet in the morning or how did...? 
MS KRAAI:   Oh, sorry.  The secretary arranged – called 
me to say Mr Masango would like to have a meeting with 
20 
you when he comes back from Megawatt Park during 
lunchtime so that you brief him about the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And ...[intervenes]  
MS KRAAI:   ...about the presentation.  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 And 
around 
– 
do 
you 
remember 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 127 of 163 
 
roundabout what time of the day or morning this was, when 
his secretary called you? 
MS KRAAI:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No? 
MS KRAAI:   I think that was the previous day.  I cannot 
remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The day before the 10 t h? 
MS KRAAI:   The day before the 10 t h, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The 9 t h? 
MS KRAAI:   The 9 t h.  To say Mr Masango would like to 
10 
have a meeting with you on the 10 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS KRAAI:   Yes, during lunchtime. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KRAAI:   So that you take him to the presentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS KRAAI:   Ja, in preparation of the meeting that was 
going to take place on the 11 t h of March. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
MS KRAAI:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the secretary was arranging a 
meeting for you and Mr Masango ...[intervenes]  
MS KRAAI:   That is correct ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...to ...[intervenes]  
MS KRAAI:   ...during lunchtime. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 128 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
To 
meet 
during 
the 
lunchtime 
...[intervenes]  
MS KRAAI:   Yes.  And it was ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS KRAAI:   ...not unusual Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS KRAAI:   Because when he has got an issue with 
finance, even when he is having lunch, you know, she will 
call – he will ask the secretary that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
MS KRAAI:   ...that Ms Nonhlanhla must come and see him 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS KRAAI:   ...so that we discuss few issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
MS KRAAI:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So did you have a meeting on the 
10 t h? 
MS KRAAI:   No, Mr Seleka...  No, Chair, we did not have a 
meeting. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   What happened? 
MS KRAAI:   I think around lunchtime ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   First of all.  Had you agreed to the 
suggestion that the two of you should have a meeting 
...[intervenes]  
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 129 of 163 
 
MS KRAAI:   Yes, I did agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did? 
MS KRAAI:   Because we are both on site. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS KRAAI:   It is happening onsite. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MS KRAAI:   You quickly go to his office. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS KRAAI:   You brief him.  Then you continue with your 
normal duties. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay but you say the meeting did not 
happen? 
MS KRAAI:   The meeting did not happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS KRAAI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka is asking why did it not 
happen. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that is right. 
MS KRAAI:   Okay.  During lunchtime, I think, I called the 
secretary to check if Mr Masango is back from his 
20 
commitment at Megawatt Park. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is this now on the 10 t h of March? 
MS KRAAI:   That is the 10 t h of March. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m? 
MS KRAAI:   Then the secretary said:  No, he is not back 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 130 of 163 
 
yet.  I think I waited for, if I can recall, 30-minutes or so, 
thinking may you know he is stuck in traffic, he will be back 
on – but then I call again, is Mr Masango back on site.  We 
call it site, you know, Kusile power station project.  Then 
she said to me no, she is not back and I took a phone, I 
called Mr Masango, you know, to say are we still going to 
have a meeting because it was important for me – the 10 
March was also our month end closing for finance so I had 
to plan other things, I need to review the report before they 
are submitted to head office.  So I just wanted to say are 
10 
you still coming, are we going to meeting, you know, and 
continue what needs to happen? 
 
Then when I called the phone, Chair, did not even 
go to the voicemail, I could not even leave a voice 
message to say, you know, and that was it.  Then I 
continue with my normal duties. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say it did not even go into 
voicemail, your call …[intervenes] 
MS KRAAI:   I am not sure if it was full or what, it is just 
like “ting”.  There was no space for me to leave.  Ja, there 
20 
was no like… 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was full? 
MS KRAAI:   I am not sure whether it was full or what but 
it just did not go to – let me say it did not go to the voice 
message. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 131 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it did not ring? 
MS KRAAI:   No, it did not ring. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or did it ring but did not go into 
voicemail or did it not ring at all? 
MS KRAAI:   No, it did not ring. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MS KRAAI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
MS KRAAI:   I am not sure, like I cannot – like I am saying 
I cannot recall but I do not remember leaving a voice 
10 
message.  Yes, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, okay.  No, that is fine.  Now you 
have called – or the PA has said he has not – or the 
secretary has said he has not come back, you take the 
step to call him, you are unable to reach him.  What do you 
do next?  Do you go about your duties? 
MS KRAAI:   No, I think I – Chair, I went back to my 
normal duties, as I have mentioned that it was month end 
there were a lot of reports that had to be submitted, we 
had a deadline of five o’clock that day to submit our report. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS KRAAI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Does he ever come back to you? 
MS KRAAI:   Mr Masango came back to me, I cannot recall 
the exact time but I think it was around four.  But later that 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 132 of 163 
 
day, you know, he came back to me, Chair, and apologising 
not coming back …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So he called you? 
MS KRAAI:   Ja, he called me. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
And 
what 
did 
he 
say 
in 
the 
conversation? 
MS KRAAI:   He said oh, I am sorry, I could not come back 
site, you know, something strange happened.  Then I am 
like oh, something strange …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, tell me about that telephone 
10 
conversation between the two of you. 
MS KRAAI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As fully as you are able. 
MS KRAAI:   Okay.  Mr Masango called me, he said  -
obviously he was returning my call saying he could not 
come to site and have the meeting as planned with me, 
apologising for not coming back to site during lunchtime as 
arranged.  Then he said to me something I was called – I 
was called by Mr Koko or Matshela, to come to a meeting 
at Melrose Arch, okay?  I just listened, you know, because 
20 
then she said it was a very strange funny meeting.  So I 
was just listening.  Then when I arrived there the reason 
why I could not call you or to say I am not going to be able 
to meet a meeting it is because my phone was taken at the 
entrance.  I met Koko, I think at the balcony, they met 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 133 of 163 
 
somewhere, then Mr Koko took him to some room at 
Melrose Arch where at the entrance he was asked to 
surrender the phone at the entrance.  They took his phone 
at the entrance.  Then she was taken to some room and in 
that room there was a indoda emfushane that is what he 
said to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is what he said in the telephone 
…[intervenes] 
MS 
KRAAI: 
 
 
Ja 
over 
the 
telephone, 
ja 
over 
the 
conversation, then …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what did you say? 
MS KRAAI:   Then I said oh, okay, what happened in that 
meeting?  Chair, as far as I can recall hundred percent Mr 
Masango did not go further.  He said to me let us meet on 
site in the morning so that you still take me to the 
presentation and I will tell you the rest of like the story 
what happened.  Because for me was oh, they took your 
phone, you know, what kind of meeting was that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Did the conversation end? 
MS KRAAI:   Ja, the conversation end, the conversation 
20 
was very brief, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KRAAI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now you referred – you said he said 
there was indoda emfushane in that meeting, do you want 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 134 of 163 
 
to …[intervenes] 
MS KRAAI:   Ja, she said to me …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, hang on, do you want to say 
what 
you 
understood 
indoda 
emfushane 
to 
mean 
in 
English? 
MS KRAAI:   It was a short Indian man. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that is what that phrase means? 
MS KRAAI:   Ja, that is what the phrase means. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MS KRAAI:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you said he – I think he was 
returning your call. 
MS KRAAI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if your call did not even go through 
he would not have known you had called. 
MS KRAAI:   As I am saying, it did not ring, it only said 
“ting” so I am not sure like it was recording and maybe the 
voicemail was full, I do not know, but I could not leave the 
– ja, the message, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Mr Seleka? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  So, Ms Kraai, did he 
mention to you that he had a meeting with this short Indian 
man and Mr Koko? 
MS KRAAI:   That is correct, Mr Chair, he did mention to 
say he had a meeting with Mr Koko and the Indian 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 135 of 163 
 
gentleman, the short Indian gentleman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And you are not mistaken about that? 
MS KRAAI:   No, I am not mistaken about that, Mr Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And so he agrees with you then – well, 
let me ask you this before that, did he mention anything 
about the suspensions to you on the telephone call? 
MS KRAAI:   Mr Chair, Mr Masango did not mention 
anything about the suspension of the four executives. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In that telephone conversation. 
MS KRAAI:   Ja, on the conversation. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   On the – ja.  So he then agrees with 
you or proposes to you that he will tell you more details 
…[intervenes] 
MS KRAAI:   Ja, like …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The next day. 
MS KRAAI:   Yes, if I may say, Chair, it was like a casual – 
you get what I am saying, it is like let us meet in the 
morning, I will relate the rest of the story in the morning, 
not something – I will say not something like tense or – if I 
may say… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and did you meet the following 
morning? 
MS KRAAI:   Yes, we did meet, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Around what time was it? 
MS KRAAI:   It was around, if I am may say, around 6 a.m. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 136 of 163 
 
because he said to me he needs to rush, there is another 
meeting at Megawatt Park. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KRAAI:   Yes, there is another meeting at Megawatt 
Park. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the meeting that was going to 
involve the other – or project managers I think you said, 
the other people, the bigger meeting, what time was it 
going to be? 
MS KRAAI:   It was going to take place between ten and 
10 
twelve. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and you met with him at 6 a.m.? 
MS KRAAI:   Yes, we met at 6 a.m. because he said he is 
not going to attend the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KRAAI:   He needs to go back Megawatt Park but I can 
continue with the meeting after I have briefed him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KRAAI:   You know, about the presentation, the risk 
that we have identified and what will be the way forward in 
20 
terms of handling the over-expenditure that we were 
anticipating. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
So 
he 
was 
going 
to 
tell 
you 
…(intervenes) 
MS KRAAI:   More or less …[intervenes] 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 137 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   What his views …[intervenes] 
MS KRAAI:   Ja, what his views are. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which he would share with the others at 
the meeting. 
MS KRAAI:   Which I would share at the others but they 
still need to take me to the details of why we find 
ourselves in this situation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now in this – this is no on the 11 
March. 
10 
MS KRAAI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In the morning.  He has promised you 
he will tell you the rest and the next morning, that is the 
morning, does he – do you ask him or does he volunteer to 
tell you the rest about the meeting he had on the 10 
March? 
MS KRAAI:   If I can recall, Mr Chair, I think he 
volunteered.  He started – as we were going through the 
presentation and he is like hey, obviously repeating what 
he said to me over the phone to say this strange meeting 
20 
happened at Mel – I am not going to repeat that but then 
he went further, Chair, and said in that meeting, as I was 
asking what happened – my last question to him last night 
was what happened, when he said okay, let us meet, 
continue with the meeting, do not cancel it, the meeting 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 138 of 163 
 
that was going to take place between ten and twelve.  In 
the morning he says I was told in that meeting that I will be 
acting as a Group Capital Executive, as executive for 
Group Capital.  Then I think for me more than – I was like 
surprised and said oh, okay, where is Mr Dan Marokane 
going, who was his current manager, you know?  And I 
cannot 
recall, 
Chair, 
what 
was 
his 
response 
to 
my 
question, you know, because I even asked and say who is 
going to take over at Kusile, you know?  Then that one I 
remember, he said I do not know.  But still in the morning 
10 
of the 11 t h he did not mention the suspension of the four 
executives. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So on the 10 t h when he spoke to you on 
the phone he told that the reason why he did not make it 
for the lunch meeting that was [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
MS KRAAI:   Yes, the reason he was calling me to – the 
reason why …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on one second. 
MS KRAAI:   Yes, he could not come. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on one second.  He told you that 
the reason why he could not make it for that meeting with 
you was because he had been called to a meeting at 
Melrose Arch and he had been called by Mr Koko and he 
had had a meeting with Mr Koko and a short Indian man, is 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 139 of 163 
 
that right? 
MS KRAAI:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And when you asked him what had 
happened at that meeting, he did not tell you on the 
conversation but he said …[intervenes] 
MS KRAAI:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   …he would tell you more …[intervenes] 
MS KRAAI:   When we meet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you met in the morning on the 
11 t h. 
10 
MS KRAAI:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And on the 11 t h when you met the issue 
was discussed but he just told you that he had been told at 
that meeting that he would act as Group Capital?  What is 
the title? 
MS KRAAI:   Group Capital Executive.  Ja, Chair, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Group Capital Executive, ja. 
MS KRAAI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who position was that? 
MS KRAAI:   That was Mr Dan Marokane’s position. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So he said he would act – he had been 
told he was going to act in that position? 
MS KRAAI:   In that position. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you …[intervenes] 
MS KRAAI:   I was a bit surprised, hence …[intervenes] 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 140 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You were surprised and you asked him 
what would happen to …[intervenes] 
MS KRAAI:   Ja, where is Mr Marokane going? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KRAAI:   I thought maybe they are moving, there are 
some changes happening in the organisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he did not give you an answer for 
that? 
MS KRAAI:   No, he did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then you asked who was going to act in 
10 
his position? 
MS KRAAI:   At Kusile as a project director. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then he gave you answer? 
MS KRAAI:   He said he does not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He said he did not know. 
MS KRAAI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he did not tell you about any 
suspensions? 
MS KRAAI:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MS KRAAI:   As far- ja, he did not tell me about any 
suspensions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, is that the sum total of your 
conversation at that meeting of the 11 t h insofar as it 
related to his meeting the previous day? 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 141 of 163 
 
MS 
KRAAI: 
 
 
That 
is 
correct, 
Chair. 
 
Then 
we 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Whatever else you discussed related to 
the presentation. 
MS KRAAI:   It was related to the presentation because I 
had to quickly brief him about the presentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KRAAI:   Because I remember, I think I – he said I 
need to be out by half past six. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MS KRAAI:   You know, just to – ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Could you be mistaken 
about your conversation with him on the 10 t h on the phone 
and your conversation with him on the 11 t h? 
MS KRAAI:   Chair, on the 10 t h, I am not mistaken.  He did 
not mention the suspensions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and on the 11 t h? 
MS KRAAI:   On the 11 t h he did not mention the 
suspensions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But the things that you say he 
20 
mentioned, could you be mistaken about them? 
MS KRAAI:   About the…? 
CHAIRPERSON:   About them, they things that you say he 
did mention, could you be mistaken about them? 
MS KRAAI:   Chair, I am not mistaken. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 142 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MS KRAAI:   That is what I can recall what happened in          
that morning, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you, Chair.  Did you at any 
time thereafter, you know, on the 11 t h or the 12 t h or the 13 t h 
learn about the suspensions? 
MS KRAAI:   On the 12 March, I think it was around about 
eleven, 
there 
was 
a 
communiqué 
from 
corporate 
communication to the whole organisation relating to the 
10 
suspension of four executives already mentioning the 
names of the people that were going to act in those 
positions and Mr Masango’s name was one of the names 
that was there, exactly the same position.  He told me he 
was told he was going to act. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did the communiqué mention anything 
about the suspensions of the executives who occupied the 
positions, one of which being where Mr Masango was going 
to act? 
20 
MS KRAAI:   I think I sent the – if I can recall the 
communiqué, it was just saying the four executives – I am 
not sure whether did it say they will be suspended but it 
was saying the four executives, I cannot remember where 
to where but I did – it was there affidavit. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 143 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON: You [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
MS KRAAI:   Ja, I cannot remember but it was – it did say 
to say these are the four executives and while – I think 
there is some investigation happening, if I can recall, and 
these are the current executives that will be acting in those 
positions, I cannot remember word to work. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did he say they would step aside? 
MS KRAAI:   Can you repeat that, Mr Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Do 
you 
remember 
whether 
the 
communiqué said that the executives would step aside?  
10 
You cannot remember? 
MS KRAAI:   I think so, hence I am saying I cannot 
remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS KRAAI:   Where – oh, there is the communiqué, sorry, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, yes? 
MS KRAAI:   It was just saying the executive – ja, to step 
down while the inquiry is underway.  I remember something 
inquiry. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS KRAAI:   As if there is some inquiry happening. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MS KRAAI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you.  Thank you, Chair.  
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 144 of 163 
 
That is on page 59.22, Eskom bundle 14A.  So were you – I 
suppose you were not surprised by that or were you 
surprised to learn – to see that Mr Masango is going to act 
in the position that he told you about the day before? 
MS KRAAI:   I think I will say I was surprised also the step 
down of these four executives more than anything to say, 
oh, okay, the four executives are stepping down but just 
the middle manager in a project and these are executive 
changes happening, so I was like oh, okay, you know, this 
is what Mr Masango told me that he will be acting although 
10 
he did not tell me the reasons behind. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did – going back to your meeting with 
Masango on the 11 t h in the morning did he tell you the 
name of the person to whom he referred to as a short 
Indian man? 
MS KRAAI:   Mr Chair, he never told me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He never told you? 
MS KRAAI:   No, he never. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you did not ask. 
MS KRAAI:   No, I did not ask. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright. 
MS KRAAI:   I do not remember asking but he never told 
me and I would say I was also not interested, if I may say. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now I seem to think Mr Masango 
said he met with you on the side of the road on the 10 t h.  
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 145 of 163 
 
Did that happen on the 10 t h when he came back from that 
meeting? 
MS KRAAI:   Chair, as I have said, Mr Masango called 
around four, past four, I was still on site.  As I have 
mentioned previously it was month end reporting, there 
were reports that were due at five.  I think that day I left 
the site around six, past six, which was just normal for us, 
you know, sometimes even eight at night we will leave the 
site if it is month end reporting, but I never met Mr 
Masango on the side of the road. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  So he must be mistaken 
about that if that is what he says as far as you are 
concerned. 
MS KRAAI:   As far as I am concerned, ja.  I think it is up 
to him to prove it, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Did you enquire from him 
why he called this meeting strange?  Did you find out from 
him? 
MS KRAAI:   Chair, I did not – for me I assume it is 
20 
strange because they took his phone from him.  I never 
enquired to say – I think if I can recall, Chair, I think it is 
even there in my affidavit, I only asked a question to say 
why was the meeting not at Megawatt Park and I cannot 
remember the answer from Mr Masango.  I remember 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 146 of 163 
 
asking that to say why was the meeting at Megawatt Park 
but at the same time, Chair, I did not read that much 
because it was normal for Mr Masango to – whether 
Megawatt Park to meet stakeholders, you know, ja.  Ja, for 
meetings.  So I did not really enquire, ensure – there was 
nothing suspicious or untoward for me to be enquiring to 
say who was this Indian man. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, the email screen shots or 
prints at page 55 and page 58, do we have something 
clearer than what we have here? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair.  We have tried to do that 
prior to the hearing and Mr Padayachee, the attorney for 
Ms Kraai, has re-emailed to us those screen shots.  We 
can enlarge them on the computer but I am told when they 
get to be printed out they still come out small. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Will she be able to – that is Ms Kraai – 
to read into the record what appears on those screen 
prints? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes because the names …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Cover that. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Let 
us 
cover 
that 
because 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us cover that, ja. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 147 of 163 
 
MS KRAAI:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As you have said, Mr Seleka, she is 
testifying on very narrow issues. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I want to us to finish as soon as 
possible. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   With her evidence.  There is no need for 
us to stay for too long because the area she is covering is 
very narrow. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Ms Kraai, will you be able to 
read?  Let us start with the screen print at page 55. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think in the paragraph 10 you say: 
“I set out below what I was informed by Mr Masango 
over the telephone on that day.  It is important now 
that I also sketch some background better from the 
conversation and do so by reference to the email 
screen print of it below.” 
20 
Okay, then you can read it so – because I cannot read it 
clearly. 
MS KRAAI:   Okay.  The first screen shot relates to 
paragraph 10, Chair.   
“It is a rescheduled meeting, it was supposed to take 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 148 of 163 
 
place on the 4 March but it was rescheduled to take 
place on the 11 March.  The subject of the meeting…” 
It says: 
“MYPD3 discussions and where …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who is the author of the document. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And to whom is it directed and what is 
the date of the document? 
MS KRAAI:   Oh.  Oh, okay.  I think it will reflect as if it 
10 
was – it was coming from Tapiso Rapport(?) who was my 
secretary. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS KRAAI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was directed to? 
MS KRAAI:   It was directed to the following people, Mr 
Masango, Abram Masango, Nonhlanhla Kraai, Dudu Ngema 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh and then the rest of the people that 
you mentioned? 
20 
MS KRAAI:   Ja.  Boitemelo(?) Kanya, [indistinct – dropping 
voice] Mosiwe and …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that is fine, you do not have to 
mention all of them. 
MS KRAAI:   Yes. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 149 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what did it say – what was the date 
of the …[intervenes] 
MS KRAAI:   The meeting was 11 March 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, the actual …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The date of the email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The date of the print or whatever was 
sent to them, the email or whatever, what was the date of 
it?  Was it sent on the 10 t h or 11 t h or is that not clear? 
MS KRAAI:   It is not clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  What did it say to them, 
10 
to the addressees? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is clear on my side, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, what it is it? 
MS KRAAI:   Tapiso send – Tapiso Rappowe(?) sends the 
email on Wednesday 4 March 2015 at 7.08 and she says – 
can you see it now? 
MS KRAAI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She says: 
“Good day all, the meeting is rescheduled due to 
unavailability of people.” 
20 
And then you have the subject and then you have: 
“When?”  
Meaning the date.  Then it says: 
“Wednesday, 11 March 2015 at 10.00 to 12.00.” 
 
“Where”? 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 150 of 163 
 
It says: 
“PD’s boardroom” 
Now what does PD stand for? 
MS KRAAI:   Project director ’s boardroom.  Mr Masango 
had his own boardroom where he discussed his – ja, 
presentation, his own issues that relate to his office. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, so now – so that we understand 
this, 
on 
the 
4 
March 
this 
email 
communicates 
the 
rescheduling of the meeting and gives a new date being 
Wednesday the 11 March at 10.00. 
10 
MS KRAAI:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and that is all that is important 
about that print that is contained there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is it, Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then we go to the one at page 58 of 
your affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 7 of your affidavit but page 58 of 
20 
the paginated bundle.  Yes, Ms Kraai? 
MS KRAAI:   Okay.  Is the one that relates to paragraph 
23, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, paragraph 23 says: 
“With 
respect 
to 
Mr 
Masango 
a 
meeting 
was 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 151 of 163 
 
scheduled on the 16 March 2015 on site at Kusile, 
see the screen shot below, whereby Mr Masango 
told us of his appointment to act as GE Group 
Capital, exactly the position in which he had said to 
me that Mr Koko had told him he…” 
That is Mr Masango. 
“…would 
be 
appointed 
to 
act. 
 
Please 
see 
hereunder a [indistinct] invitation.” 
Yes, do you want to read that, Ms Kraai? 
MS KRAAI:   Thank you, Chair. 
10 
“The meeting was sent out on Friday the 13 March 
which was after the Group Corporate communiqué 
was already out talking about the suspension or 
step down of the four executives where Mr Masango 
requested a meeting with his management.” 
We used to call it steering committee, we meet people 
which is all the discipline within the project.  As you can 
see the meeting took place on the 16 t h – I think it was a 
Monday, if I can recall, where Mr Masango came to address 
us to say he is moving and it was with immediate effect, 
20 
you know?  And if I can recall, which I did not mention in 
my affidavit I think on that day he already had the person 
introducing a guy who was going to take over at Kusile. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say on what day was that? 
MS KRAAI:   On the 16 t h. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 152 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, on the 16 t h. 
MS KRAAI:   The very same meeting when he called of us, 
all – ja, all the managers as per the invite  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MS KRAAI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  So the person he 
was introducing is the person going to act in his position? 
MS KRAAI:   Who was going to act in his position, that is 
correct. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Now if it were to be said that 
you are colluding with Mr Masango to implicate Mr Koko, 
what would be your response? 
CHAIRPERSON:   In other words, Mr Koko has said that Mr 
Masango’s evidence that he had a meeting with him and Mr 
Salim Essa, because that is what Mr Masango has 
testified, on the 10 March 2015 is not true.  He has given 
evidence as to why he says Mr Masango would falsely 
implicate him but he says that at that time he and Mr 
Masango had a -  were very close – they were getting on 
20 
very well, but he says later, and I think it may be 2017. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Their relationship seemed to have 
soured, but then I asked him well Mr Masango says he told 
Ms Kraai about this meeting on the 10 t h in a telephone 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 153 of 163 
 
conversation and – about this meeting why would – and Ms 
Kraai confirms that in her affidavit, why would, then, Ms 
Kraai say that Mr Masango told him something that she 
didn’t tell him and I think Mr Seleka is going there to say, 
well what would you say if Mr Koko’s response is you were 
colluding against him, you were colluding with Mr Masango 
against him because I think he said – didn’t he say, Mr 
Seleka, that he laid some criminal complaints or he raised 
– he made some allegations of misconduct on the part of 
Ms Kraai? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think you must put that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Ms Kraai your counsel has 
provided us with a printout of the transcript of Mr Koko’s 
testimony, an extract from there reads, 
“On 2 March 2017, not only did I, this is Mr Koko 
testifying, not only did I give the Board that dossier, 
but I also gave the Board the names of the people 
at Kusile that I think were in a corrupt relationship 
with Mr Masango and one of them was Ms Nhlanhla 
20 
Kraai, she is no longer working for  Eskom, I do not 
know why.  I was not surprised when I saw her 
evidence with Mr Masango joining what he says is 
their Koko hunt”, 
 
So, my question to you is, if either him or whoever 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 154 of 163 
 
says to the Chairperson, well Chairperson, in this case it’s 
him these people were colluding against me, they are 
joining, as he says their Koko hunt, all what you’re saying 
is not true, it’s only because you’ve joined the bandwagon 
of people who want to bring him down, what is your 
response? 
MS KRAAI:   Thank you Mr Seleka, Mr Chair, I did not join 
the bandwagon, I’m not colluding with Mr Masango.  Based 
on the evidence that I’ve given under the oath to this 
Commission that’s my vision of my own truth and the truth 
10 
only, it’s not based on the collusion with Mr Masango.  I’ve 
provided, I believe the evidence that I’ve provided.  It’s 
sufficient  enough to prove that I’m not colluding with Mr 
Masango, hence I provided the emails and if I can recall, 
Mr Seleka, you even requested the presentation itself to 
prove and the presentation, luckily, because I still had my 
backup taking into account what happened to me within the 
organisation.  So, the presentation, if you can recall, Mr 
Seleka, it was even written 10 t h of March which was, say 
you know, this is the presentation and it’s written NYPD3 
20 
and the appointment also supports my provision of what 
happened. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but do you know anything about 
what Mr Koko is saying there about the dossier, corruption 
at Kusile and that you were part of it? 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 155 of 163 
 
MS KRAAI:   I think, I will speak for what happened to me 
to say, I did not leave the organisation because of – I was 
corrupt, I was never corrupt, and I was also not in the 
corrupt relationship with Mr Masango.  I resigned in July 
2019 or I formally left the organisation in August 2019 but 
what led to my resignation is, on the 1 s t of March, I’m just 
going to be at high level, I got an appointment in my diary 
that there’s a meeting taking place at – because by then I 
was with procurement as a senior manager, primary energy 
responsible for – ja.  Then it was just a – it was like a 
10 
business meeting, then 12 o’clock I go to the boardroom 
then I found my manager who was my manager by then and 
there was a HR person there, HR/IR Person.  Then the next 
thing what happened there, I was told of the intention to be 
suspended which I was shocked, I remember so well, I 
even cried because I was shocked to say, okay – then 
there was just – I’m not going to go to the details but there 
were just two allegations.   
I want to answer the issue of corruption to say, the 
allegation, we’re not talking about corruption.  The two 
20 
allegations we’re talking about a conflict of interest to say, 
I declare that my husband is owning a company because 
my husband is a businessman, but I declare – it’s like 
playing with words, it said, I declare as a Director, I think 
it’s there in the – it doesn’t say, I did not declare it says, I 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 156 of 163 
 
declare as a Director not as a shareholder that was 
allegation number one.  Allegation number two was, I sent 
the document to my husband somewhere in 2017 and even 
the declaration is talking about 2017.  I think for me, I’m 
saying it’s 2019, the organisation stayed with this for two 
years then you come and suspend me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So…[intervenes]. 
MS KRAAI:   Then, during my – just to be brief to get 
where I resigned, then I was subjected to – those are the 
allegations – then let me respond, I deny those allegations 
10 
saying I did declare the document I sent to my husband 
was nothing to do with him getting business in Eskom it 
was just an example of something he requested, you know, 
I did not hide, just to say example, look this is how we do 
things in Eskom, there was no conflict of interest but just 
to go further Chair, then I participated – that was in March 
where they asked questions about my husband, everything 
what happened, you know, and I participated fully, that was 
March.  Then it was quiet…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s and Inquiry now? 
20 
MS KRAAI:   Sort of an inquiry, ja I got called somewhere 
in Pretoria to answer about those allegations, provide 
information, provide everything, then…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Were you being interviewed as part of 
the investigation? 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 157 of 163 
 
MS KRAAI:   Yes, I was being interviewed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not a disciplinary hearing as yet? 
MS KRAAI:   No, it was not a disciplinary hearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS KRAAI:   I was just being interviewed but even that 
interview it became more personal because it was more 
about, I would say, the assets we owned, just to be at high 
level.  How did we, you know, acquire those assets and all, 
you know, it wasn’t more about the two allegations for my 
suspension. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But was Mr Koko, to your knowledge, 
involved in any way in these allegations being brought 
against you? 
MS KRAAI:   I don’t know Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You don’t know? 
MS KRAAI:   I don’t know, I really don’t know.  I 
participated in March Chair, nothing happened, I waited 
and waited and as I said, somewhere in May something 
happened and I said, now it’s a personal attack where a 
video of my house was shown throughout the organisation 
20 
and the allegation was – it was built by a contractor. Then I 
realised that my relationship with Eskom was irreparable, 
hence in July I tendered my resignation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And when you tendered your resignation, 
did Eskom allow you to serve your notice…[intervenes]. 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 158 of 163 
 
MS KRAAI:   They allowed me to serve my notice, I 
left…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, hang on, Ms Kraai, we can’t 
speak at the same time. 
MS KRAAI:   Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did they allow you to serve your full 
notice? 
MS KRAAI:   They did Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They didn’t say after you tendered your 
resignation, okay you don’t need to serve your notice you 
10 
can go? 
MS KRAAI:   No, Chair, they allowed me to serve the 
notice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, was that before they proffered any 
disciplinary charges against you when you tendered your 
resignation? 
MS KRAAI:   I can’t hear you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was it before they tendered any charges 
or proffered any charges…[intervenes]. 
MS KRAAI:   No, no charges were brought against me 
20 
Chair, when I resigned. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KRAAI:   But in my letter I stated that I will continue to 
participate if there are any charges against me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, in your letter of resignation of 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 159 of 163 
 
March, you continued to cooperate with them…[intervenes]. 
MS KRAAI:   Yes, I wanted to continue to cooperate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Even after you were…[intervenes]. 
MS KRAAI:   Even after I’d left the organisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And did they follow-up? 
MS KRAAI:   Nobody contact me, nobody till today. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Up till today? 
MS KRAAI:   Up to today, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you been charged criminally about 
anything arising out of that? 
10 
MS KRAAI:  Nothing, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think one important question is this 
Ms 
Kraai, 
the 
questioning 
– 
the 
people 
who 
were 
questioning you about these allegations they were making 
against you, was Mr Koko part of those people? 
MS KRAAI:   No, no I think – if I can recall, they hired a 
company, was it Bowmans, it was Bowmans. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, so he wasn’t present. 
MS KRAAI:   No, he wasn’t Chair. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So – and you have said, you don’t 
know whether he was behind this? 
MS KRAAI:   No, Chair, I don’t have …[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Would you have any reason to join the 
Koko hunt? 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361 
 
Page 160 of 163 
 
MS KRAAI:   No reason to join the Koko hunt, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you know Mr Koko before the 10 t h of 
March 2015? 
MS KRAAI:   Yes, I know Mr Koko from Generation when I 
was working in Generation at Kriel Power Station and Mr 
Koko was, I think and Engineer at Duvha Power Station, 
but we will have those meetings where he’s there, I’m there 
but I knew Mr Koko and there’s nothing ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Had there been any issues at any stage 
between the two of you before …[intervenes]. 
10 
MS KRAAI:   Nothing that I know of Chair, till today. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before he gave his evidence before this 
Commission and said whatever he said about you, did you 
know 
of 
any 
issues 
that 
might 
have 
been 
there 
before…[intervenes]. 
MS KRAAI:  No, we don’t have any issues with Mr Koko.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright. 
MS KRAAI:   Yes, Chair 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, Chair I think that’s it, are you 
20 
aware of any investigation by, what’s his name, the 
gentleman who’s mentioned by Mr Koko, Paul O’Sullivan? 
MS KRAAI:   Who’s that? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Paul O’Sullivan. 
MS KRAAI:   Okay Who’s that? 
16 MARCH 2021 – DAY 361

ADV SELEKA SC:   You don’t even know the man? 
MS KRAAI:   No, I don’t know who’s that, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay that’s alright.  
MS KRAAI:   I don’t know who’s that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is there anything you could have 
benefited by falsely implicating Mr Koko? 
MS KRAAI:   Me benefiting? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hmm. 
MS KRAAI:   Nothing, Chair, there was no benefit for me, 
even to collude with Mr Masango. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Counsel for Ms Kraai do 
you wish to re-examine.
