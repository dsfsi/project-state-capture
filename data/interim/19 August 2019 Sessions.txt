PROCEEDINGS ON 19 AUGUST 2019 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we ready? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Mr Nxasana will give 
evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  He has returned to give evidence 
following the intervention of several weeks.  May he be sworn? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes let him because there have been quite a number 
10 
of weeks that have lapsed although it is a continuation of his evidence. 
REGISTRAR:   Please state your full names for the record? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Mxolisi Sandile Oliver 
Nxasana. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you have any objection in taking the prescribed 
affirmation? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No I do not. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you solemnly affirm that the evidence you will give 
shall be the truth; the whole truth and nothing but the truth, if so please 
raise your right hand and say, I truly affirm. 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I truly affirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Thank you Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  We have taken the liberty Chair 
and if I may deal with two housekeeping matters? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 3 of 192 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Of transforming your original file 
into a larger file which you have in front of you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Originally we dealt with Exhibits 
EE1 and EE2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  They have been taken from your 
original file and placed in that lever arch file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so everything is here? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  We have added further 
10 
documents.  EE3 is an affidavit of the former President which contents 
need to be commented on by Mr Nxasana during the course of his 
evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  EE4 is a timeline of events 
relevant to the evidence of Mr Nxasana covering the period towards the 
end of 2014 and the beginning of 2015.  Attached to that timeline are 
documents relevant to items on the timeline. They are duplicates, they 
can be extracted from the file or one can go to the original 
documentation which is referenced in the timeline.  And EE5 just for 
20 
convenience is the transcript of Mr Nxasana’s evidence when he was 
recently before the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I wonder whether EE5 should not have been 
separate because it is just to remind – to remind us what is there but 
maybe that can be dealt with later. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 4 of 192 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It can be separated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Quite conveniently. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  We can do that during the 
course of the day.  It is not separately indexed or paginated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay no that is fine.  You might wish to consider 
whether if you do not already have in this bundle you should have – you 
should include a memorandum that I think Mr Nxasana sent to the 
Minister of Justice some time in I think July 2014 or August I am not 
10 
sure where he was asking the former – the Minister of Justice and 
Constitutional Development or Correctional Services to ask the former 
– the President at the time to consider suspending Ms Jiba, Mr Mrwebi 
and Mr Mzinyathi and setting out in very great detail what the basis was 
in his view on which the President should consider acting.  That is 
affidavit – that affidavit is something that is in the public domain.  I 
mean that memorandum.  It was part of the record in the Corruption 
Watch matter, CASAC Matter that went all the way from the high court 
to the constitutional court and then also there may be other documents 
but I think that might be important.  So that is just for you – for you to 
20 
consider. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The memorandum that you have 
referred to is referred to in the evidence. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 5 of 192 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But it is not attached. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  We shall get it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Perhaps today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then there is a second matter 
Chair before we commence.  On the 24 June a Rule 3.3 Notice was sent 
to attorneys whom in our understanding represented Mr Mrwebi, 
10 
Advocate Mwebi and to a private email address.  Then on the 30 July 
on the 31 July and again on the 8 August 3 notices were sent to 
Advocate Mrwebi informing him of the change of date and this 
appearance today on the 19 August.  In correspondence at this time it 
emerged that it was Advocat Mrwebi’s contention that he did not 
receive the original emails sent on 24 June with the 3.3 Notice.  On 
discovering that I asked for the matter to be investigated.  The 3.3 
Notice has now been sent.  The question arises what we do in the 
circumstances but as I am assured by the investigators who have 
collated all the documentation that everything that is going to be said 
20 
by Ms Nxasana is a matter of public record and therefore there should 
be no prejudice but insofar as there is we can hear from Mr Mrwebi and 
deal with it at that stage.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  He knows that Mr Nxasana is giving evidence 
today? 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 6 of 192 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  He does Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  And … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That has been confirmed three 
times. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and Ms Jiba also knows? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We – in respect of Ms Jiba you will remember that 
when Mr Nxasana came to give evidence last time Ms Jiba’s council 
came and we – certain arrangements were made. I wonder whether in 
the meantime there has been any application for leave to cross-
10 
examine Mr Nxasana that has come from Ms Jiba?  Do you know? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No I am not aware of any such 
correspondence.  This is simply the communication from Mr Ngalwana 
that he was not on record as representing but did it simply on request 
at the last hearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  To represent Advocate Jiba’s 
represented by attorneys and communications have been made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  To those attorneys. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  No that is fine. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  May we then proceed? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but maybe before we do so Mr Nxasana you 
expressed a concern last time has it been sorted out in relation to 
being a sole practitioner? 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 7 of 192 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Not yet Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But were you informed of the legal provisions that 
make it possible for any witness appearing before the commission to 
get witness fees? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No I think I saw that Chair 
when I think the Chair made a pronouncement after I had given 
testimony. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  During the subsequent 
proceedings.  I do not know who was testifying on that day. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh but have you had time to put in a request for 
payment or claim or anything? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No I have not.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I told myself I will do that 
after today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay no – no I was just concerned because you 
raised that concern as a sole practitioner. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so – so that can be – you can pursue that in due 
20 
course. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes our information is that the 
particular provision has been communicated to Mr Nxasana but … 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 8 of 192 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  We can talk about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If you… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I cannot remember how far we had gone last time but 
I know that it may be that certain paragraphs were being skipped 
because of the arrangement or whatever.  I cannot remember. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes what we did at the last 
hearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And we will refer again to those 
matters briefly in course of evidence today was to halt just before the 
long adjournment at a stage where there was mention of a recording. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And it was your instruction that 
we should listen to the recording to see if it was of any value and 
added significantly to the evidence.  Our conclusion by the way has 
been that it does not and we do not have to put the recording before – 
before you.  Although there has been a request for it and we will 
provide it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you say you have taken the view that it does not 
admit much? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It does not add materially to 
the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 9 of 192 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  To the actual evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Given because it is indirect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Okay.  But it is available? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It is available if anyone wants to 
hear it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And we have had a request and 
we will accede to that request. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  Okay. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So that was the stage at which 
we halted evidence.  Then there was the intervention on behalf of 
Advocate Jiba and at that stage what we did was we went to the 
constitutional court judgment and dealt with matters already in the 
public domain that were on affidavit and had been adjudicated by the 
constitutional court and we went through the judgment of the 
constitutional court in relation to issues relevant to the evidence and 
then we stopped.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So we are going to go back by 
20 
your leave Chair to page 7 of your statement.  Mr Nxasana would you 
put the microphone closer to you please and perhaps speak up a little. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not too close I think move it back again.  Ja I think 
then it should be fine. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And if we could rewind a little 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 10 of 192 
 
and go to paragraph 33. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Where you said in evidence on 
the previous occasion you were here and you say in paragraph 33 that 
almost immediately after you were appointed you received information 
from two NPA officials that Advocates Jiba and Mrwebi were plotting to 
oust you, do you see that in paragraph 33? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair I see that. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you comment there that this 
information was volunteered to you by these persons of their own 
10 
accord? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Would you tell the Chair please 
of the information given to you by Mr Terence Joubert? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Who is he firstly and then what 
did he tell you? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Mr Joubert is a risk 
specialist at NPA attached to that unit based in Durban at the NPA 
offices in Durban.  I had not met him when he sent me an email.  He 
20 
sent me an affidavit via email.  In that email he told me of the 
arrangement that he had where he was supposed to go and pick up 
Advocate Jiba from the airport. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright before you continue that 
affidavit would you look at Annexure MN1 at page 30 please of the EE1.   
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 11 of 192 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes I see it. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Is that the affidavit that he sent 
to you? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Briefly what did he say 
in the affidavit? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Briefly Chair he said that 
he received a telephone call after arrangements were made for him to 
go and pick up Advocate Jiba from the airport.  He said he got a call 
from Advocate Jiba’s secretary that it was not going to be him Joubert 
10 
who was going to pick up Advocate Jiba from the airport and the 
arrangement was that it was now going to be Colonel W S Mhlongo who 
was going to pick her up from the airport.  Then the – in a nutshell the 
affidavit went on to say that Colonel Mhlongo told Joubert that 
Advocate Jiba had said to him that I am not a good person to be 
appointed as a – as a National Director at NPA and that they must try – 
he must try and get any dirt about me and then I think that was the 
whole plan if I may refresh my memory? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may do that. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If you go to paragraph 36.3 it 
20 
may not be clear on the record. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Who said what to whom 
according to the report made by Mr Joubert to you according to the 
report made by Mr Joubert to you? 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 12 of 192 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  He said Colonel Mhlongo 
disclosed to – to Joubert that Advocate Jiba had told him that she did 
not think that I was the correct person for the job of the NDPP and 
according to Mhlongo Jiba said Colonel Mhlongo – he told Colonel 
Mhlongo that Advocate Jiba and Mrwebi should try – they told him that 
he should try to find some dirt on me as they had done it against Mr 
Stanley Gumede.  Mr Standly Gumede is a regional court magistrate 
based in Durban who was tipped for – to become the National Director 
of Public Prosecutions before a was appointed and this affidavit tells us 
that they – according what Joubert said in the affidavit Jiba and Mrwebi 
10 
were instrumental in making sure that Mr Gumede did not – was not 
appointed at the National Director of Public Prosecutions because he 
was subsequently flooded with complaints and was then investigated by 
the Magistrates commission and the President as a result of that 
decided not to appoint him.  Then the – it also went onto suggest that 
Mhlongo – Colonel Mhlongo disclosed to Joubert that they had 
apparently – they had to follow up to some information that I had 
embezzled or misappropriated clients trust monies which were paid by 
the Road Accident Fund and that information it surfaces during the 
conversation in the recording that the – Mr Pretorius has referred to.   
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In any event this is what Mr 
Joubert says on oath in his affidavit annexed? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you have summarised it? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 13 of 192 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Am I correct? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So what you have spoken about 
now is attested to on oath by Mr Jourbert in Annexure MN1? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you just referred now to the recording. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the recording is it Mr Joubert and Colonel Mhlongo 
who were talking? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and that – that is – that is also in Joubert’s 
affidavit or it – does it – does the conversation go beyond? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No the conversation in the 
recording is that it is Advocate – it is Colonel Mhlongo talking to 
Joubert.  He was not aware that Joubert was recording him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Then Joubert sent me that 
recording. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  In the recording Mhlongo 
20 
was telling him that Jiba wanted to become the – wanted me out of the 
– of my position and that they must work hard and – to get something 
on me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Especially the issue of the 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 14 of 192 
 
Road Accident Fund. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And Joubert had promised 
him to hook him with people from the Road Accident Fund who were 
going to give him information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  About my misappropriation 
of trust funds which something that has never happened.  I have never 
even had a complaint of misappropriation of trust monies arising from 
the Road Accident Fund. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius you have told me what the view is that 
the legal team has taken of the recording.  Unless – unless there is 
some requirement that has not been met procedural requirement in 
terms of people I would like to hear that – the recording. 
ADV JULIE ANN HOWARD:  Sure we have got it available. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja – yes.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I asked for a transcript to be 
made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That should be available as well. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The recording is less direct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Though than the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 15 of 192 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And we have chosen to rely on 
the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But I – I understand that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In the light of what has just been 
said perhaps it is advisable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And we will make arrangements 
to do that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Let us then move on to your 
assumption or belief expressed in paragraph 38 concerning the 
intention that was attributed to you in regard to reinstating criminal 
charges against the former President.  Would you tell the Chair about 
that and what you believe that Advocates Jiba and Mrwebe advised in 
that regard? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair my belief – I 
believed that Advocate Jiba an Mrwebi in running their [indistinct] to 
get me removed from the NPA they also peddled some misinformation 
20 
to the President that I intended to reinstate charges against him.  That 
I say because every corner that I went to I was confronted by the same 
question.  In Durban here in Gauteng everywhere people were asking 
me that they hear that the reason why the President wants me out it is 
because I – he was told that I intended to reinstate charges against him 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 16 of 192 
 
which is something that I had not even formulated the intention to do 
because I had not even seen that docket itself. The docket at the time 
still remained with Advocate Jiba and she had not given the docket to 
me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is now what more than eight months since after 
you had started as NDPP you still had not been given that docket? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Had you asked for it or you did not – had not 
asked for it? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I never even asked for the 
10 
docket. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ys. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I did not even see the 
docket myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Because it was very 
strange because soon after I was appointed it was very strange of the 
President to behave in the manner that he behaved.   Because all of a 
sudden he had an attitude against me he did not want to see me at all 
and I got that from reliable sources.  People very close to him.  
20 
Because everyone was now offering to hook me up with the President 
which I found it very strange and this is what I got from all those 
people who were offering to hook me up with the President.  And some 
of the people were very close to the President.  Ja.  And that is also – 
also – is also evidence by the fact that we will see as we continue with 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 17 of 192 
 
our – with the evidence that the President was reluctant, he did not 
want to see me up to the point that I had to bring an interdict when he 
wanted to suspend me and I insisted that I wanted to see him so that 
we can discuss before he can take this drastic step. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is a – strange why – strange why people would want 
to hook you up with the President when you were appointed by the 
President. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if he needed to discuss anything with you he 
could ask you to see him anytime and if you wanted to discuss anything 
10 
with him you could also request to meet him. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair it was – it was 
very strange and it was a very trying moment for me because soon after 
I got this rumour that the President wanted to – that I wanted to 
reinstate charges against the President and that the President had this 
attitude.  I contacted the person who – who was the legal advisor the 
time Mr Hulley. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And I remember I had to 
chase him also. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  At one point I even – 
because I live in Midrand I had to stop him at the – on N1 that is where 
there is that restaurant the Bridge Restaurant.  We had to stop – I 
stopped him there and I related to him that I am – I have a problem.  
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 18 of 192 
 
The things that I am hearing that the President does not want to see me 
and can you please arrange a meeting that – so that you can meet with 
the President and all the time even when I met him in Durban I would 
also meet him in Durban and I will tell him the same thing.  And he will 
assure me that no the President is very comfortable with your work.  
There is nothing.  Do not worry about those rumours.  And strangely he 
was the same person who then approached me – I was hosting a 
delegation – African delegation of Prosecutors in – in Sandton and he 
was the one who then came that night to break the news that look the 
President has decided to institute commission of inquiry into your 
10 
fitness to hold office.  Without having met the President at that time.  
Then I said well if he has decided – if he has taken a decision there is 
nothing then that I can say.  And that meeting lasted not even more – 
not even more than 5 minutes then we parted ways. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In paragraph 39 Mr Nxasana you 
refer to a meeting between yourself and the President at a flat in 
Durban.  Would you tell the Chair please what happened at that 
meeting? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  It is not a meeting at a flat 
20 
in Durban but I am referring to a flat in Durban here.  At the meeting 
that I had with the President one of the meetings after I subsequently 
had meetings with him that was after I had instituted that interdict.  And 
we agreed to halt the interdict and we then started the negotiations.  It 
is one of the meetings that we had – I had with him where he – after I 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 19 of 192 
 
explained myself to him that I am aware of all this campaign.  I told him 
of all this campaign.  This campaign started before I even came to the 
office after he had made the announcement that I was appointed as the 
NDPP.  Then I remember he said to me you know one of the things 
people have told him about me is that I was meeting Mr Ngcuka, 
Ngcuka – Bulelani Ngcuka who is the first National Director of Public 
Prosecutions and he said the information that he heard is that I was 
meeting Ngcuka at a certain flat in Durban and those people were even 
prepared to go and show him the flat where Ngcuka and I would meet.  
And he then said to me you know [African language] once a person 
10 
mentions the name of that person – of Ngcuka I simply go crazy 
because that person referring to Mr Ngcuka he hates him – Ngcuka 
hates the President. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right so… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  Are you saying that at 
that meeting … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You actually told the President about the campaign 
which you came to know after assuming duty as NDPP that you say was 
being pursued by Ms Jiba and Mr Mrwebi? 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Including - did you also tell him about what 
Mr Joubert’s affidavit says … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or not in detail? 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 20 of 192 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair I would have told 
him as well everything … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And because I - remember 
that I gave him also - the recording I gave him.  The recording that we 
are talking about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you gave him a recording? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  The - the - yes.  The 
affidavit I gave him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Joubert’s affidavit? 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I gave him a - a lever arch 
file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this meeting that you are talking about are you 
able to remember roundabout when it - it was? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair I will not be in a 
position to remember that meeting. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  To remember, ja. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Because - and I - I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the - you brought the application to interdict your 
- I think your suspension? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes before I - before I 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 21 of 192 
 
(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - you brought that application sometime in 2014?  
Is it not? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes.  In 2014, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the second half of the year? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So your meeting with him would have been in 
the second half of 2014? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay, alright.  Thank you. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So if we may just summarise for 
the record Mr Nxasana.  During the latter months of 2014 you met with 
the former President? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  At that meeting you would have 
informed him of details of what you referred to as the campaign to have 
you removed or not appointed as National Director of Public 
Prosecutions? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Amongst those details would 
20 
have been the information given to you by Mr Joubert to which you 
have just testified? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  One of the matters that was 
discussed at the meeting with the President is referred to in paragraph 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 22 of 192 
 
39 of your affidavit … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And it is apparent that the 
President had been told that you had been meeting with the former 
Director of the NDPP - Advocate Bulelani Ngcuka? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you told the President 
correctly as I understand it that this was false information and the 
President was being misled by someone? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair.  
10 
Even more so because even to this date I have never even talked with 
Mr Ngcuka.  We have never even met.  We have never even exchanged 
- explain - pleasantries for that - for that matter. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  What did you conclude in 
relation to the conduct of Advocates Jiba and Mrwebi and your 
appointment or continued occupation of the post of NDPP? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  I am interrupting you.  
Before we get there I am still interested in your meeting with the 
President … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  President. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  At that time.  You are telling these things and - and 
he tells you that he had been told that you were meeting with 
Mr Ngcuka in a flat in Durban? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now you - you said earlier on that you had heard 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 23 of 192 
 
rumours … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That the President had been told that you were going 
to reinstate charges against him. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now the information that the President told you at 
that meeting namely that he had been told that you were meeting with 
Mr Bulelani Ngcuka in a flat in Durban appears to me to suggest that he 
may have been told indeed that you were considering reinstating 
charges against him because remember that Mr Bulelani Ngcuka was 
10 
the NDPP when - who had - was the first NDPP … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And there had been judgments that deal with things 
relating to him and the former President and so on.  So did he indicate 
whether he had also been told that you were considering reinstating 
charges against him or did he not go that far? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No he did not go that far 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  It seems to me that if you - if he - if he 
was told that you were meeting with Mr Ngcuka and if he did not like 
20 
that it is possible that he might have thought that maybe you were 
considering something like that or it may be that as part of the story.  
Otherwise why would it be relevant that he be told that you were 
meeting with Ngcuka?  Are you able to say anything? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That was my conclusion 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 24 of 192 
 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was your conclusion? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That - that was my 
conclusion Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  In fact to me when he said 
that to me it appeared as a confirmation of what I was telling him.  That 
I was - I was aware of the - of the rumour that is making rounds 
because I told him that I am aware of the rumour that is making rounds 
and I know that it is Advocates Jiba and Mrwebi who told him that he 
10 
would - that I intended to in - to reinstate charges against him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you did tell him that … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One - part of the rumours that you had heard … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that he had been told that you were going to 
reinstate charges against him? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes I did tell him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and what was his reaction to that part? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And one of the reactions 
20 
was - was that he was told that - yes - that he was told that I am 
meeting with Mr Ngcuka - with Mr Ngcuka in a certain flat in Durban 
and those people are even prepared to - to go and show me.  In fact 
Chair the whole scenario branded me as a person who was prepared to 
even do anything. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 25 of 192 
 
I remember when we tried to have a - another meeting - a 
follow up meeting.  I think some people picked up that we were meeting 
because the first meeting that we had we had the meeting in the King’s 
house in Durban … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And I think some people 
must have picked up or that information must have leaked that he 
acceded to meeting me and I got the impression that there were people 
who were putting presume on him that he should not meet with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I remember at one point 
that when he was reluctant to meet with me I said to one of the persons 
that was close to him that he must not worry because he - he was told 
that the information that I was told - I was given is that I will come 
there wired and I would be … 
CHAIRPERSON:  To record him? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  To record him and I even 
joked and said to - to that person go and tell him that I do not mind 
meeting him naked because I will not have wires with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So - but when you said to him you had been 
20 
told that he had been told or you heard a rumour that he had been told 
that you were going to reinstate charges against him.  Did he deny 
having been told that? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  He - he did - he neither 
denied nor admit it.  He did not deny or (intervenes). 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 26 of 192 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  He neither denied nor admit it … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But he responded by saying he had been told that you 
were meeting with Mr Ngcuka? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes.  I am meeting with 
Mr Ngcuka. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In a flat in Durban? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Thank you.  I interrupted you 
Mr Pretorius when you wanted to … 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Talk about … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Clearly from the exchange now it 
appears clear that the misinformation concerning the reinstatement of 
criminal charges and the misinformation as alleged in relation to the 
meetings with the former NDPP are indeed related and consistent as in 
misinformation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe just to round this off I am not sure if I 
understood correctly.  When you were speaking to him - that is the 
President - and telling him about the rumour/rumours that you had 
20 
heard did you say - a few minutes ago did you say that you told him 
that you knew who was - who had told him that? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What did - who did you say you knew had told him 
that? 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 27 of 192 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I told him that I knew it 
was Jiba and Mrwebi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what was his reaction to that part? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  He - he did not - he did not 
deny … 
CHAIRPERSON:  He did not say anything? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You make some comments 
expressing your own views about the circumstances in paragraph 40.  
10 
Was there any reason you could not have worked together with 
Advocate Jiba in the NDPP? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair even now - and 
people that are very close to me I always tell them that my view was 
that - and I have told Jiba herself that there was not reason that Jiba 
and I could not work together professionally and I still hold the same 
view even to this day but the - I came to the conclusion that the reason 
why taking into consideration the affidavit deposed to by Joubert and 
the recordings it became very clear to me that Jiba was resentful 
because in that affidavit you will see that Colonel Mhlongo says that it 
20 
is not - Jiba said it is not that he hates me or she hates me or she is 
against me because she did not know me and I always tell people that 
she had not reason to hate me. 
I do not hate Jiba.  She does not hate me because we did not 
know each other but the problem is that she was acting in that position 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 28 of 192 
 
for a long period.  I think of a year and the hopes had been created and 
I then got information that when I was appointed the Minister of Justice 
then Minister Radebe - Mr Radebe - Jeff Radebe - had promised her 
that she will - he was - she would be recommend - he was going to 
recommend her such that I was told that he had prepared a 
memorandum to the President. 
In fact that information I was told by Mr Hulley himself that 
the reason why Jiba is acting the way she is acting is because 
Mr Radebe had prepared an affidavit.  He was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  A memorandum. 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  A memorandum - sorry.  A 
memorandum - a memorandum … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Recommending. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA: 
 
Recommending 
Advocate Jiba for the position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you say this information you were given by 
Mr Hulley. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Mr Hulley himself yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who was advisor to - legal advisor to the President? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  To the President yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Huh-uh.  So am I correct in understanding you 
to be saying that you do not think now and you did not think then that 
whatever Ms Jiba might have done against you in terms of the 
campaign that you say she was pursuing … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 29 of 192 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say it was not because she hated you? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair.  It - it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was simply because she was - she wanted the 
position to which you had been appointed …  
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which she had hoped would be given to her? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what you are saying? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes.  It was not personal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was not personal? 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  It was not personal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  It was not personal at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I think all that she was 
doing in - in fact in the affidavit if - if one reads the affidavit - the 
affidavit of - of Joubert.  He says that Colonel Mhlongo told him that 
Jiba said they will do what they had done to - to Mr … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Stanley Gumede. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  To Mr Gumede. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  She did not know me.  I 
did not know her.  She had no reason really to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Dig.  The only thing that 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 30 of 192 
 
she was interested in and the affidavits even say so that if I am - in 
fact in the affidavit of Joubert he says Advocate Jiba said it was not her 
intention to embarrass me but to get to find dirt against me so that the 
President will take a decision to remove me and she will stand a 
chance to - to get appointed or to continue acting as the NDPP. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  We will come back to that 
after the short adjournment Chair.  We have now a transcript of a 
portion of the - the relevant portion of the conversation … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And we will play it … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And come back to these issues 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  After the short adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  How in your mind did this 
campaign as you have referred to it culminate?  In what event did this 
campaign culminate?  You refer to that in paragraph 41. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  This whole campaign Chair 
20 
culminated in the President taking a decision to establish a Commission 
of Inquiry to look into my fitness to hold office of the National Director 
of Public Prosecutions. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And during your office - period of 
office - as NDPP what was the state of affairs within the organisation 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 31 of 192 
 
and what steps did you take to deal with what you found? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair as a result of all 
what was going on and this campaign I - I felt also that the - some staff 
- senior staff members of staff - NPA staff were being used to - to 
pursue this campaign which I - I found unacceptable and this was - I 
remember there was a - a time also where I listened on Radio 702 a 
guy who was employed at NPA. 
His name was - I think it is Prince Mokotedi - who was then 
telling the - the world that there are two factions at NPA and he then 
said that he and others - I think Jiba and - and Mrwebi and others that I 
10 
do not know - I - I regarded as the Zuma people and I - I found that 
distasteful because I have never belonged to any faction at NPA and I 
was not aware of any faction but what was happening when they were 
using - especially him also he was used. 
Mr Mokotedi in - in my pursuit because at one stage he came 
up with information that he was investigating me of two murder 
charges.  I - I did not even know what he was talking about.  We asked 
him about that and I said to him I did not want to interfere with what he 
was doing because it was part of his investigations but I found - I felt - 
I expressed my concern that I do not think that he - he was suitable to 
20 
conduct an investigation of that nature against me as the head of the 
institution but nevertheless I said to him I did not want to interfere with 
him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Who was investigating? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  It was Mr Prince Mokotedi. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 32 of 192 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Who was later on - I think 
- was later on - he later resigned at NPA when he was hauled before a 
disciplinary hearing.  He resigned and was later on appointed as I saw - 
I read in the - the media that he was appointed as head of the Hawks in 
Gauteng.  I do not know whether he is still the head of the Hawks there. 
Then I - I became worried when members of the - the staff of 
the NPA were also used and I then decided to conduct investigations at 
- at NPA because I felt that this was interfering with the stability of the 
NPA.  I - especially at the senior management level.  I then obtained 
10 
the - the opinion from Senior Counsel, Patrick Ellis - regarding the 
various criticisms by the High Courts and the Supreme Court of Appeal 
against Advocate Jiba, Advocate Mrwebi and Advocate Mzinyathi. 
I also then appointed the Fact Finding Commission headed by 
the retired Justice of the Constitutional Court Justice Yacoob to look 
into the instability and the leakage of information at NPA.  I also 
prepared the memorandum that … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Before you go there. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In relation to the Yacoob inquiry. 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Did you give any instructions to 
Advocates Jiba and Mrwebi? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair I gave instructions to 
everyone.  I gave instructions to everyone to cooperate with the - that 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 33 of 192 
 
inquiry of Justice Yacoob even myself but we - Justice Yacoob found 
resistance with Advocate Mrwebi and Advocate Jiba.  They refused to 
participate despite my repeated calls that they should do so.  They 
flatly refused. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The - the purpose of that inquiry did you say was to 
establish what the causes of the instability and at the NPA were.  Is 
that what you said? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair.  There was 
some instability at the NPA at the time and there were (indistinct) at the 
time and I wanted the - Justice Yacoob to investigate who - who are 
10 
behind all of this and also to come up with recommendations what 
should be - what should happen.  Also including the criticisms 
obviously by the courts - what action had to be taken over and above 
the opinion that one had sourced from the - from senior counsel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you say there were certain judgments of High 
Courts and the Supreme Court of Appeal where the three advocates - 
namely Jiba, Mrwebi and Mzinyathi - different courts of the three had 
criticised some - some of them. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Each one criticising either where maybe one 
20 
criticising all three or criticising two.  Another one criticising another 
one and then the Supreme Court of Appeal and you took these 
judgments.  You gave to senior counsel and asked for an opinion as to 
whether there is anything that should be done about that.  Is that right? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 34 of 192 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You got that opinion … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you asked Justice Yacoob to look at the 
instability at the NPA and the leaks in - of information that was happen 
- that were happening in the NPA and establish the cause there - 
causes thereof and make recommendations as to what should be done 
to deal with the instability and the leaks.  Is that correct? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then you were about to refer to 
10 
a memorandum prepared by Advocate Nel? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What position did Advocate Nel 
occupy at the time? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Advocate Gerhard Nel was 
a legal advisor in my office. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right and was that memorandum 
signed by someone else other than Advocate Nel? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes.  I had instructed - 
(background noise) sorry - I had instructed Mr - Advocate Gerhard Nel 
20 
to prepare that memorandum on my behalf but shortly after he had 
prepared it I left.  I took leave of office - I think - for two days.  I 
appointed Mr Hofmeyr to act whilst I was on leave and Mr Hofmeyr 
signed off the memorandum and sent it to the Minister Mr Masutha. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Is that memorandum 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 35 of 192 
 
attached to your statement? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Would you look at page 34 
please? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see an affidavit on page 34 Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  The memorandum that you 
referred to was that transposed into an affidavit? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair the - the affidavit 
that Mr Pretorius is referring me to is an affidavit that was deposed to 
by Mr Hofmeyr in the High Court Western Cape Division but it refers 
10 
largely on the memorandum that he signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It contains the same information that was in … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  The same information in 
here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the memorandum? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You say in paragraph 43.3: 
“The affidavit Annexure MN2 which appears at page 
34 and following deals with circumstances relevant 
20 
to the memorandum.” 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So do I understand it correctly.  
The 
memorandum 
prepared 
by 
Advocate Nel 
contains 
certain 
information which was taken then by Mr Willie Hofmeyr and then put 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 36 of 192 
 
into his affidavit? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Would you look at page 34?  Is 
that the affidavit you are referring to? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  We will deal with 
excerpts from that to the extent necessary later.  Did you have dealings 
with the General Council of the Bar concerning the conduct of 
Advocates Jiba, Mrwebi and also Mzinyathi? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair based on the 
10 
opinion that I received from Senior Counsel, Patrick Ellis.  Then I 
referred correspondence to the General Council of the Bar asking them 
to investigate the conduct of the - of its members - Advocates Jiba, 
Mrwebi and Advocate Mzinyathi based on the criticisms levelled by - 
against them by the various courts. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And still enumerating the steps 
that you took to address the instability within the NPA as you describe 
it. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Did you take any steps to 
20 
improve the relationship between yourself and Advocates Jiba, Mrwebi 
and Ms Mzinyathi? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair.  I - I did.  I 
remember even at one stage I tried to - really to - to be open to them.  
I tried to reach out to them.  Advocate Jiba at one stage I even 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 37 of 192 
 
suggested to her that perhaps we -we just needed to go out just me and 
her.  Out for - for tea or coffee and just discuss and have a frank 
discussion about ourselves and Advocate Mrwebi I tried my best to 
reach out.  I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well what - what was the response from Ms Jiba 
before you go to (intervenes)? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No she smiled. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  She just smiled Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  She smiled and she … 
CHAIRPERSON:  She - she did not … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Say anything other than just smile? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  She did not say anything.  
She just smiled, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA: 
 
Ja. 
 
Advocate 
- 
Advocate Mrwebi I - I remember we even had a - a trip to London.  
There I would without fail every morning come to the breakfast, go and 
20 
greet him personally.  We would eat together with other members of - of 
the - that were … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The delegation. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Of the delegation and he 
will sit alone.  I will approach him.  I will exchange pleasantries.  I tried 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 38 of 192 
 
to accommodate him but to my dismay I - I thought that things were - 
were okay - were getting on very well but then I subsequent learnt that 
he castigated one of the delegates - delegation who - who he had seen 
in my company around there. 
He castigated him for sucking up to me and I - but I did not 
even taken an issue about - about that but I continued to treat him as a 
- as a professional and also as a colleague.  At no stage did I shout at 
him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you approached him every morning while you 
were in London at breakfast and you would greet him and as you say 
10 
exchange - I do not know - exchange pleasantries.  Well that is how 
you put it but what was the response from him? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA: 
 
Chair 
- 
Chair 
Advocate Mrwebi is such a very nice person.  Such that I would ask 
myself what would - what really would happen after I thought we were 
getting on very well and after I would hear some stories - things that he 
was doing together with Advocate Jiba because when he was with me 
he would be a very nice person. 
Same as Jiba.  They were the nicest persons ever and 
Advocate … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  In front of you? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  In front of me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Well Advocate Mzinyathi is 
exceptional.  He is such a nice person also and I - I remember I told 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 39 of 192 
 
him that I - unfortunately this is what I - I have to do.  We worked very 
well because … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You mean Advocate Mzinyathi? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA: 
 
Ja. 
 
With 
- 
with 
Advocate Mzinyathi.  We get on very well with him.  He is such a - a 
very humble very professional person.  We had … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  I do not know why I thought Advocate Mzinyathi 
was a - a lady. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No, no.  It is a - it is a … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is a male. 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  He is a - the Xhosa they - 
they are named Sibongile.  It is a … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I think … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  A male.  He is a male, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I - I think that must be … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Because of the first name, 
ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I am … 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Ja.  People confuse.  They 
think … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  They think it is a female. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think now I understand. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 40 of 192 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  It is actually a male, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because you are right.  With - I mean isiZulu and 
isiXhosa are very close … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And isiXhosa that is where 
the problem lies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And some of the names of people are the same … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you would find that a particular name … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  In isiXhosa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Exist among the Zulus … 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And exist among the AmaXhosa and but … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And particularly Sibongile. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But with - with AmaXhosa that name would be for a 
female or would be used … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And both … 
CHAIRPERSON:  For both. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  For females and females. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whereas with AmaZulu … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  It is only for females. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  It would only be for males. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Like Fikile … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then Sibongile.  For those two among AmaZulu 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 41 of 192 
 
would always be female. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Female, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No it is a name … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I think that must be what also made me think … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was a female but … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  In fact … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said it is a man, ja. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  In fact he is the Director of 
10 
Public Prosecutions in the North Gauteng Division. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Advocate Mzinyathi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Yes.  So you say he was - he is a very 
nice person? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  A very nice person.  We 
had … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you got on very well? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  We got on very well.  Even 
to this day.  We are getting - we get on very well. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Even today? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA: 
 
Ja, 
but 
I 
think 
he 
understand - he understood that it is - it is the job that I had to do … 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 42 of 192 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And - and I do not pass 
any judgment … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  On any of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I was merely doing my 
work.  I think he understood that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  At no stage did he feel that 
10 
I - I was painting him in anyway. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes but you - you say - you say Mr Mrwebi and 
Ms Jiba at least in your presence they were also very nice people? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  They were very nice.  They 
presented themselves … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is just that afterwards you would hear other things? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Other things, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair is this a convenient time?  
We will … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Make preparations to play the 
recording. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  We will take the short adjournment and 
resume - is it fine if we resume at half past or should we make more 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 43 of 192 
 
time with the preparations that you are going to make at tea? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I would like to look at the 
relevant extract again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So perhaps an extra five 
minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So we will resume at 25 to 12. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
10 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, are you ready? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    DCJ we have – we engineered 
the bundle, EXHIBIT EE5 is no longer the transcript of the evidence 
given previously by Mr Nxasana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    It is on your desk, or on your 
table in a separate folder. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    EXHIBIT EE5 now is the 
transcript of the recording at page 197 and following, 197 is simply an 
affidavit of the person who did the transcription. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    And the transcription I am 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 44 of 192 
 
informed of the conversation there is other material which is irrelevant 
on the recording, it is at page 201 and following.  I must say Chair that 
I have looked at it during the adjournment and for the life of me I do 
not follow the references but if Mr Nxasana can help then he can help. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is in the transcript? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    In the transcript. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    I haven’t listened to the 
recording, but I am assured that the transcript accurately reflects what 
was said in more than one language on the recording. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    So in accordance with your 
request it is not long Chair, perhaps we can play the recording. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    You could indicate, or the 
witness could indicate where it needs to be stopped for commentary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay no that’s alright, my inclination is I don’t 
know how long – how long is the ...[intervenes]  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    It is a few minutes, four 
minutes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  My inclination would be to listen to the whole of it, 
unless either your or Mr Nxasana wishes that we stop somewhere for 
some clarification to be given and then if we do not have that then the 
clarifications could be given afterwards. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Yes, well in the light of that 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 45 of 192 
 
Chair it also is my own preference that we hear the whole thing and 
then ask Mr Nxasana to explain where the confirmation is that he 
attested to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Because I – the references are 
obscure so I do not see it, maybe he will be able to explain that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Mr Nxasana have you followed 
what the Chair has now said. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    We are going to play the 
recording. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes Chair, I was 
following. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    We are going to play the 
recording from beginning to end, that recording of the conversation 
between Mr Joubert and Colonel Nklongu[?]. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Once that has been concluded 
20 
you can tell us where in that recording there is confirmation of the 
parts of the evidence that you gave. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Okay, I will do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Because quite frankly it is not 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 46 of 192 
 
immediately apparent from the transcript, okay. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, and if in order to – if it would assist to later on 
play certain parts of the recording that can be done as well, okay 
alright. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    So in short we will play the 
whole recording, we will ask you to confirm what was said as you 
testified earlier, or not said, as you testified to earlier, and then if you 
require certain portions to be replayed as the Chair indicates we can 
facilitate that.    
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   No problem Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
AUDIO RECORDING PLAYED 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry, yes because I could not hear earlier on and I 
am not sure if I can hear now the actual words, I just hear some noise 
and then somebody speaking but not the actual words.   
VIDEO RECORDING PLAYED 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the conversation already with Mr Joubert?  I 
seem to hear some Zulu, what appear to be Zulu words. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    The conversation yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
AUDIO RECORDING PLAYED 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, just stop, just stop.  I cannot hear a word, I 
hear that there is somebody speaking, maybe more than one person.  I 
do not know whether it is the noise or what it is but the clarity that is 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 47 of 192 
 
supposed to be there so that I can hear the actual words being spoken 
is not there.  I do not know whether it is because maybe I am at a 
certain distance away from the instrument or what.  I do not know if 
other people are able to hear? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Well certainly I cannot Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, Mr Nxasana are you able to hear from where you 
are, other than what you may have listened to it privately?  Are you 
able to hear now? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   I can now hear, I do not 
know whether perhaps that is because I ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because you know ...[intervenes]  
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   I know the – ja, but we 
have not come to the actual conversation relevant to the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, do you think when we get there it might be 
clearer? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Perhaps, I do not know, 
that is why I was signalling to him that he must just fast forward it, and 
I will tell him where. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay maybe let him fast forward to where the 
real conversations starts that we are interested in and let’s see if one 
20 
might be able to hear that, and the technician maybe will bear in mind 
what I have said, maybe there is something that needs to be done 
technically to make sure one can hear.  I think we did have something 
like that when I was  hearing evidence or a recording relating to the 
Waterkloof landing, and I think I took five minutes adjournment and 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 48 of 192 
 
when I came back we would hear better, I could  hear better.  I don’t 
know if that is the same problem.  Let’s start and let’s see whether 
there was improvement. 
AUDIO RECORDING PLAYED 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just stop.  Are we already on the conversation?  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Chair I am informed that the 
recording contains a portion where Colonel Nklongu[?] was speaking 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  To somebody else? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    In a different conversation. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Whilst Mr Joubert was as it 
were holding on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    So perhaps we can get to that 
portion, it’s not long and see if at that portion where the conversation 
takes place it is clearer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, let’s get to the real conversation we are 
interested in. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Do you know where it is?   
20 
AUDIO RECORDING PLAYED 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Just stop.  This portion Chair 
appears at page 2003, in other words in the transcript of the 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  On the transcript, 2003. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 49 of 192 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    MS0N2003 at line 15. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Carry on please. 
AUDIO RECORDING PLAYED 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just stop.  Just stop.  There is very little improvement 
between what I was hearing earlier and what I am hearing now.  I still 
cannot hear a full sentence, I don’t know whether has your hearing 
improved Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   No, no better or worse than 
yours Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   But it may be the recording 
itself, which could be technically enhanced.   It may be how the 
recording is being played. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Because it is being played over 
speakers over there and I am not sure it is coming across on the 
speakers and perhaps over the long adjournment we can deal with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja.  And I wonder whether people at the back are 
hearing better than us, they shake heads, it looks like really nobody 
20 
hears, so there is no point in continuing with it.  Maybe either the 
current technician or whoever may assist can look at what needs to be 
done technically to make sure that we can hear. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Yes I suspect it may have 
something to do – may have something to do with how it is being 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 50 of 192 
 
broadcast from the recording, because I do not hear it over all these 
speakers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, maybe, so the technician can look at that and 
definitely maybe after lunch we can revert to it if he or she, I don’t 
know, I can’t see if it’s a he or a she if he or she needs assistance from 
colleagues who are technicians perhaps you can do that, because it 
would be – I would love to hear it if it is at all possible.   
 
Okay, I think we will have to continue and other people will try 
and look into that issue with a view that if possible after lunch we could 
try again. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Mr Nxasana can we go then 
back to page 10 of your affidavit? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   At paragraph 43.6. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   You have told the Chair what 
steps you took to address what you refer to as instability within the 
NPA.   
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And you have told the Chair in 
particular about your relationship with Advocates Jiba, Mgwebi and 
Mzinyathi in this regard? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    That is correct Chair. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 51 of 192 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Did you make any requests to 
hold a meeting with the President and what was – if so what was the 
purpose of those requests?  You deal with that in paragraph 43.6 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes Chair as I have 
indicated earlier I was more concerned about what I was hearing, the 
rumour that was going around and I wanted to see the President.  I was 
not getting any joy, I made all attempts, including to contact Mr Harley 
as I have indicated, which I managed on one instance I managed to 
meet him on N1 in Midrand and subsequently he then I think he wrote 
me letters to where he was telling me that he intended to institute an 
10 
inquiry or maybe before that I think I received letters where I was 
asked to comment by certain particular dates the comments that are 
attributed to me, which are in the media amongst other things, my 
involvement in a matter where I was charged and acquitted of murder. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   If I may ask you to pause there 
Mr Nxasana, I think you are going ahead, and if you could go back 
please to paragraph 43.6.   In other words before we deal with the 
charges that were contemplated against yourself I would like you just to 
first deal with the contents of paragraph 43.6 and following. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Oh, okay I understand.  
20 
Yes I also made requests to the President as well, after I had to send 
him 
the 
memorandum 
I 
requested 
him 
to 
consider 
instituting 
disciplinary action, to taking disciplinary action against Advocates Jiba, 
Mgwebi and Mzinyathi. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   So your decision was to 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 52 of 192 
 
institute disciplinary action against Advocates Jiba, Mgwebi and 
Mzinyathi? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   You requested a meeting with 
the President to discuss this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry Mr Pretorius, I think the two of you got 
mixed up, you said his decision was to institute disciplinary action and 
he said yes but I think his decision was to request the President to 
institute not for him to institute himself. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because the power vested – was vested with the 
President, is it not Mr Nxasana? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You could not institute any disciplinary action 
yourself? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes, no not myself, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   You are quite correct Chair, 
your decision was to initiate a process. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   As you say in paragraph 43.7 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Of course you could not make 
the final decision. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes.    
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 53 of 192 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And you wished to discuss this 
with the President? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    With the President yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Was there any response to your 
request? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Chair the response that I 
received if my memory serves me well I think I received a response 
from the Minister of Justice, Mr Masutha. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   What did he tell you? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Basically he threw the ball 
10 
back at me and asked me to explain what measures I had taken in 
addressing all those issues, and I wrote back to him and indicated that 
I had caused a memorandum to be submitted to him for onward 
transmission to the President and we are still waiting for the President 
to intervene and take a decision to institute the disciplinary action 
against the advocates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think it will be important, maybe after lunch Mr 
Pretorius, you know the sequence, the sequence and the actual 
correspondence dealing with those things is attached to either Mr 
Hathorn’s affidavit or Naidoo in the corruption ...[indistinct] application, 
20 
they can be, I think they could be very useful in terms of the terms of 
the correspondence as well.   So I think he can continue and give 
evidence and then during the lunch break maybe he could look at that 
affidavit.  I think those records are available that is something that was 
– that went up to Constitutional Court. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 54 of 192 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then – so he can give evidence about it and then 
later on we can go into the correspondence. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Yes we have the affidavit here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   To put it to Mr Nxasana, but 
perhaps to get copies and speak to him about it over the long term. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, get copies, yes, yes and the annexures because 
the memorandum also is there, it is attached if I recall correctly. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   We now have that memorandum, 
10 
and that can also be presented. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Do you recall a meeting at 
Emperor’s Palace, a meeting of what you refer to in paragraph 43.8 as 
the NPA meeting? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Well did that meeting take place 
in March 2014 or March 2015?  Or when did it take place?   You say 
here it took place in March 2015. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Chair I think it would have 
20 
been in March 2014 if I am not mistaken. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Alright. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   I think that is an error. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is 43.8 is that where you are? 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 55 of 192 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  So that 2015 you say must be an error Mr 
Nxasana? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   It must be an error yes, if 
I look at paragraph 44 what follows thereafter it must have been 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   But I stand to be 
corrected. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Did Minister Masutha say 
anything to you about your request to the President to intervene, as 
you have testified? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes Chair, he told me that 
the President had agreed to intervene, and to intervene as I had 
requested, but he never did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, if this is March 2014 am I correct in 
understanding that that meeting at Emperor’s Palace that is referred to 
at paragraph 43.8 would have happened after you had requested the 
President to consider suspending Ms Jiba, Mr Mgwebi and sending the 
20 
memorandum which gave him the basis, or what you thought was the 
basis for him to act?  
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so that was much earlier, I think earlier on I 
may have said July, August, so that was much earlier.  It was much 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 56 of 192 
 
earlier than that, it was before March, the request for the President to 
do something? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   I think Chair I can verify 
this information about the Emperor’s Palace when was that meeting.  I 
remember the meeting vividly but I cannot recall the date now but at 
that meeting ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but also it may be that because paragraph 43.8 
talks about the President having, the Minister saying to you the 
President had agreed to intervene.  Maybe did you at some stage 
simply request him to intervene and that request being separate from 
10 
requesting him to consider suspending Ms Jiba and Mr Mgwebi and 
instituting disciplinary proceedings against them.  Could those have 
been separate and different requests at different times? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   It was at different times 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   The meeting at Emperor’s 
Palace I think it was a workshop organised by the – I think it dealt with 
corruption, it was organised by the NPA, I cannot remember which unit.  
I attended that meeting and Minister Masutha was also present at that 
20 
meeting but what he was confirming to me is that after I had submitted 
to him the memoranda and the – and everything the file wherein I had 
asked the President to consider taking disciplinary action against 
Advocates, Jiba, Mgwebi and Mzinyathi that was his response on that 
day, that the President has finally agreed to intervene and was 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 57 of 192 
 
considering my taking action against the Advocates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So does that mean that you are clear in your own 
mind that the meeting at Emperor’s Palace took place after you had 
requested the President to consider suspending Ms Jiba and Mr Mgwebi 
and after you had submitted a memorandum which you believed set out 
the basis for him to act? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright, thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, let’s just place your 
evidence now in context Mr Nxasana, as I understand your evidence in 
10 
relation to the conduct of Advocates Jiba and Mgwebi and Advocate 
Mzinyathi you had to rely on information provided to you by other NPA 
officials, and that is why you obtained a memorandum from Advocate 
Nel and Mr Willie Hofmeyer? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Right, Chair insofar as it is 
necessary to deal with that detail that will be dealt with directly, it just 
seems to me that the purpose of what you are saying to the Chair now 
is to say that based on information you had received, which we can 
place before the Chair in due course, you had taken a decision to at 
20 
least initiate disciplinary proceedings against the Advocates involved. 
MR MOXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And you had requested a 
meeting with the Minister – with the President to deal with that? 
MR MOXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   That is correct Chair. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 58 of 192 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Right.   And that is the 
background to the evidence which you are going to give now as to what 
happened to you at that stage? 
MR MOXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   That is correct yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   So Chair insofar as the content 
of those memoranda and affidavits are concerned they are there, but 
the direct evidence should perhaps be given by others because it does 
implicate people quite seriously. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well while you were asking questions I was thinking 
about the sequence of events that we talked about a few minutes ago 
10 
and I see he on some of the things about the sequence he is not – his 
recollection might not be good that might be because he might refresh 
– need to look at documents to refresh his memory.  I was wondering 
whether we should not break for lunch a little earlier than normal so 
that he gets a chance to look at the correspondence which is attached 
to Mr Hawthorne’s affidavit and when we come back he can then deal 
with those very easily – there is correspondence that is important.  It 
gives the dates of his attorneys writing to the Presidency and the 
Presidency to the President’s legal advisor writing to her.  I think it is 
very important and a usual sequence of events.  As I say it is 
20 
something that is already in court records in a matter that went up to 
the – corruption matter and the CASAC matter. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  We will do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So maybe we – maybe we should look at breaking at 
half past twelve to give more time for lunch and looking at the 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 59 of 192 
 
documents and then when we come back then we can just [indistinct]. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Just to establish the sequence? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The sequence and the… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes that does not obviate the 
need to get the direct evidence from elsewhere 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no it does not.  It does not.  It is just that it is 
important I think from the perspective that he made a certain request as 
the NDPP to the President that the President should consider taking 
certain action against certain people within the organisation.  If he had 
the power I am sure he would have taken the decision himself.  And 
10 
what we then see is certain sequence of events and correspondence 
and then the timing can be important because if all of that happened 
before and then no action was taken against the two but instead action 
was taken against him. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That sequence is – can be very important.  What did 
the President know about both him and about Ms Jiba and Mr Mrwebi 
and – and when the President is given a chance to deal with this matter 
he may have to indicate, justify, taking action against the one and not 
the other and so on.  So it is important that he can deal with it properly. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes what we know so far Chair is 
what is contained on pages 9 and 10 that memoranda, affidavit, 
documentation was prepared. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And transmitted to the Minister 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 60 of 192 
 
for… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  For onward transmission to the 
President. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That was accompanied by a 
request for meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And an expectation that it would 
be followed up. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And that the report we now 
presume is in March 2014 but it may be necessary to clarify that; that 
the President had agreed to intervene – failure to intervene and then 
steps taken.  That is the sequence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  As I understand it but I 
understand your concern is that there is further evidence in relation to 
that sequence in the affidavit of Attorney Hawthorne. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And we will put that to the 
witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Over the long adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no that is fine.  Thank you. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 61 of 192 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  What happened then – let 
us assume for the moment and we will check this over the long 
adjournment Mr Nxasana.  Let us assume that the Emperor’s Palace 
meeting took place in March 2014. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Where you were informed that 
the President has agreed to intervene as requested or proposed by 
yourself? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You say that there was a failure 
10 
to act in accordance with what you had been told would happen. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe – maybe – sorry Mr Pretorius.  In the – in your 
affidavit you have used the word intervene is that because that is what 
you were told by Mr – by the Minister that the President had agreed to 
intervene or did he tell you that the President agreed to initiate 
disciplinary – a disciplinary process but you – in your affidavit you have 
simply said he agreed to intervene or is that the words that was used 
by the Minister?  Because then if that is the words that the Minister 
20 
used I want to understand what your understanding was of what 
intervening in that situation meant? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair I – although I cannot 
recall precisely what the Minister said but my understanding during our 
discussion was that he – he said to me the President had acceded to 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 62 of 192 
 
my request and he was going to act.  That is the [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that is what he said. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  What then happened a 
few months after March 2014 in July 2014 and this is now direct 
evidence from yourself? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I think in July 2014 I then 
received communication from the President.  I remember it was very 
late at night.  It came through my email.  He was advising me that he 
10 
had taken a decision to institute a commission of inquiry into – to 
determine my fitness to hold office as the National Director of Public 
Prosecutions. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  When you say you were 
informed; how were informed?  Was it directly by the President or was 
it through his legal representatives? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No it was through his 
personal assistant I cannot recall the name of the – of this young man 
– his personal assistant he sent me the email and I received it on my 
handset.  I responded by acknowledging receipt of it and noted the 
20 
contents. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And in July that same month 
towards the end of the month did you receive another communication? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes I did receive another 
communication from the President also from the same guy.  I have 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 63 of 192 
 
forgotten his name but he was his personal assistant or he was aide – 
his aide advising me that the President intended suspending me 
pending the inquiry and that the terms and the dates and time and 
venue of the said inquiry was going to be communicated to me in due 
course.  And I was then called upon to make submissions why I should 
not be suspended pending the said inquiry.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Now how – how long after the Emperors Palace 
meeting was this more or less when you were told that the President 
intends – was going to suspend you? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair I – I … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot remember? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I cannot remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay maybe after lunch it should be possible after 
lunch because there is correspondence in the record about all of that. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Would you go to page 135 
please.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say page 135? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The top page of course.  Not this – not the other one. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I am sorry MSON046. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  46?  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You have that?  Top right hand 
corner Mr Nxasana there is some letters followed by numbers. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  It is page? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  46. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 64 of 192 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Oh page 46.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It is Annexure MN3. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes I have it with me. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What is this document? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  It is a – it is a letter dated 
the 4 July 2014 which I received from President Jacob Zuma.  It is a 
notice of institution of inquiry.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And it is dated 4 July 2014 ne? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then if you would go to page 
10 
48 please.   
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Page 48 is a letter I 
received from President Zuma dated the 30 July 2014 titled Notice of 
intention to suspend in terms of Section 12(6)A of the National 
Prosecuting Authority Act 32 of 1998. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Paragraph 2 of that letter 
reads: 
“You 
are 
no 
doubt 
aware 
that 
the 
National 
Prosecuting Authority is an important constitutional 
institution in the administration of justice and that 
20 
maintaining public confidence in the institution is of 
necessity.  In consideration of maintaining the 
integrity of the National Prosecuting Authority and in 
particular its 
good 
administration 
I 
am giving 
consideration to suspending you on full pay pending 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 65 of 192 
 
the finalisation of the inquiry to which I have 
referred.” 
It reads further: 
“The inquiry will examine your fitness to hold the 
office as National Director of Public Prosecutions 
having regard to whether.” 
And what was contemplated by the President at that time in relation to 
the subject matter of the inquiry.  You can read if you wish. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  It was – he said: 
“The inquiry will examine my fitness to hold the office as 
10 
National Director of Public Prosecutions having regard to 
whether 
1. The criminal convictions which I possess for violent 
conduct. 
2. Reported comments in the media are unbecoming of 
a National Director of Public Prosecutions divisive 
and have the effect of bringing the National 
Prosecuting Authority into disrepute. And lastly 
3. The lack of disclosure of the facts and circumstances 
of prosecutions which I faced are consonant with the 
20 
contentiousness and integrity of an incumbent to the 
office of National Director of Public Prosecutions as 
required by the Act.” 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Then I was required to 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 66 of 192 
 
furnish the President with written representations in this regard by no 
later than 1500 hours or 1600 hours on Friday 1 August 2014. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That is a day or so later? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Two days later.  But if you could 
go back please.  It is not our intention to hold Trials-Within-A-Trial but 
did you have criminal convictions for violent conduct? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I had criminal convictions 
for assault common. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Had these been 
10 
disclosed? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then reported comments in 
the media.  Do you know to what comments reference was here being 
made? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  To this date Chair I do not 
know what the President was referring to as the media comments 
because we – I personally wrote a letter asking him to furnish me with 
the particulars of what he meant about the media comments and he 
failed to do that. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And the alleged lack of 
disclosure of facts and circumstances of prosecutions.  And I presume 
that is something different from convictions which you faced.  Do you 
know what was being referred to here? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  In the same letter Chair 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 67 of 192 
 
before I applied for an interdict against the President we had made that 
request to the President to explain – to give me particular – particulars 
of what he meant about that matters which he did not do.  And I still do 
not know what he was referring to.  In his response I think he said I 
should know what he was referring to in a nutshell. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The assault that you – you talk about that you had a 
conviction for, is that right? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When had that conviction happened or – and when 
10 
had the incident that gave rise to it happened? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair it was in I think in 
1986 at Nongoma. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And I remember even when 
I – I applied to – to register for my articles of clerkship as an attorney. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That was one of the 
requirements because I disclosed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  But I even went to 
Nongoma charge office and Nongoma court and I could not find those 
records – the records because of the – the very … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The lapse of time. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Because of the lapse of 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 68 of 192 
 
time yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So this was the reference to violent conduct insofar 
as it related to your conviction for assault.  It related to something that 
had happened what more than 30 years ago or previously as at the time 
you were being asked about this. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is what one could 
only assume because the President was not forthcoming about what he 
meant about my violent conduct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so you never got information from the President. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  What he… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Giving you full information whether what you were 
thinking he was talking about was exactly what he was talking about. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes.  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You speculated? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As to what it might refer to? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  At one point he in the 
same letter he referred to my previous convictions of assault and then 
in another point he referred to my violent – to my previous convictions 
involving violent conduct then I did not know what he meant. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was talking about? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  He was talking about 
hence I wrote to him and asked him to give me full particularities of 
what he meant and he failed to do that. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But I think what the Chair is 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 69 of 192 
 
asking about in your knowledge. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Was there any other conviction 
or prosecution other than the one that you recall? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Those are the only 
convictions that I – I knew and the prosecution of the murder charge for 
which I was acquitted in 1985 that is one that I know.  And there was 
also reference to an incident where I was – which I disclosed as well 
which he also asked me about where I was stalked by police in – I was 
driving a car and they stopped me and they said I was driving 
10 
inconsiderately and the matter was – I did not even appear in court it 
was not placed on the roll.  That was in I think 2013 or 2012 before I 
was appointed. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright leave that one aside for 
the moment. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And let us restrict ourselves to 
convictions or prosecutions.  Is it your evidence that the only incidents 
which could have formed – feasibly formed the subject matter of such 
an inquiry by the President or such a statement happened you say 
20 
when? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  In 1985. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  1985. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  1984 and 1985 ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then let us go to paragraph 50 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 70 of 192 
 
please.  Under the head my right to a fair hearing you deal at length 
with your response to the notice of suspension. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Or the notice of intention to 
suspend or the notice to consider suspending you. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr Pretorius what page is that? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  12. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  I think maybe we should take the 
adjournment now. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Ja we have dealt with 48. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  By reference to the annexure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no that is fine.  I think we should take the 
adjournment now so that he can get a chance to look. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At those affidavits and the correspondence and then 
we can then resume at two. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Chair if I may just raise 
one issue before we adjourn. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  On pages 12 through to page 17 
the statement summarises procedural matters in relation to the 
suspension and the Cassim Inquiry.  It is our view that as neither the 
suspension nor the inquiry ever took place. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 71 of 192 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  These are procedural matters 
that we can summarise very briefly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are asking if you can do that before we take the 
adjournment. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. Let us do that. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No, no not before after. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh after. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I have just… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  I mean if you wanted to do it 
now we could do it but then add more time after two before we resume. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No Chair it will be very, very 
brief. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  With your leave. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I do not intend to go into any 
detail. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine.  That is fine. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then we will start at page 18 
again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay no that is fine.  We will take the lunch 
adjournment then and we will resume at two o’clock. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 72 of 192 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  To report back 
in relation to the recording.  The engineers have tried their best to 
produce a better more audible version without success.  The fault lies 
10 
with the recording itself.  There are ways of enhancing recordings but 
those must be done technically and we will try to do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
Secondly 
Chair 
we 
have 
established that the date in paragraph 43.8 - as originally placed in 
that paragraph - March 2015 is the date at least intended by the 
witness Mr Nxasana but what we would like to do following your advice 
and have recast is EXHIBIT EE4 which is the timeline … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And we have … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh did you say in regard to 48 - 43.8 that is the date 
that he had intended? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So okay.  So it was not an error … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 73 of 192 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of what he intended to say? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  2015 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  He intended to say and he will … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Tell us about that in due course 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In relation to the timeline. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Mr Nxasana would you go to 
EXHIBIT EE4 which is after the EE4 divider in your file?  Do you have 
that? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes I have it. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That is a timeline recast by the 
legal team during the long adjournment and we have attached relevant 
documentation from other sources.  There are various sources for this 
timeline and I will refer to them in due course including … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The affidavit of Hawthorn … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In the corruption watch matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Or is it the freedom and the law 
matter?  If you could go to the timeline at the point where it says item 1 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 74 of 192 
 
- do you see that? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes I see that Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  On 4 July you were informed by 
the former President that he had taken a decision to institute an inquiry 
into your fitness to hold office. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That has been your evidence? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  On 7 July you obtained an 
opinion from Advocate Ellis SC.  Is that correct? 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  That is - that is on page 
37 of your papers.  The source of that information - that date is the 
affidavit of Mr Hofmeyr.  It is referred to on page 37.  Do you see that? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Does that accord with your own 
memory? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And in that opinion Mr Ellis 
made certain recommendations including a recommendation that 
20 
Ms Jiba be provisionally suspended pending an inquiry into her fitness 
to hold office.  The recommendation continued that a criminal 
investigation for perjury be opened against Ms Jiba and finally a 
recommendation was that the findings against Ms Jiba should be 
referred to the General Council of the Bar for their consideration. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 75 of 192 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That - that is correct 
Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then on 18 July 2014 the 
memorandum signed by Mr Hofmeyr was forwarded to Minister Masutha.  
That memorandum appears annexure - as an annexure to this timeline 
Chair at page 1-8-4.2-4.  It is a memorandum dated 18 July 2014 from 
Mr W A Hofmeyr acting  
CHAIRPERSON:  Can you find it Ms (intervenes)? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  As National Director of Public 
Prosecutions. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Addressed to Mr Masutha. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think he is still looking for the memorandum - I 
think. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 1-8-4.2-4 at the top.  MSON1-8-4.24. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Are you at the timeline? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  (No audible reply). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Go to the timeline. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes.  There is the timeline. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It is just a few pages on from the 
timeline. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Can you find it?  Page 1-8-4.  You must not be 
confused with the bigger numbers where there is 5-8-8 which is bigger. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 76 of 192 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No I have got - I have got 
the timeline.  I am battling to locate … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  It is a - it is a memorandum on the letterhead of 
the NPA.  That page is also marked 5-8-8 in bigger numbers than 1-8-
4.24.  Maybe somebody should … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I am on it, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Go and assist him. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I found it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I found the memorandum. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair is suggesting that you 
ignore the bold type clear numbering and you look for the other 
numbering. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have found it? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Ja, I found it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Whenever there is any reference - whenever 
Mr Pretorius refers to page numbers and whenever I do the same we 
will be using the MSON page numbers … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Oh yes.  I - I see … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But we will not keep on saying MSON.  We will just 
say 1-8-4 point whatever … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or 1-8-4.  Okay.  So ignore the bigger page numbers. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Okay Chair. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 77 of 192 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes I have - I have got it. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  You have it.  The origins 
of that memorandum - firstly is that the memorandum forwarded by 
Mr Hofmeyr to Mr - to Minister Masutha on 18 July 2014? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If you go back to page 37 - now 
we are back in the affidavit of William Andrew Hofmeyr which starts at 
page 34. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Page 37.  Yes I am back at 
10 
37. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You got that? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Paragraph 16 reads: 
“It was on the basis of this opinion …” 
That is the Ellis SC opinion. 
“…that the NDPP instructed his legal advice and 
Mr Gerhard Nel to draft the confidential ministerial 
memorandum dated 18 July 2014.” 
You have testified to that? 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  “The memorandum was 
approved by the NDPP …” 
That is yourself? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 78 of 192 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  “…shortly before he 
departed on leave to two days subject to a few 
minor changes that he required.  Since he regarded 
the matter as urgent he requested me to sign the 
memorandum once the changes had been made as I 
would be acting as NDPP during his absence.” 
Correct? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And so that is how Mr Hofmeyr 
came to sign this memorandum as Acting NDPP but on your instruction? 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That memorandum may - and - 
and was it sent with your approval and on your instruction? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  On my instruction yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The memorandum on page 37 
paragraph 17 made a number of conclusions and recommendations: 
“Namely that the NPA and the NDPP should report 
the adverse findings to the Minister and President.  
Recommend that the President should consider to 
provisionally suspend Ms Jiba and Mr Mrwebi and 
20 
Ms Mzinyathi pending an inquiry into their fitness to 
hold office.” 
Over the page, page 38: 
“Refer the matter and findings to the courts to open 
criminal investigations for perjury against the above 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 79 of 192 
 
mentioned members of the NPA and four, submit the 
findings of the courts against the three members of 
the NPA to the General Council of the Bar.” 
So those were the recommendations made by your office, 
approved by you and instructed by you to be forwarded to - to the 
Minister of Justice at the time - Minister Masutha? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  So to go back to the 
timeline.  On 30 July 2014 - and I am still on the first page of the 
timeline - you received a notice of intention to suspend from the former 
10 
President.  Do you see that? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is (intervenes). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You have testified to that.  The 
references are there. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes I see that. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  On 30 July item five over the 
page - Minister Masuthu - Masutha rather - acknowledged receipt to 
Mr Hofmeyr of his memorandum dated 18 July. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes I - I recall that. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then on 31 July 2014 
20 
Constitutional Court Justice Yacoob was appointed to Chair a fact 
finding inquiry into allegations of unethical conduct by senior members 
of the NPA. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Correct? 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 80 of 192 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes it is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then on 1 August 2014 - and we 
will come to this in due course - you made representations in reply to 
the notice of intention to suspend? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to clear up something.  I think earlier on before 
lunch I may have understood your evidence to be to the effect that you 
had communicated with the Minister - Minister Masutha and with the 
10 
President or maybe only with the Minister with a view to him conveying 
that to the President your concerns about the conduct of Ms Jiba and 
Mr Mrwebi and that you had asked that the President should consider 
suspending them and initiating disciplinary processes and that instead 
the President instituted the inquiry against you and started considering 
the possibility of suspending you but when I look at this timeline it 
appears that actually I may have misunderstood and you might have not 
understood my question. 
It appears that the President notified you of his decision to 
institute an inquiry and the - your approach to the Minister and to the 
20 
President happened after and not before he initiated an inquiry.  Is - is 
that - do you - do you see that I am talking about? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes I see what you are 
talking about Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 81 of 192 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes.  I think Chair because 
of the lapse of time … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  But we have now verified 
as the Chair has - had - had requested … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  With the specific dates … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  But in a nutshell on - I 
think the - the conspectus of my evidence was that when I approached 
10 
the President to institute disciplinary steps against these individuals 
what happened was the other way round.  He instituted - he instituted 
the - the Commission of Inquiry against myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but the - the point I am - I am trying to make and 
I just want to make sure that we understand each other is that whereas 
that was my understanding of what may have happened.  It is clear 
from this timeline that on 4 July 2014 - that is item 1 … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say:  the former - former President Zuma 
informed you that he had taken a decision to institute an inquiry in 
20 
terms of Section 12(6) of the NPA Act. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and 7 July there is an - there is the Ellis 
opinion. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 82 of 192 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so I do not know whether the Ellis opinion had 
been requested prior to 4 July but this is when it seems to either have 
been received by yourself or have been signed by counsel - the 7 t h - 
7 July after you had been informed that the President had decided to 
constitute an inquiry against you. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I think the - I think the 
opinion was signed on 7 July (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of July yes, yes.  Did you recall when you had 
requested it?  Was it prior to 4 July or was it after that?  Is that 
something you can recall or not really? 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I - I cannot recall … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot recall, okay. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Of that, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - and then the appointment of Justice Yacoob 
happens much later - end of July and so on.  So - so what I am saying 
is the impression I get now when I look at this timeline is different from 
the impression I had before lunch. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  The impression I had before lunch was that you had 
already approached the President asking him to take action or consider 
20 
taking action against Ms Jiba and Mr Mrwebi … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And while you were waiting for him to actually do that 
what you got was that the President decided to take action against you 
as it were in terms of - by way of an inquiry and considering 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 83 of 192 
 
suspending you but I am - I am saying that it does appear that the 
President’s decision to institute an inquiry came first before you asked 
him to take action against Ms Jiba. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that correct/ 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That - that is the position, 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  No I thought it is important to clear … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It up. 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I think what was happening 
before this there were these communications by way of letters where 
the President called upon me to respond by a particular date … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  About the - the media … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA: 
 
And 
the 
- 
and 
the 
allegations of (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Security clearance? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Security clearance and - 
20 
and the criminal cases (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  To place that in its proper 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 84 of 192 
 
context and perhaps to allow the Chair to consider the - the full 
context.  Before 4 July had you any contemplation about taking action 
or initiating action against Ms Jiba and others? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair before then I would 
have contemplated getting legal opinion and also appointing the Fact 
Finding Committee headed by Justice Yacoob. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  In that regard what would 
you say to the suggestion that your decision to initiate action against 
Ms Jiba, Mrwebi and Mzinyathi was motivated and prompted by the 
receipt of the notice by you from the President of 4 July to institute an 
10 
inquiry to your fitness to hold office? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That was not the position 
because that was a decision that was taken after a special Exco 
meeting arising from what was happening.  Especially the matter 
involving the criticisms of these advocates.  I came to learn about it in 
the media and we were very much concerned.  I remember that we had 
a special Exco to deal with these issues and as Exco we took a 
decision that this is the way to - to deal with these issues. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  We have not learnt of 
that Exco meeting.  Do you know more or less when that would have 
20 
taken place?  We can get a minute of that Chair. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  You can get a - a minute of 
that. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Just make a note. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I think it may be important to - to have sight of 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 85 of 192 
 
when the brief was sent to counsel for an opinion on whether the 
criticisms of Ms Jiba and Mr Mrwebi in various judgments warranted 
disciplinary action.  Partly for the point that Mr Pretorius is mentioning 
because it may be - we do not know - it may be that the position may 
be taken that when you realise that the President was contemplating or 
had decided to constitute an inquiry against you your response was 
then to effectively say well I cannot be the only one to be dealt with. 
Let me ask him to also deal with Ms Jiba and Mr Mrwebi.  
There may - there may be nothing wrong with that but it - it might be 
different from a situation such as the one I thought was the case before 
10 
lunch where you say to the President and to the Minister here is 
evidence of what I believe is misconduct by Ms Jiba and Mr Mrwebi.  
Take action and then no action is being taken against them. 
Instead action is being taken against you.  So that is - that is 
what we need to look at to - to understand but I think you may even 
after today need to refresh your memory on - on everything.  So that 
later on if there is anything you might wish to clear up in your evidence 
which you might have said because without the benefit of refreshing 
your memory on other things then you can clear up.  Okay. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I understand. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that alright? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That is the only comment in 
relation to that that we now know is that … 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 86 of 192 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The opinion was received on the 
7 t h … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of July. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Of July … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No he said it was signed on the 7 t h - I do not know. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Of - of July. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I - I found - I found 
something here Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is on page 1-8-4.2-7. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1-8-4.2-7?  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  In paragraph 12. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, yes.  You want to read that? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
“On 
26 June 
2014 
the 
National 
Prosecuting 
Authority briefed Advocate Patrick Ellis SC to finish 
20 
a legal opinion on the following questions:  a, the 
disciplinary procedures available respect of senior 
personnel at the NPA; b, whether disciplinary steps 
ought to be taken against Advocates Jiba, Mrwebi, 
Mzinyathi and Mboyni (?) primarily as a result of 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 87 of 192 
 
the findings made in the judgments referred to in 
paragraph 10 above and the judgment of Gorven J 
in Booysen vs Acting National Director of Public 
Prosecutions and Others.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  At least that seems to indicate that at least 
asking for - briefing counsel for an opinion happened before you were 
informed of the President’s decision to institute disciplinary - an 
inquiry? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you for that Mr Nxasana.  
I was going to comment on the improbability of senior counsel finishing 
an opinion in three days but I thought the better of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the - the one thing which I want to ask arising 
out of this is whether you are able to say Mr Nxasana who other than 
yourself and the state attorney involved in the matter and counsel may 
have - who else may have known that you had sought counsel’s opinion 
on this matter?  Would there have been anybody else that knew before 
4 July? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes because the request 
20 
went 
under 
the 
- 
the 
hand 
of 
the 
CEO 
then 
Ms Karen 
- 
Advocate Karen Van Rensburg was the CEO of the NPA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That would be the only other person or was the matter 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 88 of 192 
 
handled in such a way that a lot of other people may have been aware? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And advocate - Mr Hofmeyr 
also was aware, Advocate Gerhard Nel was also aware. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But as far as you know Ms Jiba and Mr Mrwebi did not 
know? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  When? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before 4 July? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I will not - I will not … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would not know? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have no basis to … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright; but at that stage your communications 
with the - with the Minister or the President would they have included 
you saying anything along the lines that you were contemplating 
seeking an opinion about disciplinary action against them or not really? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair I also stand to be 
corrected.  I cannot remember but I - I want to believe that the 
20 
meetings that we subsequently - that I subsequently held with the 
President those meetings took place before the - before July or - or 
June. 
I think it was around May if I am not mistaken and I want to 
believe that during our interaction I had informally told him - not in 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 89 of 192 
 
writing - that he has been misled and in fact it is the very people who 
are driving this agenda before I sent the memorandum that I asked 
Gerhard Nel to send to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but my question was specifically about whether 
the President may have known from been told by you before 
4 July 2014 that you could be - you could be wanting to have 
disciplinary action taken against Ms Jiba and Mr Mrwebi. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That - that is what I am 
saying Chair.  That is what she could have known. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That during our interaction 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but - but how would he have known?  Did you say 
so specifically to him?  How would he have known that is what you were 
contemplating? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair although I cannot 
recall now but I want to believe that I have reason to believe that I - I 
must have communicated that to him during our - during our 
engagement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay, thank you. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If we could go back to item five 
on 30 July 2014 it appears that Minister Masutha told Mr Hofmeyr that 
he had received Mr Hofmeyr’s signed memorandum of 18 July 2014.  
That is apparent from the documentation.  We have not got a reference 
there yet but that is item five … 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 90 of 192 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In the timeline.  Item six reads - 
item six according to your own affidavit … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  I think I have lost the page 
for the timeline now. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  It is - it is behind divider 
EE4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, thank you.   I have got it.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Page 2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I have got it. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If we could go to item 6 on 
31 July Justice Yacoob was appointed to Chair a Fact Finding Inquiry - 
inquiry - according to your affidavit? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then item 7 on 1 August 2014 it 
is apparent that you made representations in reply to the notice 
contemplating your suspension? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then on 8 August former 
President Zuma wrote to you to justify his refusal to provide particulars 
20 
of the allegations against you? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And on 8 August in addition 
Minister Masuthu - Masutha rather - my apologies - acknowledge 
receipt of 18 July 2014 Hofmeyr memorandum in correspondence with 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 91 of 192 
 
you? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In other words he had already 
acknowledged receipt to Mr Hofmeyr himself on 30 July but in 
correspondence with you on 8 August … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  With me on - on 8 August.  
That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  He said he - he had received it. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Then on the 8 t h of August item 
10 
10 you submitted a founding affidavit in an application in the High 
Court to compel the former president to provide you with further 
particulars pursuant to his intention to hold an inquiry? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    You deal with this in your 
affidavit, then on the 11 t h of August 2014 you replied to Minister 
Masutha, now we should perhaps deal with that 18451.3. Chair I 
hesitate to make reference to the big bold numbers but there’s a yellow 
or an orange marker in the documents following the timeline, headed 
“letters”.  Now it’s at EE4, just before EE5 You’ll see an orange sticker, 
20 
is there no orange sticker in your file, oh dear…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you got an orange sticker on your file Mr 
Nxasana? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    The first one with letter written 
on it. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 92 of 192 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   I found the letter that you 
are referring me to. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Have you? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    18451.4? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes with the bullet number 
618. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the page number, 184? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    58.1, it’s not in any sequence 
10 
Chair because there are other documents intervening but if one goes to 
the 184 numbers…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’ve got 184.51.1 without a yellow sticker. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Yes that is the one, that is the 
letter addressed to you by Mr Masutha, do you see that? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes I see that one. 
CHAIRPERSON:    The letter is signed by the Minister on 8 August 
2014. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Do you see that? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes I see it. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Now in that letter, Minister 
Masutha says to you, as I read it, 
 
“I 
acknowledge 
receipt 
of 
your 
memorandum, 
or 
the 
 
memorandum of 18 July 2014 making certain recommendations 
 
to the President”. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 93 of 192 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius when we have difficulty locating these 
documents better to read what is there otherwise the one who looks for 
it later on thinks It’s the wrong one.  My one says something like, 
 
“I am in receipt of a memorandum”, 
 
That’s the first sentence are we looking at the…[intervenes]. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    We’re looking at the same one. 
CHAIRPERSON:    It’s just that you said, “I acknowledge” and I didn’t 
see acknowledge and begin to think that well, later on somebody will 
say I’m looking at the wrong letter, it doesn’t say. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Yes perhaps the description in 
the timeline is incorrect.  Yes but in that letter dated the 8 t h of August 
2014, Minister Masutha says that he has received the memorandum 
signed by Willie Hofmeyer. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    And he notes that, that 
memorandum recommends that he, that is the Minister approached the 
President with the recommendation or request to suspend Advocates 
Jiba, Mgwebi and Mzinyathi? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   That is correct. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    But he says to that before he 
does that he wants certain information from you? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   That is so. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    And you reply to that letter at 
184.51.3 to say,  
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 94 of 192 
 
 
“We hadn’t had an opportunity to met, let’s meet”. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   That’s correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    And then over the page and on 
the 12 t h of August the Minister says on page 184.51.4, 
 
“I note that you want to meet but give me the information 
 
anyway”. 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   That is so. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    So that exchange of 
correspondence takes please between the 8 t h and the 12 t h of August 
2014. 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Then on the 17 t h of September 
2014, you submit a memorandum to Minister Masutha? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes responding to what he 
had raised in his letter dated the 8 t h of August 2014. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    That memorandum is at 184.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There’s something wrong with that numbering isn’t 
it? Earlier we had 184.49 and so on and then much later we have 
184.1.  Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    These were all paginate and 
20 
numbered in the break Chair but 184.1 is in fact towards the end of the 
bundle 
in 
EE4. 
 
It 
should 
have 
been 
marked 
with 
a 
– 
perhaps…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja if we don’t correct it now, then in the transcript if 
we refer it to - could cause confusion. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 95 of 192 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes it is number 184.1 – page 
184.1 but it’s out of sequence and we can easily put it back into 
sequence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in the meantime how will you refer to it? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:     By it’s page number which is 
indelibly marked on the page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  184.1? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:     Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think that is what will cause confusion, or you mean 
you will take it back to the right place later? 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:     Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Would 
that 
work, 
I’m 
just 
trying 
to 
look 
whether…[intervenes]. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:     It should because anyone 
reading this bundle will go to 184.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so it was just located in the wrong part of the 
bundle? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:     Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:     Well I’m sure the person who 
20 
did it will say it’s correct but… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if that will work then that’s fine because then 
referring it to page 184.1 would be fine, okay, alright it looks like that 
should be fine. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:     I had hoped that the stickers 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 96 of 192 
 
would appear there but for some reason they didn’t. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:     Anyway do you have 184.1? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:     Do you have it Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I have. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:     It’s immediately after this 
correspondence that we’ve just referred to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I know I found it a long time ago. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:     Good thank you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it was just the page numbers that we would use 
that I was concerned whether it wouldn’t cause more confusion using 
them. I think if it’s just a…. [intervenes]  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:     I understand Chair, you’re 
fairly more skilled and experienced in finding page numbers than our 
witnesses and myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright, let’s continue. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:     184.1, you’ve got it 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I’ve got it Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:     That’s the memorandum that 
20 
you’ve just referred to dated 17 September 2014.  How did – if we can 
just deal with it briefly, how did it come about that you then sent this 
memorandum to Minister Masutha? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    That was because after 
Mr Hofmeyer – after the memorandum that was signed off by Mr 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 97 of 192 
 
Hofmeyer was delivered to the Minister. The Minister in his letter, in his 
response in his letter dated the 8 t h  of August 2014 raised some issues 
then I wrote back to him on the 11 t h of August and said to him, I think it 
will be better for us to meet and discuss a lot of issues pertaining to 
NPA because the Minister had been appointed for about – for a period 
of two months, he was in office for two months without – we had not 
met by then but the Minister then insisted, I think that, in principle 
understand that we had to meet but he nevertheless felt I must 
respond, hence I then responded by way of that memorandum dated  
the 17 t h of September. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:     Alright and you then sent this 
memorandum? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes and in that 
memorandum I basically reiterated the contents of the memorandum 
that was sent off by Mr Hofmeyer. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:     Okay if we can continue with 
the timeline for the  moment, we are going to come back to one or two 
of these issues in due course, on the 3 r d of November 2013 against 
item number 14 you then, through your attorneys and  Mr Halley of your 
agreement to a mediation process. 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:     Now, generally as a matter of 
principle how do you understand mediation, does it involve any 
concession on a part of a – or admission on a part of a person entering 
into a mediation process? 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 98 of 192 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Concession in… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:     Well did you make – when you 
agreed to a mediation process, did you intend to concede anything? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:     What was the purpose of the 
mediation process? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  If my memory serves me 
well I think there was a suggestion, I think it was – from the 
Presidency, I cannot remember if it was from Bonsiwe Mokene, one o 
the legal advisors after we’d had those meetings, that they’d suggested 
10 
that there should be a mediation but I think in the tone of their letter 
suggested that the mediation should be confidential and we responded 
by saying I agree in principle that a mediation should – to avail  myself 
to a mediation but that it should not be confidential because I 
understand it. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:     The point is a somewhat 
different one, the issue which we will come to in a moment is whether 
you required or requested that you be allowed to vacate your office. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No I did not make that 
request. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:     I’m not saying that you did, 
I’m saying that’s an issue that we will look at in a moment, it’s an issue 
of some controversy. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:     By agreeing to settle, the 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 99 of 192 
 
dispute between yourself and whomever else, even on monetary terms 
can it not be implied that you were, in fact, requesting to leave? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Not at all. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:     Why not? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Because I made it clear, I 
think you’ll see in the correspondence also – the exchange of 
correspondence in our meetings I made it very clear because there was 
this attitude that I must leave office and I remain steadfast, saying that  
there’s no reason for me to leave office because I still consider myself 
fit and proper to hold office, and during the exchange of the 
10 
correspondence between my attorneys and the Presidency we made it 
very clear – I made it very clear that we have never, one, initiated the 
discussions, two, even the discussions around the settlement of 
whatever issue that was there and there was no way, we maintained 
that I still – there’s no basis in law and in fact for me to relinquish my 
position as the National director of Public Prosecution, but then with 
the right that if they want a soul, and I made it clear in that letter, I 
think the letter dated the 10 t h of December 2014, we made it clear that 
unless then I am paid the  remainder of my contract then I will 
relinquish the position as the President would want me to vacate my 
20 
office. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Let’s go back to the mediation, who came up with 
the idea of mediation? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   It was – I wold say the 
Presidency, I think the legal advisors. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 100 of 192 
 
CHAIRPERSON:     It was the Presidency? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:     And you think it was the President’s legal advisor? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes in one of the 
correspondence. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes and you made reference to Ms Mokene, Bonzi 
Mokene, she was a - was she a legal advisor in the Presidency? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     And then of course we know you did refer earlier on 
to Mr Hulley, was he also a legal advisor to the Presidency? 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   He was also a legal 
advisor to the President. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes but as between the two legal advisors and 
maybe any others that there may have been there, are you clear as to 
which one came up with the idea of mediation or are you not sure? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  The letters …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:     Oh was it in a letter? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  It was in a letter because 
we responded in a letter, we responded and referred to specifically the 
letter that he had sent to my attorneys. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay so I’m sure that letter I’m sure will be found. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:     If you would go to page 185 in 
EE4.  That is again towards the end of that bundle, page 185, you’ll see 
the letter of 3 November 2014 there. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 101 of 192 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Do you have it there? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   I have it with me/ 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   It reads: 
“We refer to the telephonic conversation between the writer 
hereof and yourself on the 30th of October 2014”, 
And the writer is Mr Mabundo of your attorneys, correct? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:      
“We confirm that you have raised concerns about the 
inordinate time the matter is taking and that your view the 
10 
delay is attributable to our client.” 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes and the letter is 
addressed to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  To Mr Hulley. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Yes, and Mr Hulley is there 
acting on behalf of the President, I think we know that. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:     The President at the time.  
You, Mr Mabundo says he was out of the country, he says further: 
“We have however urgently and subsequent to our telephonic 
20 
conversation consulted with client who has instructed us to 
respond as follows.” 
It appears that this letter was written in response to issues raised in a 
telephone conversation of the 30 t h of October 2014, correct? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Oh yes I see that here. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 102 of 192 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    And the response is as follows: 
“Our client is willing to participate in the mediation process as 
your client has proposed.” 
Is that a correct summation of events? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    It states here that 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I’m – Mr Pretorius I mean you want him to 
confirm whether it was Mr Hulley’s client who had proposed the 
mediation because – you haven’t finished the summation, you wanted 
10 
him to confirm whether that’s the correct summation. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Alright perhaps let me go 
through all four first.  Point 2: 
“Although client would have preferred to have the matter 
resolved by way of inquiry he is of the view that it is in the 
best interests of the NPA to have the matter finalised 
expeditiously by exploring the mediation route.” 
Point 3: 
“It should be put on record that our client does not in any way 
waive any rights he has in law by agreeing to explore the 
20 
mediation process and as such the proposals of the mediator 
shall not be binding on him unless expressly agreed to in 
writing.” 
And then the letter continues over the page with a request to initiate 
the mediation process.  Now the Chair asked you directly whether the 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 103 of 192 
 
mediation idea or proposal emanated from you or from the side of the 
President or the President’s advisors and you responded as you did but 
does this assist you? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes it does because it 
says that in paragraph 1 that I was willing to participate in the 
medication process as proposed by the President. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Independently of this letter do 
you recall where the proposal came from? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes, because I never 
proposed any mediation. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you say it could only have come from the side of 
the Presidency? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Of the Presidency, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm, okay.  
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   In fact the letter is very 
clear that I would have loved to have the matter resolved by way of an 
inquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, is that later in the letter? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   It is in paragraph 2 of the 
letter on the first page: 
20 
“Although client would have preferred to have the matter 
resolved by way of an inquiry he is of the view that it is in the 
best interests of the NPA to have the matter finalised 
expeditiously...” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 104 of 192 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    
“...by exploring the mediation process.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  So is that a suggestion that your prize ...[intervenes]  
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that let’s go to the inquiry? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But because ...[intervenes]  
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   They had proposed 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  They proposed mediation. 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were willing to participate in it. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   As long as the process 
would be expeditious. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    The next letter which is an 
important letter apparently in the sequence of events is against item 9 
on the next page of the chronology and it appears at page 187 
immediately after the letter of the 3 r d of November and that’s the letter 
of 10 December 2014 and it’s addressed by your attorney Mr Mabundo 
20 
to Bonisiwe Mokene, who is that, Bonisiwe Mokene? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Is that the person you referred 
to earlier? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes as the legal advisor 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 105 of 192 
 
to President Zuma at the time. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Right, and it says: 
“We refer to the above matter and particularly to the meeting 
we held on the 8 t h instant [that would have been the 8 t h of 
December] at the residence of the President, wherein it was 
discussed, advised and agreed as follows.” 
Now before we go there were you at that meeting? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes I was at that meeting. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    What happened at that 
meeting, briefly? 
10 
MR MOXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes I was at that 
meeting. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   What happened at that meeting, 
briefly?   Well firstly who attended? 
MR MOXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   At the meeting was the 
President, myself, Mr Mabunda and the professional assistant was 
there, the attorney, Ms Shelley – I have the surname, Ntandani, 
something like that ja, at that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, whose attorney was that? 
MR MOXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   She worked in the office 
20 
of Mr Mabunda and she was involved in this matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Mabunda himself was not there? 
MR MOXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Mr Mabunda and herself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh the two of them were there. 
MR MOXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes the two of them 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 106 of 192 
 
were there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Now this ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  And what was discussed, I think that was the 
question, briefly what was discussed at this meeting? 
MR MOXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Chair it was the same 
issue about the inquiry or not the inquiry, the same issue that if I put 
my foot down that if I – if they want me to leave because I still believed 
it was not necessary, there was no reason for me to leave, they must 
be prepared to pay me for the remainder of my contract, of my period 
10 
which it was ten years, and then we started making some calculations 
and at that meeting I was then asked to provide Bonisiwe my leave 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  That’s Ms Mokene? 
MR MOXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   That’s Ms Mokene yes.  
I was asked to provide – we were asked to provide them with my leave 
days and also I think my tax, something like that, my tax details and my 
salary details. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   This discussion that took place 
and the settlement proposal from whom did the settlement proposal 
20 
come, this meeting was taking place at the residence of the former 
President. 
MR MOXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Chair I remember that 
by settlement proposal, a reference to the figures or that we settle if I 
may just get clarity. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 107 of 192 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I think maybe Mr Pretorius you might wish to, I 
think you are talking about the fact that subsequently there was a 
settlement proposal made. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Well I will tell you why I asked 
the question. 
MR MOXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Because it is apparent from the 
contents of this letter that a settlement proposal was made to you 
based on certain legislative provisions in the NPA Act. 
MR MOXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   In other words it was made to – 
well you tell the Chair what was the basis of the settlement proposal 
made to you. 
MR MOXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Chair the ...[intervenes]  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Let me be fair to you, read the 
letter first and then answer the question for the benefit of the Chair 
please, because it goes to certain allegations that I still need to put to 
you emanating from the President himself.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the same letter of the 10 t h? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   The letter of 10 t h of December. 
20 
MR MOXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes thanks. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Have you read the letter? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry Mr Pretorius before Mr Pretorius ask you a 
question based on that letter let’s go back to the meeting of the 8 t h of 
December and this letter seeks to confirm some things emanating from 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 108 of 192 
 
that meeting. 
MR MOXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who had come up with the idea that there should be a 
meeting held on the 8 t h, or who came up with the idea of that meeting?  
Do you remember or is that something you cannot remember? 
MR MOXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   I think the idea of the 
meeting would have come up with I think it was communication between 
Mr Mabunda, my attorney, and Mr Hulley. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, it may have been through discussions among 
them. 
10 
MR MOXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Through discussions 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  What was the purpose of that meeting as 
you understood it?  Why was that meeting called as you understand the 
position? 
MR MOXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Chair my understanding 
was that we were still going to discuss the issue of whether or not, 
because we are trying to convince, to persuade the President, that is 
our view, we are trying to persuade him that there is no need for him to 
hold the inquiry in the first place, and there was no need for me to 
20 
vacate the office of the NDPP, whilst on the other hand it was clear 
from the meeting that they had already made up their mind that they 
wanted me to leave. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now [excuse me] that – that – I was about to ask the 
question.  Prior to this meeting had – did – had anybody from the 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 109 of 192 
 
Presidency either the President himself or those who were acting on his 
behalf had – had they said or anybody said they wanted you to leave 
your position of NDPP either in a letter or in discussions?  In other 
words I am trying to see what was the – to the extent that these may 
have been negotiations aimed at resolving something or some dispute.  
What was the dispute that was sought to be resolved? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If there was a dispute? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair except to say 
according to my recollection whenever I – I spoke to President Zuma 
10 
we would speak and I would convince him I would put my side of the 
story to him informally and I would persuade him I will tell him that he 
was misled but at the end of the day he would seem to be getting to 
understanding me but then at the end would then come say something 
about [African language] I think but you – I think we must just settle 
this you have to leave and you have to sort out your issues.  The 
issues with my legal – with my legal team of you vacate the office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did that ever come from him? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And are you sure about that? 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I am sure about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That he said he wanted you to leave? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And how – in terms of the timeframe are you able to 
indicate around about when he may have said that for the first time to 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 110 of 192 
 
you? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair although I cannot 
remember the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it still 2014 or was it in 2015?  Was it around mid 
– was it after – was it after he had notified you that he was – there was 
going to be an inquiry or was it even before? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Even – even before Chair 
because in our engagements before he even sent that letter dated July 
2014 where he indicated that he intended establishing a commission of 
inquiry.  I was under the impression that he had changed his mind.  He 
10 
was no longer going to institute because of the interactions that we had 
together.  Then it came as a surprise when he then somersaulted and 
changed his mind and sent me that letter that he – he – he intended to 
– to establish the commission of inquiry.  Then when we engaged and 
there was these engagements with my attorneys and Mr Hulley and 
Bonsile and himself I think we tried even in those meetings to persuade 
them that there was nothing really that warranted me to leave the office 
and we pointed out that even at the inquiry I will – the inquiry will not 
even find that I was not fit and proper to continue holding office.  But 
then I think the – the decision must have been taken because at the 
20 
end we would talk and talk but at the end then he will say but you know 
I think you – you have to – to step aside and you must then formalise 
the issue of how you are getting paid and you will meet with the – with 
my legal team to discuss that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So are you saying that discussions or the – either 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 111 of 192 
 
discussions in plural or the discussion singular where the former 
President said that happened before the – you received the letter 
saying there was going to be an inquiry into your fitness to hold office? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes in – in some of the 
discussions before that and even after that Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Even after the letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So where he – he said you need to leave. 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what was your response? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair I – I remained 
steadfast and I remained – I always told him that there was no reason 
for me to leave and I told him that I kept on repeating myself that this 
was a campaign against me by these individuals and they misled him 
and there was no reason for me to leave and even at the inquiry I told 
him – I told the President even the inquiry that they have – he had 
constituted I told him that that inquiry will not find anything against me.  
That… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  It was not going to find 
that I am not fit and proper to continue holding the office.  And there 
were negotiations also.  We would meet even after he had issued these 
letters we also met.  I remember we met again like we – I say we met at 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 112 of 192 
 
Mhlambandlovu that was after the – the 4 July. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see the one scenario is that the discussions 
could have been at least at a certain stage been about whether or not 
you were fit to hold office. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In order for the President to decide whether there was 
a need for an inquiry.  That is the one scenario.  Another scenario and 
that in terms of that scenario the President could have adopted the 
attitude that I do know what the outcome of the inquiry will be if the 
inquiry is held but if you want to persuade me that you are fit and – to 
10 
hold office and there is no need for an inquiry I am happy to listen and 
if you persuade me I will terminate the inquiry.  That is one scenario.  
Another scenario may have been that he may have been saying I 
believe you are not fit and I believe that the inquiry will find that you 
are not fit to hold office in which case you will have to go.  Rather than 
us reaching that point why do you not – why do we not find another 
way.  That – maybe that is another one.  Maybe there is a third one 
which may have been I want you to leave but let us rather agree on the 
basis on which you will leave.  So are you able to say categorically 
which one of those fitted into his situation? 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair what I am certain of 
during our discussions with President Zuma it became clear to him that 
the information that which he conceded to me that the information that 
he was given about me he was misled.  But I do not know why then he 
decided because I do not know who he was talking to and who are 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 113 of 192 
 
these people that were pressurising him and to what extent he was 
being pressurised.  I do not know because I got the impression that he 
was getting pressure somewhere to get me out of – of my office.  
Because when we spoke ultimately he conceded that he was misled and 
the issue of my fitness or otherwise it did not feature.  All that he was 
trying in a nutshell just to summarise although I cannot recall the 
details of the meetings on various dates but the conspectus of the 
meetings was to try and persuade me to resign which I remained 
steadfast and refused to do it.  And I said because they are so content 
on seeing me out of the NPA then they must be prepared to pay me that 
10 
is – that was the basis of those meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so do you – did you say that he conceded that 
he had been misled about whether you were fit or not fit to hold office 
or in terms of the things that may have made him decide on the inquiry? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  The – that is – that is my 
view Chair.  Because he conceded.  Because one of the things when he 
said you know these people the things that these people were telling 
him one of the things that people were telling him that I need Mr 
Ngcuka for instance which he conceded I told him that was a blue lie.  
The other thing is the one that I referred to earlier on before tea break 
20 
that after we had met – I had met with him at Kings House in Durban.  I 
think some people picked up or the information leaked that we are 
meeting we are now talking because initially he was reluctant to even 
meet with me.  He did not want to meet with me.  I think my – I – these 
people when they found out that we are now talking they were not 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 114 of 192 
 
happy such that they started – they tried to block our meeting; the 
meeting that I had without my attorneys, with him at Mahlambandlovu. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Ones – at one stage that is 
where I even – I had even said to the person who said the President 
was scared that I might be recording him.  Then I said no I would come 
there naked if it needs be.  All of those things I – it – all of those things 
they convinced that he was now – he had conceded that he was misled 
in – by being – by being given all the information, the wrong 
information about me and that he should not have taken this decision. 
10 
But I do not under – I do not know for some strange reasons there was 
– that is my – my view there was some pressure somewhere that he = 
he has to take this decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The legal basis of the settlement 
proposal that was made to you on the 8 December 2014 did you 
understand what that was? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair I understood what it 
was.  It was based on the fact that because they wanted me to resign 
they were talking that I should leave.  Then I had said I will only leave 
20 
if I am paid the full amount of my contract.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And then the settlement 
that – proposal that was made by Ms Makhene he then – she then 
referred to the prescripts of the Public Service Act and the NPA Act and 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 115 of 192 
 
calculated it according to those prescripts then we disagreed there.  
Because our view and my view was that I was – if I was leaving I was 
not leaving NPA in terms of Section 12(9) of the NPA Act.  That was our 
argument.  The argument was that… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Was that your consistent view 
throughout? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That was my consistent 
view throughout.  Because in terms of that provision the NDPP makes a 
request to the President.  Then we are saying and remember there was 
litigation that I had initiated against the President.  Based on the 
10 
litigation for me not continue with the litigation and now we say we are 
settling and I am not leaving in terms of Section 12(8).  You want me to 
leave then you must be prepared to pay.  It is a breach of contract.  It 
is constructive dismissal in other words. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Can I just take this 
opportunity to read onto the record the provisions of Section 12(8) of 
the NPA Act?  It reads: 
“The President may allow the National Director or a 
Deputy National Director at his or her request to vacate 
his or her office. 
20 
i. On account of continued ill health. 
ii. For any other reason which the President deems 
sufficient.” 
Sub-Section B reads: 
“The request in terms of paragraph A2 shall be 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 116 of 192 
 
addressed to the President at least six calendar 
months prior to the date on which he or she wishes 
to vacate his or her office unless the President 
grants a shorter period in a specific case.” 
Arising out of the provisions of that section did you ever request or 
intend to request of the President to permit you to vacate office? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No Chair I never. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And is it your understanding that 
the settlement proposal made to you was made on the basis of that 
section that it would be then taken that you had requested your 
10 
termination? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV JULIE ANN HOWARD:  Alright then you deal with that in… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry would – can you just repeat Mr Pretorius 
the question.  I want to understand the answer correctly.  I think I may 
have missed something. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Did you understand that the 
settlement proposal made to you was let me put it slightly differently 
intended to be an implementation of the provisions of Section 12(8). 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In other words you are 
requesting your termination asking the President to allow your 
termination in terms of that section? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Sir Chair 
and this why we rejected it. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 117 of 192 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right and your rejection is 
explained… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now that is… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In the letter [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what I do not understand.  Mr Pretorius has 
just read to you Section 12(8). 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it contemplates that the NDPP may request the 
President to permit him or her to leave office you understand that? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is so Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now Mr Pretorius asked you earlier on did you ever 
request the President to permit you to leave office as NDPP and I 
understood you to say no you never made such a request.  Did I 
understand you correctly? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now my understanding of this last question that Mr 
Pretorius put to you and he is going to tell me if I misunderstood it and 
you are going to tell me if you had the same understanding – a different 
understanding.  My understanding of what he put to you is whether your 
understanding 
was 
that 
the 
settlement 
agreement 
was 
an 
20 
implementation or the settlement proposal was an implementation of 
Section 12(8) and I understood you to say yes that is correct? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair I understood Mr 
Pretorius to be saying – his last question was that the proposed 
settlement I understood the proposed settlement to be in terms of 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 118 of 192 
 
Section 12(8). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Then I said yes I – that is 
how I understood and that is why… 
CHAIRPERSON:  The proposed – the proposal? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes proposed that is the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is the – that is the 
word.  That is why we rejected it because… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  We of the view that I have 
not requested – I had not made a request to leave NPA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No maybe I am – I then mis – or maybe it is 
when we go to the documents that I would understand. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes we will come to the 
document in a moment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  This is just by way of 
introduction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  To what is made very clear in the 
letter.  My question was intended to focus on the intention of the 
proposal rather than the intention of any subsequent agreement and I 
think Mr Nxasana understood it that way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Understood ja.  Okay. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 119 of 192 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What did you understand the 
intention behind the proposal made to you to be… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And so perhaps that is a bit 
clearer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Let us go to paragraph 2 then on 
page 187.  This is your attorney’s statement to the Presidency in regard 
to the proposal made to you. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It states: 
“Following our discussions of the 8 t h instance and the 
subsequent instructions from client regarding the 
proposed settlement we would like to place the 
following on record. 
2.1  We are of the firm view that the prescripts which 
you sought to rely on pertaining to settlement are not 
applicable in the present case for the following 
reasons.” 
Was that letter sent with your knowledge?  I think you say elsewhere in 
20 
your statement that you helped draft this letter? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair.  That is why I 
know these provisions because I helped – I was involved in drafting 
this letter. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.   
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 120 of 192 
 
“2.1.1  The provisions of the NPA Act which you seek 
to rely on deal with the scenario where the NDPP is 
removed from office in terms of Section 12(6)A.  The 
procedure thereof is succinctly spelt out in Section 
12(6, 7, 8 and 9) of the NPA Act.” 
Then continues to read: 
“We would consequently like to draw the following to 
your attention. 
3.1  That it has never been the NDPP’s intention to 
resign from his position since he considers himself to 
10 
be a fit and proper person to hold this position.” 
That is what is stated was that your view at the time? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That was my view at the 
time. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   
“4.  The proposed settlement was triggered by the 
discussions which the NDPP had with the President 
following the latter’s’ announcement of his decision 
to hold an inquiry into the NDPP’s fitness to hold 
office and the possible suspension pending the 
20 
inquiry.” 
5.  Our instructions further are that the meeting 
between the NDPP and the President only took place 
after numerous attempts by the NDPP to seek 
audience with the President without success.” 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 121 of 192 
 
The allegations in those two paragraphs are they correct? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Paragraph 6. 
“It must be remembered that the only time the 
President agreed to meet the NDPP was after the 
latter had lodged a court application inter alia 
interdicting the President from suspending the NDPP 
before the President provided further and sufficient 
particularity to enable the NDPP to respond or to 
show cause why he should not be suspended.” 
10 
Is that a correct allegation and fact? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  It is a correct allegation. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Paragraph 7. 
“We are advised that during the discussions the 
NDPP had with the President the NDPP made it very 
clear that he will only consider stepping down from 
office if he is fully compensated for the remainder of 
his 
entire 
contract 
as 
head 
of 
the 
National 
Prosecuting Authority.” 
You did make that clear?  You have said already. 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is so Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It may be a fine legal point but 
your statement to the President saying yes I will step down, will vacate 
office, will voluntarily leave office if you pay me for the rest of my 
contract.  Is that not akin to a resignation in terms of Section 12(8)? 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 122 of 192 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No it is not. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Why do you say that?  And I 
understand there may be legal argument about this and I am sure the 
constitutional court judgment considered that. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I am sure that will – if you 
continue reading the letter paragraph 10 there will be the answer to 
your question Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright let us go then to 8 and 9.  
You say in paragraph 8: 
“We reiterate or your attorney says in paragraph 8 
10 
we reiterate that there is no factual or legal basis for 
our client to step down from his position.” 
Paragraph 9: 
“It is our considered view in the light of the above 
that the provisions of the NPA Act read with the 
provisions of the Public Service Act which you have 
alluded to do not apply to this proposed settlement.” 
And then paragraph 10 to which you have now referred: 
“In the circumstances our client will only consider the 
option of leaving office as the President would want 
20 
him to if he was – is fully compensated for the 
remainder of his contract.” 
Now that is what was said and it was your view that you – the 
provisions of the NPA Act particularly the one which we have just read 
did not apply to this. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 123 of 192 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That was my … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Process. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That was my view at the 
time Chair yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Based on what reasoning? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Based on the reasoning 
that my leaving the office was not at my instance – at my request.  It 
was the President who wanted me to leave. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I see that exactly on the issue of who – whether 
the President wanted you to leave which I asked you about earlier on 
10 
and you said that indeed he had said that he wanted you to leave. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you said he had said that even before you 
received the letter from him saying that – or the letter saying there 
would be an inquiry into your fitness to hold office.  I see that in 
paragraph 10 of this letter dated 10 December 2014 from your attorneys 
to Mr Hulley it does say 
“As the President would want him to.” 
It says: 
“In the circumstances our client will only consider the 
20 
option of leaving office as the President would want 
him to if he is fully compensated.” 
It seems that this is in some way placed on record that it is the 
President who wanted you to leave. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is so Chair. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 124 of 192 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And your attorneys were placing on record that you 
would only accede to that wish on his part if you were fully 
compensated for the remainder of the period of your contract? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is so Chair.  And – 
Chair I can even say that this paragraph was inserted specifically at my 
insistence because I was part and parcel of drafting this letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You – you helped draft some of the correspondence 
from your attorneys? 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is – that is correct 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course you are an attorney yourself. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes,  yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And that is how I was 
trained that whatever discussion you may have had you follow it up with 
a written confirmation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Which is exactly what we 
20 
did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I am sure Mr Pretorius will still take you to any 
subsequent correspondence.  Did Mr Hulley to whom this letter was 
addressed did he ever say subsequent to this letter no, no, no, what 
are you people talking about?  The President has never wanted – said 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 125 of 192 
 
he wants Ms Nxasana to leave it is not his position that Mr – he wants 
Mr Nxasana to leave?  Did they deny this part of the letter? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair the letter was 
addressed to Ms Bonisiwe Makhene not Mr Hulley. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright, okay I am – it was addressed to the 
Presidency. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For the attention of Ms Bonisiwe Makhene? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Ms Makhene was as you said legal advisor to the 
10 
President? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or in the Presidency? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes.  She responded 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  By way of a letter dated 
the 12 t h December 2014 which is Annexure – page 192. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Pretorius I realise that I am – I am 
jumping the gun but maybe we will deal with that and then you can 
20 
continue now that … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  There is a letter of 12 December 
2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Do you want to say anything on it in regard to 
this particular point Mr Nxasana? 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 126 of 192 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair there is no denial in 
her response except to say – to refer to the correspondence – to this 
letter and she says it is not her intention to traverse each and every 
allegation 
or 
averment 
contained 
in 
her 
correspondence 
notwithstanding certain glaring inaccuracies and misstatements or fact. 
Then he said he reserves – she reserves her right to do so in the event 
that it becomes either necessary or appropriate but she did not 
vehemently deny. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so – so she – she said she did not intend this 
letter to be a response to each and everything that had been written in 
10 
the letter of the 10 t h December. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And reserved the right … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To do so later but pointed out that according to her 
there were glaring inaccuracies … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And misstatements of fact but did not go to say which 
ones … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  She did not … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Those were. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  She - she did not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Extrapolate them … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 127 of 192 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And as far as you know did anybody either 
Ms Makhene or the President or Mr Hulley subsequently come back to 
the issue of this statement that you said your attorney said the 
President wanted you to leave?  Did they come back to say actually 
that is - was not the case? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  It was not the case Chair 
except for the President’s affidavit which he filed in the High Court … 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the High Court, ja. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And - and subsequently in 
10 
the Constitutional Court … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Where he maintained that I 
made a request but specifically dealing with this letter now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I cannot recall where he 
specifically disputed the contents of this letter.  That is why this letter 
even in the - in the High Court and in the Constitutional Court the 
Judges the - the court found that my version based on this letter … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Was the most plausible 
one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Thank you.  I am sorry.  I - I interrupted you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
Just 
to 
place 
this 
correspondence in its context.  You have told the Chair that you had 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 128 of 192 
 
discussions with the President about your holding office as NDPP? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Did some of these discussions 
take place before 4 July 2014? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The notice of the inquiry? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Or the notice of the intention to 
consider suspension? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you have told the Chair that 
at these meetings the President expressed a view that you should leave 
office.  Is that correct? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you have also told the Chair 
that your response was there is no need to do so because there is a 
campaign and it is being fed with misinformation about you. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Is that correct? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The subsequent events show 
that during July the President acted on what you told the Chair had 
been his intimation early in regard to the termination of your services in 
whatever manner? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes.  On the - yes, by his 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 129 of 192 
 
letter. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Dated 4 July 2014. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Was there ever any occasion on 
which the termination of services or the termination of your holding of 
office was at your instance? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Not at any stage Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Did you ever come to the 
conclusion that despite your attempts to persuade the President to 
abandon this idea that you should leave office - which you say you did.  
10 
There was no point in continuing that avenue because he seemed 
unwilling to change his mind.  Did you ever come to that realisation? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No.  To abandon the idea 
… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That you should leave office. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  It is - at a particular point 
I then agreed to - to enter into a settlement agreement because they 
were now willing to pay me the remainder of my contract. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes but at whose instance would 
that termination had been - have been yours or the President? 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No it was - it was the 
President’s instance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That will - that - that letter of 10 December that we 
talked about a little earlier referred to the settlement agreement that 
came from - ja, paragraph 2. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 130 of 192 
 
“Following our discussions of the 8 t h and the 
subsequent instructions from the client regarding 
the proposed settlement …” 
The proposed settlement that is - that the - your attorney is 
talking about there did it come to them in written form?  Was there a 
letter that came from the Presidency saying here is our settlement 
proposal or is he talking about the - the discussions at the meeting of 
the 8 t h? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair I must have perhaps 
misplaced that letter.  There was at that meeting Ms Makhene produced 
10 
a - a document which was a settlement proposal proposing a settlement 
amount of about R6 million and some sorts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I remember we had that - 
that letter - that letter but the problem Chair is that when - when the 
matter went for litigation and I wanted to respond to all these issues 
when the President said that I had made a request my files at my - at -
at my attorney’s offices had disappeared.  That was a strange thing 
that happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Unfortunately I had rely on 
- because I used to insist that whatever that they send out they must 
send … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Give you a copy. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Give me a copy.  Then I 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 131 of 192 
 
had put the - the copies aside.  I managed to reconstruct the - the 
evidence.  So to enable - which enabled me to respond adequately to - 
to the President’s allegations that I made a request. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see Mr Pretorius asked you some questions and 
you answered in relation to whether the settlement was in terms of the 
NPA Act. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now if there had been a letter that preceded - that 
came with the settlement agreement I would have loved to see that 
because there is this issue of whether or not you made a request to the 
10 
President and here in this letter of the 10 t h it is made quite clear that 
as far as you and your attorney are concerned what you are looking at 
is not something in terms of the NPA Act … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it - the NP - what they may have written maybe 
might have - if what they were looking at was in terms of the Act it 
probably would have been in terms of Section 12.8 which necessarily 
requires a request from your side … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if what they had sent to you or your attorney was 
20 
a letter which contemplated that their understanding was that the two 
parties were engaged in a process that requires your request.  Then the 
fact that in this letter you and your attorney are saying look what we 
are talking about is something that is not in terms of the Act. 
It might make it quite clear that you definitely rejected any 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 132 of 192 
 
concept of any - concept of a request that you may have made and it 
would be important to look at their reaction to that.  You - you cannot 
remember whether the letter that may have come from them with a 
settlement agree if - if it was a letter made any reference to the 
request? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No Chair it - it did not - it 
did not talk about the request.  I - I remember it vividly.  It was a 
settlement proposal that I relinquished the - my position and I would be 
paid this - so much money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That was it.  Then we 
rejected it outright by this letter of the 10 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did it refer to the Act itself?  To - it might have 
referred expressly to the request but did it refer to Section 12.8 by any 
chance if you are able to remember? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair I am - I am not able 
to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot remember? 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No I am not able to 
remember … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  The contents of the letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  That is fine.  Thank you.  Mr Pretorius. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 133 of 192 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  The situation is clarified a 
little further in the next letter of 12 December 2014 at page 1-9-2.  If 
you would go there.  The intervening letters are just monetary 
calculations.  I am not sure that those are relevant for present 
purposes.  If we could go to that letter addressed to you by 
Advocate Bonisiwe Makhene legal advisor to the President to Mabunda 
Incorporated.  It reads: 
“I 
refer 
to 
your 
correspondence 
dated 
10 December 2014 addressed to the Presidency and 
respond thereto as follows:  one, it is not my 
10 
intention to traverse each and every allegation or 
averment 
contained 
in 
your 
correspondence.  
Notwithstanding certain glaring inaccuracies and 
misstatements of fact.  I reserve the right to do so 
in the event that it becomes either necessary or 
appropriate.” 
Then there is a - an interesting comment which follows: 
“Two, whilst any negotiated settlement pertaining to 
your client’s employment as NDPP ought properly to 
be had with the Minister of Justice and Correctional 
20 
Services the President assumed this role mindful as 
he was of certain reservations which had been 
expressed regarding the Minister.” 
That statement is fairly clear that what is now being said is 
that a negotiated settlement is the job of the Minister. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 134 of 192 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Correct; but we know that 
Section 12.8 is not the function of the Minister but of the President. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So this seems to be an 
acknowledgement of the fact that if there is to be a negotiated 
settlement it should not be then in terms of Section 12.8 but simply a 
negotiated settlement. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is so - that was my 
view Chair. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And that you had pointed out in 
your letter of 10 December? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is so Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And so on this basis it appears 
what is said in paragraph 3 or perhaps I first should go to the last 
paragraph and paragraph 2. 
“Notwithstanding such intervention the President is 
not at liberty to depart from accepted prescripts 
which regulate Government conduct.” 
Paragraph 3: 
20 
“What now appears apparent is that the parties are 
incapable of resolving the matter alone and I must 
therefore to this - the initial suggestion of making 
use of the services of an independent mediator in 
order to find a settlement to the matter.” 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 135 of 192 
 
Do you see that? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes I see it. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then a request is made again.  
Then on 15 January … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Before that Mr Pretorius if you look at the 
last sentence on paragraph 2 Mr Nxasana … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Of 
the 
letter 
of 
12 December 2014 
from 
Advocate Bonisiwe Makhene it says that: 
“…the President is not at liberty to depart from 
10 
accepted prescripts which regulate Government 
conduct.” 
You see that? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes I see that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Within the context it seems to be saying that they are 
taking the view that whatever is done must be in terms of the - of - of 
the NPA Act.  Was that your understanding as well?  Is that your 
understanding of what they are saying? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That was their argument 
Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but then the following paragraph or the following 
two or the last paragraph or the following two paragraphs they then talk 
about going to mediation to settle the matter.  Does the National 
Prosecuting Authority Act make provision for mediations in such a 
case? 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 136 of 192 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So to the extent that they proposed mediation they 
themselves were proposing something that was outside of the … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Outside of the Act. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the - of the Act. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well as the Chair has pointed 
out you are an attorney … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you obviously and as you 
have said to the Chair we are aware of all the relevant provisions 
governing any termination or ending of your services as NDPP … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you were careful to have 
regard to those when drafting or attending to correspondence drafted 
on your behalf? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is so Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Perhaps you can help us then 
because paragraph 2 and paragraph 3 seem to be a little confusing at - 
20 
at first glance because on the one hand they are saying a negotiated 
settlement must involve the Minister of Justice and Correctional 
Services and not the President … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And on the other hand they are 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 137 of 192 
 
saying that the President can only act in terms of accepted prescripts 
whatever those might be.  We know that Section 12.8 involves the 
President directly.  It is he that must exercise his discretion in terms of 
Section 12.8 at your request … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Or at the request of the NDPP 
wishing to resign.  Nevertheless there is a statement here that a 
negotiated settlement pertaining to your employment should not be at 
the hands of the President but at the hands of the Minister. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Can you explain what is going on 
here? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair I understood this 
paragraph to be saying that whilst it was the responsibility of the 
Minister to deal with this - with the issue of - of my issue the - the 
President assumed unto himself to deal with this issue.  It - it was 
confusing to me. 
I - I must - I must admit but I thought she was just saying that 
it was the responsibility of the Minister to deal with this not the 
President and the Minister must after dealing with any issues then the 
20 
Minister as the Member of Parliament responsible for who exercise final 
responsibility of our NPA should then communicate it to the President 
and the - for the president to take a decision. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes because we know that 
Section 12 of the NPA Act you may recall says that: 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 138 of 192 
 
“No termination of service may take place other 
than in accordance with the prescripts of Section 
12.” 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That - that is so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had you expressed any reservations about the 
Minister to the President?  I ask that because they - they refer to 
something along those lines.  It seems that what they are saying is the 
President was aware that you had expressed certain reservations about 
the Minister of Justice. 
I do not know in regard to what but you had expressed certain 
10 
reservations and that is why he therefore played this role himself which 
they seem to suggest ought to have been played by the Minister of 
Justice. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You had? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes I had Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA: 
 
Chair 
I 
had 
verbally 
expressed my - my dissatisfaction at the manner in which the Minister 
of Justice handled my matter especially … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is Minister Masutha or …? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Firstly - firstly it was 
Minister Radebe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I also - I am on record.  I 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 139 of 192 
 
wrote a letter and expressed my discomfort and dissatisfaction in the 
manner in which he - he treated me … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Because he is the first 
person who told me about the fact that he was going to advise the 
President to institute the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  An inquiry? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  The inquiry.  What - what 
does not appear in these papers Chair - just briefly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA: 
 
Is 
that 
before 
Minister Radebe was removed or reshuffled from this position of 
Minister of Justice he called me to a meeting in Pretoria in his office.  
Present there was himself and the DG then Ms Sindane and at that 
meeting he then confronted me with all these allegations of my previous 
convictions, of my matters that were - the complaints that were laid 
against me in the - in the KwaZulu-Natal Law Society and that I did not 
declare all of those which was not correct and I told him at that meeting 
that I know the campaign and that was the first person I told that the 
campaign - I am aware of the campaign waged by Advocates Jiba and 
20 
Mrwebi against me. 
I tried to explain myself.  He dismissed me by saying that that 
was a figment of my own imagination - imagination and then he 
suggested to me and that I must resign because of all of these.  I - in 
fact his trump card was that - but now you do not have the security 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 140 of 192 
 
clearance certificate and I found it odd because I am the one that 
applied for the security clearance certificate and I had not been told by 
the state security agents that my security clearance has been declined 
and which was - which I subsequently learnt it was not even the case 
and I refused … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You mean that - that it had not been declined.  You 
say it not the case. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  It was not the case.  It was 
not the case.  It has never been - it was never declined … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA: 
 
But 
that 
is 
what 
Minister Radebe told me.  It was not the case.  That was the initial 
push.  They tried to push me then I refused and then he said to me I 
must resign and they agreed with the DG Sindane.  I told them that I 
was not going to do that.  Then he said to me then that the President 
will have to appoint the Commission of Inquiry. 
Then I left the meeting and the following day I addressed the 
letter to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Before the following day are you able to 
indicate roundabout when this was?  There was an election in 2014 … 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I think that maybe when he might have ceased to 
be Minister of Justice … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I remember … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then Mr Masutha came in. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 141 of 192 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I remember he was going - 
was it - was it in December or January 2014.  December 2013/January 
(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well he - he - I think he - he was not Minister of 
Justice after the election of 2014. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if you had a meeting with him while he was 
Minister of Justice it could only have been before the election … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Before the elections. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or - or at least before the inauguration of the 
10 
President because Ministers continued to operate as Ministers even 
after the election as long as the President has not been inaugurated 
yet. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair I know that he was 
coming from the - he was the - Parliament was sitting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The election would have been around May I think 
more or less - 2014. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  2014, but I know that he 
was coming from Cape Town … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And immediately after our 
meeting I think - immediately after - thereafter he was then removed 
from that position and he … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  He went to the Presidency. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 142 of 192 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if he is - his departure from the Ministry of Justice 
was because of - was after the election then your meeting with him 
must have been close to the election or between the election and the 
inauguration. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair I - I do - I do have 
the - I do have the - the date at home because … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I - I have the copy of that 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That I - I wrote to him 
confirming what had happened on that day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No I think then what can happen is that later 
on you could do a supplementary affidavit and/or statement and attach 
the letter and indicate that you are able to say what date the meeting 
took place. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes, but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - but you were saying that … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The following day you wrote a letter? 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Confirming - confirming 
what - what transpired … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 143 of 192 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  The previous night, yes 
and I did not get any response. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what did you say - the gist of what you said in 
your letter what you recorded or what you said?  What did you convey 
to him? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I confirmed that he - he 
called me to a meeting and that this is what happened at the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As you have testified to me now? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  As I have testified and I 
called the - the - I called Exco and I explained to Exco what had 
10 
happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  It is - it is minuted.  It is 
there … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  At NPA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And then I think the - the 
comments - the - the remarks that he - that she might be referring to 
here is I - I also made remarks - verbal remarks about Minister Masutha 
20 
at - I think at the meeting of the 8 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the meeting of 8 December? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Of December. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 144 of 192 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair I was - when - you 
would 
understand 
that 
after 
I 
had 
had 
that 
interaction 
with 
Minister Radebe - you would understand my attitude.  Then when it was 
announced that we - we were going - we were having a new Minister.  
To me - I said to me it is a relief. 
Then I am having a new Minister with fresh ideas and he will 
be able to - not to play all these NPA politics as I perceived 
Minister Radebe was doing but strangely Minister Masutha - I then saw 
him on the news talking about the issue - my issue without even having 
10 
had the decency of meeting me and even finding out from me or getting 
my version of the events and he was already making statements about 
me in the media and I told him - himself at the meeting that I had with 
him at the - at the hotel in … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The first meeting you had with him? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  With - with Masutha and 
remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With Minister Masutha? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Masutha.  We had a 
meeting - there was an evening meeting also that I had with him at the 
20 
Sheraton Hotel and I told him that I am very concerned in the manner in 
which he was behaving because I got the impression - I told him that he 
was taking sides because - and then he assured me that he did not 
know either Jiba or myself. 
That is what he - but I think in this letter that is the remark 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 145 of 192 
 
that Ms Bonisiwe Makhene is referring to because I said I had some 
reservations 
about 
the 
- 
the 
impartiality 
of 
the 
Minister 
- 
Minister Masutha in - in this whole matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But this is - this letter is dated 12 December 2014 or 
is that the - ja 2014 … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it responds to a letter that recorded what had 
transpired at the meeting of 8 December? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So my question is prior to 8 December - prior to that 
10 
meeting - had you conveyed to the President or anybody acting on the 
President your reservations about Minister Masutha? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair my - Chair my 
response is that at the meeting of 8 December before they responded 
on the 12 t h I must have conveyed my - my reservations about 
Minister Masutha at that meeting or even before that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but - but you see the President had interacted 
with you … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Prior to 8 December if I understand the position 
20 
correctly. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Ms Makhene is trying to justify why the President 
preformed functions that she says should have been performed by the 
Minister of Justice.  Namely negotiating with you as I understand the 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 146 of 192 
 
position. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what he may have done prior to 8 December 
cannot be used to justify him handling this matter himself if he only got 
to know about your reservations on the 8 t h or after.  So my question is 
whether you had conveyed to the President or through to people 
representing him much earlier that you had reservations about 
Minister Masutha. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That - that is the position 
Chair.  To - to the President and to Mr Hulley as well. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You had? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No, thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair it is 10 past four.  
Mr Nxasana is due to fly subject to what you say at five past eight.  We 
could attempt to finish by 6 o’ clock when I think Mr Nxasana should 
leave at the latest … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But I cannot guarantee we will 
finish in that time … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  At the rapid pace at which we 
are going.  Even that might not - although we are - once we finish the 
timeline we will go quite quickly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Well we - we said - we certainly can go up to 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 147 of 192 
 
five.  Whether we can go beyond that maybe we can deal with that 
close to five or around 5 o’ clock.  So let us - let us see how it goes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Let us see how far we can get … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  By 5 o’ clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Let us see then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What happens?  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Okay, it’s probably necessary 
to place it on record because you did mention an issue concerning the 
security clearance certificate. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    That is dealt with on page 189 
in the letter of your attorneys to the Presidency of 10 December 2014. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    If I can just read paragraphs 11 
to 13 onto the record and you can confirm whether that’s correct or not.   
“We confirm, [says Mr Mabundu on your behalf], that the 
20 
President advised us that the Minister of the State Security 
Agency, the Minister, has confirmed that he has upheld the 
NDPP’s appeal against the refusal to grant him the security 
clearance and he has already issued but he is waiting to hand 
it over to the NDPP upon finalisation of the settlement between 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 148 of 192 
 
the parties.” 
Paragraph 12: 
“While we do appreciate and welcome the Minister’s decision 
to uphold the NDPP’s appeal it is our respectful view that the 
granting of the security clearance certificate to the NDPP is 
and/or should not be a condition for any proposed settlement.” 
Paragraph 13: 
“We are accordingly bringing it to your attention that we are 
despatching a letter to the Minister to release the security 
clearance certificate to the NDPP.” 
10 
Now I don’t think it is necessary to go into whether it’s a valid reason 
for withholding the certificate that there is no settlement between the 
parties, I think the answer to that question is fairly obvious, but are the 
facts here correct?   
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   The facts are correct 
Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Alright then let’s go then to the 
letter of the 12 t h of December 2014 which is the Presidency’s response 
to the letter we have just dealt with, that’s the letter of the 10 t h of 
December addressed by your attorneys to the Presidency.  The first 
20 
paragraph and it is signed by ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought we have dealt with that letter, I remember, I 
think I remember you reading the first paragraph and we have certainly 
dealt with the paragraph that says it is not my intention to traverse 
each and every allegation, and then we dealt with the one that says 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 149 of 192 
 
whilst any negotiated settlement pertaining to our client’s employment, 
I think we have dealt with all of it. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    My recollection is we dealt with 
another letter Chair, but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  No it was this one, but there may be one or other 
point that you want to make but I think we – you remember in regard to 
paragraph – the last two paragraphs we looked at the last sentence of 
paragraph 2. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Yes we did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    I want to get to paragraph 3 
however. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Paragraph 3 reads: 
“What now appears apparent is that the parties are incapable 
of resolving the matter alone and I must therefore revert to the 
initial suggestion of making the use of services of an 
independent mediator.” 
I think that’s where we left the letter. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes, correct. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    And then on the 15 t h of January 
your attorney once more enter the fray. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    And firstly you acknowledge 
receipt of a letter dated 9 December 2014 and received by our office on 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 150 of 192 
 
the 9 t h of January 2015.  Now that may be a mistake, it may be 
referring to the letter of 10 December, or it may be referring to a letter 
that we could not find and you have mentioned that’s the letter setting 
out a settlement proposal, can you help us there?   Do you know of any 
letter of 9 December 2014, as opposed to the letter of 10 December 
2014. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   I cannot recall Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Alright, well we don’t have any 
letter of 9 December and it may be that they are actually referring to 
your letter of 10 December. 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Chair I think there must 
have been a letter of the 9 t h December because the letter that on the 
10 t h of December is a letter from ourselves. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, that may have been the one that brought the 
settlement proposal. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Perhaps Chair.  It is the 
letter that was coming from them. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Alright, well perhaps in the 
fullness of time we can find that letter, but let’s go to paragraph 2; 
”we place on record that we have been liaising and 
20 
corresponding with Mr Michael Hulley before you were 
introduced to us as the legal advisor to the President.” 
Paragraph 3: 
“At all material times Mr Hulley has always represented to us 
which we accept that he was the legal representative of the 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 151 of 192 
 
President.  It was at his instance and request that the formal 
engagement which bears reference was initiated.” 
The formal engagement referred to there do you know what it is?  
Perhaps a mediation? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   I think the formal 
engagements that we had between the engagements that we had on the 
8 t h, 8 t h of December, when Ms McKenna was available. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Right, paragraph 4 reads: 
“We are noting the tone of your letter which is somewhat 
unsavoury and un-reconciliatory.  We would like to bring to 
10 
your attention that our communication to Mr Hulley dated the 
3 r d of November 2014 is still of relevance in this case and 
equally remains on record.  We enclose herewith a copy of the 
said letter received and read by Mr Hulley for the ease of your 
reference.” 
And then paragraph 5: 
“You will note from the said letter that our client had always 
been, and still remains amenable to the proposed mediation.  
It is however apposite that you attend to the proposed terms of 
reference for the mediation for consideration and acceptance 
20 
by our client.” 
We can leave the rest.  Paragraph 6 on page 194 we must record that 
our client is amenable to a proposed independent mediation and not a 
confidential one you seem to be proposing.   
 
Then paragraph 7: 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 152 of 192 
 
“We further wish to record that our client has at no stage 
initiated the discussions regarding settlement proposal.  In 
terms of paragraph 2 of your letter you seem to be creating an 
impression that the Minister, and not the President, should 
have been the one liaising with our client regarding the issue 
in question.  We venture not to express an opinion in this 
regard.  We are equally unaware of any formal meeting 
between the Minister and our client.   
Trusting you find the above in order.” 
That is the letter you sent then to the Presidency. 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Where you placed yourself 
clearly on record.  Now there was a space of time between the 10 t h of 
December and the 15 t h of January 2015. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    It seems from the letter of 15 
January 2015 that there was some hiatus in correspondence in that 
period. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   That is so. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    During that period did you ever 
20 
meet personally with the President, or well let me first ask, is there any 
other correspondence of which you might be aware that would alter 
what is clearly set out in the letter, your letter of 10 December 2014 
and 15 January 2015, did that ever change in the interim period? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   No Chair there was 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 153 of 192 
 
nothing. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Were there any meetings 
between you and the President in that intervening period? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Although I cannot recall 
but I would say – no I cannot recall having a meeting with him, I 
cannot. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    In any meeting with the 
President or the President’s legal advisor at any stage or even with Mr 
Hulley for that matter, did you ever abandon or qualify the position that 
you were not a fit and proper person, or that you were indeed a fit and 
10 
proper person to continue holding office. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   At no stage Chair did I 
abandon my view. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Did you ever communicate to 
anybody in the Presidency, the President or representing the 
Presidency that you wished at your instance to vacate office? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   No Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    You did however say that if you 
were fully compensated for the remainder of your term of office you 
would leave? 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes Chair because they 
were pushing me to leave and I could see they had taken a decision. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Had you left at whose instance 
would your departure have been? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Had I left? 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 154 of 192 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Yes had you – well you did 
leave eventually. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes I did. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    But at the stage in December, 
because we’re going to deal with what happened afterwards now.   
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   I would have left at the 
instance of the President. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Right.   
CHAIRPERSON:  It is going to be important that you try and remember 
whether in December or January you did have a meeting personally 
10 
with the President, because in the corruption ...[indistinct] matter I 
think there is an affidavit in his answer affidavit or one of the affidavits 
by the President, he says it was between the end of December and the 
beginning of 2015, he says between the end of December and the 
beginning of 2015 there were discussions and he says it was during 
maybe one of those discussions that you made the request.  Now we 
know that there was a meeting which involved both of you and other 
people on the 8 t h of December 2014, and we know that on the 10 t h of 
December your attorneys wrote a letter which you drafted yourself to 
record what had been discussed at the meeting of the 8 t h of December. 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We know that Ms Mokene wrote a letter on the 12 t h of 
December responding to the letter of the 10 t h of December if I recall 
correctly, but we – and I think then there was another letter if I am not 
mistaken from your attorneys, or maybe your attorneys then wrote in  
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 155 of 192 
 
January, now so therefore it seems that the request that the former 
President says you made to him if ever it was made was made between 
the end of December and the beginning of January, so it will be 
important for you to remember, not necessarily now if you cannot 
remember, if there are other documents that might assist at home to 
remember whether you did have such a meeting to be able to prepare a 
supplementary affidavit that deals with whether you had any meeting or 
telephone discussion or any discussion at all with him during that time. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    I understand Chair that the 
...[indistinct – microphone off] is now in the bundle. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh it is in the bundle, okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    It is now in the bundle and Mr 
Nxasana has been given a copy to consider and I had intended to ask 
him about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, okay.   So you – if you want to respond to 
what I have just said you may do so, if you want to go and check 
certain documents and try and remember that’s fine. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Chair I was going to 
respond in this way, my response is in as much as I would not – I 
cannot recall whether we had any interaction, be it a meeting or 
20 
telephone discussion or otherwise but the fact I think what Mr Pretorius 
wants to know is that did I at any stage make a request and my answer 
is a big no, I never made a request. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well no I understand that, but you see if indeed there 
was a meeting between yourself and the former President during that 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 156 of 192 
 
time that might give a certain flavour maybe to the issue but if the 
position is there was no meeting at all, or any discussion at all it might 
give a different flavour, you understand what I mean, so you might say 
yes whatever meeting I had with him if I did have a meeting what I do 
know is that I never made such a request, that is fine, but he says 
there were discussions during that time and if the position is there were 
no discussions that might be important as well, you understand that? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   I understand Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay alright, thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Of course the possible 
10 
scenario that there was such a meeting at which resignation was 
requested in terms of Section 82 would beg the question of why 
negotiations fell through at that stage, but that’s a matter that we can 
deal with in submissions Chair, but if we may then go to paragraph 2 
and 3 of page 195 which is a letter of the 23 r d of January 2015 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry Mr Pretorius I wanted to say something at 
paragraph one, at page 194, Mr Nxasana I see that in this letter of 15 
January, paragraph seven thereof says we further wish to record that 
our client has at no stage initiated the discussions regarding settlement 
20 
proposals.   This seems to suggest that the settlement proposals or 
settlement negotiations that were taking place were initiated by the 
Presidency and not by yourself, is that right? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, you never initiated any negotiations? 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 157 of 192 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   I never initiated any 
negotiations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, thank you.  And as far as you know this 
was never denied in any correspondence that they were the ones who 
initiated, or that you never initiated the settlement discussions? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   No because in the letter 
of the 23 r d of January, the next page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Advocate ...[indistinct] 
does not even refer, she does not dispute that, save to say that there 
10 
has been insufficient progress in resolving the matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   And paragraph 2 is very 
important because it talks about there has been – she says it appears 
apparent that insufficient progress has been made in respect of 
resolving your client’s current status as National Director of Public 
Prosecutions.  That is why I was saying the discussions were around 
everything about – not just about the settlement proposals in terms of 
the money, it was about everything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What did you understand that part to be “resolving 
your 
client’s 
current 
status 
as 
National 
Director 
of 
Public 
Prosecutions”?  What did you understand them to be talking about in 
regard to that? 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 158 of 192 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   I understood it to mean 
that there was insufficient progress in resolving the matter whether or 
not I remain in office or that I am leaving. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Let’s deal with paragraphs – 
my apologies – let’s deal with paragraphs 2 and 3 of the letter, it says, 
well and paragraph 1 in fact, paragraph 1 reads: 
“I [and that’s the legal advisor to the President] refer to your 
recent correspondence in respect of this matter and reserve 
our rights to deal with certain aspects contained therein.” 
10 
Notably there’s no reference to any meeting that has taken place in this 
period. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Let alone a meeting at which 
you request to resign? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Paragraph 2 reads: 
“It appears apparent that insufficient progress has been made 
in respect of resolving your client’s current status as National 
Director of Public Prosecutions.” 
20 
You have answered the Chair’s question in that regard? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Paragraph 3: 
“I must accordingly advise that after consideration of the 
matter President Zuma has taken a decision to proceed with 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 159 of 192 
 
the inquiry into Mr Nxasana’s fitness to hold office.” 
And then over the page on the 26 t h of January your attorneys address a 
letter to the Presidency saying: 
“We note the President’s intention to proceed with the inquiry 
into our client’s fitness to hold office.  Kindly advise us when 
we can expect to receive the terms of reference for the 
inquiry.” 
If we can then go back, that’s pretty self-explanatory, is there any 
comment that you wish to make? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   I think it explains the – 
10 
this exchange of correspondence explains, it fairly explains that there 
was no progress reached and my attitude and the attitude was that the 
Presidency then decided to proceed with the inquiry and I said bring it 
on.  That is exactly what I said. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Perhaps had there been a 
request for you to resign made directly to the President in terms of 
Section 12(8) of the NPA Act, and the only question then remaining was 
the financial consequences of the President accepting your request to 
resign, would that have been progress in the context of what happened 
in – progress in the sense of getting closer to finalisation, not progress 
20 
in respect of being satisfactory to you? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Surely if I had made a 
request Chair in fact if I had made a request to resign it does not make 
any sense that I will make a request to resign and at the same time 
expect to be paid the full amount of the contract.   I mean it does not 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 160 of 192 
 
take a rocket scientist that it is nonsensical, it does not make sense at 
all. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    You have made that point yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is the point you are making this that if you yourself 
made the decision that you want to request the President to allow you 
to leave and then it would be – it would not be expected that you 
having decided that you want to be allowed to leave that you would 
then want to be paid for the full remainder of the full contract, the full 
remaining period of your contract.  What is consistent with that demand 
10 
that you paid for the full remaining period of your contract is if the 
other side wanted you to leave against your will ...[intervenes]  
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Against my will. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you say ...[intervenes]  
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Pay me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Since I am not the one who wants to leave, you are 
the ones who want me to leave then pay me, because I have been 
prepared to stay on up to the end of my period of contract. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   That is the position Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the point you are making is that the fact that they 
20 
acceded to that you are saying means that or shows that they – it was 
the other side that wanted you to leave and not you? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   That is so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the point you are making. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   That is the point I am 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 161 of 192 
 
making Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    If we could go back Mr 
Nxasana to the timeline, we have dealt with all the items up to item 14, 
the further items are dealt with in your evidence and we will deal with 
the briefly but it appears that on the 5 t h of February 2015 you were 
informed that Advocate Cassiem, assisted by Advocate Nkosi Thomas 
and S K D Madlala would chair the inquiry. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is Mdladla not Madlala Mr Pretorius. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    What should it be? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mdladla not Madlala. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Oh Mdladla.   Then item 16 is a 
reference to a publication in the Government Gazette of the terms of 
reference in the inquiry and then item 17 March 2015 the NPA workshop 
at Emperors Palace at which you were apparently told by the Minister 
that the former President would attend to your advice or requests in 
relation to Advocates Jiba and others. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    You then filed submissions or 
20 
sorry submissions on behalf of the President and the Minister were filed 
on the 4 t h of May, you also filed submissions did you? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   I did not file submissions 
...[intervenes]  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Or you prepared submissions. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 162 of 192 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   I prepared the 
submissions but before filing them then we reached settlement and I 
did not, I ended up not filing them. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    And that settlement was 
concluded in May 2015, signed by yourself on the 9 t h of May and signed 
by the former President on the 14 t h of May together with the Minister? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   I think signed by the 
Minister on behalf of the President on the 14 t h of May if I am not 
mistaken. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Is that how it occurred? 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   If I am not mistaken yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Alright, well we can have a 
look at that, we don’t have the settlement agreement attached, but is 
there anything significant in the fact that the settlement agreement was 
signed by you first and only later on behalf of the former President? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   That is correct Chair 
because if you look at the settlement agreement I signed it at 
Umhlanga, it is dated at Umhlanga in Durban, at the offices of Mr 
Hulley. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    I see, who prepared the 
20 
document? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   I suppose it was Mr 
Hulley. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    But not you? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Not me.  In fact just to 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 163 of 192 
 
clarify there was the – he sent me I think it also it is there in the bundle 
of documents that came up before the Concourt, I think then the High 
Court and the Concourt that he initially sent me a proposed settlement 
of a certain amount of money and then I rejected it, then he sent me 
another settlement without any amount and he asked me to insert the 
amount.   Then I calculated the salary that I was earning at the time, 
and multiplied it by the number of months that were remaining.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius I think that we – I will be agreeable to 
going beyond five o’clock if – in order to try and help us to finish but I 
think we must then take an adjournment now, because I had a meeting 
10 
planned for five o’clock and I need to change that, but in any event it 
might be good to have a break now.   
 
Is that fine, so in other words from my side you mentioned six 
o’clock, we could go up to six o’clock if we don’t finish before that from 
my side.  You are fine with that?  How long do you think we might still 
be?  Or maybe you must tell me that when we come back from the 
break.   Mr Nxasana ...[intervenes]  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    We may finish because there 
are sections that we can summarise and we have dealt already with the 
contents of the Constitutional Court judgment and the confirmation by 
20 
Mr Nxasana of what was said there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no that is fine, but we will take a break now and 
when I come back we continue.  Obviously if we finish before six 
o’clock all the better.  I take it that is fine with you Mr Nxasana? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   It is fine with me Chair. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 164 of 192 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay, let’s take a ten minute break, we will 
resume at ten to five, or should we take fifteen minutes? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    In your hands Chair, perhaps 
fifteen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, maybe fifteen, okay, we will resume at five to five. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us proceed. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  My apologies Chair.  You have 
told the Chair that by letter dated for July 2014 you were informed that 
a decision had been taken to institute an inquiry into your fitness to 
hold office.  Correct? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You also told the Chair that you 
received a notice that the President was considering suspending you on 
20 
full pay and that was on the 30 July 2014? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You took certain steps in regard 
to the suspension issue? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 165 of 192 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The upshot of it all was that you 
were never suspended? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I was never suspended 
that is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In paragraph 50 and following 
you deal with your rights to a fair hearing and your statement in 
paragraphs 52, 53 and 54 focus on the point that really your rights to a 
fair hearing were prejudiced because you were not given sufficient 
particulars of what this inquiry was to be about? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So for example you say in 
paragraph 52 that you were not given particulars of criminal 
convictions.  You say in paragraph 53 you were not given details of the 
alleged comments in the media which were divisive and had the effect 
of bringing the NPA into disrepute? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you were not given details 
of the alleged prosecution which you had failed to disclose at the time 
of your employment, correct? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And your view was as placed on 
record in paragraph 55 that it was not for you to speculate about these 
matters details should be provided? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is so Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you – you took action in 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 166 of 192 
 
terms of these contentions of yours, correct?  
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well not formal action you – you 
communicated these? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You – you say you were not given clarity with regard 
to the media comments to which reference was made, is that right? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I did read somewhere I do not know whether – I 
think it was a letter that you did send to the Presidency which would be 
10 
maybe in the record relating to the Corruption Watch Matter or CASAC 
Matter where at some stage you say if I recall correctly although you 
say you do not know what media the President may have been referring 
to you say but what was said was accurate – was correct.  My 
understanding of what you said it is either in a letter or in an affidavit 
is where you were saying effectively I have not seen maybe the 
newspaper if it was a newspaper where I am alleged to have said – 
made those remarks or whatever the source or the media was.  But you 
say but that is actually correct.  Does that ring a bell at all? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  It does not ring a bell 
20 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It does not. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Ja but Chair I – I know 
that what then happened is in this – in the letter that I sent to the 
President or in this affidavit I said that I ended up speculating because 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 167 of 192 
 
I was required to – to respond.  But to be precise – to say precisely 
that this is the media comment that I made which the President is 
referring to as the media comment that is divisive and brings the NPA 
into disrepute I expected the President to tell me which of the media 
reports he was referring to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius is the letter that Mr Nxasana or his 
attorneys I think representations that he made is it here because it 
might be the one where my recollections or understanding at least is 
that he was saying in effect what is alleged is correct.  I might not know 
whether this was in this or that media but it is true.   
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What is annexed as MN5 is the 
draft submissions made by the NDPP to the Cassim Inquiry and a 
number of these matters are dealt with in those submissions.  But the 
letter … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no this would be … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But the letter as I understand it 
is not.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It would have been… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In other words the response to 
the letter at page 48 the letter of 30 July 2014 is not included in the 
20 
bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not included? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  It is – it… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  We could attempt to obtain it of 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 168 of 192 
 
course. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
I 
think 
you 
were 
– 
Mr 
Nxasana 
making 
representations. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the President as to why you should not be 
suspended. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think – I think the – I think that that is the letter 
because in regard to the establishment of the inquiry you were not 
asked to make representations whether there should be an inquiry or 
10 
not.  But in regard to whether you should or should not be suspended 
you were asked to make representations. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I think in response you then asked for 
particulars. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then – but you – you were not given particulars and I 
cannot remember whether you responded when you made your 
representations to the President whether you had already been told that 
you were not going to be given particulars or whether because there 
20 
seemed to be no response from the President to you asking for more 
time or whatever you then decided to make representations anyway.  
But I think it is in your representations on why you should not be 
suspended where I saw what I am talking about.  So if we do not have 
those here then – but I think there is somewhere where on my reading 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 169 of 192 
 
you seem to say what is alleged is true.  But you were querying I think 
maybe the media where it might have been reported.  You cannot 
remember? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I cannot remember Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  But in the same spirit here 
I think the point I was making here is that that did not take away the 
responsibility of the President to give me particulars of what he was 
alleging.  I may have made mention of media reports speculating but 
precisely which media comment that he was referring to it remained a – 
10 
he was expected to tell me which one was it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I think… 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  [Indistinct] considered 
divisive and bring the NPA into disrepute. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you may wish as I indicated earlier on after 
today to just go back to the record of that CASAC and – and Corruption 
Watch. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Corruption Watch. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Matter because there is a lot of material there.  You 
know and you were not – you – your participation in those proceedings 
20 
was limited. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Other parties participated very fully. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  [Indistinct] [mumbling]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But – and they attached to their affidavits some of the 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 170 of 192 
 
correspondence that the parties exchanged and at a certain stage the 
Presidency submitted to the court the record of the decisions that 
sought – was sought to be reviewed and then they got more 
correspondence that had been exchanged between yourself and the 
Presidency and then there was a supplementary affidavit.  So – so I am 
raising that partly because you out of not remembering you might say 
one thing but when you refresh your memory you will – you might have 
a better recollection of what the position was. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  [Not speaking into the 
microphone]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In any event Mr Nxasana you 
say in paragraph 56  
“Because I did not have the essential particulars of 
the allegations against me I could not say whether 
they were true or whether they were sufficiently 
serious to warrant suspension or whether they were 
such that it is not possible for me to interfere with an 
investigation into them or with witnesses who made 
them.” 
20 
Perhaps I am leading you unfairly but does that correctly reflect your 
position? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair.  Yes Chair it 
reflects my position.  I think it is – it is saying exactly what I – because 
I – I firmly believed that I was not getting a fair hearing if I was not 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 171 of 192 
 
informed precisely of what the President was referring to. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It appears that the response to 
your complaints by the President were to the effect that it appears 
apparent from your initial response that you were aware of the matters 
to which the President was referring and that you had sufficient 
information in order to enable you to make representations.  That was 
the position of the President. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That was the position of 
the President yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And we will look at the response 
10 
to the notice when we get it.  Over the page you deal with the Casim 
Inquiry.  Chair I am not sure that the fact that the President’s 
complaints in the terms of reference differed from the complaints in the 
submissions needs to be dealt with in any detail. The fact is that that 
inquiry did not commence.  What is of more concern is whether you 
require Mr Nxasana to go through his draft submissions because those 
deal in detail with many of the issues that have been discussed in 
evidence.  Because if that is so and if we cannot just have it as a 
matter of record we will take considerable amount of time to complete 
that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the – if the submissions are here it is not 
necessary to go into too much detail.  It might be important to just deal 
with the main fissures and to confirm that the – the submissions reflect 
what he – his views. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Let us first deal with the 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 172 of 192 
 
complaints you raised on page 14 and 15 of your statement.  
Essentially what you are saying here is that the President’s complaint 
as expressed in the terms of reference differed fundamentally from the 
complaints that were put up to Advocate Casim in the course of the 
inquiry.  
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If you can highlight for the Chair 
the essential differences between the two.  I am not sure that that is a 
fair question to you but in what respect did they differ fundamentally as 
opposed to in formal detail? 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair the complaints that 
he had – the President had mentioned in his terms of reference some of 
them when he instituted – when he appointed the Casim Inquiry he did 
not put them as the – as the complaints.  I think that is the point that I 
was making and then I make reference to – to the – to those here in – 
from paragraph – from page 14 to page 15.  I think also page 16 as 
well.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you can mention one or two – two or three 
fundamental differences and then – then we can move on. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair the complaint … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was what the inquiry was required to do is to 
determine whether you were fit to continue in office as the NDPP. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And was the factual basis on which it was supposed 
to determine that issue or were the factual basis the issue of the 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 173 of 192 
 
assault conviction and the murder acquittal and the absence of a 
clearance certificate.  What was the context of that – of that – that 
function, that brief on the part of the inquiry? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Okay.  Chair the letter that 
I received from the President or the minutes dated the 30 July 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  It is on page 48.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Page what? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  48. 
CHAIRPERSON:  48. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  48. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And the last paragraph. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes but that is the notice of 
intention to suspend.  Here we are looking at the terms of reference as 
opposed to the submissions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no.  It says the inquiry will examine your fitness 
to hold the office as National Director of Public Prosecutions having 
regard to whether – so it is exactly what we are looking for. 
1. The criminal conviction which you possess for violent conduct. 
20 
2. Reported comments in the media are unbecoming of a National 
Director of Public Prosecutions divisive and have the effect of 
bringing the National Prosecuting Authority into disrepute. 
3. The lack of disclosure of the facts and circumstances of 
prosecutions 
which 
you 
faced 
are 
consonant 
with 
the 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 174 of 192 
 
conscientiousness and integrity of an incumbent to the office of 
NDPP.” 
So the factual basis for the establishment of the inquiry. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Were these three. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was the – it was these three grounds. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So if I might just clarify Chair.  
In paragraph 60 and 61 what the – what Mr Nxasana is saying here is 
that the terms of reference published on the 9 February 2015 deal with 
10 
the issues in paragraph 61 and in contrast to that the submissions on 
behalf of the President the Minister filed on Monday for May 2015 were 
different to the complaints in the terms of reference.  So he is 
comparing two different things.  And perhaps if we just look at 
paragraph 61. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Because the letter to which we 
have referred was the letter inviting him to make representations in 
regard to suspension.  And maybe that is a third difference but not the 
differences referred to here. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but – well for me it is helpful insofar as it tells me 
what the President thought as at 30 July 2014. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The inquiry would look into and on what grounds but 
of course to the extent that the same issue is dealt with elsewhere we 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 175 of 192 
 
must look – look at other – other documents as well. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  So is it correct that the 
terms of reference in summary referred to two previous separate 
convictions on charges of assault referred to complaints of profession 
misconduct laid against you with the KwaZulu Natal Law Society.  
Referred to you having faced criminal charges for acts of violence. 
Referred to your arrest and detention on criminal charges albeit 
unspecified and referred to the media statements bringing the NDPP 
and NPA into disrepute, is that correct? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes and any other matter 
10 
yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes that is important.  And the 
terms of reference also referred to any other matter as might be 
relevant to the abovementioned issues and your fitness and propriety to 
hold office. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So that is an open door for 
further allegations. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The complaints in paragraph 63 
20 
you summarise the complaints in the submission and you say that what 
was complained of in the submissions against you was firstly that 
before your appointment you had failed to disclose to the President or 
his advisors that you had two previous convictions for assault, correct? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 176 of 192 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That secondly you had failed to 
take steps to expedite the finalisation of a complaint to the Law Society 
by Mr Jabulani Mtshali against you in 2008. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  A slightly different emphasis 
from what had been raised earlier. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  From what – yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And thirdly that in your security 
clearance application you failed to disclose that during 1985 you had 
been acquitted on a charge of murder and that during October 2012 you 
10 
had been arrested but not charged for inconsiderate driving. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  But Chair I think most 
importantly what you have omitted to read that in that security 
clearance application questionnaire in answers to the following 
question “ 
CHAIRPERSON:  ADV JULIE ANN HOWARD:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  “Have you ever been 
convicted or are there any pending cases for a criminal or department 
case?” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Departmental case.  Then 
– because this is very important.  This is what the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it is important.  You are right. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  It is very important 
because the security clearance is written in this fashion. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 177 of 192 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And he says that I failed to 
disclose this.  But if you look at it it is not the – it is not… 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is you failed to disclose an acquittal. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  An acquittal which is not – 
which is not what is asked. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Actually – actually you – you – if you – if you had said 
I was acquitted bla, bla, bla anybody reading that would have said what 
is this person talking about.  The question was about conviction. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  It is – that is it Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And secondly the same logic 
applies to the fact that you were arrested but not charged for 
inconsiderate driving during October 2012. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Exactly.  But I think in 
simple layman’s term if you are arrested not charged you as good as 
you are not convicted you are not prosecuted. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I mean the – there is no 
issue.  I do not know why [indistinct]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  It would be different if the question was have you 
ever been arrested. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Arrested yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  It would have been 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 178 of 192 
 
different. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then you were also charged 
here with failing to disclose whether you had taken any steps to resolve 
your complaint against the two police officers who arrested you 
unlawfully during October 2012 for inconsiderate driving.  I am not sure 
that that is covered by the security clearance question either? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No it is not. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Not at all. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In any event there does appear 
10 
to be a difference in detail and emphasis. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  In detail and emphasis yes 
Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You point out in paragraph 64 on 
page 16 that certain complaints did not fall within the terms of 
reference.  That is an analysis that one could do in due course with 
reference to what you say here.   
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is so Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  My concern Chair is in relation 
to the preparation of the submission for the Casim Inquiry.  In that 
20 
submission Mr Nxasana sets out in some details the merits of the 
complaints against him.  Now the merits of the complaint against him 
may be relevant to a different inquiry as to whether there was merit.  In 
relying on these allegations as they were with the time lapse and for 
that reason I have taken a slightly different view from the view I had 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 179 of 192 
 
earlier that one could just simply place them on record.  So my view 
subject to what you say Chair is that we should deal with them albeit by 
highlighting.  Otherwise we can take them as read if Mr Nxasana simply 
confirms but I do suspect that if we are to go through them in any detail 
in fact I more than suspect I am quite certain we will not finish by six. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the terms of reference of the inquiry whereas – 
did you say were such that anything could be added as the inquiry was 
going on? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is how it – the terms of reference read? 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The – any other matter? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Any other matter as might 
be relevant but to the abovementioned issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  To the issues that were 
mentioned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We – which … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  The one two previous 
convictions, complaints of professional misconduct.  My having faced 
20 
criminal charges for acts of violence.  My arrest and detention on 
criminal charges, media statements either issued by me or on my 
instruction that undermined or brought the office of the NDPP or the 
NPA into disrepute. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well there may be allegations that were made which 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 180 of 192 
 
have never been substantiated by anybody in any forum.  Allegations 
made – there may be allegations that were included in the submissions 
against Mr Nxasana which were never substantiated by anybody or by 
any evidence because the Casim Inquiry did not proceed.  And it may 
well be that and then of course there is the issue of the settlement 
agreement.  The terms of the settlement agreement where the 
President as I recall the terms thereof specifically acknowledges that 
Mr Nxasana was suitable to hold as I recall any senior public service 
position.  I think at some stage I thought it says specifically to hold the 
position of NDPP. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think – I think that might be Mr Vusi Pikoli’s 
settlement agreement because there was some similarity between the 
two settlement agreements.  I think Mr Nxasana’s one says any senior 
position in the public service.  Mr Nxasana is that your recollection as 
well? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is my recollection 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair it is there on page – 
20 
on paragraph 82.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Paragraph 82.1? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  82.1 that is the last 
paragraph on page 22.  The last sentence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The source of the dispute was effect… 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 181 of 192 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  The last sentence I said.  
The last from the bottom line. 
“My fitness and proprietary was agreed to and 
recorded by the President and Minister in the 
settlement 
agreement 
and 
did 
not 
contend 
otherwise before court.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but what I am saying is I seem to have - my 
understanding is that in your settlement agreement what was said was 
that they considered that you were fit to hold any senior position in the 
Public Service and maybe they can then argument that any senior 
10 
position in the Public Service would include the position of NDPP. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  May I read it Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes please, ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Although it is not before you.  
Mr Nxasana may recall the wording. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine, ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The wording that we have on 
record Mr Nxasana which you may recall and comment on now is the 
following: 
“The President recognises that the 
NDPP is 
20 
professionally competent, sufficiently experienced 
and conscientious and has the requisite integrity to 
hold a senior public position both in the public and 
private sector.” 
Is that the recollection? 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 182 of 192 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is - that is the 
recollection. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Does that accord with your 
recollection? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes, yes Chair.  That does. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and the reference to conscientiousness and 
integrity is that taken from the … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  From … 
CHAIRPERSON:  National Prosecuting Authority Act as requirements to 
be made by an NDPP? 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes.  It is - it is actually 
taken from Section 179 of the Constitution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the Constitution? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I think that needs to  
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Read together with - I 
think - Section 22 of the NPA Act. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think that - that maybe relevant to the question you 
were raising Mr Pretorius because if at the time of settlement the 
President effectively acknowledged that Mr Nxasana was - had all that 
20 
was required for him to be and continue to be the NDPP. 
Then maybe whatever he may have said or may have been 
said in submissions on his behalf might be neither here nor there 
because it may reflect that at the time of the submissions he may have 
been thinking in a certain way but at the time of the settlement he had 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 183 of 192 
 
a certain view and that view was that he meets the requirements. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It just depends whether the terms which you have 
read capture the requirements in the Act for - for somebody who is 
NDPP. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair we can extract those 
now from the National Prosecuting Authority Act.  What are their 
requirements for appointment?  We can deal with that briefly.  If Chair 
the assessment that you ultimately will make of all these facts is 
determined by the ultimate concession that there were indeed no 
10 
grounds as conceded by the President in the settlement agreement that 
is one approach but it may be of interest to determine whether the 
grounds raised in the inquiry were at the outset spurious or … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Advised … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And that this was merely … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  (Indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, maybe it is better to deal - to be on the safe side.  
20 
I do not know. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am - I am not ruling.  I am … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair as long as I can lay it at 
your door.  No Chair I … 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 184 of 192 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the fact of the matter is why would the - why 
would the inquiry be terminated if there were grounds for it to continue 
and make a determination? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Precisely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because - well of course I think the settlement 
agreement says the parties recognise that protracted litigation was not 
in the interest of anybody and all of that.  So … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But is it a matter of principle 
that should be settled in that manner … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see … 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I think that is something that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see.  Ja that maybe another question. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That was considered by the 
Constitutional Court.  Can you see these matters … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I - I … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Of principle? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think it might be safer to let him deal to a limit - to 
some extent with the merits on a basis that if anybody does come and 
give evidence he might have to brought back, give evidence because if 
- if anybody comes and gives details to the complaints. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So if we may then go to 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 185 of 192 
 
Annexure MN5 that is at page 51. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I have it here.  Yes I have 
it. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And if we could go to page 57 
paragraph 20. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  I see at page 51 what may 
have caused you to refer to Mr Mdladla as Mlala.  I see there is - there 
is a misplacing of the surname here.  So probably that is where you got 
that from but it is Mdladla but I think this is where you got it from. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If you could then go to page 57. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Here you deal with the merits of 
the issues raised either in the terms of reference or in the complaint as 
submitted to Advocate Cassim.  Correct? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes I do. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And briefly in relation to the two 
convictions for assault meaning that you are not fit and proper to be 
the NDPP.  What was your submission briefly? 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you said earlier on that you had disclosed the 
conviction for assault … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Assault ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you applied for admission as an attorney to the 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 186 of 192 
 
Law Society. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Do you want to deal with that? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - you - I think you made that point … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I am - I do not think that is the complete point 
that you made. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Perhaps if that can be 
explained Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  The conviction of assault, was the - 
was … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Deal with the allegations in 
paragraph 24. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Was the fact that … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You had been convicted of assault in 19 - is it 85? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  85. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1985, was that a ground to render you unfit to hold 
office as NDPP? 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair I - I made the 
submission that my - my view was that it - it was not a ground - a 
ground to render me unfit.  I say that I was very young.  I think I was 
about 17 or 18 years old when I was convicted of those assaults and 
the - the convictions occurred almost more than 30 years before my 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 187 of 192 
 
appointment. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  When you were 17 and 18? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you disclosed this to - when you applied for - for 
admission as an attorney? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair and I 
disclosed also - firstly I disclosed when I registered my articles. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes to the Law Society. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  To the Law Society and I 
also disclosed it when I applied … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  To be - to be admitted as 
an attorney. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Was it held to be something that rendered you 
unfit to be an attorney? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No.  I was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The High Court admitted you as an attorney … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  The High Court admitted … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Even though it was aware you had a common assault 
… 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Conviction that had happened some time before? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 188 of 192 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair I think I must pause 
here and mention that the - the way these previous convictions were so 
old … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I - I could not even 
remember the details of the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Previous convictions and 
when I applied to the Law Society - in fact how I also came to know that 
10 
there were two convictions is when a lady at NPA.  She was at the - I 
think she was at the risk and what-what unit.  She then asked to 
conduct some vetting and then she came back to me and said I have 
two previous convictions of assault and in my mind I - I only knew one 
and then I was worried which was - which one was she talking about 
and it was - it was there on my record and it assisted me a lot because 
when I completed the security clearance certificate I mentioned it and I 
said although I cannot remember what - what it was about but because 
of the passage of - of age and yes those were - because I remember 
that I think the - the record says in - the one that I know very well was 
20 
the conviction at Ngengoma (?) where I - I was sentenced to pay I think 
a fine of R50,00 or 30 days imprisonment. 
Then I paid a fine.  I cannot remember whether it - it was 30 
days, it was R30,00 or 50 but that is what I - I - the recollection that I 
have.  Then the other one said I was convicted in Durban for assault 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 189 of 192 
 
common in 1984 or 85.  I cannot remember what - what was that about 
but it said I was cautioned and discharged. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Even today you do not remember? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I cannot remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I cannot remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It looks like to me we cannot finish by six. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  There is a little way to go. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Must you go back to Durban this evening 
Mr Nxasana? 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja I know.  We - we cannot finish. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In fairness to all parties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Including those who wish to 
justify the inquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  So I think that therefore we may as well 
adjourn now but also adjourning might be important from the point of 
view of affording Mr Nxasana time to get those documents that he may 
wish to use to refresh his memory on some of the things.  You know do 
20 
you have - do you remember whether you have got a full set of the 
papers that were involved in the corruption watch matter? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  We can provide Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, because you might wish - some of the things we - 
we might be taking long about some of the things because you have to 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 190 of 192 
 
try and remember. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whereas if you have had a chance to go through most 
of those - some of those things it would be easier.  Well we - one, we 
can - we can adjourn but whatever is left I do not imagine we would 
need more than two hours? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No Chair.  Two hours would do 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  In which case we can arrange to continue on the 
day on which we continue we could start earlier than normal - earlier 
10 
than 10 o’ clock.  If we start for example at nine then we would - 
hopefully we would be done by 11 and the witness for the day who 
would have started at 10 will just be delayed by one hour.  That is one 
option. 
Another option is that we - we could even do the days witness 
and then maybe start late after that witness.  Maybe the morning one 
might be better. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It sounds so, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It sounds better.  So - so but it - it should if possible 
not be too far from now.  Mr Nxasana do - do you know when you might 
20 
have that two hours in the morning - when next you might have that 
time?  Of course coming from Durban it will not be two hours for you. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It - it would - it would mean half a day with the 
travelling. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 191 of 192 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair.  I - I will have 
to confer with my - I did not bring my diary with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Alright.  I think let us leave it on the basis 
that Mr Nxasana will - you will talk to each other. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  To a date to be arranged. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair can I - may I just read for 
completion of today … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Section 9 to which reference was 
10 
made earlier of the NPA Act … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Regarding the qualifications for 
office? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Section 9.1 reads: 
“Any person to be appointed as National Director, 
Deputy National Director or Director must a, 
possess legal qualifications that would entitle him 
or her to practice in all courts in the Republic and 
20 
b, be a fit and proper person with due regard to his 
or her experience, conscientiousness and integrity 
to be entrusted with the responsibilities of the 
office concerned.” 
So there is a coincidence in language. 
19 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 147 
 
Page 192 of 192 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja.  Ja.  No that is fine.  Okay.  I think we - we 
must adjourn and then another date should be arranged.  I hope it will 
not be beyond next week if possible but it is subject to Mr Nxasana’s 
practice as well and what he has in his diary but let us try and see 
whether by end of this week the date has been finalised.  Okay.  
Mr Nxasana so we will adjourn on - on that understanding. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  On that understanding, 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Mr Pretorius we will adjourn then on that 
basis. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Tomorrow we will be starting at half past eight 
and we will be resuming the evidence of Mr Thabethe, the Head of 
Department - of the Department of Agriculture in the Free State in 
regard to the Vrede Dairy matter.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 20 AUGUST 2019
