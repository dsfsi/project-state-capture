PROCEEDINGS ON 5 JUNE 2019 
CHAIRPERSON:  It looks like we are not ready.  I will adjourn.  I will 
adjourn for five minutes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  My apologies Chair. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody.  
Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes are we ready? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Apologies for the delay 
Chair one of the technological devices on which we rely decided to give 
up the ghost. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay.  No that is fine.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair we are continuing with the 
evidence of Dr Bloom and hope to finalise today.  In fact we will make 
every effort to finalise today and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And we might even finish a little 
20 
earlier than four o’clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  Dr Bloom. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The oath – you – you do understand that the oath you 
took the other day continues to apply until you have finished your 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 3 of 143 
 
evidence? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You consider yourself still under that oath? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  I do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Just by way of summary and 
introduction to today’s evidence Dr Bloom we will deal with and have 
dealt with three transactions.  The first is the – what was the referred 
to as the CDB loan the China Development Bank loan in an amount of 
2.5 billion dollars originally. 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You told the Chair that that was 
split into two amounts.  An amount of 1.5 billion dollars and an amount 
of 1 billion dollars.  The latter amount of 1 billion dollars was never 
utilized and in fact fell away. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It was replaced by the second 
loan that you spoke about and we will also speak about today and that 
is a 1 billion dollar facility that was abandoned and the 12 billion club 
loan syndicated club loan that you spoke about? 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The former loan the 1.5 
remaining China Development Bank loan was a cross border loan? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The latter was a domestic loan? 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 4 of 143 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Albeit syndicated.  Then you will 
talk later in your evidence of a third amount and that is an existing 
Transnet debt of R11.3 billion.  
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That was hedged by means of a 
swop.  In other words financial instruments used to protect against risk 
were utilised. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  If we can then just go 
10 
back please to page 21 of Exhibit BB8[d].  Are you there? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  This is the diagram that we dealt 
with at the conclusion of our evidence last week explaining one of the 
financial instruments used to protect or hedge against risk. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you going to deal with an 
interest rate swop which was the financial instrument or hedge 
instrument used in this particular case in relation to the 12 billion club 
loan. 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  So what happens is if we 
can just summarise this because it is relevant to the next trip – part of 
your evidence.  On the right hand side of the diagram you have the 
original loan.  So there is a consortium of lenders or the club they lend 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 5 of 143 
 
money to the borrower Transnet? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The loan agreement was entered 
into or an amount of R12 billion? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  12 billion ne? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  R12 billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Billion hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And the interest rate… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you said – you may have said 12 million. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Oh did I?  Yes that may be my 
sinus issue.  But let us not go there Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  R12 billion.   
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  And there was floating 
interest rate? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Entered into and you told the 
Chair that that agreement was entered into on the 23 November 2015? 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  You also told the Chair 
that days later Transnet entered into a separate and discreet 
agreement involving a financial transaction the goal of which 
purportedly at least was to protect Transnet against the risk arising 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 6 of 143 
 
from it having entered into a floating rate interest rate agreement? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And that is on the left hand side 
of the page.  Transnet was the one counter party and Nedbank was the 
other counter party. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Correct.  We just summarising 
what we would have stated to the Chair although not completely once 
more.  So in essence what Transnet says to itself I have entered into a 
large loan of R12 billion at a floating interest rate. 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I have a risk.  The interest rate 
may rise to the extent that it may cause financial problems.  I may not 
be in a position to pay an ever increasing floating interest rate on this 
capital amount of R12 billion? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It then says I am going to seek 
out a counter party with whom I can transact in order to protect myself 
against the risk? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I will enter into this agreement 
as you explained to the Chair on the basis that I forecast that interest 
rates are going to rise? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If I can find someone who will 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 7 of 143 
 
enter into a transaction with me on its understanding that interest rates 
will not rise and that the fixed rate will always be higher than the 
floating rate then we can enter into a negotiation and enter into a 
swop? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you described the stances 
that each party takes – each counter party takes in entering into such 
an arrangement.  So for as long as the floating rate is higher than the 
fixed rate Transnet will stand to gain? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Because – and for as long as the 
fixed rate is lower than the – is higher than the floating rate then 
Nedbank stands to gain? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So when you say in the diagram 
Nedbank pays the floating rate to Transnet and Transnet pays the fixed 
rate to the counter party Nedbank they do not actually do that? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair it is notional. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It is notional and it is just the 
difference between the two what you call the nett cash flow of netting 
20 
off those two amounts that is paid by one party to the other? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What happened in this case? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  In this particular case the rates were 
fixed at a – at quite a high level and Transnet as indicated were paying 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 8 of 143 
 
the fixed rate and Nedbank would notionally be paying the floating rate 
and essentially what has happened up to now which we will see also 
later Chair is that the floating rates have never exceeded the fixed 
rates and they actually have never even come close to exceeding the 
fixed rates. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well just before you proceed on that.   
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You stated that this happened within a matter of days. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right?  Now I think when we last discussed this 
here one of the issues I had raised was that one would have expected 
Transnet to have done its homework before entering into the floating 
interest rate regime.   
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And assuming that it had done its homework then one 
must conclude that it had reached the conclusion that it was better to 
go with the floating interest rate regime rather than a fixed rate 
regime? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  What are the chances that if they had done their 
homework before entering into the floating interest rate arrangement 
that within a matter of days they would have a different forecast of how 
the interest were likely to – to go over the years of the transaction or 
what are the chances that like if you do your homework and you come 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 9 of 143 
 
to the conclusion today that the – the best regime for you is a floating 
interest rate for the next ten years or whatever the period is that after a 
few days you could have a completely different opinion and now seek to 
have a fixed rate.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair that seems to be strange 
because in terms of and we will see later as well that in terms of the 
risk management framework policy of Transnet that they would – if they 
made a decision to fix the rates at that point in time if that decision – 
given that they swopped it three days later if they made that decision 
then it would have been in line with the risk management framework.  In 
10 
this particular case it was not in line with the risk management 
framework policy and they would have made a call prior to actually 
entering into the loan on the 23 November that interest – these – this is 
what we expect interest rates to do in the next – in the short term, in 
the medium term and potentially the long term and they would have 
locked in the appropriate rate at that point in time not three days later.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is quite strange that there was this change of or 
what appears to be a change of view? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay thank you. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I think in the course of your 
evidence to come your view is a little stronger than strange but let me 
not put words in your mouth and we will deal with the question in detail 
Chair.  But perhaps one should flag one issue for the moment.  The 
content of the swop arrangement between the two counter parties 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 10 of 143 
 
Nedbank and Transnet is essentially Nedbank says you pay me the 
fixed rate and I will pay you the floating rate we will nett the two off 
and that sum will either go to you Transnet or go to Nedbank. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Depending on which is the 
higher? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  So Nedbank assumes the 
risk on the basis that if the floating rate remains low contrary to the 
predictions of Transnet it will profit? 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  On the other hand Transnet says 
if the floating rate does rise I am protected because all I have to do is 
pay the fixed rate? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But we should flag an issue 
here.  The fixed rate is that the rate the market rate at which the loan 
could have been entered into in the first place or is it a different fixed 
rate? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair there are – there are two – 
20 
there are two rates.  The one – when you pricing these types of 
transactions in other words you going into the market to find out okay 
so if I wanted a fixed rate who is prepared to give me a fixed rate and 
at what rate?   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Are you talking about in a swop 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 11 of 143 
 
transaction? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  In a swop transaction.  And you 
would – you would look at what the market says.  Then it would become 
a negotiation in terms of – but this is what the market says but as the 
person that is demanding the fixed rate in other words I am prepared to 
pay it is – it will be a higher rate.  So that is the – there are two – when 
we talk about the fixed rates in this particular context we talking about 
two rates.  The one that is market related and the other one is – is the 
actual rate that is concluded in a negotiation and agreed to. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In the swop 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  In the swop. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So had Transnet in November 
2015 decided to enter into a loan at a fixed rate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Is that outside?  Is that noise from 
outside?  Ja it looks like it is from outside.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I am told it is outside Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well somebody will try and see if we – there is 
any chance of them – of the noise not affecting us in any serious way.  
Okay let us proceed in the meantime. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Mr Brown we were dealing then 
20 
with the two fixed interest rates amounts.  But in lay language if I – if 
Transnet had entered into a fixed rate at the time the floating rate 
agreement was entered into if it had decided wisely in your view to 
simply say I want a fixed loan not a floating interest rate loan it would 
have done so at a rate determined largely not totally by the market? 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 12 of 143 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  However in this case when it 
enters into the swop arrangement with the counter party Nedbank the 
fixed rate is not the market rate it is a negotiated rate? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Which in this case and ordinarily 
would be higher that the market rate? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair yes but only – only slightly 
because the market rate is – from a fixed rate perspective would be the 
base and then there are certain small adjustments that are made for 
10 
further risk that is taken by the counter party.  So it would not – it 
would not be substantially higher it would be a couple of tenths of a 
percent more. But it will not be – it will not be significant.  It is just 
merely that – that counter parties assume further – assume further risk 
and therefore compensate for that risk in adding a couple of tenths of a 
percent to a – to the fixed base rate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So when entering into the swop 
arrangement it is not as if I simply put myself in the position I would 
have been had I entered into a fixed rate.  I am paying a premium on 
20 
the fixed rate in the swop arrangement? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In this case was the difference 
between the market rate or what you call the mid-market rate and he 
actual fixed rate paid in the swop minor or substantial? 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 13 of 143 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Substantial Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So it seems what you are saying 
it was exceptional? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right if we can then go on to 
page 22.  You say there in the first bullet and perhaps you should tell 
the Chair what you say by way of summary of what we have been 
dealing with up to now. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So essentially as we indicated there 
are two – there are two counter parties in the transaction.  The one that 
10 
is willing to pay the fixed rate and the other one that is willing to pay a 
floating rate on the notional amount.  In other words on the principle, 
the capital amount and these rates what is important and it will come 
out later as well are exchanged over a period of time in terms of an 
agreement and that could be on a – it is normally on a quarterly basis 
or it could be any other time frame but in this particular instance it was 
over a fifteen year period on every quarter.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then let us go to page – did you 
deal with the second bullet? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  No I have – I have not dealt with it 
20 
Chair – the second bullet.  So it essentially relates to the first one 
Chair and the base rate that they – in terms I think this is important 
just to clarify.  That the base rate on floating because there is a base 
rate for fixed, there is base rate for floating is a rate that is used by – 
that is determined by the banks in Johannesburg called the JIBAR and 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 14 of 143 
 
then a counter party in terms of providing or entering into a rate regime 
would add a margin to that.  So it would be the JIBAR rate plus a 
percentage to – and that would become your floating rate. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And we will deal with the 
differences between market and swop rates in a moment? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then if we could go to the next 
page please where you make further points about the swop instrument. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair by way of summary the – you 
enter into a swop arrangement because the two counter parties have 
10 
different or opposing views.  Because if the one wants a fixed the other 
one would want a floating etcetera, etcetera.  So it is a mechanism to 
lower the cost of money or the cost of debt if you like in terms of what 
one would – which one would achieve.  But also that would happen 
initially but then the market forces kick in and it will result in either 
increasing or decreasing but that is why swop transactions are done 
because of two counter parties having opposing views. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right and of course it only offers 
you a what you term a lower cost of money if the market moves in 
accordance with your predictions? 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If it does not you stand to lose? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  As Transnet did in this case? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes, yes Chair. 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 15 of 143 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So you make that point in the 
second bullet would you just deal with that please? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So essentially if – if Transnet entered 
into a fixed rate if we can use an example of 15% and the other counter 
party entered into a floating rate of say 12%.  So Transnet would pay 
fixed 15 or notionally and the other – the counter party would pay 12 
and then the difference would be paid depending on the situation.  But 
if floating rates were to increase – let us assume that the floating rate 
went from 12 percentage points to 13 and the – remember the fixed rate 
– the fixed rate is still 15 then the – that is beneficial to Transnet or to 
10 
the fixed rate payer in this particular case.  If floating rates went in the 
opposite direction in other words if it went from – maybe from 12 to 11 
then that is not beneficial to Transnet it is beneficial to the counter 
party paying the floating rate. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So let us use an extreme 
example because often extreme examples illustrate the point better.  
Let us assume that in the swop transaction Transnet has demanded or 
has agreed to pay – Transnet has demanded and Nedbank the counter 
party has agreed to pay a fixed rate to Transnet or allow Transnet to 
pay a fixed rate of 15%.  Right. 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Let us assume the interest rate, 
floating interest rate skyrocket to 20% then who gains and who loses? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Transnet would gain because their 
rate remains fixed and the floating party or the counter party paying the 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 16 of 143 
 
floating rate would have to… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  To Transnet? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Notionally. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Would have to pay that difference 
between the 15 and the 20. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If the floating rate however does 
not go anywhere near 15% but in fact remains around 10% who wins 
and who loses? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Transnet would lose because they 
10 
pay fixed rate irrespective of the movement in market rates and the 
beneficial party in this particular case then would be the counter party 
paying the floating rate in Nedbank [indistinct]. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So all the counter party Nedbank 
has to do is pay Transnet the floating rate of 12% it is receiving the 
equivalent of 15%? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the – is the principle that the party that favours 
fixed – a fixed rate gains if the floating rate increases above the fixed 
rate and loses if the floating interest rate goes below the fixed rate to 
20 
which they have agreed? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then there is a creature in 
the market called the swops dealer that is the counter party that is to 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 17 of 143 
 
go back to our earlier analogy the insurer. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And the dealer makes a profit as 
you and the Chair have just exchanged views about, where do the 
dealers make their profit as it were? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair the dealer makes profit 
because – as I indicated previously you – there are two fixed rates.  
The one is the market rate and the other one is if you like the 
negotiated rate.  So the dealer would say this is what the market rate is 
what I would be able to get in the market and the negotiated rate is 
10 
what I conclude with a – a counter party.  So the difference between 
the market rate slightly adjusted for – as for the risks as I indicated 
and the actual negotiated rate is the profit that the dealer would make.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Is part of the profit the dealer 
would make? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Party – Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes well and that difference 
between the market fixed rate and the negotiated fixed rate and the 
swop is what the experts and yourself refer to as the  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  They are called – a Delta. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  A Delta and we will come to that 
later in graphic form.  But let us just clarify for the sake of 
completeness.  If market rates move in favour of the counter party 
Nedbank then it makes a profit there? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 18 of 143 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Or it profits put it that way 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  There is a second source of gain 
for an institution such as Transnet the counter party and that is the 
source of gain to which you have just now referred.  Because out in the 
market Nedbank would blown money at a fixed rate of say 12% correct? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But here it is paying the fixed 
rate at a negotiated amount of – or it is not it is being paid a fixed rate 
by Transnet at 13% and that difference between 12 and 13 is an added 
10 
source of gain for the counter party? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  I am not sure if that is 
clear if you want us to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think it is clear but I wanted to clarify in the context 
of the reference to a dealer.  In this transaction between Transnet and 
Nedbank who would be the dealer? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair the – in this particular case for 
the club loan because that is essentially what we talking about.  The 
counter – the one counter party was Transnet the other counter party 
20 
was Nedbank as we know and Regiments was the exe- what is called 
the executing agent.  In other word the party that does the trades.  In 
other words actually executes the transaction or the swop every 
quarter.  But I think it is important to also note that either of the 
counter parties can also be the executing agent.  It is not necessary for 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 19 of 143 
 
an external party to be able to do the types of swops that we are 
referring to now because these are as we will see later as well these 
are called vanilla swops.  It is also a term that is used in the industry in 
other words to be put it in – to simplify Chair it is stock standard that 
anybody – it is not – there is nothing untoward about it.  It is a very 
straightforward transaction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There are no special features. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So to speak, ja. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you have stated earlier and 
you will repeat today that Transnet Treasury had capacity.  Was its 
capacity sufficient enough to execute these trades? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is – that is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
So 
the 
appointment 
of 
Regiments as executing agency was that necessary in order for these 
swaps to be executed? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At a practical level earlier on you said that - in 
20 
response to one of Mr Pretorius’ questions – there is no actual 
payment.  I assume that what you meant was there is no actual 
payment during a particular time but at a later stage then there would 
be or – or are you able to clarify that more? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  I can – I can Chair.  What is – what it 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 20 of 143 
 
means is in theory the one party would pay an amount of money based 
on a fixed rate to the other party and the other party in theory would 
pay an amount of money based on the floating rate to the other 
counterparty.  So instead of them both writing out a cheque the one to 
the other and the other – and vice versa they would look at what the 
two amounts were based on the fixed rate and based on the floating 
rate and then (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  The one who is supposed to pay the difference pays? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So only one pays and that is the one who is so to 
10 
speak prejudiced by the - the interest rate at the time? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair.  There can only 
be one winner. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There can only be one winner? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay but how – what is the frequency of those 
payments during that period of the arrangement? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair it depends on the agreement 
and the – the swap agreement – and in this particular case it is 
quarterly.  So ever quarter a … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  A swap transaction occurs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, but for all intents and purposes it can be 
whatever the parties agree upon? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 21 of 143 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Now a swap arrangement cannot exist 
without another arrangement.  In this case Nedbank and Transnet their 
– their swap arrangement needed the arrangement of the consortium 
with Transnet to be their first.  Is that right? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair.  In other words 
the loan. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  The one can exist without the other but the other 
cannot exist without the first one? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Now once Transnet had concluded the loan 
10 
agreement with the consortium and it had proceeded to conclude the 
swap arrangement with Nedbank what was there for Regiments to do 
after that?  Was there anything for Regiments to continue doing after 
the two arrangements had been concluded? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So in other words – except depending 
on how Regiments – if Regiments were doing the execution of the 
swaps in other words they were the executing agent.  Then they would 
do that swap every quarter. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So in other words they would remain 
involved in order as the – as the party doing the trade.  They would be 
involved in that for the duration of the agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  So the execution that you are talking about is 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 22 of 143 
 
the execution at the time of the conclusion of the arrangement except 
for the payments interval – intermittent payments? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright and then they get something each time 
they do their role to play? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair.  Every swap - 
every trade or every swap that they do … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  They would get a percentage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Like a commission? 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well they would do the maths 
every three months? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And obviously Transnet would 
check and itself do the maths? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes.  In other words … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And so would Nedbank.  They 
would not just accept at face value what Regiments tell them surely. 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Well in – in this particular instance 
Chair the fee that was paid to Regiments was included in the rate that 
Transnet paid Nedbank.  In other words it was not a – it was not a fee 
or a commission that Transnet paid Regiments.  It would – because the 
fee was included in the - what is called the yield or the rate it would 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 23 of 143 
 
have – they would have been paid by some other party. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But ultimately by Transnet? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Ultimately by Transnet through the 
rate. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  But practically or physically receiving 
payment would have been from somebody else. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And that was – that fee for 
Regiments - as I understand your evidence – was included in the fixed 
10 
rate paid as part of the swap as opposed to the midmarket rate? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right and you say that that 
margin – the delta as you refer to it – between the midmarket rate and 
the fixed rate actually incurred by Transnet in the swap was unusually 
high? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair and it included 
the Regiments fee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and the role of Regiments or any entity playing a 
similar role in regard to a swap does it include collecting the money 
20 
from whomever is supposed to pay during the intervals and then 
handing it over to the one who is supposed to – to receive the payment 
or do the two parties do the arrangement pay each other directly or 
whoever needs to pay directly or does it go via Regiments? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  It is - Chair it is merely an electronic 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 24 of 143 
 
– it is an electronic transaction where the two parties – where the 
money is netted off but essentially what it – what it comes down to is 
that Nedbank as the counterparty in this particular instance would issue 
confirmation notices of the transaction and that – and those 
confirmations would then be captured by Transnet’s dealing room as … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  As proof that the transaction has 
been concluded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So the flow of funds is – is 
10 
essentially an electronic calculation exercise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Dr Bloom I think I did tell you that my knowledge 
of some of these technological advances is limited.  So I am – I still 
think of actual payment. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  No Chair you are doing very well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But – but your answer seems to suggest that the 
payments do not – do not go via Regiments.  They go from Nedbank to 
Transnet directly electronically and vice versa depending on who is 
supposed to pay? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair in this particular – it depends 
20 
on the situation.  In this particular instance I am unsure how those 
payments were affected.  In other words if – if it was done via 
Regiments or not I am just aware of the fact that the fee for Regiments 
was included in the rate paid by Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Well part of the reason why I was asking was 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 25 of 143 
 
to try and place the role of an entity like Regiments into some other 
kind of role that one maybe much more used to like whether it is like an 
estate agent that collects rent and pays the landlord and so on.  So 
that is what I was trying to – to figure out but I think from your answer I 
can take it that you do not understand these – the role of an entity such 
as Regiments to necessarily include that any payment that must be 
made either to Transnet or Nedbank has to go via Regiments? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  We will come back to these 
10 
concepts in the course of your evidence and to the extent that further 
explanation is required in relation to any specialist concept.  We will 
deal with it then but for the moment we can close off this part of your 
evidence just to summarise to say that we are dealing here with a 
particular risk mitigation or risk avoidance financial instrument in other 
words a hedge of a particular nature that is an interest rate swap. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And that is particularly important 
where the loan is a domestic loan? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Now there are other 
hedging instruments or risk protection – protection against financial 
risk instruments – hedging instruments and you deal with those on page 
24.  Now we are not going to go into any detail but to say firstly in 
relation to the China Development Bank loan it was a cross border loan 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 26 of 143 
 
involving exchange rates which fluctuate? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Is there a hedging instrument 
that is used to protect against any loss that might be incurred by an 
adverse movement in exchange rates? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair.  It is called a 
Cross Currency Swap and it – and it – the intention of that is to 
especially in our particular case to cater for volatility in the Rand as we 
have seen.  So – because as we have – as we discussed previously it 
is necessary to repay the – the loan in the currency which it received it.  
10 
So to – to hedge against that it costs you money but it takes the – it 
takes the liquidity risk – if I can put it that way – out of the – out of the 
equation by entering into such an agreement. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you also enter into it with a 
counterparty.  It is a separate arrangement? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So where I borrow money from 
the China Development Bank I borrow it in Dollars.  I have got to 
exchange it into Rands and I have got to repay it across the border in 
Dollars as well? 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So there are interests – I mean 
– there are exchange rate on both sides of the equation on receipt and 
on repayment? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 27 of 143 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And I can enter into an 
arrangement with a third party – a counterparty – in order to protect 
myself against a risk of exchange rates moving adverse to my interest? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  That is enough I think on 
Cross Currency Swaps.  There are also credit default swaps and you 
mentioned two risks in your evidence last week to the Chair.  The one 
is where the borrower – Transnet – cannot pay because of factors due 
to its internal financing? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And there are risks associated 
with the failure to pay because of external factors such as a collapse in 
the economy or a downgrade? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  Would you explain how 
those risks are dealt with? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair.  The - Transnet entered 
into an agreement for a – if we can call it - a CCDS which is the 
Contingent Credit Default Swap. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Which is that? 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is the swap that you just 
referred to. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No what is the risk – sorry. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Oh the risk – sorry.  The risk – the 
risk is twofold.  The first one is the – to cover yourself against the 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 28 of 143 
 
inability or the default of not been able to pay interest on your loan.  
That is the first portion of it and then linked to that would be a situation 
where circumstances beyond your control as a – as a company prevent 
you from actually making good on your requirements in terms of the 
agreement.  So it is – it is – in other words it is actually taking out an 
additional portion of risk to cover that eventuality should it happen. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So if the adverse event against 
which you are seeking protection or insurance occurs what happens? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Well then the other party the party 
that you have entered into the swap with … 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The counterparty? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  The counterparty - if that event 
occurs would pay you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The full amount of the loan? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Well the – depending on what the 
agreement is and what the tranches are. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  To summarise then where 
one borrows money across the border and one faces a risk because of 
exchange rate fluctuations one can enter into a Cross Currency Swap 
which is a financial instrument entered into with a counterparty to 
20 
mitigate against risk? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And similarly where you wish to 
ensure against yourself being unable to pay interest rates or being 
unable to pay because of external market factors you can also enter 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 29 of 143 
 
into a financial instrument? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And those are called credit 
default swaps or Contingent Credit Default Swaps? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And the latter is external to 
Transnet.  The former is internal to Transnet? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But we need not go into any 
detail on those because we are going to concentrate on the interest 
10 
rate swaps.  Am I correct? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you make that point on page 
25.  What do you say there? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  It is essentially what we have been 
about Chair.  It is the agreement between two parties in which one 
stream of future interest payments is exchanged for another based on 
the principal amount.  So in other words as we have said it is 
exchanging a floating rate amount related to the loan for a fixed rate 
the difference as we said is paid to either of the counterparties. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  What do you say on 
page 26 in relation to Cross Currency Swaps?  Now those were actually 
entered into - were they? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  What is the point you 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 30 of 143 
 
make on page 26 from examining the Transnet records? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair in terms of the payment of fees 
related to the – the Cross Currency Swaps an amount of R7.5 million 
was paid by Transnet to Regiments for structuring and arranging the – 
the CCS’ – in other words the Cross Currency Swaps - but what is - and 
just note that Regiments was the Supply Development partner of JP 
Morgan.  In other words they worked together but what is interesting JP 
Morgan was appointed to do (indistinct) or to conduct these particular 
transactions.  So it is unclear why Regiments was paid R7.5 million by 
Transnet where if they were working on the transaction as JP Morgan 
10 
Supply Development partner then they would be paid by JP Morgan but 
they issued an invoice to Transnet for an amount R7.5 million but Chair 
what is – just to create the necessary context – last – when we met last 
time on Friday I indicated there was an amount of 166 million that was 
applicable to so called success fees paid to Regiments and I focussed 
specifically on 152 million of that 166 million and explained how that 
was all done and where that number came from.  Now included in that 
166 million paid by Transnet to Regiments was this 7.5 million.  So it 
could never have – Regiments could never have been paid that amount 
by Transnet for work that they did on this particular transaction.  So it 
20 
is – I have indicated it is nothing else but – but fraud.  It is unjustified 
and unwarranted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do – do we know whether as a matter of fact JP 
Morgan performed the job – this – the job that Regiments was paid 
R7.5 million for? 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 31 of 143 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair they would – they did – they 
were appointed to pay the Cross Currency Swaps … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  And there were 25 drawdowns … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  And this relates to the CDB loan. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  There were 25 drawdowns on that 
loan … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  And they would have done – at each 
draw down … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  They would have applied a Cross 
Currency Swap. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm.  Well I – you say they would have and I am 
trying to look at would have and whether they actually did. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair I given that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you in a position to say yes as a matter of fact 
they did it or I would – or you are only able to say I would have 
20 
expected them to have done it? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair I did not see the agreements … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Which regulate the Cross Currency 
Swaps between Transnet and JP Morgan per se. 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 32 of 143 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So I – I cannot say that – that it did 
happen … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Or it did not happen … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  But I am in terms of the drawdowns 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Transnet entered into an agreement 
10 
to apply these swaps … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  And therefore I would – I would 
(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  JP Morgan - in terms of the agreements which you did 
see JP Morgan – this – performing this task fell within what they were 
required to do? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you are able to say? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  What you cannot say is whether they actually did it? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that might require some other – somebody to look 
more closely and to whether they did it but if the payment that they 
were paid – JP Morgan – so the payment that they - that was made by 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 33 of 143 
 
Transnet to them should give an indication or even their invoices would 
give an indication whether they actually did that part of the job and 
then if they did not do it – it maybe that then it might not be fraud 
against Regiments if they actually did the job but if JP Morgan did the 
job and Regiments did not do that job because it had already been 
done then it would be fraud.  Is that right? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Let us try and understand the 
essence of what you are saying here with reference to the content of 
10 
page 26.  In relation to the China Development Bank loan it was 
deemed necessary by Transnet to enter into a risk avoidance or a risk 
protection hedging mechanism.  Correct? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That was called a Cross 
Currency Swap.  Correct? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Regiments was not appointed to 
do anything in relation to the Cross Currency Swap? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  JP Morgan was appointed to do 
that work? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You say that despite the fact 
that it was not appointed to do the Cross Currency Swap it nevertheless 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 34 of 143 
 
invoiced Transnet for R7.5 million and said I helped my partner to do 
it? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you say that that in your 
opinion and understanding is unjustified and unwarranted and amounts 
to fraud? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So are you saying then that as 
far as your knowledge goes Regiments was not appointed to nor 
entitled to issue an invoice for R7.5 million? 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Not to Transnet Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  It could have an internal 
arrangement with Regiments – sorry – an internal arrangement with JP 
Morgan its partner? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And that – but that internal 
arrangement was an internal arrangement between Regiments and JP 
Morgan or would have been certainly no basis for placing that liability 
in the hand of Transnet.  Is that what you are saying? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I understand part of what you are saying to be that 
Regiments was not appointed to do – perform this task … 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By Transnet? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 35 of 143 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And before you can perform – it could perform this 
task it would have had to be appointed and – and also to be able to put 
in an invoice to Transnet.  It – it could not put in an invoice without 
having been appointed unless it was just some fraud? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  If there was an underlying agreement 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Of sorts. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was no underlying agreement. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The only – the only thing that would – would remain is 
whether for this kind of thing there could be any appointment of 
Regiments that is not formal to do the job.  I would imagine.  So 
whether somebody could say just please do this and put in an invoice 
and we will pay you and they actually do the job.  That is what we do 
not know.  Is that right? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair and how that 
relates to Supply Chain Management. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja.  So one does not expect that to – to happen. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but just in case it happened and they actually did 
the job then - then it might not be fraud as such but it might be 
something else but that – that might not be something that you – you 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 36 of 143 
 
want to say much about.  I do not know.  I am just to – I am working it 
out in my own mind. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  No unfortunately – yes Chair you are 
right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM: 
 
If 
there 
was 
any 
underlying 
agreement … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Or a side agreement or whatever the 
case … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Maybe for … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  This type of work I was not aware of 
that and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  I did not see anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if – if there was a genuine job that was done and 
Regiments – you know - had done the job and genuinely believed that it 
was entitled to put in an invoice that would be something else but in 
20 
the normal course of these types of – of jobs one expects that they 
would have been formally appointed in one way or another or there 
would be an agreement and in the absence of an agreement they are 
putting in an invoice for this type of job.  It seems very strange to use 
my term – very strange - and you say it may well have been fraud? 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 37 of 143 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you.  I do not know whether I have 
helped to clarify Mr Pretorius or whether I have compound it. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No, Chair.  The – I will deal with 
the issues you have raised in a moment but it does seem that in the 
final report some qualification will be necessary in order to make it 
accurate and the qualification would be the following Dr Bloom.  Are 
you aware having been given access to the relevant records the 
records which deal with these issues – these financial transactions 
about which you are testifying – are you aware of any agreement or 
10 
written arrangement or verbal arrangement that would justify Regiments 
charging Transnet for R7.5 million? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  No Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Would you have expected to find 
such documentation in your work? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  No Chair not – not between Transnet 
and Regiments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  It would have been because JP 
Morgan were appointed.  So if - that would – if – if Transnet said that 
they actually did the work then it would have been in addition to what 
JP Morgan were potentially doing and then some form of agreement or 
an arrangement would have been reduced to writing at that point. 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 38 of 143 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Between? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Between Transnet and Regiments if 
... 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, no but – sorry.  What I am – 
what I am alluding to is something different. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In the volume of documentation 
and records that you examined had there been such an agreement – an 
extra agreement – between Regiments and Transnet albeit strange 
would you have come across it? 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair.  Well I would have hoped 
to have come across but I did not. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  So subject to the 
existence of a special arrangement between Transnet and Regiments 
for the payment of R7.5 million in the absence of such you would stand 
by your opinion on this page? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It is qualified however to the 
extent that there may be such an arrangement recorded in writing 
20 
elsewhere and that would have to be examined against different criteria 
such as procurement criteria and the like? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But as I understand your 
evidence even if there was such an arrangement it would be strange? 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 39 of 143 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Why? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Because Regiments was the Supply 
Development partner or the partner in the – in the transaction or for 
conducting these transactions of JP Morgan.  So they were 
...(intervention)  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Regiments was part of the JP 
Morgan stable? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes for all purposes ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, so if it had done any work 
10 
for JP Morgan in executing the swops you would have expected 
arrangement to be between Regiments and JP Morgan. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you wouldn’t have expected 
Transnet to foot the bill?  
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Of course there may exist 
information which explains how it came about that Regiments was 
informed that it could bill Transnet for 7.5million rand and Transnet 
would pay but that evidence would exist elsewhere in email 
20 
communications and the like. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s possible Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    And then you deal with the 
contingent credit default swap which is the swap necessitated to avoid 
or protect against risk where external factors such as a market dip 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 40 of 143 
 
would require protection. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   What do you say there on page 
27? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair it’s very similar to the previous 
slide, in other words the fee that Regiments charged for the cross-
currency swap.  This is related to the contingent credit default swap 
and the principles that apply there also apply here.  The only difference 
is the 5.7million fee that Regiment claimed was also paid by Transnet 
as part of the 166million that we’re referring to previously so that is 
10 
how the 166million was comprised of the 152million related to the debt 
origination and lead arranging fees, the fee payable for the cross-
currency swap and the fee payable for the contingent credit default 
swap, that would make up the 166million.  So the 5.7million in terms of 
structuring the CCDS’ is even more intriguing if I can use that word, 
merely because – this is a very, very complex transaction as you may 
appreciate and the – JP Morgan had certain intellectual property that 
they applied in the execution of this transaction which actually was a 
benefit to Transnet.  So – and the IP related thereto, in other words in 
– to execute this transaction was that of JP Morgan’s and not of 
20 
Regiments. So this is what is also quite strange in terms of, if I can use 
the word, in terms of this particular transaction because this is – this 
would have been a – this is a highly complex thing and the IP, as I said 
was JP Morgan’s. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So again, JP Morgan is 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 41 of 143 
 
appointed to do a particular hedging swap. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It would have used its own 
intellectual property to execute this complex financial instrument. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Notwithstanding that Regiments 
was paid separately, an amount of 5.7million rand for apparently doing 
the work that JP Morgan was formerly appointed to do. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s correct Chair, for structuring 
and arranging. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Similarly are you aware of any 
other arrangement directly between Transnet and Regiments to pay it 
that separate amount of 5.7million rand? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  No Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  On the face of it, had such 
existed would have been proper? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  It would have been strange because 
there was already an agreement between JP Morgan and Transnet for 
the execution of these particular types of transactions, so how 
Regiments fitted in and how they would align with Transnet in 
20 
performing these functions is where the link is missing. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Alright, we’re going to go back 
now to the interest rate swaps and perhaps we should use the few 
minutes before the short adjournment because Chair, the witness does 
really need to finish today and so we will make our best attempt to do 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 42 of 143 
 
so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no we’ll – if need be work till five. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    I hope that won’t be necessary 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, just indicating that from my side I will be available 
to do that if we need to, yes okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair but let’s deal as 
far as we can with the return to interest rate swaps.  You say, in the 
first bullet – and I think you’ve already told the Chair that interest rate 
swaps were only applicable to the domestic syndicated loan of 12billion 
10 
rand called the Club Loan. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Right and you say the swaps 
were executed in two tranches, what does that mean? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  In other words there was 12billion 
rand applicable and the first tranche or in other words the first amount 
of that 12billion rand was 4.5billion rand that was executed or the 
transaction occurred on the 4 t h of December and then on the 7 t h of 
March – ag 2015 and on the 7 t h of March 2016 a further 7.5billion rand 
of the 12billion rand was swapped – was executed. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   So are you saying that the 
financial arrangement, the hedging or interest rate swap was put into 
effect in respect of 4.5billion rand in December 2015 and the remaining 
7.5billion rand in March 2016? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s correct Chair. 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 43 of 143 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    And the third bullet you’ve 
already explained to the Chair but because it’s quite a neat summary 
would you just place that third bullet on record. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  I can, so Chair what is swapped are 
the cash flows associated with the two interest rates, the floating and 
the fixed. The one is floating that moves with the market and the other 
is fixed for a certain duration.  The one party received the amount 
attached to the floating rate and the other party pays an amount 
attached to the fixed interest rate.  Only the difference, as we’ve 
discussed, amount, based on the fixed and floating rates are paid to 
10 
either of the parties, that’s correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright, and you then will 
proceed, hopefully after the short adjournment with your observations 
on page 29.  We’ll deal with the by way of summary because you’ve 
alluded to them previously, would this be a convenient time Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes it would be but before that, that bullet point at 
page 28, is it an answer to what Mr Pretorius said on the first day of 
your evidence, I don’t know if that was Friday, when he was saying that 
you people talk about – in this sector talk about a swap but there’s 
nothing swapped, or was that a different context? 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  No Chair this is – you’re absolutely 
right, it’s the same context in other words…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I can see what is swapped here, I hope I’m 
right. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  No Chair, you’re absolutely right, in 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 44 of 143 
 
other words, it’s actually only the difference between the two rates 
that’s paid to either of the parties.  So it’s not – as you alluded to 
previously Chair, the one party doesn’t write out a cheque to the other 
one and the other party doesn’t write out a cheque visa versa and then 
they- and then it’s – and then the one received more and the other one 
received less, it’s literally the difference between the two. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But going back to the meaning of swapping that Mr 
Pretorius was talking about, can one say when parties such as Transnet 
and Nedbank in the transaction that we dealt with, enter into that swap 
arrangement, in effect what they are swapping are the risks. 
10 
DR 
JONATHAN 
ZORAH 
BLOOM: 
 
 
That’s 
correct 
Chair 
because…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  So Transnet has entered into an arrangement with the 
consortium in terms of which it is running a risk associated with a 
floating interest rate. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it’s not happy with that, it goes to Nedbank and 
say, assume or take this risk because I’d rather have a fixed interest 
rate risk and Nedbank says, well I can give you a fixed interest rate 
risk, I’m happy to take the floating rate interest risk. 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So is it more or less correct, you are swapping risks? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM: Yes, in other words, from a Transnet 
perspective they would be the ones that say, I want to de-risk or take 
out the risk of future interest rate increases and I’m prepared to pay for 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 45 of 143 
 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright one is trying so it may be that Mr 
Pretorius, my example of swapping a risk is not a hundred percent 
accurate, it’s my way of trying to understand these things, as you know, 
as lawyers we always want to make sure that the definition fits or a 
term fits the definition. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIOUS SC:  Chair however one looks at it, 
in essence one is swapping risks, one is saying to the counter party 
you take my risk and I’ll take your risk and then the financial results 
which follow are just a netting off of the financial implications, the 
10 
cash-flow resulting from both – but what – the point that was made last 
week Chair was a different one slightly and that was that the original 
agreement remains in-tact. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So the original Club Loan 
remains in-tact and Transnet must always pay that, nothing is swapped 
in or out of that arrangement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC: The swap takes place with the 
counter party and it’s a risk swap so that was the point that we were 
20 
trying to make. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So at a practical level as between Transnet and the 
consortium, that risk remains. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Correct, nothing is swapped. 
CHAIRPERSON:  All that happens is that Transnet goes and 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 46 of 143 
 
approaches a party and says cover me in terms of this risk because it 
still stands. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in effect by doing so it takes care of the risk. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Not in this case but it ought to 
have taken of the risk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the purpose is to take care of the risk ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So that’s clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  We’ll take the tea adjournment 
10 
and resume at twenty-five to twelve.  We’re adjourned. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNED 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes we may proceed. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  Doctor Bloom 
page 29 of your presentation makes further comments in relation to the 
interest swops.  Would you go through that page please? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Certainly Chair.  As we know there 
were two parties to these transactions related to the 12 billion club 
loan Transnet and Nedbank and each one of them assumes a certain 
20 
risk.  The – as indicated there is a – there is normally a market 
executing agent or a market agent that does the trades and as 
indicated previously this could also be the either of the counter parties 
but in this particular case there was external – an external party 
Regiments was used as the executing agent of the execution agent for 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 47 of 143 
 
all the trades related to the club loan.  And then Nedbank as indicated 
was the counter party for all the swop transactions related to the club 
loan.  Then in the last bullet Chair the Transnet dealing room was more 
than capable and had the requisite capacity to execute the trades.  As 
indicated previously these are – these types of swops that were 
performed were – as – I use the word Vanilla.  They are stock standard 
swops.  There was nothing untoward, nothing strange or anything about 
them in terms of their execution.  It could be done by anybody that is 
a… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Nothing complex? 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Nothing complex Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That could be done by any person 
that has been on a – on a trading floor. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yex. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  As such.  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So there cannot be a justification that there was 
something particularly complex about them? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Not… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is why somebody from outside was required 
20 
who may have had better expertise? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair.  So I have also 
indicated that this – this will be a point of contention by Mr Ramosebudi 
and because there is a belief that there was not sufficient capacity and 
skill within Transnet to perform these transactions.  Which is actually to 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 48 of 143 
 
the contrary and therefore fees paid to Regiments would therefore be 
unjustified as the – as the capacity and the skill existed within Transnet 
to perform these transactions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Talking about that potential point of contention you 
have made the point that this swop transaction was ordinary? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was really nothing requiring any exceptional 
expertise.  But have you been able to look at the qualifications, 
expertise and experience of the people that Regiments used for this 
swop transaction and compared them with the people that Transnet 
10 
would have used if it had used its dealing room to deal with this and be 
able to say I have looked at their qualifications, I have looked at their 
expertise, I have looked at their experience really there is – there was 
nothing that the dealing room people at Transnet did not have? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair I did not look at Regiments 
specifically. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  But I looked at – I looked at 
Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  And I do have – I would just need to 
go there.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You deal with it at page 40 for 
example? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair.  That is where I 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 49 of 143 
 
was going.  Page 40. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And 41. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is right.  Chair… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please talk to it because I have not read it. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Okay the – I will just read it. 
“The Transnet treasury team had and still has the 
expertise to handle these transactions without the 
support of external transaction advisors or execution 
agents.”   
The relevant transactions as indicated Chair are typically termed 
10 
Vanilla, they are stock standard swops and the treasury dealing room 
has 
done 
these 
and 
does 
these 
periodically 
without 
external 
assistance.   
“The normal process in terms of doing these type of 
swops would be for Transnet treasury dealing team 
to obtain indicative pricing of the proposed structure 
from the Transnet approved counter parties and then 
depending on the size of the proposed transaction 
the number of participating counter parties will be 
reduced to three based on achievable prices.” 
20 
In other words they will go into the market, they look at who is going to 
give us the best price for what we are trying to achieve or in realising 
our objective and they would do it on that basis.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Before you go would such swop 
be anything new to the Transnet dealing room? 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 50 of 143 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Not in – not the swops that we are 
referring to here Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I – I guess what I am looking at seeing that you were 
– you made the point that there could be a point of contention with 
regard to whether or not the – Transnet had the requisite capacity.  I 
guess what I am looking at is a situation where if somebody has a 
contrary view to yours and says as you say Mr Ramosebudi is likely to 
say – says no but we did not have the capacity.  Quite apart from 
debating what the actual expertise you can actually say but look at the 
people you used or Regiments used.  Look at what they have in terms 
10 
of qualification, experience and expertise.  Maybe you are able to – you 
would be able to say, when you compare it with those – with the ex – 
qualifications, experience and expertise of those that Transnet had 
there is nothing really special.  So I am looking at doing an even if kind 
of argument.  You understand what I mean? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  I do.  I do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – but if – if your starting point is this – this was an 
ordinary swop transaction? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It did not need special expertise I know – what 
20 
experience.  It was just a normal swop transaction. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The experience that Transnet had was enough but I 
am saying I am going beyond that to say let us assume that there was 
something exceptional about it you look at the people that Regiments 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 51 of 143 
 
that use for it and you compare them to the people that Transnet had in 
its dealing room and you are able then to say there is no justification 
for not having used Transnet’s own capacity. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Perhaps you should while we are 
dealing with it then go to page 41 and deal with it there.  Of course 
Chair the question arises as you have stated which will be put before 
you in due course with the answer hopefully will be put before you in 
due is did Regiments have any capacity at all or did they outsource but 
10 
we will come to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  They are not – that becomes very important ja.  
Thank you. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair on page 41 until 30 April 2017 
this was now well after the – this swop transactions commenced the 
Transnet treasury dealing room team comprised four traders and a 
market analyst and the team members had a combined experience of 
almost a hundred years in the local money capital and forex markets.  
So as we – as we also discussed previously Chair the Transnet treasury 
was also rated as one of the best in the world by McKinsey in their 
20 
survey in 2010 excuse me and therefore my conclusion was looking at 
the CV’s of these gentlemen they had the ability, the skills and 
qualifications as well as experience to raise debt but also to execute 
the financial transactions we are talking about.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 52 of 143 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  If we can go back then to 
page 31.  The Chair has already raised with you issues related to the 
R12 billion club loan, the domestic loan and he has asked you why if 
the agreement was entered into on the 23 November 2015 at a floating 
interest rate one could reasonably and explicably swop and I use that 
term advisedly the risk with a counter party to place yourself in the 
position that you would have been had you entered into a fixed rate 
loan.  And the question then arises this swop transaction was done a 
few days later how does one explain that and you deal with that in the 
next section of your presentation. 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  So let us go to page 31 
please if you would take the Chair through what you say on that page? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair in order to – for Transnet to 
swop such large amounts of money remember we talking about the 12 
billion club loan, we talking about a further amount of Transnet debt of 
11.3 billion which we will get to.  It would have required them to first 
understand what the impact of that is on the structure of their debt 
book.  If I can put it that way.  In other words all the floating – the debt 
that they had on their book in terms of floating rates and the debt they 
20 
had on their book in terms of fixed rates.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Now the debt book is all the 
loans and all the debt which Transnet has at any particular point in 
time? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair that could be in 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 53 of 143 
 
bonds issued by Transnet, it could mean straight debt raised by 
Transnet etcetera, etcetera. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  All loans? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  All loans that is right.  So – so 
essentially what Transnet had to – well what had to happen is the – 
Transnet have a policy the risk management framework which deals 
with exactly that point.  What the ratio should be between fixed rated 
debt and floating rate debt.  And in order for them to do these 
transactions in other words to convert from floating to fixed they might 
have to have or they would have needed to potentially and we can see 
10 
it did happen, potentially change the ratio between floating and fixed.  
In other words because they wanted to execute interest rate swops at 
fixed rates they would have had to increase their debt or the debt ratio 
from reducing floating and increasing fixed to a accommodate that.  So 
they would have had to check are they still within the bounds of the 
policy or not?  And if they were not within the bounds of the policy in 
terms of what they were trying to do then they would have to amend the 
policy.  And that is what is being referred to Chair as the fixed rate 
strategy in the second bullet.  In the third bullet… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  In the third bullet there one has an 
indication of what happened.  In 2012 the – and remember Chair the – 
what we are talking about here is that there are ranges for floating in 
other words it is between a certain percentage and a certain 
percentage and fixed would be between a certain percentage and a 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 54 of 143 
 
certain percentage so there were ranges.  So each one of those ranges 
would have to add up to 100.  So if you have a look we can use an 
example… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let me ask this before you proceed.  Is the ration 
that you talking about in relation to all the debts of Transnet?  In other 
words if you look at all the debts they have and you look at the – at 
where they have used a floating interest rate and where they have used  
fixed rate that is what they must have in – they must bear in mind and 
the policy is that when you have regard to all of those this is the ratio 
that should be or is it something else that you talking about? 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  No Chair that is – that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  In other words Transnet make a – a 
determined judgment on how much floating debt they would like to 
have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To have ja. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  And how much fixed debt. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  But do – and that is the basis. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So that can change. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR 
JONATHAN 
ZORAH 
BLOOM: 
 
Periodically 
depending 
on 
circumstances. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 55 of 143 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  But we will… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But until it is changed that is what you must be within 
if you enter into any transaction? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair in the terms of the risk 
management framework. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of risk management ja.  Okay thank you.  
The idea being that Transnet does not want to be beyond certain 
parameters in terms of either fixed or floating interest rate at any one 
time.  Does not want to outside of the parameters it fixes for itself? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair.  So if they want 
10 
to take on new debt. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Or they want to swop. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Then they would need to consider the 
impact. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Of that decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  On the existing policy. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So that their approach should primarily to be to 
fall within the policy and if the circumstances of that transaction are 
such that they think that they should go against what is there in the 
policy then the policy should be changed first to accommodate that? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 56 of 143 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I understand the exercise that 
you have not done is to look at the policy as it existed on the 23 
November 2015, look at the debt book as a whole and the proportion of 
fixed to floating in the debt book and concluded whether it was 
appropriate to enter into a floating rate policy in the first place.   
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But you do talk of trends in the 
fourth bullet. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair.

ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So it is one thing to say look 
there must be a policy in place which will allow you to swop from 
floating to fixed as they did in December 2015 but what about the 
original agreement?  Should that not also accord with the policy 
because the original agreement was to enter into a floating rate loan 
and then a few days later they enter into a fixed rate and we have no 
indication that the policy was changed in the interim. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair because if you – 
what they did was they – because they – the intention was to have a lot 
more fixed rate debt they had to change the policy and that policy 
20 
changed significantly to having a 90% at the upper bound, 90% fixed 
and 10% floating.  If you look at the third bullet the last sentence those 
are the ranges but if you look at the highest on fixed and the lowest on 
floating it would be 90/10.  So that was the policy that was adopted and 
they would have needed to do something like that and as Advocate 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 57 of 143 
 
Pretorius quite correctly says further work is required and further 
investigation is needed in this – in this context more specifically to the 
timing of the transaction at that point – in November 2015.  But this 
was a clear indication of what the intention was and that was to 
increase the fixed rate component of the debt book through a policy 
change.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But if one just goes on the 
information that you have to hand Doctor Bloom if the swop to fixed in 
December 2015 was within the bounds of policy then it follows that it 
would also have been in accordance with policy to enter into a fixed 
10 
rate loan a few days earlier? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And so what is the point you 
make in the fourth bullet? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  The fourth bullet.  In other words 
because of the circumstances and the timing of the transaction that the 
club loan on the 23 November should have been entered into a fixed 
rate loan if that was the intention.  It was not necessary to first enter 
into a floating rate loan and then into a fixed rate loan later.  Because 
the – Chair the financial risk management policy also clearly says that 
20 
you must fix the rate at source.  In other words once – at the point 
where you conclude the agreement – in other words – the club loan on 
the 23 November it should have been fixed at that point, that is the 
source and not a week later as it was done in terms of the swops. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  For the moment all you 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 58 of 143 
 
are saying on page 31 as I understand it that subject to a more detailed 
analysis the trends and the policy would indicate that the loan should 
have been entered into on a fixed rate basis in the first place? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And we have applied a little 
logic to corroborate that, correct? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You are going to get later to the 
policy but in relation to another aspect.  In other words as I understand 
what you are saying the policy says make up your mind when you enter 
10 
into the loan do not change your mind a week later.  Is that in effect 
what the policy says? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Let us get there to page 
32 then.  What do you say in page 32? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So Chair this unpacks a little further 
the timing of these transactions.  As we know the club loan was 
concluded on the 23 November.  On the 1 November the first portion of 
the R12 billion the R4.5 billion was drawn down and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is 1 December hey? 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So it is the – so in terms of the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I think you may have said November. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Sorry Chair. 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 59 of 143 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 1 December. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So it was the 23 November it was 
concluded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  The 1 December the first portion was 
drawn down the R4.5 billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  And three days later on the 4 
December the interest rate swops from floating to fixed was concluded.  
So from a timing perspective now in terms of the following transaction 
10 
the second portion of the draw down the other R7.5 million that was 
also – was drawn down on the R12 billion this occurred on the 1 March 
2016 and a couple of days later … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright not three. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Pardon? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It is six days later. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Six days ja.  Six days later on the 7 
March the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh should – that [indistinct] should be 6? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  It should be 7.5. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  It should be six days. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.   
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  And then the – and then the 4.5 
should be 7.5 just as one carries on.  On the – then on the 7 March the 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 60 of 143 
 
R7.5 billion that was – was concluded at floating was then fixed – was 
then changed or converted to fixed.  So what comes out Chair from this 
analysis is that a certain trend that the first portion was done on the – 
in December the second portion was done in March and so it is clear 
that there was some kind of understanding of how this execution of 
these transactions would take place.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In short on the 23 November 
2025 you enter into a floating rate policy in effect a few days later you 
change it to a fixed rate police at great cost to Transnet. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And great benefit to counter 
parties and execution agents? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Now you go into the implications 
of those facts now in the following pages and you say – you asked the 
question in the second bullet on page 32 why did this take place?  What 
is the explanation for this? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair the – in the number of 
memoranda that I – that I perused the group treasurer was at pains to 
indicate that 
for – 
interest rates 
were 
expected 
to 
increase 
20 
substantially.  It – so as part of the analysis I went and looked exactly 
what happened.  And there was – they took a two year view of interest 
rates and remember they entered into the swop agreements for fifteen 
years.  So the problem that exists here so based on two years of 
forecasts which were not – which did not indicate anything exponential 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 61 of 143 
 
in terms of growth or increase of interest rates was used as the basis 
to justify the fixing of the rates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the interest rate yes.  Yes.  But what is the norm 
or what is the logic if you do a forecast of interest rates in respect of a 
fifteen year transaction loan should the forecast not cover the whole 
period or it is fine if it covers the lesser period provided certain things 
happen or what is – what is normally expected professionally? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair you will – you will rarely find 
that institutions will forecast a fifteen year interest rate.  It is just 
almost impossible. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because there are too many variables over the 
period? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what is the norm?  What do – what kind of period 
does the forecast normally cover? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair that took… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or 50% of the duration or a quarter or it just goes 
maybe by five years, five years or three years, three years? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair there is no norm per se. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  But in Transnet’s case they subscribe 
to the – to forecasts of interest rates provided by the Bureau For 
Economic Research at Stellenbosch University.  They – and they use 
that as the justification.  So they – they use – they do not do forecasts 
for longer than two years. 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 62 of 143 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  From a service provider that is 
actually providing information to the market 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  On this particular matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  They do have five year forecasts but 
it is not a – it is a more a deposit rate but as you can see Chair the 
problem with that and as you correctly said is – has got to do with the 
fact that it is very – there are many variables that impact on it and as a 
10 
consequence this was a justification but for a fifteen year period which 
the two components of this – of what we talking about do not align. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what I was trying to establish is whether there is 
anything to be made of the fact that they base their forecast on two 
years.  So – but from what you are saying it seems that the fact that 
they based their forecast on two years is – has no significance? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair in other words they used 
information at hand that was available in the market that people can – 
institutions can access.  So yes it was – in other words they based 
their decision on two years given a fifteen year duration. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that is what they did immediately before they 
went for the fixed interest rate swop, is that right?  Not before they 
entered into the floating rate. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes that is the point Chair. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  They – Chair that is exactly the 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 63 of 143 
 
question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  The – in other words you would not – 
you would – will start doing this type of analysis not to try and justify a 
swop. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  You would be doing that analysis to 
justify should I be fixing at source or should I rather keep – let us stick 
to floating and I can always fix a portion of it later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And on what you had a look at in terms of 
10 
documentation and memoranda and whoever you may have spoken to if 
you spoke to any of the people who were involved did you – are you 
able to say whether or not that there was a forecast that was done 
before the floating interest rate regime was done or you have not been 
able – you have not come across anything that suggests that it was 
done? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  No Chair the only – the only – as you 
say only in terms of the memoranda that I perused and so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  It – the argument was based – was 
20 
for the swop. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So it was – that became the modus 
operandi in essence … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 64 of 143 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  And in terms of analysis related to 
deciding to fix off or retain floating at the source.  In other words when 
the loan was concluded – no I do not have … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have not found? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  They – I have not found any 
information that actually speaks to that particular … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Aspect but more – only – more to the 
swap. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the swap, ja.  Okay, thank you. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well what we know Dr Bloom is 
that within a few days Transnet changed its mind from floating to fixed.  
It justified the fixed interest rate swap on the basis of long terms 
forecasts by the Bureau for Economic Research.  Do you know whether 
Transnet subscribed to that service? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes they do Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So leave aside the question of 
fixed or floating as absolute concepts for the moment but concentrate 
on the change of mind within a few days.  Is there any explanation for 
that?  In other words is the long term forecast a valid explanation for 
20 
changing of approach between floating to fixed within a few days? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know whether this question will be the same 
as the one that Mr Pretorius has just asked but I wanted to ask it much 
earlier.  To do a forecast with regard to interest rates you need a 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 65 of 143 
 
certain state of affairs or you need to inform yourself of a certain state 
of affairs or factors that influence the fluctuation of interest I would 
imagine.  Now that material how - how is he – is it for it to change 
within just a matter of a few days? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair it – it is unlikely and as you 
rightly said these – these forecasts of interest rates are based on – on 
various modelling approaches which take into account various variables 
but in order to that forecast - I am getting a little technical – but in 
order to do that forecast you would have to – all the variables that you 
consider that would impact on interest rates in the future you would 
10 
have to forecast.  So you would have to forecast those variables in 
order to forecast the interest rate which in itself is a very difficult task 
but – yes, I mean that is the – the premise … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Which was used. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So let us just put it in a different 
way perhaps to conclude that page at least and move on.  If Transnet – 
the Transnet Treasurer – sought to justify the swap at huge costs to 
Transnet to fixed on 4 December sought to justify it by reference to 
20 
economic forecasts.  The question arises surely that information should 
have informed the decision made on 23 April and applying those same 
forecasts one should have entered into a fixed agreement on the 23 r d.  
It would take some explanation to explain that anomaly. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair.  I think in – 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 66 of 143 
 
what is important – important to understand is that these forecasts 
would have been available.  So they would have done – been done 
previously and as a consequence you would not – even if you wanted to 
fix rates at that time on 23 November you might not have fixed the 
entire portion of the loan.  You would have said okay we see there is an 
uptick in interest rates potentially happening according to these 
forecasts.  So let us – let us fix a portion and then we will – if – if 
interest rates start to increase significantly whatever the case maybe 
then we can fix more and more but to – to say I am going to fix the 
entire amount in one – in one tranche is very unusual in that. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So what would require an 
explanation from the Treasurer would be the following:  he says I did 
my homework and therefore entered into the swap on 4 December.  
Presumably he should have done his homework as the Chair said 
before entering into the loan in the first place. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  One does not do ones homework 
after the event after the examination surely. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And there may be some 
20 
explanation but you could not find any on the record and the indications 
are that there is no explanation? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair.  Except the - 
the two year forecast. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well the only explanation will be 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 67 of 143 
 
there that suddenly the two year forecast landed on the Treasurer’s 
desk after 23 November? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes it was – it was for the purposes 
of justification. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And – but you say that these 
forecasts are prepared long in advance. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Do you know when that forecast 
came out? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  No Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you – do you get – did you get to know whether 
the persons involved in choosing – in going with the floating rate – 
floating interest rate regime in regard to the loan were the same people 
who decided on the fixed term rate for the swap or could it have been 
different people or is that something you could not tell? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair that – if you look at the 
departments within Transnet or the divisions one would – it would have 
been the Debt Raising Department or the Funding Department – as they 
are called now – and then the Treasury Department and within Treasury 
there are various – there are various sections that deal with various 
20 
aspects … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Of Treasury matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So collectively … 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 68 of 143 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  They would have – they would have 
to sit … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  And get an understanding of what is 
the best strategy … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Within the Risk Management or the 
Financial Risk Management framework. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay, thank you. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Let us approach this 
conundrum from a different angle and you deal with that on page 33, 
right.  There may be information placed before the Chair in due course 
that the planning for the fixed interest rate swap took place before 
23 November.  In other words when the floating rate interest agreement 
was entered into they already knew that they were going to swap. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So that subject matter of 
investigation and evidence will be placed before you in due course but 
applying your knowledge and experience is the transaction – the swap 
20 
transaction capable of being concluded in a few days after a change of 
mind? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair not if you – because if we can 
just sort of unpack it and raise it and note a couple of points.  First of 
all they would have to go to the market and do their pricing.  They 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 69 of 143 
 
would have had to – they would have had to consider who was – who 
would have been given the best options in terms of pricing.  They would 
have – they would have also had to go through various processes in 
terms of approval and authorisation.  So it – this does not happen in 
three days – in four days.  It – it – there is a – there is a process and – 
and it could have taken – it could easily take a month or it could take 
three weeks potentially but yes it is not a – it is not something that 
happens very swiftly.  Yes it could – it could be – it could be expedited 
if there is a crisis.  In other words interest rates for some or other 
reason suddenly shoot up for – for whatever – whatever reason.  So – 
10 
but in - in the normal course of – of events it would take – it would take 
a couple of weeks to – in order to – to decide – because they would 
also Chair as – as indicated previously would have to understand what 
the impact is on the debt structure.  So it is not only going out to the 
market for pricing.  There is a lot of calculations and a lot of 
understanding and authorisations that need to happen.  So in my 
opinion it cannot take – it cannot happen in three days. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right and so what is the opinion 
that you offer as a matter of probability on page 33 – second bullet? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That: 
20 
“Prior to entering into the club loan on a floating 
rate basis Transnet Officials would have intended to 
effect interest rate swaps effectively converting the 
loan into a fixed interest rate loan.” 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
So 
you 
say 
given 
your 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 70 of 143 
 
knowledge and experience of the way these things happen the way 
these financial transactions are negotiated and constructed and the 
time that it takes to do so in the ordinary course - when they entered 
into the floating rate loan on 23 November - Transnet Officials already 
knew as a matter of probability - leave aside other evidence.  That they 
were going to swap to fix rate at a higher cost later? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair.  Just given the 
– the very short timeframes and the decisions taken in the context 
thereof. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then that therefore begs the 
10 
question why enter into a floating rate policy when you know you are 
going to change to a fixed rate later and why do you not simply enter 
into a fixed rate loan in the first place. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And we deal with that question 
in the next few pages, okay.  What you say on page (intervenes)? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Before you go to that page so you – you 
are quite positive that in your professional opinion it is highly unlikely 
that within – that they entered into a fixed interest rate swap three days 
after the loan agreement involving a floating interest rate.  It is highly 
20 
unlikely that they did so because of any change in circumstances that 
occurred within that two/three days.  Is that correct? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say that is highly unlikely that that is the case.  
They must have known before they concluded the loan agreement 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 71 of 143 
 
include that – included the floating interest rate arrangement.  They 
must have known that they were planning to do a fixed rate – interest 
rate swap soon afterwards? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair.  There was 
nothing in the market at that point … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That alluded to a – in that specific 
period of time … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Up to 4 December – we will talk 
10 
about the later periods later … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I was about to ask whether it was anywhere 
around the 9 t h/10 December 2015. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  We are going to get that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, but this was before? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  This was before.  So there was 
nothing … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  From a market perspective … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That could have said but now 
something is – is drastically going to happen … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  And we have to – we have to make a 
problem.  We have … 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 72 of 143 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Intervenes). 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  There was – there was talk of 
downgrades and – and things like that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  But it never – there was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Concretised into anything? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Exactly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  And – and that is why it – it was very 
odd … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That this happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You mentioned earlier on you made the point 
earlier on that in relation to the loan they could have limited the 
floating interest rate arrangement to a shorter period than the full 
duration of the loan.  Did I understand you correctly? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair.  What I – what I meant 
was that instead of fixing the entire amount of 4.5 billion they could – 
they could enter – they could take the loan on – at floating.  Say using 
the 4.5 billion as an example and then if the need arose they could 
20 
have – they could fix a portion of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh a portion of the – of the amount not of the – of the 
duration of the …? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That – that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  The duration has to remain 15 – 15 years? 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 73 of 143 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is just the portion of the amount. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But to some extent you might achieve the same 
whether you – you know - even if you were to have been given maybe 
seven and a half years to use a particular regime and another seven 
and a half years to use another regime.  If you half the amount and use 
one and use another one for a year you might end up achieving the 
same thing or not – not as simple as that? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  It is not as simple as that Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I suspected.  Okay, alright thank you.  Your point is 
they could have made sure that it was not the whole amount that was 
put under a certain regime? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair that – that is what risk 
mitigation is all about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Not putting all your eggs in one basket? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Of course Chair interesting point 
arises out what happened later in December.  I suppose one 
20 
explanation could considerably be I knew what was going to later in 
December but that would create further problems for the decision 
makers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is true. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But we do not have any 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 74 of 143 
 
indication of that yet Chair.  Let us deal then with page 34.  Again just 
to place page 34 in context you are talking about the change of mind? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And the justification - possible 
justification for any fixed rate swap.  Would you deal with the four 
bullets then on page 34 – the four sub bullets? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair I would like to address the four 
sub bullets as Advocate Pretorius indicates that the strategy adopted … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well … 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Sorry. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If you could deal with the 
introduction as well. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Okay.  In my view there could be no 
justification for the execution of the extreme change of the floating debt 
to fixed debt and the manner considered and ultimately executed and 
the reason for those are the following:  the strategy that was adopted 
this fixed rate strategy that I am referring to assumes an environment 
of high interest rates and because we are referring to the club loan 
over a period of 15 years.  This would – this would imply that Transnet 
is locked into the interest rate swap agreement for 15 years.  So that - 
20 
that – it is the point that we were discussing previously Chair where 
you are using two year forecasts to make your decision of fixing rates 
and then you still fix the whole amount and – but you forget about you 
are actually locking in Transnet for 15 years and it is not a question of 
swapping back from fixed to floating.  It is a – it is – it is the other 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 75 of 143 
 
around. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, once it is fixed it is fixed.  Once it is floating it is 
floating? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes you can –you can swap from 
floating to fixed … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  But if you – if you for instance enter 
into an agreement with a counterparty and that counterparty says you 
10 
pay me fixed and I will pay you floating.  Then there is a risk involved.  
So the counterparty says listen I am – I am entering into this agreement 
over a long period of time.  So if you want to get out at any point in 
time or exit the position - as it is called - you are going to have to pay 
for that and that is what – and that is where this whole situation 
becomes (intervenes). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  We will come to that calculation 
later. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair.  So the second one is in 
my view it is not possible to predict interest rates so far into the future.  
20 
Adopting an extreme (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  They so far relates to – to 15 years? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So in – it is not possible to predict 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 76 of 143 
 
interest rates so far into the future adopting an extreme adjustment to 
the debt structure from floating to fixed rates.  In my view it is 
irresponsible.  This – this is particularly important because it confers 
the large risk and potential loss on Transnet. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you will tell the Chair that 
Transnet is in fact suffering losses now? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair.  I will give you 
the numbers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to interrogate that second bullet point before you 
move on.  Were you – whether one is talking about a fixed rate or a 
10 
floating interest rate regime one does take the risk that things might 
ultimately turn out in such a way that one regrets having chosen a 
particular regime at the beginning of the transaction but that is 
something you can only make a judgment on at the end of the whole 
period.  Is it not?  You – you – if it is a 15 year loan you cannot 
necessarily blame the person who made a judgment call at the 
beginning if three years down the line it looks like it was such a terrible 
mistake because you do not know whether by the end of the 15 year 
period you will actually be smiling saying actually it has worked out 
quite fine.  Is it not? 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair that is possible but I would – 
when we get to discussing the numbers a little later on … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  I will – I will give you an indication of 
– of the dilemma … 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 77 of 143 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That exists and therefore … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  It brings me back to the point that 
you are right.  Over a period time it could equal out or it could be 
beneficial … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Or whatever the case maybe … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  But in this particular – it is – it is 
10 
also important to understand that that you mitigate your risk by making 
decisions that are taken over a period of time.  For instance - as we 
were discussing – only taking a small portion of the debt and fixing it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Given the upward movement in rates 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  And then doing that same process as 
you – as you proceed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  In other words the balance that you 
achieve … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Would be because then you would 
bring more floating at a later stage in from other debt into your … 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 78 of 143 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Your debt book – if I can call it that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  And that would start balancing it out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So – so there – it is all about a 
strategy … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  But what we see here is extreme … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Movements … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Or extreme decisions to – to fix or to 
enter into agreements for very large amounts of money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So basically the strategies seek to make sure that 
over – for example – a 15 year period you are not going to just keep on 
hoping that at the end of the 15 year period things will work out fine.  
As things go bad during the 15 year period you just hope that at the 
end it will work out 15.  The strategies are meant to mitigate so that 
your expectation is based on what you have put in place to try and 
20 
mitigate any possible adverse changes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair but it must be 
done correctly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Must be done correctly, ja. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair. 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 79 of 143 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  It cannot be guess work? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is true Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If you would then go through 
because you have now dealt with some of the issues that you intended 
to deal with.  The four sub bullets on page 34 as part of the first 
paragraph.  You dealt with the first one. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  And the second one.  In – in the third 
one in my view to mitigate against paying significant fees and as - this 
we have discussed Chair- a phased approach in small increments would 
10 
have been prudent based on evolving market conditions when 
circumstances dictated. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The last bullet. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Then the last bullet is the Transnet 
Group Treasurer although relying on the Bureau for Economic Research 
interest rate forecasts assumed a very steep trajectory with – of long 
term interest rates and there was no indication at that point in time that 
such a dramatic upward movement in interest rates would – would 
occur. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  So far we have an 
20 
unexplained change of mind from floating to fixed – 23 November 2015 
to 4 December 2015? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
It 
is 
inexplicable 
and 
unreasonable on your assessment and in your opinion? 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 80 of 143 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is true Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  To put it simply in lay language 
had the proper investigations been done upfront that – and the policy 
been followed the fixed rate if it was advisable should have been 
entered into in the first place? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And not involving a change of 
mind over a few days but what was the certain outcome of this change 
of mind?  You deal with that in the second bullet on page 34. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair as a consequence of the – the 
10 
way that the transactions were structured and implemented or 
executed.  This would result in significant fees for Regiments and cash 
flow for the counterparty.  At – obviously at the expense of Transnet 
because as we – as we have discussed there can only be one winner in 
this – in this transaction and therefore this outcome was in fact the 
only reliable predictable outcome at the time.  So in summary I am of 
the view that this was irresponsible, unfounded and unwarranted to fix 
such a large portion of the debt at that time.  If a portion of the debt 
was too be fixed it should have been a small portion in reaction to an – 
an anticipated increase in interest rates or some other strategy that 
20 
might have been part of the Transnet requirement but to – to fix 4.5 
billion at that point in time and then a further 7.5 billion in the – in the 
next couple of months appear to – did not appear to be justified in the 
context of the information available. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you explain that or you are 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 81 of 143 
 
about to explain the losses incurred by Transnet as a result of these 
arrangements. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Which you say were ill advised 
in the first place? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Let us go to page 35 then and 
you say in relation to a graph that we are about to introduce two points 
should be made.  What are those points? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So in – in other words it was 
10 
unacceptable to enter into a floating rate alone and thereafter 
effectively enter into a fixed rate loan as we have been discussing.  By 
doing this Transnet ended up paying interest at a fixed rate 
substantially higher than it would have had it entered into a fixed rate 
loan in the first place. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Just pause there.  You 
say there indications that make it more probable than not in your expert 
opinion that even when they entered into the floating loan – floating 
interest rate loan – they knew already and would have claimed for 
entering - changing it effectively to a fixed loan – fixed rate loan – 
20 
later? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right but when it decided in 
December to effectively - well no because that is wrongly put because 
we know that on your opinion the decision was made even before 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 82 of 143 
 
23 November.  When it implemented the swap effectively to change the 
floating rate loan to a fixed rate loan early in December 2015 did it pay 
a fixed rate in the swap equivalent to the fixed rate it would have paid 
had the loan been entered into on a fixed term – fixed rate basis in the 
first place? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  No Chair because the rate – the rate 
that was ultimately agreed as part of the swap agreement and 
compared to the market fixed rate – if I can call it that – at that point in 
time were substantially different.  As I indicated previously the market 
fixed rate or the midmarket rate that one would use would have been 
10 
adjusted slightly to make provision for a couple of other little risk 
factors that one would – that – that counterparties normally include but 
not at the same level as the rates that they were finally entered into. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In fact what you are going to tell 
the Chair in graphic form in a moment is that the floating – the fixed 
rate ultimately paid or payable by Transnet was much higher than the 
fixed rate, substantially higher in your view than the fixed rate that 
Transnet would have paid had it entered into a fixed term rate – a fixed 
rate agreement in the first place. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct in terms of the market. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you say that’s quite apart 
from fees and cost? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Let’s go to page 36 then and put 
up the graph.  Now this is a – what you call a stats bar graph, 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 83 of 143 
 
statistical bar graph. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay what do the blue lines 
indicate? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair the blue lines indicate the 
floating rate over the period starting on the 01/12/2015 it was when the 
drawn down of the loan occurred to 01/10/2018 by way of example. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes and on the left-hand side we 
see from nought to 12 interest rate levels. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s correct Chair. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   So if one looks at each blue 
bar, one will see how interest rates floated between 8 and 10 percent 
over that period. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s correct Chair and if you look 
at that you will also see – okay one needs to look at the axis, I mean, 
in other words on the left-hand side that you were referring to but also 
you will also see that there’s no – there’s no substantial movement in 
the blue bars, they all hover around the same area, if I can put it that 
way and then the line at the top, the black line where it…(intervention). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right at the top of the graph the 
20 
solid black line. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s correct Chair, where it 
indicates 11.83 in the corner, that is the fixed rate that was concluded, 
not the market rate, the fixed rate that was concluded as part of the 
agreement between Transnet and Nedbank and that’s what Transnet 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 84 of 143 
 
pays Nedbank every quarter when a swap occurs. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Okay so what is the difference 
between the blue and the black? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair the difference is, is the – is an 
indication that the floating rates, in other words – or the floating rates, 
ja have not increased or have not reached the fixed rate level of 11.83 
at any time over that period that we are assessing at the moment. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   So instead of paying the rate 
indicated by the blue bars, between 8 and 10 percent on a floating rate 
basis, Transnet has ended up paying a much higher rate of interest 
10 
indicated by the black line? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s correct Chair and – so 
simplistically put, I want to emphasise that, the red bars represent all 
the losses that Transnet occurred – that accrued to Transnet. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Just arising from the swap? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s just arising from the swap. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Just arising from the difference 
in interest rate basis. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Though you say there are other 
20 
costs factored in. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s right, I think it’s important to 
also note that the – included in the 11.83 would be execution fees 
because that is how – so the rate paid to Nedbank would include the 
execution fees within that 11.83 fee…(intervention). 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 85 of 143 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    And the rate paid to Regiments 
too would come out of the losses of Transnet. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay can we go to page 37 then, 
here you deal with losses to Transnet on a different basis.  It’s a little 
bit more complicated would you explain it please? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair I’m going to focus on the totals, 
if I may at the bottom of the table. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright but before you go there, 
perhaps we should explain the column on the right-hand side, second 
10 
from the right-hand side or the right-hand margin called costs, it reads 
of exist, that should read, cost of exit. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  A concept you’ve referred to.  
Basically if at any point in time the parties to the swap were to sit down 
and Transnet would say to it’s counterpart Nedbank, look, I’m not happy 
with our arrangement I want out, Transnet would say, as I understand 
your evidence to date, yes I’ll let you out but then you must pay me 
what I would have earned in the balance of the term. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s correct. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The present day value of what I 
would have earned for the remainder of the term. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    So that’s what you refer to as 
the, cost of exit. 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 86 of 143 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:   Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But it’s a reliable forecast on the 
other hand by way of corollary of Transnet’s losses, not only would it 
be a forecast imposed by Nedbank of what it would have profited for 
the balance after the exit to the termination of the arrangement but it 
would also be an indicator, as I understand your evidence of the losses 
that Transnet would have continued to incur, so the one matches the 
other. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair at the 14 t h of May in 
terms of this particular table but what is important, Chair, is just to note 
10 
that – if I may, the realised cash-flows, in other words the third column 
from the right, the 850million rand is the loss that Transnet has 
occurred – or the loss that has accrued to Transnet to date.  In other 
words, put another way, that is the cash-flow – that’s the amount of 
money that Transnet have actually paid to the counter party as the – as 
part of the agreement. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In relation to each portion of the 
loan? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  In relation to each portion of the 
loan, correct.  So this is the total 12billion rand Club Loan, in terms of 
20 
the cost of exit…(intervention). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well let’s first explain what is 
the realised cash-flow, what is that amount? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Those are the differences, remember 
we said that Transnet does not write out a cheque to Nedbank and 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 87 of 143 
 
Nedbank 
does 
not 
write 
out 
a 
cheque 
to 
Transnet 
so 
the 
difference…(intervention). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Ultimately paid now we know by 
Transnet to Nedbank. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:   Is 850million correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Over that period of time up to 14 
May 2019. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  From December 2015. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s correct. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    So it has, on this swap of risk 
lost, you say, 850milliion rand? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And if one was to forecast the 
loss over the whole period of this swap arrangement what information 
would you use? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Then one would look at the last 
column Chair, so this would cost Transnet, just on the 12billion Club 
Loan, 1.8billion. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Ja well no, you would add to the 
20 
850million what amount? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  980million. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That’s the cost to the exit. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That’s the forecast loss of profit 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 88 of 143 
 
to Nedbank, it’s corollary is the forecast expense and loss to Transnet. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It would have lost over the 
period? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Okay that’s 980million giving a 
total loss of this whole exercise amounting to? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  1.8billion rand. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So this exercise, constructed in 
the way it was constructed cost Transnet or will cost Transnet over the 
10 
full term 1.8billion rand? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The parties to profit are whom?  
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Well included in these costs would be 
the fee – well the fee paid to the executing agent and the benefit, if 
one can put it that way, to the counter party.  So included in those 
realised cash-flows are the fees paid to the counter party. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright on the next page you 
deal with the Transnet policy entitled the Financial Risk Management 
Framework, would you just – you’ve dealt with it but by way of summary 
20 
would you please just place page 38 on record. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So Chair we’ve referred to the 
Financial Risk Management Framework Policy on several occasions this 
morning but it regulates, amongst others, the dead portfolio and 
transaction parameters, in other words, amongst other things the size 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 89 of 143 
 
of the debt book the ratio of fixed to floating etcetera and then the risk 
management practices within the Transnet Treasury environment in 
terms of hedging the swaps or hedging the risks through the use of 
swaps. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So how big the debt book can 
be, in other words, how much you can borrow and how much you should 
be in debt and the ratio of fixed to floating, we have dealt with that as 
well as how you should go about hedging risk. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay then the second bullet? 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  The framework dictates that the 
decision to secure funding on a fixed or floating interest rate basis 
should be taken at the time of concluding the funding transaction.  
We’ve used the term at the source and that is what it’s about, to avoid 
unnecessary costs of revising the position at a later date and had this 
been done, Transnet would have saved billions because it wouldn’t be 
necessary to pay execution fees and it wouldn’t have been – and no 
interest rate swap would have been required. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  On page 39, apart from 
summarising much of what you’ve told the Chair you deal with events 
20 
which might imply and need to change mind from floating to fixed or 
from fixed to floating, would you deal with that please? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So Chair in terms of the timeline and 
justification for the Club Loan, by way of summary the Club Loan was 
concluded – contracted on the 23 r d of November, the first draw down of 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 90 of 143 
 
the 4.5billion occurred on the 1 s t of December and three days later the 
first tranche of those interest rate swaps, in other words the 4.5billion 
was changed or swapped from floating to fixed…(intervention). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Effectively swapped? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Effectively swapped correct Chair.  
As indicated previously Mr Ramosebudi argued a volatile economic 
environment with high inflation and volatile exchange rates as the basis 
for fixing interest rates.  To the extent that this was true he should 
have known this prior to the 23 r d of November 2015 and certainly would 
have known this had he listened to his treasury team because the 
10 
treasury – the decisions are based on significant research that the 
treasury team does before they enter into any agreement and therefore 
they would have assessed various rates, they would have assessed 
various circumstances and made that call.  In terms of the following 
point, this argument of substantially higher increase in interest rates, a 
volatile rand, high inflation which would necessitate from an economic 
point of view an increase in interest rates to keep it in check, would 
have only been able to hold water if some, what’s called in the financial 
world, a Black Swan event, could trigger exchange rate volatility or 
high inflation which would invariably drive interest rates higher.  Five 
20 
days after the execution of the first swaps with Nedbank the Finance 
Minister at the time Mr Nhalanhla Nene was sacked and this could have 
been considered as a Black Swan event and caused significant 
volatility in the rand and caused long-term and short-term interest rates 
to spike.  So – but what is interesting is the rates never stayed high, 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 91 of 143 
 
they rarely do. In other words, you might have a spike but then there’s 
a decrease to another position where it finds itself. So – however the 
rates stabilise quickly at slightly higher levels after the appointment of 
Pravin Gordhan and moved in a very narrow band after that.  The rates 
never reached levels that were close to the fixed rates concluded for 
the swapped transactions and this is the ultimate.  So Chair, my view is 
that – as was indicated previously, although the situation or event was 
triggered it never had the effect that was anticipated, in other words 
that interest rates would increase.  Even if interest rates increased 
they would still stabilise thereafter.  Interest rates never remain at the 
10 
levels that were executed or were used in this transaction for 15 years.  
It might have been there for a couple of weeks, whatever the case may 
be but it would have then stabilised, given intervention at that point. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Alright and then on page 40 and 
41 you deal with the expertise within Transnet dealing room, it’s 
expertise, it’s capability, it’s international reputation, the regard it was 
held in by McKinsey for example and you deal with what the capability 
was particularly in relation to the swaps that we’re dealing with here, 
you’ve given that evidence to the Chair. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s correct Chair. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Unless there’s any question we 
could move on then to page 43.  Would you go to page 43 please, here 
we deal in more detail with the cost of these transactions, cost of the 
change of mind, cost of the entry into the swap entailing a fixed 
interest rate risk mitigation measure and you do so by reference to a 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 92 of 143 
 
schedule.  Please take the Chair through page 43 and explain what you 
have portrayed here in this schedule under the second bullet. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair the – because this is a 
syndicated loan various parties to the loan would have different floating 
rates depends on negotiation.  So various financial institutions would 
agree a certain rate for their loan…(intervention). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  This is the floating loan part? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s the floating loan part, so in the 
context of the 4.5billion loan that was a portion of the 12billion loan 
that was executed as a swap on the 4 t h of December we can look at the 
10 
rates which are the more important aspect of this table.  You would see 
that the floating rate for the different parties at that point in time was 
9.18 for Absa and then 9.22 percent for Bank of China, Nedbank, 
Future Growth and Old Mutual Finance.  So that’s an important – they 
concluded the loan on the 23 r d of November at those rates.  Then, why 
it’s important to hen bring in the next column just alongside that, what’s 
called the, midmarket blended rate is to understand what the market 
was indicating at that point in time should the loan have been fixed. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  On the 23 r d of November 2015? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes this was – Chair the midmarket 
20 
rate that we’re referring to here was not for the 23 r d of November it was 
for the – applicable to the interest rate swap, so this was on the 4 t h of 
December. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Yes but would there have been 
a significant difference? 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 93 of 143 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  It wouldn’t have been significant but 
there would have been a couple of bases points difference, potentially. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So if one – if Transnet weren’t 
interested in entering into a fixed rate swap at that point in time, they 
would have said, okay to the treasury, let’s have – what are the 
midmarket rates, in other words, what are the rates in the market that 
we should be able to fix at and Chair on the 4 t h of December it would 
have been 11.16 and this is extracted from market information that’s 
provided by sources, if I may, Bloomberg and Reuters and these – that 
10 
provide these types of – this type of information.  So the 11.16 would 
have been the basis added to that, as I’ve indicated previously would 
have been a couple of basis points or a couple of extra percent – 
points of a percent to make provision for some other risks, market 
execution fees, etcetera, etcetera but what is important to note is, what 
was the actual fixed rate that was paid by Transnet. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In the swap? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  In the Swap, that’s correct Chair, so 
it’s 11.83 which remains consist – which remains fixed for 15 years, at 
that point in time versus 11.16 which would have been a little higher 
20 
than that given the – as I indicated given some of the other risk factors 
that one would work into that but it would not come close to that fixed 
rate that was actually charged. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So we need to ask your opinion 
at this stage, the midmarket blended rate is the fixed rate basis upon 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 94 of 143 
 
which a fixed rate loan would have been entered into in the first place? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is what the market rate was at 
that point, so you would use that as the basis for your – to start off 
your understanding. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you would add on little bits, 
but they would be little bits. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Right not significant for the 
purposes of the question to follow I understand. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  No. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    But when it entered into the 
swap it paid a much higher or the equivalent of a much higher fixed 
rate. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right, now to the ordinary 
person the difference between 11.16 and 11.83 doesn’t seem huge, 
would you comment on that. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair from the perspective of the 
amount of money we’re talking about, in other words, 4.5billion rand it 
is the difference of 67 basis points or 0.67 percent in this particular 
20 
case is significant. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Alright and that’s – the 
difference between the midmarket blended rate and the fixed rate 
ultimately paid as part of the swap, you’ve referred to as the Delta. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s correct Chair. 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 95 of 143 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Is this Delta that you see here 
in your schedule 11.16 to 11.83, is it normal, you used a word in 
consultation earlier that was more descriptive. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair I did, I think the important 
thing is, this is not normal because the rate that would have been – the 
rate that one would have fixed at is – remember it would have been the 
market rate plus the execution fees that the counter party would have 
charged plus a – what’s called a CVA, a credit value adjustment, let’s 
not go there but it’s little extra risk factors that are built into the rate 
and that wold have been the rate at which they fixed.  So this rate of 
10 
11.83 was substantially higher than what would have actually 
happened. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Abnormally higher would that fit 
your description? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  It’s abnormally high Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright we’re going to deal with 
the second tranche but perhaps we should do that after the long 
adjournment on page 44 and the prospects of finishing by 4 o’clock are 
increasing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We’ll take the lunch adjournment and resume at two, 
20 
we’re adjourned. 
INQUIRY AJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  We may proceed. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  Doctor Bloom 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 96 of 143 
 
on page 44 you deal with the schedule in relation to the second tranche 
of the club loan of R12 billion.   
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Please place that information on 
record please? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  The second tranche Chair was – 
involved an amount of R7.5 billion and the execution of the swops took 
place on the 7 March in the same manner as presented for the first 
tranche 4.5 billion the same is done over – is done for the 7.5 billion.  
So if you – if you look at the floating rate transactions are very similar.  
10 
It would have – the rates would be different but in terms of – in terms 
of the floating rate if you add them up it comes to 9.62 and 9.71 so 
those were the floating rates but I think what is more important Chair is 
the – is the mid-market blended rate.  So that would have been the 
market rate that we as the same in the previous example but would 
have been 11.44% and the actual rate concluded or agreed in terms of 
the swop agreement was 12.27% with – between Transnet and 
Nedbank. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And again a similar amount as 
what you have described as the Delta. 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And do the same comments 
apply in relation to whether that is abnormally high, low? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  It is in exactly the same realm of the 
first tranche which is excessive if you think 11.44 versus 12.27 that is 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 97 of 143 
 
quite a jump or in the fixed rate and so in my opinion it is – it is high. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And so what do you conclude in 
the second last bullet on page 44? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So Chair Transnet overpaid for the 
swop transactions insofar as they incurred substantial losses as a 
consequence.  And they also paid excessive fees as – that is included 
in those rates and that is essentially very similar to the same – to the 
same situation occurred for the 4.5 billion. But Chair I would just like to 
indicate an interesting outcome of both tranches and that is if you – if 
you subtract in the 4.5 billion the fixed rate from the floating rate not 
10 
the mid-market just the fixed to the floating in the 4.5 billion and the 
fixed to the floating in the 7.5 billion the difference between those two 
rates it is exactly the same.  So in other words it was 2.65% which is – 
it does not work like that in practice.  In other words where the floating 
rate and the fixed rate payable it is as if it was aligned to be the same 
spread between  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  The floating and the fixed for both 
tranches. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What conclusion do you draw 
from that? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Well that appears to indicate that – 
that the fixed rate of both loans or both swops was intended to have a 
spread, a very high spread of 2.65% between the floating and the fixed 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 98 of 143 
 
rate.  In other words that is – that is excessive. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And who would benefit from that 
spread? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Well… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Excessive as you describe it? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  The counter party would benefit and 
then essentially and then Regiments obviously because their fee is 
included in the 2.27. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Would Regiments be the only party that would stand 
10 
to benefit from that? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair they were a point for these 
transactions they were appointed as the executing agent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So they would fulfil that role as 
trading the swops so yes they would the party and Nedbank as the 
counter party would benefit from the difference in the interest rates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So would – would your conclusion be that 
probably this was done to benefit Regiments and if in the process 
Nedbank 
benefited 
that 
might 
have 
been 
just 
an 
unintended 
20 
consequence. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Well Chair coming to the fees. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  It was – yes because in order 
Regiments were paid 20 basis points. 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 99 of 143 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  On each one of the swops. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So by splitting it – by splitting the 
loan into two tranches etcetera, etcetera was – would have benefitted 
them also in terms and Nedbank would have had a very high – would 
have had a benefit from the fact that the fixed rate payable by Transnet 
was so high.  And we have seen that is why the losses incurred by 
Transnet to date have accrued as a consequence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it – what are the chances that this might have been 
10 
simply a result of the negotiations between Nedbank and Transnet 
without anybody aiming to benefit Regiments as such and that 
Regiments just happened to benefit in the process?  What are the 
chances of that scenario having been the scenario? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  I do not think Regiments would have 
just benefitted.  I think this was planned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  In respect of the fact that entering 
into the swops would result in significant fees for them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For them ja. 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  From the other perspective and from 
what I have seen Nedbank indicate that the – the fixed rate paid or the 
2.2 – the 12.27 in this particular case was provided to them by 
Transnet and Transnet advisors as they say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 100 of 143 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So it was a question of Nedbank 
would have not entered into something like this if it was not beneficial 
to them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Or it did not make business sense for 
them to enter into such an arrangement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So obviously at that point in time 
they saw the rate as being an – beneficial. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Beneficial to them ja. 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  And it is – and that is what they 
concluded at. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And to the extent that the two figures or 
percentages that you talked about as having probably – having 
probably been aligned to the extent that they were aligned are you able 
to say they could not have been any bona fide innocuous motive or 
trying to align them? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Not Chair – not when it comes to 
interest rates or when it comes to marking rates to the market. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Which is what is required in an 
exercise like this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So it does seem – it does seem out of 
place or a little odd. 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 101 of 143 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  It is not something you have seen in your 
experience over the years? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  So you make the 
conclusion then on page 44 that at the very least what the above 
schedule shows is that Transnet significantly overpaid for swop 
transaction, is that still your opinion? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright let us go to page 45.  A 
10 
new challenge to explain this graph to us. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Okay Chair the – if – this a graph 
that takes a couple of things into account.  The first one is this is – this 
relates – the – has to do – first of all.  This relates to the cost of debt 
in other words the interest paid by Transnet.  But – and it relates to the 
two transactions that we have been talking about the 4.5 billion and the 
7.5 billion and the rates – the fixed rates … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Which made up the China 
Development – sorry made up the 12 billion? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  The 12 billion club loan. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Club loan? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  And that – the idea behind this is to – 
to indicate how does that relate to the overall cost of debt within 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 102 of 143 
 
Transnet?  As a – as a benchmarking exercise if I can… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay no let us take a step back. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What you have done in this 
graph is you have attempted to show the cost of debt in interest rate 
terms to Transnet on average? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay and there are two ways in 
which you portrayed that and the blue line and the red line and we will 
explain that in a moment.  And then in comparison to that you have 
10 
attempted to show what the cost of debt was in relation to the club 
loan? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And your comparison illustrates 
the basis of your conclusion which you will make at the end of this 
presentation? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright what is the blue line? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  The blue line with the dots that 
represents the weighted average cost of debt at Transnet.  Each month 
20 
for the period 1 September 2015 on the lower axis up until the 1 March 
2018. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay so the blue line and all its 
dots show what interest rate was being paid by Transnet on average in 
respect of all its debt at a particular date? 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 103 of 143 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What is weighted average? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Weighted average that is where WAC 
D comes in.  It is – because Transnet have different types of debt and 
the magnitude of the debt differ.  In other words they have different 
sizes like in – if I can indicate it like that.  They – in order to get an 
overall indication of what the cost of debt is you cannot just add up all 
the interest rates applicable to each of the loans or the etcetera you 
have to – you have to weight each one of those rates in terms of the 
size of the loan and that creates the average.  So that is why it is 
10 
called a weighted average cost of debt and it refers to all Transnet 
debt. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.   
CHAIRPERSON:  You specified from what period to what period earlier 
on.  Do you want to just repeat that in regard to that blue line? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It represents the weighted average cost of debt at 
Transnet from a certain date to a certain date? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair.  From the 1 
September 2015 until the 1 March 2018.  Now… 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That is the horizontal axis of the 
graph? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So if you take then the red line … 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 104 of 143 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well let us just 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Make a general observation 
about the blue line.  Over that three year period 1 September 2015 to 1 
March 2018 the cost of debt on a weighted average basis increased 
from approximately 9.4 % to 10.7%, is that correct? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  A gradual increase over that 
period of time? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  It – that is – Chair that is a 
10 
significant increase. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Is it a significant increase? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And it is what Transnet was 
paying on average for its debt? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  The red line? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  The red line represents the average – 
it is a normal average of the different dots on the blue line.  In other 
words if you add all the interest rates the weighted average cost of 
20 
debt rates on each on the blue line together and you divide it by the 
number of periods that we are talking about you get to an average of 
10.23. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Put differently the red 
line indicates the average rate of interest paid by Transnet for its debt 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 105 of 143 
 
over that whole three year period? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay and that average… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that during the same period? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  So that is one average of 
all the debt over that whole period? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me just make sure I have got it right.  The red line 
represents the normal average cost of debt at Transnet for the period 1 
10 
September 2015 to 1 March 2018. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair but just for clarification. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  It includes – it is the average of all 
the dots on the blue line.  In other words it is taking all the dots just to 
obtain an average over that period. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In fact… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  They should perhaps not be on 
the same graph because they different measures. 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  It is merely to indicate trend that is 
why it is there. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright so the blue line tells you 
at any particular date what the average cost of debt was.  So in 
September 2015 it was relatively low 9.4% but in March 2018 it was you 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 106 of 143 
 
say significantly higher 10.7% say. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair but I think what is 
important to understand is that to look at the dotted blue line from the 1 
April 2016.  In other words just under the red line and to look at – from 
that point to the end of the period which is the 1 March 2018.  That 
slightly upward movement is not significant.  It is the normal trend – it 
is the normal trending of interest rates higher. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  In terms of the cycle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So that is not abnormal if I can use 
that term. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  But what is interesting and this is 
caused by and we will get to the differences now but what is caused by 
the fact that they swopped so much debt from floating to fixed you 
could see there that from the 1 February there was a – there was an – 
let us start on the 1 – from the 1 December there was a slight increase 
and then – but from the 1 February up to the 1 April. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  There was quite a significant 
increase. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Spike. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  A spike.  And that was when the 
12.27 fixed rate swop was entered into.  So we changed the – 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 107 of 143 
 
essentially changed the debt profile of Transnet increasing the 
weighted average cost of debt up to that point. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright so you say what is 
significant here is that the blue line which reflects the weighted 
average of all debt spikes and that spike is caused by the fact that 
expensive interest rate swops are being entered into? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes in other words more fixed debt is 
being added or fixed – ja fixed debt is being added to the total debt of 
Transnet. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  At high interest rates. 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  At a high interest rate correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that we say is from around 1 February 2015 to 
around 1 April 2016? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So at any particular date on this 
graph one can see on the blue line what the weighted average is? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Cost of debt in interest rate 
terms. 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Correct.  And one can see the 
spike and you have explained the cause of the spike? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Those two vertical boxes relates 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 108 of 143 
 
that spike to the information that you are about to describe at the top of 
the graph. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So the green line and the… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No, no before we go to the green 
line we must explain the red line.  The red line is a single average over 
the whole period? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Okay.  Yes it is the single average 
over the whole… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And one can see that from the 
time of the spike more or less Transnet is paying above average rates 
10 
for its debt, correct? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright the green line is? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  The green line represents the fixed 
rate of the first tranche of 4.5 billion across that period and I will 
explain now the purple line represents the fixed interest rate of the 
R7.5 billion of the 12 billion on – in March 2016 – well the other one 
was in April – ag in December 2015. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Those are the fixed interest 
rates consequent upon the swop? 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair.  So the parallel lines 
or not the parallel lines the arrows between the average debt 10.23 and 
the green line that represents how higher – how much higher the actual 
overall cost of debt was that was entered in – although the – how much 
higher the interest rate – fixed rate was entered into in the first tranche 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 109 of 143 
 
of swops when compared to the average.  In other words 11.83 
compared to 10.23 on average.  And that represents 1.6% which is on a 
type of debt book such as Transnet has is a significant impact.  On the 
dotted arrow which is drawn from the average 10.23 to the 12.27 the 
second tranche of the 12 billion that percentage is just over 2% which 
is also compared to the higher rates at which those swops were entered 
into also seems to be out of place. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  And Chair just by the way I think it 
just adds a little bit of context the last dot on the blue line on the 1 
10 
March 2018 is actually 10.64 just for interest sake. Because – so you 
can see that it is moving – it is trending up but it is not showing signs 
of exponential growth in rates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  An unskilled or non-
expert observer may say look the difference between the average debt 
over the period 10.23% and what was paid in the first and second swop 
1.6% or 2.04% more is only one or two percent it is not much.  What 
would your response to that be? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair as I indicated on the debt – on 
20 
the size of the debt book especially on the fixed side that Transnet 
have it represents a substantial amount - it can represent a substantial 
difference in financing cost.  In other words it means it is just – it is 
extra – it is extra funds that Transnet have to find or – to settle just the 
cost of debt which is then – which is out of kilter with the market. 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 110 of 143 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  On page 46 you refer to the fees 
that accrued to or were paid to Regiments as fees for executing the 
swops. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You say that the manner of 
calculation of the fees and the resultant amount accrued to or paid to 
Regiments is the subject matter of further investigation? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So we will deal with that Chair at 
another stage.  You are now going to move to a completely different 
10 
transaction and that is the transaction that involved the Transnet 
second defined benefit fund. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It involved Transnet and it 
involved Regiments? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  What is the TSDBF?  
Transnet Second Defined Benefit Fund?   
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair it is one of Transnet’s funds ag 
pension funds but in terms if you look at its name it is a defined benefit 
20 
fund in other words it pays out benefits to beneficiaries but does not 
receive … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Contributions. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Contributions correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And those benefits are fixed?  
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 111 of 143 
 
Transnet has to pay them? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You cannot say I am in financial 
trouble? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Or it cannot say my investments 
are not doing too well? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right it has to pay those 
benefits in terms of its rules? 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  And in terms of the agreements with 
the beneficiaries. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes okay.  Well let us not go into 
that detail.  It is just that in relation to the performance of the fund 
Transnet itself is risk? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  So you say there was 
an amount of R11.3 billion of Transnet debt. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Now this is just Transnet debt in 
20 
general it is not necessarily a particular loan it is just part of 
Transnet’s debt at a particular time? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair and it does not 
align also with the financing that we have been talking about for the 
loco – for the Chinese locomotives. 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 112 of 143 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.   
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  This is a separate transaction but it 
is dealt with in terms of interest rate swops. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  And this debt had been 
incurred by Transnet as I understand your evidence as a floating rate of 
interest? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to go back to the terminology of hedging.  In this 
context where it says at a stage it was decided to hedge R11.3 billion 
10 
of Transnet debt which was at floating rate which was under the 
floating rate regime – swop with the company – so it goes back to the 
normal where – meaning that we gave it to protect – to protect. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it was decided to protect this amount – this debt? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You will recall an earlier 
question from the Chair where he asked was it always the case that a 
hedging transaction would be preceded by another transaction such as 
20 
a loan agreement? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is not entirely always the case.  
In this particular case this was existing debt within Transnet. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So one can take your existing 
debt and hedge it? 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 113 of 143 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Or you can take a particular loan 
at a time and hedge the implications of that loan? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I do not know I am trying to look at the – what 
appeared to me initially to be a subtle distinction that may – you may 
be seeking to make here in regard to the earlier question I had asked 
whether a swop or a transaction must always be preceded by another 
transaction.  It seems to me that even here you do have a pre – a pre-
10 
existing transaction or transactions because you do already have a 
loan. Those loans – that loan must be based on a transaction or based 
on a number of transactions? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So going back to the answer you had given to 
my question earlier it should still apply that you cannot have a swop 
arrangement without a pre-existing transaction.  It can be a transaction 
or transactions maybe? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair you need debt. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes there must a debt. 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  You need to have… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  You need to have incurred debt. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  To be able to do the transaction. 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 114 of 143 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and the debt cannot come about without some 
transaction? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright.  I just want to make sure I – because 
I had come to understand it in a certain way and I want to make sure 
that it is still fine – still applies. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So as I understand what 
happened here was that someone or other earmarked R11.3 billion of 
10 
Transnet debt from its book? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And said we are going to hedge 
this? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is right. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  From floating to fixed? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Now what is interesting 
here is the role that Regiments or Regiments related entities played.  
The person in debt at this stage – the person liable for the debt was 
20 
Transnet. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The counterparty in the hedging 
transaction was who? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  The Pension Fund. 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 115 of 143 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Transnet’s Pension Fund? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes, TSDBF. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So we have the situation - 
whether extraordinary or not that is for a later comment - where 
Transnet is as - you described to the Chair earlier – betting against its 
Pension Fund? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And there can only be one 
winner? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  I was just going to say that.  There 
10 
can only be one winner, correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me make sure I follow that.  This 11.3 billion debt 
that Transnet had – had is not connected with the fund.  The fund is 
going to be another party to the swap transaction? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay alright. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So if one goes back to our 
explanatory boxes that we started off this morning the right hand side 
of your explanatory diagram is Transnet debt to various creditors … 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That remains but Transnet says I 
am now going to hedge the floating interest rate debt and the 
counterparty in this hedge is going to be Transnet Second Defined 
Benefit Fund? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 116 of 143 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so it is not a requirement that in a – in a swap 
transaction it is not a requirement that one of the parties be a bank of 
financial institution or is it a – an essential requirement? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see this is a fund as opposed to Nedbank or Absa. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair this is – this is very unusual. 
You would – because the fund is – is – has sufficient collateral and 
funds that is why they would – that is why they would be able to enter 
into this type of transaction.  In other words if – if the rate or if the 
10 
swap went against them then they would be able to pay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  From pensioners’ money? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  From pensioners’ money.  So that is 
what makes the – that is what makes this transaction very unusual in 
terms of using a – a pension fund as a counterparty for a swap 
transaction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I – I can understand that in the context of a bank 
being party to a swap transaction that there may be – the motive for 
engaging in a swap transaction would be that they are confident with 
their forecast on interest rates and they think they will – they stand a 
20 
good chance of making money. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they are in the financial sector.  That is – that 
forms part of their core business.  Now if it is somebody else I guess 
the principle – the same motive might still apply except that in a certain 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 117 of 143 
 
set of facts an entity that may not be a bank may be unnecessarily 
taking a risk.  Is that right? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
Yes 
Chair 
the 
further 
implications will emerge as we proceed in evidence.  What is significant 
about this transaction quite apart from what the Chair has questioned 
you about is the role that Regiments played or Regiments related 
entities played.  Who were the Fund Managers of the benefit fund? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair Regiments Fund Managers 
10 
which is another company a different company to the Regiments 
providing consulting or advisory services to Transnet were also – were 
the fund appointed by the Pension Fund as their Fund Managers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Are they related companies? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Well they are from the same stable.  I 
am not sure if they – how the parties relate to each other. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well you say so. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes.  They related in terms of the – in 
terms of the group. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  So they part of the same 
group or stable? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So Regiments Fund Managers 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 118 of 143 
 
are the  
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Fund Managers of the Defined 
Benefit Fund of Transnet? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And obviously as Fund Managers 
they play a role in the decision making regarding investments? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Sorry Chair did I 
interrupt? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No you asked exactly the same question I wanted to 
ask.  So that is okay – that is okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And the other Regiments in the 
stable what role did they play in relation to Transnet itself? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair they were the – the party that 
were the advisory – the advisors to Transnet on various transactions.  
So it was – there appeared to be the two parties discussing the 
transactions with each other together with Transnet. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So go back to your earlier 
comments regarding one counterparty “betting” against the other 
20 
counterparty on different premises and forecasts and your comment in 
addition to that there can only be one winner and therefore one loser. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Regiments in whatever part of 
the stable are on the one hand conducting the transaction on behalf of 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 119 of 143 
 
Transnet and advising Transnet.  Correct? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And on the other hand are the 
Fund Managers in control of the investments of the Pension Fund? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  The question of conflict 
of interest obviously arises but that is a legal issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So in the third bullet point at page 48 
Regiments Fund Managers Pty Ltd you say there: 
“At the time of this transaction a party related to 
10 
Regiments (Regiments Fund Managers (Pty) Ltd).” 
Is that – is that the party that – that was the Fund Manager for TSDBF 
or Regiments Fund Managers was the one that Regiments were using? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Regiments Fund Managers were the 
fund managers of the TSDBF.  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, okay.  Okay.  It is a – it is a question of – 
for me once you have got brackets there it means something else but if 
you put commas on either side it means exactly what you are saying.  
So … 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Apologies Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  You make the point then 
that we have just alluded to on page 49 at the first bullet.  Would you 
state or explain that with the Chair? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair I think in this – this 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 120 of 143 
 
transaction is no different to the transactions concluded previously on 
the – the R12 billion club loan.  Transnet in this particular case would 
pay the fixed rate to the TSDBF and receive the floating rate notionally.  
As we have been discussing and the funds of the pensioners would be 
used to cover the position if floating rates exceeded the fixed rate. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So if the fund lost the gamble 
and was the loser who would fund that loss? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  The fund would, ja – if the – if the 
floating rates exceeded the fixed rates that Transnet were paying the 
fund then the fund would have to pay Transnet from the – from the 
10 
(intervenes). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Pensioners? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So they were going to put the pensioners’ money at 
risk? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes and we will come to one of 
the possible reasons why in a moment Chair.  In any event under the 
second bullet you raise a question which you do not answer.  It says 
merely under investigation.  The question whether it would be lawful in 
20 
terms of Pension Legislation Rules and Policies to put funds at risk in 
this manner. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct because Chair in 
terms of the - normally an investment policy statement which is 
underscored by the – by the Fund Rules would place restrictions on the 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 121 of 143 
 
types of investment or the types of instruments that one could use and 
that – the intention behind that is just to prevent taking too much risk 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  At the expense of – of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Pensioners. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Of the pensioners’ funds. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So yes the – as Advocate Pretorius 
indicated one must also remember that the Transnet Pension Fund is 
10 
not a South African – a Regulation 28 Pension Fund.  It is falls under 
the auspices of Transnet but there – but it works on exactly the same 
basis.  There are Fund Rules.  There are investment policies etcetera.  
So this is – this also needs to be understood in the – in the broader 
context as – as was indicated it is a legal matter but in – in other words 
was – was the TSDBF committed to actually engage in this transaction. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes and as you say it is not the 
Pension Fund Act.  It is the Transnet Pension Fund Act that is at issue 
here. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But there are also Fund Rules 
and investment policy statements? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But you have a situation here 
where one would think general principles would apply.  Regiments 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 122 of 143 
 
under one guise is duty bound to act in the interest of the fund because 
it is the Fund Manager. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Regiments in another guise is 
duty bound to act in the interest of Transnet … 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Because it is employed by 
Transnet to execute the funds and pay the fee to do so. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  To execute the transactions.  It 
10 
was paid a fee to do so.  Correct? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Conflict of interest seems pretty 
obvious but we will do that in due course Chair.  We will not deal with it 
here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is – is there any possible significance in the 
closeness of the amounts involved in these two transactions where 
swap arrangements were involved?  The one was R12 billion.  The 
other one is r11.3 billion or is it a coincidence. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair that is a very good question.  I 
20 
do not know but in my conclusions I will venture an opinion in terms of 
– of the various transactions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  It is quite strange.  Maybe it is not strange to … 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  People who are in the financial sector.  It is – it is – 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 123 of 143 
 
when you have a transaction involving R12 billion for which you decide 
there should be a swap arrangement and then among all your debts you 
say okay debts amounting to R11.3 billion also I will have a swap 
transaction. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well the question arises and this 
question will hopefully be answered at the end of all the evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  A very lucrative for certain 
parties arrangement … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Hedging arrangement is entered 
into … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Relating to R12 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Did someone not say well let us 
do it again? 
CHAIRPERSON:  And of course you have just told us that there seemed 
to be – there was some relationship between the Fund Managers that 
were used for in this one and Regiments in the other one? 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair.  I think I might 
just then comment … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  On what Advocate Pretorius has just 
said.  One must realise and it also relates back to your question is a 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 124 of 143 
 
coincidental that we are talking about 12 billion and very close to 
another 12 billion.  If you look at it – if you look at how the transactions 
were structured in other words we started off with 4.5 billion and that 
went through very easily.  If you look in that – if that works why not do 
it again.  So then let us try 7.5 - the other portion of the 12 billion and 
if that works great let us try it again and each time it increased by a 
significant factor from 4.5 to 7.5 to 11.3.  So – so the question is this – 
this was an interesting trend that was – that was emerging in terms of 
this continuously swapping of floating to fixed rates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In any event we know that these 
issues which you are now making comment on and rendering your 
opinion are indeed the subject of litigation. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And also the subject of further 
investigation. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Which we hope to conclude at 
least to a degree from the part of the investigators and legal team in 
due course Chair.  Now there is a schedule on page 50 where like the 
20 
schedules that you dealt with this morning the loss to Transnet is 
quantified. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  What are these losses? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM: 
 
Chair 
the 
– 
the 
approach 
to 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 125 of 143 
 
understanding the table is exactly the same as – as the previous table.  
In other words if you look at the third column from the right the realised 
cash flow.  This is also at 14 May.  Transnet have incurred actually 
losses.  In other words they physically paid R720.8 million. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So in addition to the interest 
they are paying to the lender in the original transaction? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair because this has got to do 
with a swap. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes and that is a discreet 
separate transaction as we have learnt? 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct and then the – that is 
the 720.  Then if Transnet were to – to exist this – this particular 
transaction that the 14 t h – on 14 May it would have cost them 815 
million.  So if we take the third and the second column from the right 
and we add them together the potential loss would be 1.5 billion which 
is then an actual loss at this point in time or at least on 14 May of 720 
and if they wanted to exit the transaction if they went – if they went to 
the TSDBF and that is what makes this thing very complicated.  They 
went to the TSDBF now and said listen.  We now went to – we are 
paying you.  You can see we are paying you and we want to exit the 
20 
transaction.  Then the TSDBF just based on market – market inputs 
would tell them that you need to pay us because we have entered into a 
– a 15 year agreement.  You need to pay us R815 million. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Because that would be our loss 
if you exit? 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 126 of 143 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And according to that is that 
what Transnet would have lost over the full period? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So this swap this hedging 
exercise has already cost Transnet R720 million and over the full 
period of the swap transaction would on present day calculations cost 
R1.5 billion? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Now the interesting fact.  You 
10 
say there can be a winner and a loser in equivalent amounts.  Who 
benefitted here? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  The Pension Fund. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  By an amount of so far anyway? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  720 million. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  720 million but here is a further 
question.  Regiments are the Fund Managers.  There will be evidence 
Chair that as Fund Managers Regiments are entitled to a significant 
portion of the investment upside.  So they would get a cut of that R720 
million? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and is that in addition to fees or that is the 
form of their fees? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No they would get their fees 
from Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Separate, yes, yes.  Oh, in addition … 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 127 of 143 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  For – for doing the swap. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In addition get some percentage of this amount that 
must go to … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So insofar as it is Regiments … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Is one the two entities are … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Are of the same stable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  They get paid by Transnet on the 
10 
one hand … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PETORIUS:  For doing the swap … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And on the other hand they get a 
cut of the profits made by the Pension Fund … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  To a significant amount … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And that may for the moment 
20 
only a question mark Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Explain … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Why this happened. 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 128 of 143 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What is your view? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes, I think just to answer Chair’s 
question … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  From a fund management perspective 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Regiments would get a - a fund 
management fee … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM: 
 
And 
if 
they 
did 
performance 
benchmarks … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Which refers to the upside … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Then they would get an additional 
fee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So – so there are – you are right 
20 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  There are two fees involved … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Over and above the execution of the 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 129 of 143 
 
transactions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So it will be important to establish how 
Regiments got to be the Fund Managers for the Fund – for the Pension 
Fund. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes and could sit in this 
transaction on both sides of the fence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Ja, okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Profiting from both sides. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  When the duty of good faith is 
10 
held to both not one but those will be – those questions will be 
addressed in the fullness of time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  For the moment we are laying 
the basis for possible questions to be asked and perhaps answered in 
due course.  Conclusions on page 52 Dr Bloom. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair I have identified five – we have 
spoken a lot about various aspects and I have identified five points that 
I think are – are relevant in terms of a conclusion.  The first one deals 
with the expertise and skills within Transnet to – to execute these 
20 
transactions.  These – these people who had the knowledge and the 
understanding and the skill were side-lined when it came to these 
transactions.  In other words there was almost like a parallel process 
being run and – and as a consequence this was in the context of – of 
highly questionable agreements with third party advisors.  So that is my 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 130 of 143 
 
first conclusion.  The second – the second point has to do with the club 
loan.  Entering into the swap transactions as we have discussed on a 
floating rate basis and then deliberately changing the scope of the 
transaction by fixing the rates immediately thereafter or within a very, 
very short period is – is questionable.  So that is the second part.  The 
third point … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You make another point in 
paragraph 2. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  When you say in your view what 
10 
the reason was for entering into the loan on a floating rate basis.  What 
is your conclusion there? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That the – that it could have been – it 
would have been in contravention to the Risk Management or the 
Financial Risk Management Policy of Transnet.  Entering into the 
Floating Rate Agreement would have been deliberate if you are within 
three days going to change the – the basis of your cost of debt to fixed.  
So this was – it cannot be anything else really because as we have 
determined there would have been sufficient information on which to 
base the decision prior the conclusion of the loan. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But also is the position not that whoever it is at 
Transnet who decided that in regard to the 12 – in regard to the R12 
billion loan the interest rate regime should be a floating one – floating 
interest rate?  Whoever would have been would have had authority to 
make that decision would have known that before you make that 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 131 of 143 
 
decision you must do some homework.  You must base it on – on proper 
analysis of the relevant factors and – and do a focused.  Is that right. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if he or she decided not to do that focus to say 
the least that would have been grossly negligent. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair.  It would have 
been and then it would have been almost a preconceived … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Idea. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  It is – it is almost inconceivable that when such 
10 
big amounts are involved that person could have negligently not done 
the focused. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair and not followed 
policy? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Why is policy then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Applicable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So, yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the very decision that he or she was called upon 
to take necessarily required that a focus be done because otherwise 
how do you make an informed decision whether it should be a floating 
interest rate regime or a fixed rate regime. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 132 of 143 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  To choose between those two you must – you must 
have before you the focused. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Absolutely that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – and if that person did the focused before 
choosing the floating interest rate regime the information before him or 
her would have been the same as the information that was before him 
or her when she decided or he decided there should be a swap and it 
should be a fixed rate. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair.  They used the 
same system. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And on the same facts you cannot on the one hand 
arrive on the decision that a floating rate – floating interest rate regime 
is the correct one and on the same facts a few days later arrive at the 
decision that the – the correct regime – interest rate regime is a fixed 
one.  Is that alright or am I – am I overstating any of these things? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  No Chair.  You are not over – you are 
not oversimplifying.  It is just the – it is a very clear unusual set of 
circumstances … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Coming to different conclusions using 
20 
exactly the same information … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  But not only that it is – it is the – it is 
the scope of how those conclusions were arrived at. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 133 of 143 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Which is – which is interesting 
because it was not as if the two parties might have been close together 
in terms of the decision.  It - it appears as if there were very or totally 
divergent views potentially on – on the decision where to remain 
floating, go fixed or start with fixed etcetera. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is highly unlikely that the person who made that 
decision could come here and say I did not do the focused or there was 
not a focused on which I relied? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair because you 
have to – for – for decisions from – from reading memoranda and - and 
10 
so on … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  From Transnet … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Everything has to be motivate and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  And justified. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but even if it had not been motivated by somebody 
else I cannot see how any organisation would allow you to or you would 
think you would be allowed to make such a decision with such far 
20 
reaching financial implications for the organisation without doing that 
homework. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is – that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if that person were to come here and say I did do 
the homework then they would have to explain how they came to two 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 134 of 143 
 
contradicting – contradictory decisions on the same material within a 
matter of days. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well you deal with one certainty 
in paragraph 4 on page 52 and that is the ability to forecast the amount 
of fees paid to third parties.  What is the point you make there? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  In other – Chair are you talking about 
point 3 or fout? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Point 4 … 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Point 3. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But you can go back to point 3 if 
you wish. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Okay.  Yes the resulting hedging 
transactions were in themselves questionable as we have – as we have 
discussed and as we have seen in the numbers that the – the hedging 
cost to Transnet have been excessive.  In other words Chair they have 
– Transnet have not been in the money.  That is a – that is a market 
term where you either – it is either working to your – the transaction is 
working to your benefit or it is not working to your benefit and that is 
20 
what is – what is interesting about this but I would just like to add to – 
that if I may and that is to do with – the question is would Transnet be 
able to get into the money, in other words would at some stage over 
this fifteen year period would Transnet be able to in other words 
actually receive a benefit from entering into these swap transactions.   
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 135 of 143 
 
 
I think what is important is that it’s – one doesn’t – it doesn’t 
happen at a point in time, you have to take into consideration the 
losses that they incurred up to to date and even if interest rates, the 
floating rates went above the fixed rates, as we’ve been speaking it 
would have to increase significantly for an extended period of time for 
them to be able to recoup the losses and then actually receive the 
benefit, so from – in my view is it’s going to be difficult to achieve that, 
it’s not to say it’s impossible, who knows what happens over 15 years 
or the remaining 12 odd years that are left, but it’s – one mustn’t be, 
one mustn’t lose sight of the fact that you can’t just ignore what 
10 
happened in the past, you have to understand what that was and then 
what the implication of the future is if you get into a position where you 
actually benefit from the transaction. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So if interest rates in relation to 
the swaps were to turn in favour of Transnet it would still have to 
recoup its losses before it benefits from the change of interest rates. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s correct Chair and an extremely 
high interest rate for an extended period of time would be required. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And one of course must keep 
this in perspective, the losses resulting from the hedging transactions 
20 
in relation to the R12billion loan, almost 10% of that loan, are in 
addition to the interest that Transnet is paying to the lenders in terms 
of the original transaction. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then in point four what is the 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 136 of 143 
 
point you make? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  The transactions involving Regiment 
and others related to the above resulted in the payment of excessive 
amount of fees to them, with the corresponding cost to Transnet, as 
I’ve indicated that is a subject of further investigation currently, to get 
an understanding of exactly how much fees are we talking about, and 
how those fees were calculated.   
 
The – in terms of the last point Chair in the conclusions, the 
transaction involving the TSDBF Transit and Regiments there appears 
to be an intolerable conflict of interest, in especially with regard to the 
10 
TSDBF and that needs to be understood and unpacked in going 
forward. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And that will still be done. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And in particular what you 
haven’t dealt with which still has to be dealt with is how did Regiments 
as fund managers benefit from the profit or upside experienced by the 
defined benefit fund. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s correct Chair, the performance 
fee. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, alright some final remarks 
in relation to your evidence before we conclude, this is not in your 
statement but it’s merely a summary highlighting certain points that 
you’ve made.  The first point is that we have in your presentation, or 
you have in your presentation attempted to explain concepts in a way 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 137 of 143 
 
that is accessible to ourselves and the public, and have attempted to 
simplify the processes involved to enable understanding.   
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But in reality these transactions, 
for example a loan involving syndicated loan funding, long-term 
repayment dates, and at times offshore, involving exchange are these 
simple, complex transactions, are they easily entered into and 
negotiated? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  No Chair they are not simple 
transactions and they take some time to conclude so yes there’s – 
10 
because there are various dimensions to each one of these and in many 
cases what we’re talking about here are inter-related, so the matters 
are inter-related and you need to unpack each component as part of a 
broader understanding. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then you’ve also dealt with 
and explained risk mitigation processes, financial instruments used to 
hedge as you’ve described it? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Hedging instruments the 
involvement of counterparties, the negotiation and conclusion of a 
20 
hedging deal, the involvement of agents again are these straightforward 
matters that can be concluded within a very short period of days? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  No Chair not if you have to adhere to 
various policies, and various processes related to entering into the 
transactions.  Our planning information from the market is relatively 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 138 of 143 
 
simple, you would phone a couple of counterparties or financial 
institutions and get the information you’re looking for, but to unpack 
that information consider the impact on your debt book, which is what 
we are referring to here, is a – it takes a while and then you still have 
to go through the processes of getting approval and authorisation to 
enter into the transactions. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then of course you’ve got to 
negotiate the transaction. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  With each party serving its own 
10 
interests. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right, so would it be fair to say 
that these are highly complex transactions? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Requiring detailed preparation. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  And negotiations. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And negotiation.  You have 
studied these transactions? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:   Yes Chair.  
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And according to your own 
general knowledge and expertise and your particular knowledge of 
these transactions about which you’ve given evidence as I understand 
it you are able to make some observations. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s correct Chair. 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 139 of 143 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Express some opinion.  Let me 
ask this question then, these transactions, the original Club Loan for 
example, and the changes made to decisions concerning these 
transactions, for example the decision now to hedge in effect to pay a 
fixed interest rate in the swap transaction, were these ad hoc changes 
caused by an intervening market change, or simply a change of mind or 
can you say whether they were pre-planned in your opinion? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair in my view this was pre-
planned and one of the reasons for that is there are so many  
components to these various transactions that have occurred, they’ve 
10 
also occurred in a very short period of time, in order to orchestrate 
something like this substantial planning needs to have occurred.  We 
just have to look at the Club Loan as you’ve indicated, signed on the 
23 r d of November, the first draw was on the 1 s t of December, it was 
hedged on the – the hedge approval in other words the approval for the 
hedge was on the 3 r d of December and it was executed on the 4 t h of 
December, so in order to do all of that it would not have taken those 
couple of days, it would have been pre-planned and ...(intervention)  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  By pre-planned you mean before 
the 23 r d of November signature to the floating interest rate loan? 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair, and as a consequence of 
that it resulted in significant ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, before you deal with the consequence what 
would you say would be the minimum period that would have been 
taken by the preparation, are you talking about a month, are you talking 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 140 of 143 
 
about a week, two weeks, three months before that date? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair it would have taken a couple of 
weeks, as I said it’s not only, it’s easy to get the information from the 
market but then you have internal processes and Transnet’s internal 
processes would have resulted – they would have had to check the 
impact on the risk management or the finance risk management policy, 
they  would have had to understand what the impact that – it would 
have had on the mix of floating to fixed rates, does it still remain within 
the – within that structure, all of those types of calculations and 
assessment would have been required prior to this, then they would 
10 
have still had to obtain approvals to move into the space of providing 
or executing the transactions.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then of course they – I’m sorry 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay you were going to consequence, I interrupted 
him when he was going to consequence, I don’t want him to forget 
whatever point he wanted to make. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  No Chair I think ...(intervention)  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry, may I just ask a related 
question to your question Chair.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, that’s fine, yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Of course when all that is done 
you are ready to begin the negotiations with the counterparty. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s correct Chair, once you have 
done all your homework then you would enter into those discussions 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 141 of 143 
 
and it would depend on the appetite of the counterparty.  It might be 
that the counterparty doesn’t – is not interested, in other words it 
doesn’t work, they don’t – they are not amenable to the ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  They need persuasion? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  They might need persuasion but then 
that means that you have to go and find another counterparty. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  And somebody that’s actually 
prepared to enter into these negotiations so it’s not that you go to the 
first one for instance and you obtain success, it depends on who you 
10 
want to deal with and as I indicated in the evidence Chair that’s there 
also Transnet have a list of counterparties, so they might go to a few of 
them and say this is the type of transaction we want to do so let’s start 
the discussion. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But even if you succeed with the 
first counterparty it’s still, as I understand your evidence, a very 
complex detailed negotiation that must take place. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair there’s definitely 
negotiation. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In order to reach an agreement 
20 
with the party with counter-veiling interests. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That’s correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry I interrupted you, you were 
about to deal with consequences. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes, I mean in terms of the – how the 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 142 of 143 
 
transactions were executed, in terms of the nature of these 
transactions, the scope, in terms of size, the amounts we’ve been 
discussing, excessive fees, excessive costs, and because as I 
indicated 
previously 
Chair 
we’re 
talking 
about 
three 
specific 
transactions, 4.5, 7.5 and 11.3.  It appeared to indicate a trend that’s 
as much as I can say because if there were hurdles at the first 
transaction, in other words the first 4.5 or the 4.5 it would have been 
difficult to proceed to the 7.5 swap and because as I indicated it 
appeared to go through smoothly, there was an opportunity to then use 
the TSDBF it appears as a counterparty to further another 11.3 of 
10 
floating the fixed debt. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Dr Bloom.  As the 
Chair requested and directed we would be grateful if you would prepare 
a detailed report in relation to your evidence with supporting 
documents in the form of an expert affidavit, I trust you are willing to 
do so? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  I am Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Thank you very  much Dr Bloom, we 
20 
appreciate your having come to share your expertise with us.  I have 
tried to learn. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  You have Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much and I trust that when the 
remaining parts of the work that still needs to be done has been done 
05 JUNE 2019 – DAY 106 
 
Page 143 of 143 
 
arrangements will be made for that to be shared with the Commission 
as well. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But thank you very much and you are excused. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  It is my pleasure thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Tomorrow how many witnesses have we got, do you 
know? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I understand one witness Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who would take the whole day?  You don’t know? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I’m reluctant to forecast without 
10 
doing my homework Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You need to do your homework first. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But I understand for the bulk of 
the day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Okay no then probably we should just start 
at ten o’clock. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  As you please Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will adjourn the proceedings for the day and 
tomorrow we will start at ten o’clock.  We adjourn.
