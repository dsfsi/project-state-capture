PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 11 JANUARY 2021 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Sibiya, good morning 
everybody. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes Chair we are ready. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Craythorne you – the oath you took on 
Friday will continue to apply in – with your evidence this 
morning.  Ms Sibiya I have reflected on Mr Craythorne’s 
entire affidavit. I do not think that it is necessary to take 
10 
longer than two hours to complete his evidence.  He has 
confirmed the contents of the affidavit as correct.  What 
remains is that you must just focus on important issues – 
cover important issues in his oral evidence and I do not 
think that we need more than two hours for that so that 
thereafter I can deal with the question of what is going to 
happen with today’s other witness.  Okay.  So go for the 
important issues so that he can cover the important issues 
in your oral evidence otherwise everything that he has said 
in his affidavit is before the commission; he has confirmed 
20 
it to be correct; it is there to be read. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Thank you Chair that is duly noted.  Mr 
Craythorne you heard that. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 4 of 195 
 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  I did. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Okay thank you very much.  On Friday when 
we left off you were dealing with the complaints that you 
had levelled against the mining contractors and on page 23 
of Bundle Number 4 that is where we – that is where we 
stopped.  We were on page 23 of Bundle Number 4.  You 
indicated in paragraph 86 you say that it is only after 
Moodley was implicated in state capture that your contract 
was reinstated. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV SIBIYA:  Do you link the two? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  I do link the two because it became 
apparent at that point that the complaints that I had made 
in regard to Mr Moodley’s involvement in Scarlet Sky 
seemed to have reason to be concerned over. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Okay.  And you end off that section by 
indicating that the South African tax payers and the 
Ritchtersveldt community also deserved protection from 
what you would describe as the wholesale theft of the 
marine diamonds of Alexkor.  You say this has been 
20 
achieved 
by 
manipulation 
of 
the 
provisions 
of 
the 
agreement 
between 
the 
PSJV 
and 
the 
SSI 
and 
the 
persistent undervaluation of the diamonds produced by the 
contractors. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Correct. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 5 of 195 
 
ADV SIBIYA:  Now I will take you back on your affidavit to 
a section we did not deal with which is to be found – my 
apologies in the previous page on page 18.   
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Page 18? 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  In that page you talk about the – how 
the board of the Ritchtersveldt mining company was 
unlawfully constituted. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  That is correct. 
ADV 
SIBIYA: 
 
Now 
the 
relevance 
of 
this 
unlawful 
constitution of the mining company is what transpired at 
10 
the time that it was not properly constituted.  Is that 
correct? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  It was during the lead up to the – the 
awarding of the tender and the – the launching of the 
tender process that it became clear to the board of Alexkor 
as well as the Joint board of the PSJV that the directors of 
Ritchtersveldt Mining Company were not duly appointed.  
There has been as court case brought by Mr Craig 
Matthews against the removal of him as the sole director of 
Ritchtersveldt Mining Company and in his place the 
20 
appointment of three other directors who were then the 
directors that formed the representation on the PSJV for 
Ritchtersveldt Mining Company.  And I know that from a 
letter written by Mr Craig Matthews to Alexkor as well as 
Minister Lynne Brown which flowed out of his successful 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 6 of 195 
 
court action and that was confirmed by the Samela 
Judgment. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Confirmed there was a judgment 
confirming that he was at that particular time; that critical 
time he was in fact the only lawfully appointed director.  So 
the three Ritchtersveldt Mining Company representatives 
that were instrumental in on-boarding Scarlet Sky were not 
lawfully – they were acting unlawfully because they should 
not have been in those positions.  And Mr Craig Matthews 
10 
made it very clear to both the boards of Alexkor and the 
board of the PSJV. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Hm. 
ADV SIBIYA:  And… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do we have a copy of that judgment? 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In bundle? 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes Chair in fact it is on page 469 of this 
same bundle that we are busy with.  If we can turn there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay – okay thank you. 
20 
ADV SIBIYA:  Thank you Chair.  Now on this page – are 
you there yet Mr Craythorne? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Almost there.  I am now. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Okay.  Now in this case we can see that this 
is a case that the judgment was delivered on the 4 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 7 of 195 
 
September 2014 by Samela J, correct?  On page 469.  Can 
you see where it says the judgment was delivered on the 4 
September 2014? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Okay now if we can turn to page 483. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  I have it. 
ADV SIBIYA:  The order is the third respondent was 
unlawfully removed as a director of the RMC on 22 
November 2013. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Correct. 
10 
ADV SIBIYA:  On page 469 where we last were it is clear 
that the third respondent is Craig Llewellyn Matthews, 
correct? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Now the court order continues to say: 
“The third respondent whom we now know is 
Mr Matthews is the sole director of the 
RMC.” 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  And on the very next page on page 484 
20 
we can see that this order is being sent via email by Mr 
Matthews the third respondent who is the sole director to a 
number of people.  Who are those people that he sent this 
court order and judgment to? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  That is Zarina Kellerman, Zuki which 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 8 of 195 
 
is Zukiswa Ntlangula. 
ADV SIBIYA:  What are their roles?  Sorry when you 
mention a name can you tell us who that is? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Okay.  Zarina Kellerman was the Chief 
legal officer at Alexkor Corporate. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Zukiswa Ntlangula was a board 
member of the Alexkor SOC board. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Raygen Phillips was the Company 
10 
Secretary of the PSJV. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Dr Raja Paul was a board member. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Of the JV or of Alexkor? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Of Alexkor.  And I – and he was also a 
board member of the Joint board.  Percy K that would be 
Percy Khoza was the CEO of Alexkor at the time. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Dr Nena Mahutchwa Matabane I am 
not sure what her position in the company would have 
20 
been.  And then lastly Mr Mervin Cartens who was the 
Chief Executive Officer of the PSJV. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  And if I may refer you also to page 400 
and – my apologies I have lost my page Chair.  Chair if the 
Chair will just bear with me.  It is actually the very next 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 9 of 195 
 
page 485. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  I have it. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Okay.  And on this – in this document this is 
a letter addressed from the Ritchtersveldt Mining Company 
to the directors of Alexkor and the CEO of the PSJV and 
the board secretary of the PSJV dated the 4 September, 
correct? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:  And we can see that in this letter Mr 
Matthews is communicating the content of the judgment. 
10 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:  And what does he say on paragraph 7 which 
is on the page 486? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Paragraph 7 reads as follows: 
“The further implications are very serious in 
that in any decisions that were taken by the 
PSJV board since November 2013 are on 
the fact of it invalid for the mere fact that 
the 
Ritchtersveldt 
Mining 
Company 
representatives were not appointed by the 
20 
RMC and had no authority to take decisions 
on behalf of the company and the PSJV 
board. 
 You 
were 
advised 
in 
previous 
communications 
that 
subsequent 
to 
the 
finalisation 
of 
the 
aforementioned 
court 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 10 of 195 
 
matters that RMC may review all decisions 
taken by the PSJV board since November 
2013.” 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  And if I move you on to page 490.  90 
– 490. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Yes. 
ADV SIBIYA:  What document is that? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  This is an email or a letter transmitted 
by email from Mr Craig Matthews – oh no sorry it is 
addressed – I beg your pardon.  It is a letter sent to Mr 
10 
Craig Matthews from Alexkor. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes and what is the subject line? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Western Cape High Court Matter. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Now this seems to be a response to the 
letter that had been sent by Mr Matthews, correct? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:  And in paragraph 2 together with 2.1 what 
does it say there in that letter? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  We – it starts with: 
“As 
far 
as 
we 
do 
however 
note 
the 
20 
following:  Neither the company nor the 
PSJV were parties to the court action 
referred to in your aforementioned letter 
and 
as 
a 
result 
the 
attached 
– 
the 
attachment of the court’s ruling as well as 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 11 of 195 
 
an expose of the court action is of no 
consequence to us.” 
ADV SIBIYA:  Now what do you make of that response from 
Alexkor? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  I think it is a reckless disregard for 
good governance and for the high court. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Hm.  And in fact I can take you further to 
page 495 of the same document.   
CHAIRPERSON:  You mean of the same bundle. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Of the same bundle – my apologies Chair. 
10 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  I have it in front of me. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Now we can see that this is a letter on the 
letterhead of Adams and Adams. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Dated – and it is dated the 5 November 
2014. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:  It is addressed to Mr Bagus but with a wrong 
spelling. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Correct. 
20 
ADV SIBIYA:  Okay.  Now if I can just refer you to – well 
they confirm firstly that they act for the Ritchtersveldt 
Mining Company and they are writing the letter at the 
direction of the sole director Mr Craig Matthews. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Correct. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 12 of 195 
 
ADV SIBIYA:  And then in paragraph 4 they also confirm 
that: 
“On 
considering 
your 
correspondence 
regarding the judgment it is apparent to us 
that you are under the mistaken belief that 
due to not being a party to the proceedings 
the judgment is of no consequence to you 
despite the central issue in the judgment 
being the directorship of our clients.” 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Correct. 
10 
ADV SIBIYA:  And then they go on to address this – what 
Adams and Adams referred to as he mistaken belief.  Do 
you see that in paragraph 5? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  I do. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  And they say in paragraph 5.2 – 5.2: 
“The fact that Alexkor was not a party to the 
said 
proceedings 
is 
irrelevant. 
 
The 
decision 
making 
process 
of 
the 
PSJV 
presupposes that the directors of our client 
were 
validly 
appointed 
and 
or 
validly 
20 
removed.” 
And it sets out what the judgment says. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  So if we turn further to page 497. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  I have it in front of me. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 13 of 195 
 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  In paragraph 5.4 do you confirm that it 
says: 
“Although our client accepts that you and 
the community property association are co-
signatories to the settlement agreement 
your primary contractual obligation in terms 
of 
the 
settlement 
agreement 
and 
the 
unanimous resolution are to our client and 
his correctly appointed board of directors.” 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Correct. 
10 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  And in paragraph 5.5 what is the last 
thing that they mention? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   
“Outlined is particularly concerned by your 
failure to appreciate the potential for all the 
decisions 
taken 
by 
the 
PSJV 
from 
22 
November 
2013 
by 
an 
improperly 
constituted board to be rendered null and 
void.  This is illustrated by your persistence 
in 
engaging 
the 
purported 
directors.  
20 
Despite the court order and accordingly 
there is a very real danger that the PSJV 
may be exposed to damages claims in 
respect 
of 
contractual 
arrangements 
concluded 
with 
third 
parties 
after 
22 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 14 of 195 
 
November 2013.” 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  And we already know from your 
evidence that what had transpired in this particular period 
was that there had been a decision that was taken to 
appoint – to go out on tender for the appointment of a 
service provider for the sale of diamonds. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Okay.  Now we note that we do not have a 
response after that letter – immediately after that letter.  
Oh please correct me because I am wrong.  On the very – 
10 
on page 499 is a response.  Mr Craythorne if I – if I am 
wanting you to confirm something that is incorrect just 
bring me to order. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  I will do so. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.   
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Thank you. 
ADV SIBIYA:  And on page 499 is a response dated the 7 
November 2014 from? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  It is from Alexkor and it is addressed 
to Adams and Adams attention Mr A Malber. 
20 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes and who is the author of the letter on 
page 500? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Ms Zarina Kellerman. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  And in this letter does Alexkor accept 
the position as set out in the letter of Adams and Adams?  
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 15 of 195 
 
Do they – do they even deal the merits of what was in the 
letter from Adams and Adams?  I will take you through to 
paragraph 4. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Yes Ma’am. 
ADV SIBIYA:  They say: 
“We place on record that Alexkor is never 
pronounced 
or 
actively 
supported 
any 
factions in the Ritchtersveldt community.  It 
has through its obligations supported the 
legitimately elected structures created in 
10 
terms of the deed of settlement concluded 
between the Government of South Africa 
and the people of Ritchterveldt for the full 
and proper implementation of the deed of 
settlement.” 
And in paragraph 5 they say: 
“Alexkor has no authority over the affairs of 
the 
Ritchtersveldt 
communal 
property 
association or its subsidiaries.  We refer 
you to” 
20 
And they refer to a judgment that deals with that. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:  And then they carry on in paragraph 6 and 
they say: 
“We 
are 
advised 
that 
your 
client 
was 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 16 of 195 
 
removed through proper resolutions by the 
majority 
shareholder 
of 
Ritchtersveldt 
Mining Company.” 
Now is this correct given what the judgment says: 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Well that shows utter contempt for 
Judge Samela in my view. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Hm.  Because is it not what the Judge in fact 
said – did not – is not what the Judge in fact say the exact 
opposite of this assertion? 
MR 
CRAYTHORNE: 
 
That 
is 
correct. 
 
They 
are 
10 
contradicting Judge Samela. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Hm.  Hm.  Now that is the last of that at that 
stage and that is in November.  That is on the 7 November 
2014. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Now we – you have already given evidence 
that on the 6 November what had been done by SSI and 
other companies. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  They had begun competing to – when 
the right to market and sell Alexkor ’s diamonds by way the 
20 
request for proposal 03/14 I believe it is. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.   And SSI had in fact on this submitted 
their – their show of interest or expression of interest. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  That – that is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:  So as at the date when this letter is being 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 17 of 195 
 
written by Alexkor the – the process is on-going. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  And a few weeks thereafter you have 
already testified as has Mr Torres that the proposals were 
in fact received by the PSJV and the PSJV continued to 
evaluate 
and 
take 
the 
necessary 
steps 
without 
the 
involvement of Mr Matthews who was the sole director at 
that time of the RMC. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  That is correct.  So the – the whole 
tender process continued regardless of the implications 
10 
that Mr Matthews had raised. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Hm.  And what did this indicate to you? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  This indicated to me a total lack of 
accountability or sense of probity in relation to corporate 
governance. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Hm.  And in fact we know that – or we can 
see – let me take you to page 501 of that same bundle.   
MR CRAYTHORNE:  I have it before me. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  And what is that document in front of 
you?  It is a letter. 
20 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  It is a letter addressed to Minister 
Brown on the 25 February 2015 and it is authored by Mr 
Craig Matthews. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes and what does he say is the purpose of 
the letter in paragraph 2? 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 18 of 195 
 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  He states the following: 
“The purpose of my letter is to bring to your 
attention recent developments within the 
RMC and to raise my concerns regarding 
Alexkor ’s attitude to these developments.” 
ADV SIBIYA:  Hm.  And in paragraph… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Sibiya will you make sure that page 
502 is replaced with a page that is along the same lines as 
page 50 – no, no 501?  On my bundle 501 is fine but 502 is 
the opposite of 501 in terms of how it is placed here. 
10 
ADV SIBIYA:  Oh.  Oh I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is – I do not know what happened to 
the person who was putting them in.  So if you could have 
that corrected. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Thank you Chair we will attend to it.  Now on 
page 501 in paragraph 5 Mr Matthews indicates: 
“That as regards Alexkor ’s response to my 
attorney’s letter you will note…” 
Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see paragraph 5 on mine is at page 
20 
502 not 501.  Is yours on 501? 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes Chair then we definitely need to correct 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We should all have exactly the same 
thing. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 19 of 195 
 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you say paragraph 5 at page so 
and so I should find paragraph 5 on the same page. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So my paragraph 5 starts with  
“In view of the aforesaid” 
Is that your paragraph 5 as well? 
ADV SIBIYA:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does your paragraph 5 start with 
“In view of the aforesaid” 
10 
ADV SIBIYA:  No Chair I think we might even be reading 
two different documents as things stand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you see and that is – that makes it 
even worse then. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The – the letter that you referred the 
witness to you said appears at page 501, is that correct? 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you – when you say para – 501 – 
okay maybe – maybe I – we – we are – or maybe I am the 
20 
cause for the mistake here.  You are using black numbers? 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay no, no that is fine.  I think where 
we have bundle that has got both red and black numbers 
you must always at the start of the proceedings just 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 20 of 195 
 
confirm that it is the black numbers we are using.  Okay so 
you are at black 501? 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And your paragraph 5 starts with: 
“You – as you will no doubt agree.” 
Is that right? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Then I am reading the wrong paragraph. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the wrong paragraph. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Because I meant to read paragraph 6 but I 
10 
agree with that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it a letter addressed to the Minister of 
Public Enterprises? 
ADV SIBIYA:  It is the same document Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Dated 25 February 2015? 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say your paragraph 5 does not 
start with: 
“As you will no doubt agree.” 
ADV SIBIYA:  No, no, no Chair I am confirming that that is 
20 
how paragraph 5 starts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  No that is alright. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  But I am… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then the – the comments I made about 
501. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 21 of 195 
 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And 502 earlier on the two pages they 
relate to red 501 and red 502 but 502 still requires to be 
replaced with a page that is in line with paragraph – with 
page 501. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Unfortunately we will have the same problem 
on another page in the future but I have noted that page as 
well. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  Thank you Chair.  Chair what I was in 
fact saying was that I am – I have referred to the witness 
to the wrong paragraph number.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Because I want him to read paragraph 6. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Paragraph 6? 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes on page 501. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay paragraph 6 at black 501. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   
“As 
regards 
Alexkor ’s 
response 
to 
my 
attorney’s letter you will note that despite 
our 
concerns 
that 
the 
PSJV 
would 
be 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 22 of 195 
 
concluding 
transactions 
which 
may 
potentially be invalidated Alexkor sought to 
disregard this issue as merely an internal 
issue within the entities controlled by the 
Communal Property Associations.” 
ADV SIBIYA:   H’m.  And the next page, the next paragraph. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Going onto paragraph 7: 
“The obvious difficulty with Alexkor’s attitude is that 
it has left the PSJV exposed to potential damages 
claims as the contract entered into may potentially 
10 
be invalidated due to the PSJV Board and regard to 
and acting on the instructions of persons not 
authorised to bind the RMC.” 
ADV SIBIYA:   H’m.  And from what you know, did anything 
happen – did – was there a response to this letter?  It is not 
addressed to you or by you but I am asking from the 
investigations you made, was there a response to this letter? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   As far as I am aware there was no 
response from the minister to this particular letter. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  Now on page 30.  Sorry, 503, GC-30, 
20 
black 503.   
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Okay.  So it is black, page 530? 
ADV SIBIYA:   No, I can see you are on the wrong page. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Sorry.  I beg your pardon. 
ADV SIBIYA:   503. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 23 of 195 
 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   503.  Dyslexic.  I am sorry.  Okay.  I am 
at 503 now.   
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  This is another letter from Adams & 
Adams, addressed to Mr Bagus.  Correct? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And it is dated the 27t h of February 2015. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And among the requests that are made in that 
letter, is the request on paragraph 5.5 which appears on the 
next page which is 504 which is the page that we were, 
10 
correct? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Okay.  So that is 504 on the black 
numbers? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And one of the requests that are made by 
Adams and Adams is in 5.5, and what does it say? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   It reads as follows: 
“Hold over all further decisions of the PSJV until a 
properly constituted board of the PSJV, that includes 
20 
our client, has had an opportunity to reconsider 
these decisions.” 
ADV SIBIYA:   H’m.  And if I may refer you to page 259 of 
the same bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On what page? 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 24 of 195 
 
ADV SIBIYA:   259 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:   This is the middle of the document that starts 
on page 253.  Can you go to page 253 so that we identify 
what the document is? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I am at page 253. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  What is this document? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   This is a covering letter, addressed to 
Honourable Minister, Ms Lynne Brown.  Reporting back on an 
investigation carried out by the Alexkor Audit and Risk 
10 
Committee in relation to the appointment of Scarlet Sky. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  And the date of the document? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   29 February 2016. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Now if we go to page 259. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   259? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  Towards – on the left-hand side of the 
table that appears there, you will see at the top it says left.  
In the left column it says date.  And in the middle column it 
says description.  And then the second to last column it says 
annexure.  And in the last column it says reference to 
20 
collaborative evidence.  Correct? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   So this is a report to the Minister, Ms Lynne 
Brown. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 25 of 195 
 
ADV SIBIYA:   Now at the bottom of that page, the very last 
entry.  What is the date on that entry? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is the 1s t of March 2015. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  And in the description, what does it say 
happened on the 1s t of March 2015? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Yes. 
“SSI was informed that they were the successful 
bidder and that the tender was awarded to them and 
all 
other 
companies 
were 
informed 
that 
their 
proposals were unsuccessful.” 
10 
ADV SIBIYA:   So this is two days after the letter from 
Adams & Adams saying:  Please hold over all further 
decisions. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   So they completely disregard it, that warning? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   In addition to disregarding the judgment 
itself? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   What did this communicate to you, these 
20 
actions in spite of the judgment and in spite of the warnings? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Well, I then repeat it.  It indicated to 
me that there was an absolutely total disregard for due 
process, for honesty, for good governance and that was 
typical of what I understood to be a state capture at play. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 26 of 195 
 
ADV SIBIYA:   H’m.  Now if we can go back on your affidavit 
to page 44. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just before that. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Miss...  Mr Craythorne, the members of 
the Alexkor Audit and Risk Committee who produced this 
report.  To your knowledge, how many of them could be 
described as Gupta associates? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   At least one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Who is that? 
10 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   And that was Mr Therry Haasbroek. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, continue. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you.  If we can go to page 44 of the 
same bundle.  Your affidavit. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I am on that page, 44.  
ADV SIBIYA:   Now I am taking you to the heading that you 
have titled State Capture. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I have that in front of me. 
20 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay.  Now in this section, you tell us the 
background to the reports that we have just had a look at, 
and you indicate that there had been a complaint to the 
Public Protector and that this report was as a result of her 
reaction to the complaint to the Public Protector. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 27 of 195 
 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   What was the complaint to the Public 
Protector and who had made it? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   It was a complaint authored by 
attorney, Duncan Korabie on behalf of the Richtersveldt 
community, objecting to the absence of a due diligence. 
ADV SIBIYA:   H’m. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Prior to giving the contract to Scarlet 
Sky.  And then also in relation to the lack of transparency 
and the lack of performance on the part of Scarlet Sky. 
10 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  And if I can take you to Bundle 4B. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Sibiya, just before you do that.  Do 
you recall whether in the report of the Audit and Risk 
Committee, to which you referred a few minutes ago 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes, Chair?  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...whether in their report, that committee 
said there had been a due diligence that was conducted? 
ADV SIBIYA:   They say that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They say that? 
20 
ADV SIBIYA:   We are still going to go there but yes they say 
that.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Okay alright. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 28 of 195 
 
ADV SIBIYA:   Now in Bundle 4B, if we can open page 815.  
Eight, one, five.   
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I have it in front of me. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the page number again? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Eight, one, five. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Is this the complaint that you were referring 
to Mr Craythorne? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct. 
10 
ADV SIBIYA:   So it is the complaint to the Public Protector 
for the attention of Ms Winnie M @pprotects.org. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And what does it say the complaint is in the 
heading? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   It reads: 
“Complaint – Irregular awarding of contract to 
Scarlet Sky Investments 60 (Pty) Ltd and Flawless 
Diamonds.” 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  And if you turn a few pages to page 818 
20 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I have it in front of me. 
ADV SIBIYA:   You can see the who is the author of the 
complaint. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Duncan Korabie. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, and he calls himself an independent 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 29 of 195 
 
director, correct? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Of the Richtersveldt Mining company. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay.  Now if we turn the page to page 819 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I ...[intervenes]  
ADV SIBIYA:   And we look in the middle of the page where 
it says:  Begin forwarded message.  Can you see that? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SIBIYA:   In the middle of the page. 
10 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Is it 819?  Okay, I have it, ja. 
ADV SIBIYA:   You see it? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I do. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And there is where we can see that this 
document was sent via email because this is where it says 
from and it has the email address of Duncan Korabie and to 
Winnie and it has that email address.  And it tells us the date 
and time.  What is the date and time of this complaint? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   It is 11 September 2015 at 13:35. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  And if you look at the top of the page.  
20 
You can see that this message is forwarded to other people. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Can you see that? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   It is sent from Duncan Korabie at 13:44 p.m. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 30 of 195 
 
on the same date.  Correct? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And who is it now sent to? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   It is CC’d – well, it is sent to Percy 
Khoza. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   percyk@alexkor.co.za. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And you have said it was the CEO at the 
time? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct. 
10 
ADV SIBIYA:   And who else was copied? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   It was copied to Kgathatso Thakudi 
@dpe.gov. 
ADV SIBIYA:   H’m. 
MR 
CRAYTHORNE: 
 
 
Mervin 
Carstens, 
mervinc@alexkor.co.za. 
ADV SIBIYA:   H’m.  You do not have to read the email 
addresses.  Just the names of the people. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Zarina Kellerman, Dr Rodger Paul, The 
Richtersveldt Communal Property Associations, Mr Willem 
20 
Vries, Mr Dennis Farmer, Mr Pieter de Wet, Mr Joshua de 
Wet and Ms Catherine Slanga(?). 
ADV SIBIYA:   So many people were given this email.  And 
what does it say to Mr Khoza? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Yes. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 31 of 195 
 
“Dear Mr Khoza, please find attached the RMC 
complaint to the Public Protector related to the 
appointed to the Scarlet Sky Investment 60 (Pty) 
Ltd.   
I apologise for not forwarding the document to you 
yesterday but I only returned from a business trip 
yesterday evening and could only attend to finalising 
the complaint today.   
It is unfortunate that we have to refer the matter to 
the Public Protector but we do not have the 
10 
cooperation of the Executive Committee on this 
matter and we are slain in our access to the 
information. 
We trust the above is in order.” 
ADV SIBIYA:   H’m.  And if you look at the next page, page 
820, you can see there is another email dated 2018, July.  
Can you see that? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Yes. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Who is it from? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   There is a – it is from Duncan E 
20 
Korabie. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, and who is it addressed to?  Which 
entity is it addressed to? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   To Charmaine Essau at DPE. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  And what does he say was the outcome 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 32 of 195 
 
of the complaint? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   It reads: 
“Dear Charmaine, please find attached the original 
referral 
of 
the 
complaint. 
 
There 
was 
some 
additional information sent.  Let me know if you 
want that. 
The 
complaint 
was 
registered 
with 
the 
Public 
Protector under our reference:  REF: 7/2-011497/15, 
Mr D Korabie. 
In November 2015 we agreed, following a meeting 
10 
between 
the 
CPO 
and 
the 
Minister 
of 
Public 
Enterprises, not to proceed with the complaint to 
allow her to investigate the matter internally.   
We agreed that the ARC Committee on the PSJV will 
investigate the matter. 
Later I discovered that Sarina Kellerman tried to 
investigate the matter herself. 
To the best of my knowledge, the matter was never 
investigated. 
There was a separate complaint against Kellerman.  
20 
Let me know if you would like that as well. 
Regards, Duncan Korabie.” 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  Thank you.  You can put that bundle 
aside for now, as we go back to Bundle 4A. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   [No audible reply]  
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 33 of 195 
 
ADV SIBIYA:   If I can refer you in Bundle 4A to page 260? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I have it in front of me. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  You confirm that this is still the report 
made by Alexkor to Minister Lynne Brown? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I confirm so, ja. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  Now on page 260, we can see a heading 
marked 4.2.2.  The response to the complaint by the 
committee. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Now they start responding to the issues 
10 
raised ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  I thought you said to page 
206.  That is not right, hey? 
ADV SIBIYA:   No, it is two, six, zero. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Two, five, zero? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Two, six, zero. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Two, six, zero. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay continue. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you.  So the gist of the complaint 
starts in paragraph – in what they say para 2.  Do you see 
that reference in the box that – in the table that is below the 
heading, Responds to the Complaint? 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 34 of 195 
 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  And it says: 
“On the 17t h of December, the previous chairperson 
contacted Korabie and required him to approve the 
conditional appointment.   
Certain 
queries 
were 
raised 
surrounding 
the 
appointment and he persisted that a conditional 
appointment be done. 
An inter alia condition of the appointment of SSI was 
that the CEO should conduct a due diligence on SSI 
10 
and report back to the committee on such due 
diligence.” 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Do you see that? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I do. 
ADV SIBIYA:   So that is the complaint. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  The response by the committee is that 
Mr Korabie who we know is the author of the complaint, 
right? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just to make sure that we have captured 
this in the transcript.  You are now dealing with the Audit and 
Risk Committee report that starts at page 253. Is that right? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 35 of 195 
 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So there response is – to the complaints 
is a response by that committee. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that right? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:   So it is in a way their findings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Having investigated the issues raised 
10 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SIBIYA:   ...by – well, to the Public Protector. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  So in terms of their investigation.  
Mr Korabie did not raise any concerns regarding SSI.  The 
only committee member who had further comment in his 
email was Dr Paul.  Can you see that? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I do. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  And it says it was confirmed by the 
20 
chairperson that the reason for.. 
“The reason the approval was conditional was to 
ensure that all concerns of the committee were 
addressed even though SSI had attained the highest 
scoring.” 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 36 of 195 
 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct.   
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  And then in paragraph 3 or where they 
say para 3. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Yes? 
ADV SIBIYA:   They record the complaint as: 
“It would appear that there could not have been 
much a due diligence. 
SSI was previously owned by a Legal Frontiers 
Corporate Services which is a company that trade in 
shelf companies.” 
10 
 
It would appear, now on page 261: 
“It would appear that from 2009 to 2014, SSI was a 
shelf company owned by LF.  LF sold SSI and its 
new 
directors 
were 
registered 
on 
20 November 2014.   
We do not know who the shareholders are. “ 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   What is the response by the committee? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   It reads as follows: 
“The CEO of the PSJV did a proper due diligence on 
20 
all the technical aspect and submitted the report to 
members of the Tender Committee in an email dated 
29 January 2015.” 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  Does this tell us the nature of the due 
diligence that was conducted? 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 37 of 195 
 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   It tends to be a purely technical due 
diligence. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Now based on the evidence you have already 
given.  Could a due diligence on the technical aspects 
resulted in the continued appointment of SSI? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   No, it could not have. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Why do you say that? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Well, because the absence of a license 
on its own was enough to trigger an expulsion from the SSI 
from the process. 
10 
ADV SIBIYA:   H’m.  And we have already dealt with, in your 
evidence on Friday, with the question in relation to the 
experience. 
MR 
CRAYTHORNE: 
 
 
And 
numerous 
other 
– 
those 
specifications which were minimum requirements in the 
tender specification which were – which SSI failed to meet. 
ADV SIBIYA:   H’m.  So we do not know what their – why 
they would say – why the committee would give this 
response? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   No. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But is your evidence that there was no 
due diligence that was done? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I have not seen any evidence 
whatsoever ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 38 of 195 
 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   ...of any due diligence report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  And the committee itself did not 
attach such due diligence report to its report, did it? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   No, the only thing that I think is being 
preferred as a due diligence report was a mere email from 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that cannot be what one is talking 
about when one is talking about a due diligence that must be 
conducted before you make this kind of appointment.   
MR CRAYTHORNE:   And even the email offers no 
10 
assurance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Which is what the purpose of a due 
diligence is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  And I guess the first thing that would 
have been discovered would be that this company had no 
license. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The question that arises is, whether there 
is room for saying that the Audit and Risk Committee in 
20 
preparing this report acted in good faith or whether they 
included in the report false information knowing it to be 
false.  Are you able to say anything about that? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Chairperson, these are people with 
PhD’s.   
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 39 of 195 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   And I fail to see how anybody with a 
PhD can mistakenly – can mistake what might possible had 
been preferred as a due diligence – as a due diligence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I cannot see it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  And their report does not say 
anything about SSI not having a license, or does it? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I would have to refresh my memory 
Chairperson but there is no report. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   There is merely an email from 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The committee’s own report to the 
minister.   
MR CRAYTHORNE:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am saying.  Does their own report to the 
minister, the Audit and Risk Committee’s report say anything 
about SSI not having a license? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   No. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Not to my recollection Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And it is just difficult how they could 
have investigated without establishing that simple basic fact.  
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I agree. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 40 of 195 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   They either must have turned a blind eye 
or they were simple not prepared to include that in their 
report. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I agree Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it is difficult to understand how they 
could do that in good faith.  Maybe they will explain.  Yes, 
Ms Sibiya. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you.  Thank you, Chair.  If we continue 
on page 261 and I am taking you to the bottom of the page.  
The last log and on the left it says para 6. 
10 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I have it in front of me. 
ADV SIBIYA:   The complaint is: 
“Prior to the sitting of the Tender Committee, no 
documents were made available related to the 
candidates who would be considered to Korabie...” 
 
Sorry, let me read that again so that it makes sense. 
“Prior to the sitting of the Tender Committee, no 
documents were made available related to the 
candidates who would be considered, such report be 
made to Korabie...” 
20 
 
So Korabie did not get any documents  And it says: 
“Prior to the interview of the shortlisted candidates, 
the Tender Committee did no short listing and the 
Tender 
Committee 
had 
no 
insight 
into 
the 
methodology and process used in the short listing 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 41 of 195 
 
process. 
In an email response, Raygen Phillips mentioned 
that the CEO will speak with Korabie prior to the 
meeting. 
No such discussions took place. 
Individuals in the PSJV did the short listing.  
Amongst others, we discovered the CEO and the 
secretary were part of that. 
The CEO also sat also in the short listing interview 
process on the 11t h of December 2014.” 
10 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   The response by the committee says: 
“Gamiro Advisory Services was appointed to conduct 
the exercise of short listing. 
The committee acknowledge that the presentation by 
Gamiro 
Advisory 
Services 
should 
have 
been 
accompanied by a report that informs the committee 
of the methodology followed and the process used to 
shortlist the company. 
This matter will be highlighted to the management of 
20 
the 
PSJV 
to 
enhance 
controls 
around 
reports 
received from external parties.” 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   This response by the committee, does it tell 
you with the evidence that we have heard already or from 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 42 of 195 
 
what you have investigated, that Gamiro Advisory Services 
were appointed to shortlist and that there were shortcomings 
in the presentation made by Gamiro Advisory Services? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I agree with that. 
ADV SIBIYA:   H’m.  Now do you know whether the 
presentation by Gamiro Advisory Services identified any 
shortcomings? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   It certainly did in relation to the 
license. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  And also the scoring. 
10 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   And – well, the scoring on the license 
portion of the evaluation where Gamiro scored zero.  The bid 
evaluation committee themselves altered that from zero to 
5. 
ADV SABINA:   Sorry, which committee? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   The tender committee which finally – 
ultimately awarded the tender to Scarlet Sky altered the 
scoring which Gambro had placed on SSI in terms of the 
licence from zero to five. 
ADV SABINA:   And interestingly enough we have already 
20 
heard evidence that SSI was scored a 100% but the person 
that scored them is the same person that made this report 
to the Public Protector. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct.  It is rather curious 
but it is correct and while the other scores given by Mr 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 43 of 195 
 
Bogus and Dr Paul were way lower than Mr Korari’s 
scoring.  They were in any event the highest score 
amongst the three.  So all three of these gentlemen scored 
Scarlet Sky the highest.  So it was a unanimous – it was 
unanimous decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do we have Mr Korabie’s affidavit 
explaining his conduct that seems inconsistent in this 
regard? 
ADV SIBIYA:   We do not, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why not? 
10 
ADV SIBIYA:   Chair, that is part of the process that the 
investigating team is still undertaking.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, but that should have long been 
done. 
ADV SIBIYA:   I confirm that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He is such a  - he is obviously such an 
important witness.  I mean, he makes allegations about 
how he was contacted by the Chairperson who told him or 
instructed him that they should approve or award the 
contract to SSI and then he seems to lay a complaint with 
20 
the 
Public 
Protector 
about 
exactly 
that 
and 
as 
Mr 
Craythorne says, he awarded SSI a lot of points.  So that 
is somebody that should long have been interviewed and 
an affidavit obtained.  Do you know how far from having his 
affidavit?  I mean, how far we are in getting his affidavit? 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 44 of 195 
 
ADV SIBIYA:   Chair, the next steps are being planned as 
we speak, as we prepare the – as we present the evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I know that you …[intervenes] 
ADV SIBIYA:   In securing his affidavit his affidavit 
because there were engagements but no response.  So we 
are looking at the next steps, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I know that you only got involved in this 
work stream recently but I have been told for a long time 
that everything was ready with regard to the leading of 
evidence of Alexkor and I thought that all important 
10 
affidavits are in and 
Mr Korabie’s affidavit is quite 
important. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Chair, I …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja, you cannot say much. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:   But it was identified since my involvement 
as one of those that need to be obtained, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  And do you know what the 
position is with regard Mr Bagus, has he been interviewed?  
20 
Is there an affidavit that has been obtained from him and 
Mr Carstens? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Sorry, Chair, I missed the first person? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Bagus. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And things stand, Chair, there is interaction 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 45 of 195 
 
with the legal representatives both of Mr Carstens and Mr 
Bagus.  There has been a lot of communication.  There had 
initially been technical issues raised in relation to the 
admissibility of this evidence that was raised in relation to 
Mr Bagus by his legal representation.  So we are in 
engagements with them but they have not submitted any 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if he is not cooperating he should be 
served with a 10.6 directive requiring him to furnish an 
affidavit and he would then be obliged to comply.  We must 
10 
not be wasting time, we do not have time. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   His lawyers may be taking whatever 
point, we will see what point they take, but if we need 
information from him we cannot be engaged in an endless 
toing and froing process.  If the legal team believes that he 
has information that is required by the Commission, he 
must be served with a 10.6 directive and he be given a 
deadline.  We do not have time to waste. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Chair, I will make sure that that is attended 
20 
to this week. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  And Mr Carstens?  Has he been 
interviewed?  Do you we have an affidavit from him? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Mr Carstens submitted an affidavit last 
week.  It does not deal with the substance as such, it 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 46 of 195 
 
explains his delay in responding and other matters.  He 
has not been well, he is in isolation, as things stand.  Ms 
Phillips, 
Raygen 
Phillips 
is 
presenting 
her 
response 
together 
with 
Mr 
Carstens 
and 
they 
are 
legally 
represented. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  What should have happened is that 
by time we lead the evidence all the important affidavits 
should have been obtained. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Including the affidavits of those people 
10 
who may be seen as implicated persons. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We should have their version, we should 
have their side of the story.  That should have been done 
and when I was told that the Alexkor evidence was ready I 
thought that it would have included – that meant that the 
affidavits of all important witnesses were in.  Okay, let us 
continue.  But before we do that, Mr Craythorne I want to 
take you back to page 260, that is still in the report of the 
audit and risk committee. 
20 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I have it before me, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and I am taking you to a portion that 
Ms Sibiya did take you to but I want to canvass slightly 
different point.  Can you see where it says paragraph 2? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Yes. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 47 of 195 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, then it says – and that is a recording 
of the allegation or complaint.   
“On 
the 
17 
December 
2014 
the 
previous 
Chairperson 
contacted 
Korabie 
and 
required 
Korabie to approve the conditional appointment of 
Scarlet Sky Investments 60 (Pty) Ltd.  I raised 
certain 
queries 
with 
him 
surrounding 
the 
appointment and he persisted that a conditional 
appointment be done.  Inter alia condition of the 
appointment of SSI was that the CEO should 
10 
conduct a due diligence  on SSI and report back to 
the committee on such due diligence .” 
You have read the response of the committee which comes 
immediately after that, have you not? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I have read the response, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Does it deal with the factual 
allegation of – the factual allegation that Mr Korabie was 
contacted by the Chairperson who required Korabie to 
approve the conditional of Scarlet Sky Investments?   
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Well, what it appears to be is that it 
20 
appears to simply say that Mr Korabie requested a due 
diligence but it does not answer the question of whether a 
due diligence was done or not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   And Mr Korabie in protest resigned 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 48 of 195 
 
from the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no but that is a separate issue.  All 
I was asking was whether this committee, faced with an 
allegation that the previous Chairperson had contacted 
Korabie and required Korabie to approve the conditional 
appointment of SSI whether in its response this committee 
responded to that? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   No, I do not see. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Do you know of any reason why 
they would not have, in their investigation, contacted the 
10 
previous Chairperson and found out whether this allegation 
about him made by Korabie was correct? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Well, it seems to me, Chairperson, 
that there was no rigor at all in …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, investigating. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   In investigating and doing this report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Ms Sibiya, continue. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you.  On page 262 we see where it 
says para 7. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Yes. 
20 
ADV SIBIYA:   The complaint is: 
“The 
PSJV 
subscribes 
to 
the 
Public 
Finance 
Management Act 1 of 1999, at least according to the 
CLO.” 
Chief legal officer. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 49 of 195 
 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And the response by the committee is: 
“The JV is not legally obliged to subscribe to the 
PFMA.  However, it does subscribe and adhere to 
the PFMA through its association with a state-
owned company.” 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  And then on the next point is: 
“On 
the 
11 
December 
2015, 
the 
CLO 
and 
Chairperson at the time took Korabie and Dr Roger 
10 
Paul, an Alexkor representative into his office and 
discussed what he viewed as the new direction the 
PSJV must take in appointing the service provider.  
He mentioned that he met only one candidate that 
will be interviewed, met the new direction he 
proposes.  He then mentioned SSI.” 
Do you see that complaint? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I do see that. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And what is the response by the committee? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:    
20 
“The date 11 December 2015 cannot be correct as 
the tender was awarded on 27 February 2015.” 
ADV SIBIYA:   Now pause there.  That is correct, hey?  It 
should be 2014? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 50 of 195 
 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes and then what do they continue to say? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:    
“We have received the representation of Mr Bagus 
that he has no recollection of the meeting taking 
place.” 
ADV SIBIYA:  Similarly to the question that was posed by 
the Chair previously, does this deal with the substance of 
what was said to have been said at the meeting? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   It sheds no light on the matter at all. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   What does CLO represent again? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Chief Legal Officer, that is Ms Zarina 
Kellerman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, therefore, the CLO and Chairperson 
would now be two different people? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And in their response they talk about 
what Mr Bagus said but they do not say anything about 
what the CLO said, is it not? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Indeed. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   The CLO would have been a different 
person.  Is that right, Mr Craythorne? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:     That is correct, Mr Korabie is 
alleging that he has briefed by, amongst others, Mr Bagus 
and Mr Bagus stated he has no recollection of a meeting 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 51 of 195 
 
with Mr Korabie having taken place. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And also, from this it looks like after 
they had talked to Mr Bagus, they did not go back to Mr 
Korabie and say – he says he cannot recall.  What can you 
say to jog his memory? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   And the matter is left there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is just left there, ja.  He does not 
remember but here is somebody who does remember but it 
is just left there.  And then the CLO, they decide not to 
…[intervenes] 
10 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Question it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   …check with the CLO, particularly in 
circumstances where one of the parties says I cannot 
remember.  That was all the more reason why they should 
talk to the CLO and say do you remember? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But they just – they did not bother to 
interview the CLO. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Or, 
if 
they 
did 
interview 
him 
20 
…[intervenes] 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   There is no record of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They chose not record what he said.  
Oh, Ms Sibiya. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, thank you, Chair.  If you go to the 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 52 of 195 
 
bottom on the same page where it says para 10. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I have it. 
ADV SIBIYA:   It says: 
“During March 2015 the appointment of SSI reaches 
a boiling point with the sole shareholder of the RMC 
challenging the regularity of the appointment.” 
What is the response by the committee? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   No response. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Now is this an …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, I missed that.  Which one was 
10 
that, Ms Sibiya? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Para 10, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Para 10? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes and the response by the committee is 
no response. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So they chose not to investigate what 
this was about and whether this was factually true.  Ja.  
Okay.  I think we should take the tea adjournment. 
20 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We will resume at half past eleven.  We 
adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 53 of 195 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you Chair.  Mr Craythorne we are still 
on page 262 where we have just dealt with the fact that 
there was no response, okay. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I am there. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Now if you turn the page to page 263, and 
you go to the very last entry that says para 15. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I see it. 
ADV SIBIYA:   It says: 
“We have discovered – this is now the complaint – 
10 
we have discovered that at two days before the 
tender closed the directors in SSI were registered 
with the company’s office in Pretoria” 
So in other words they were only registered two days 
before the tender closed.  Do you see that? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I do.  
ADV SIBIYA:   So that is the complaint.  Do you see the 
response on the next page 264? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I do.  
ADV SIBIYA:   What is the response? 
20 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   It is blank.  
ADV SIBIYA:   So no response to this allegation or to this 
complaint was given to the Minister.  
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct.  
ADV SIBIYA:   And then the next issue is on, it says para 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 54 of 195 
 
16 the very next block.  You will note from the attached 
correspondence by Phillips: 
“That was chosen because they were or they had a 
good track record in the diamond industry that they 
were the only entity willing to sign a beneficiation 
agreement.  To the best of our knowledge none of 
the contractors were offered this proposal by the 
tender committee.  SSI has no track record in the 
diamond industry prior to its appointment and since 
the appointment of SS1 no beneficiation for the 
10 
community has taken place.”    
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct.  
ADV SIBIYA:   What is the response by the committee?  
MR CRAYTHORNE:   “During the adjudication of this three 
shortlisted 
companies 
each 
tender 
committee 
member was afforded an opportunity to score on the 
beneficiation commitments.  The outcome of the 
scores out of ten for SSI was Doctor Paul SSI five 
out of ten, Mr Korabie SSI ten out of ten, Mr Bagus 
SSI five out of ten.”   
20 
That is the response. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Does the response deal with the issue 
raised in the problem statement?  
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Not at all.  
ADV SIBIYA:   Does it deal with the track record of SSI? 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 55 of 195 
 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   No.  
ADV SIBIYA:   And does it deal with the beneficiation other 
than telling us that the parties were given an opportunity to 
score?   Does it deal with the factual statement that since 
the appointment of SSI no beneficiation for the community 
has taken place?   
MR CRAYTHORNE:   No, not at all.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well this risk and audit committee seems 
to really not have been interested in properly investigating 
the allegations.  Here is a very serious allegation made 
10 
here that SSI had no track record in the diamond industry 
prior to its appointment.   
They are supposed to have investigated that and in  
response to that complaint they are supposed to say we 
have investigated this we have found it to be true or we 
have found it not to be true.  They say nothing about 
it…[intervene]     
MR CRAYTHORNE:   They just ignore it.  
CHAIRPERSON:   …and it is such a critical issue and on 
beneficiation the allegation is since the appointment of SSI 
20 
no beneficiation for the committee has taken place.  
Instead of dealing with that allegation is that allegation 
true they tell us what happened at the adjudication and 
that is so unsatisfactory it is not the complaint, ja okay Ms 
Sibiya.    
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 56 of 195 
 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you.  The next issue is in para 17 
and this is the complaint: 
“It is clear to us that SSI was created specifically 
for 
this 
tender. 
 
We 
do 
not 
know 
who 
the 
shareholders are of SSI and their relationship if any 
with any of the tender committee Board members or 
the PSJV Board members.  We do not know if SSI 
complies with the PFMA.  We do not know if SSI 
complies with the BBEEE legislation.  We do not 
know if the other requirement that led to their 
10 
conditional appointment have been met.” 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct.  
ADV SIBIYA:   And what is the response by the committee? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   “The appointment of SSI was done 
via  
Round Robin Resolution that was signed by all the 
Board members.  Mr Korabie was not included as a 
signatory to the Round Robin Resolution as he no 
longer was a member of the PSJV joint Board.  The 
PSJV Board from 27 January 2015 to 15 July 2015 
20 
consisted of five directors.  All the directors of the 
PSJV Board signed the resolution.”     
ADV SIBIYA:   Again do they respond to the very first 
allegation that it is clear to us that SSI was created 
specifically for this tender? 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 57 of 195 
 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   No.  
ADV SIBIYA:   Do they deal with who the shareholders are 
or their relationships? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   No.  
ADV SIBIYA:   Do they deal with the compliance by SSI?  
MR CRAYTHORNE:   No.  
ADV SIBIYA:   Do they deal with any of the other 
requirements that led to their conditional appointment 
having been met or not? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   No.  
10 
ADV SIBIYA:   So again the response is just filling up the 
space because it does not deal at all with the issues that 
are raised in the problem?  
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct.  
ADV SIBIYA:   Now I will take you to the last one on that 
page it says para 19.   
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I have it.  
ADV SIBIYA:    
“At the Board meeting approving the appointment of 
SSI our representative Willem Vries was misled by 
20 
the rest of the Board members and the CLO that 
Korabie had already approved the appointment of 
SSI and that it was a mere formality.  They did not 
disclose to him that Bristow was involved, the Board 
at the time was irregularly constituted as it required 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 58 of 195 
 
two independent directors from the RMC and a 
community director to constitute a quorum for the 
meeting.  This was the requirement set by Alexkor 
and RMC.” 
What is the response? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   “We have received the affidavit from  
Mr W Vries which we have enclosed for ease of 
reference under file reference 26 which indicated 
that he was not misled to signing the resolution that 
approved the appointment of SSI.”   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is there any indication that they referred 
that affidavit to Mr Korabie to say what do you say about 
Mr Vries affidavit that says he was not misled?  Is there 
any indication that they did that on their reports? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Not that I am aware of.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So on the face of their report it looks 
like they got an affidavit from Mr Vries saying I was not 
misled and that was enough for them?   
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is not investigating.   
20 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   It seems to me that there was an 
original position which Mr Vries had which then changed 
and was confirmed by way of an affidavit.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Ms Sibiya.  
ADV SIBIYA:   And the last point that I want to refer you to 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 59 of 195 
 
in relation to this report is where it says para 21.  Can you 
see that on page 265?   
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I do.  
ADV SIBIYA:   And the issue that is raised is: 
“It is still not clear what the outcome of the due 
diligence was.” 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct.  
ADV SIBIYA:   And the response by the committee? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:    
“The outcome of the due diligence was forwarded to 
10 
the 
Board 
on 
29 
January 
2015. 
 
The 
RMC 
representatives were represented throughout the 
tender process and was well aware of the outcome 
of the due diligence.”    
ADV SIBIYA:   Does this tell us what was the outcome of 
the due diligence? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   No.  
ADV SIBIYA:   So all it says is you should know it in effect, 
in a nutshell it says the RMC representatives were 
represented throughout and the outcome was forwarded to 
20 
the Board.   
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct and that is a false 
statement because we already know from the errors of 
Craig Matthews or the correspondence of Craig Matthews 
in the Samela judgement that that is a false statement.    
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 60 of 195 
 
ADV SIBIYA:   And then we get to the conclusion.  What is 
the conclusion that is drawn just that paragraph under the 
heading conclusion.   
MR CRAYTHORNE:    
“Based 
on 
the 
affidavit 
and 
in 
collaborative 
evidence reviewed by the committee we could not 
find 
any 
fundamental 
breach 
of 
procurement 
procedures adopted by PSJV other than - I think it 
is a typing error mere it says - manner or manner of 
housekeeping that we have alerted the management 
10 
of the PSJV to correct.”      
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, so they did not find any wrongdoing? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct.  
ADV SIBIYA:   There conclusion is, is that everything was 
above board? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct.  
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you.  Now I take you to a new topic. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well that report who is it signed by Mr 
Craythorne? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I do not have a signed version.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well not signed but who is reflected as 
the author of the reports?  
MR CRAYTHORNE:   It is Ms N Lehobayi Chairperson of 
the Audit and Risk Committee.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and according to what she has 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 61 of 195 
 
written there she is a chartered accountant.   
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We need to have if you do not already 
have we need to have an affidavit from her explaining this 
report and all attempts must be made for her to be called 
to give evidence and be questioned about this report.     
ADV SIBIYA:   Noted Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us continue.  
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you Chair.  Mr Craythorne I am 
taking you to your affidavit on page 54, this is new topic.  
10 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Page 54? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I have it before me.  
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay you see the heading there almost at 
the bottom: 
“The proposed diversification of Alexkor into the 
coal industry.”   
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct, I have it before me.  
ADV SIBIYA:   Now you say in your affidavit that: 
“With the appointment of Gigaba as Minister of 
20 
Public Enterprises in late 2010 a process of twin 
state 
capture 
begins 
while 
at 
the 
same 
time 
expropriating 
Alexkor ’s 
diamond 
assets 
initially 
through SSI and later through Trans Hex a group 
with links to Regiment set about capturing Alexkor 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 62 of 195 
 
itself in pursuit of coal supply contracts to be 
concluded by Gupta proxies at Eskom.”  
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct.  
ADV SIBIYA:   Where did you get all of this?  How did you 
reach this conclusion?  
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I reached this conclusion as a 
consequence of having consumed quite a fair amount of 
evidence over time.  The Apex document in regard to this 
would be what is referred to as the Questco plan which is a 
document that sets out a collaboration amongst a vast 
10 
array of political and business elites in South Africa to use 
Alexkor ’s marine mining as the core component of a total 
monopolisation of the entire West Coast diamond mining 
industry extending even across the border into Namibia. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Mr Craythorne if I can refer you to Bundle 
4B page 1203, one two zero three.  Is this the document 
you are referring to?  
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct.  
ADV SIBIYA:   So the document that is titled Questco 
corporate advisory, West Coast diamond consolidation that 
20 
is the document?   
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct.  
ADV SIBIYA:   Can you briefly tell us who are the parties 
to this document and what it tells us? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   The parties to this document are 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 63 of 195 
 
Trans Hex, a corporate advisory by the name of Questco, 
De Beers and the Department of Public Enterprise, the 
Richtersveldt Mining Company and the PSJV.  
ADV SIBIYA:   And this appears on page 1207, is that 
correct and when I say is that correct I mean is it really 
correct you can correct me if I am not correct? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct this is a portion of the 
document focusing on the stakeholder needs analysis that 
was conducted by the participants in this project.  
ADV SIBIYA:   And how did you get hold of this document? 
10 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   It was given to me by a hitchhiker.   
ADV SIBIYA:   Sorry? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   It was given to me by a hitchhiker.  
ADV SIBIYA:   A hitchhiker, someone you gave a lift to 
gave you this document? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct.  
ADV SIBIYA:   What did he or she say you must do with 
the document? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Well I was driving from Alexander Bay 
to 
Port 
Nolloth 
I 
picked 
up 
a 
gentleman 
from 
the 
20 
Richtersveldt who was hitchhiking and whom I happen to 
know actually and he asked me how I was looking forward 
to the new owners of Alexkor and I said to him well what 
are you talking about and he started telling me about a 
plan that would result in what we are looking at here in this 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 64 of 195 
 
document.  
And I found it quite fantastical and I took it with 
quite a pinch of salt but he persisted and then when we got 
to Port Nolloth he said to me well just park at this address 
and I will go and fetch you a copy of the document.  And 
that is how I came to have possession of this document 
was given to me by a gentleman who I have picked up 
hitchhiking and this is a very important document in 
connecting the dots.  
ADV SIBIYA:   So what was the importance of this 
10 
document to you?  
MR CRAYTHORNE:   The importance of this document to 
me is that first of all the stakeholder analysis excludes one 
of the most important stakeholder groups in the region and 
who depend upon Alexkor ’s success as an SOE which is a 
group of people I represent as a member of the EAC.   
And that is the diamond diving community because  
it is the diamond diving community that have contributed 
more to the operational profits of Alexkor and the PSJV 
than any other segment of the business and included in the 
20 
stakeholder analysis is a collection of elite government and 
business and community representatives that set out to 
capture Alexkor ’s marine mining assets.     
ADV SIBIYA:   In fact you say in paragraph 241 of your 
affidavit in Bundle 4A on page 55.   
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 65 of 195 
 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   241? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Page 55 paragraph 241.  
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Okay, can you repeat the paragraph 
number for me please? 
ADV SIBIYA:   The page is 55.  
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Yes.  
ADV SIBIYA:   The paragraph is 241.  
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I have it before me.  
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, you in fact say there that as it turns 
out, yes continue.  
10 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   “As it turns out while I was trying to  
persuade the Alexkor Board to review the SSI 
contract and to report on the true value of Alexkor ’s 
marine diamond assets unbeknown to me Trans 
Hex, Questco, Khoza and Carstens had devised a 
plan to persuade Alexkor to dispose of its diamond 
assets in the region and to diversify into coal.”   
ADV SIBIYA:   And you say: 
“What this in fact envisaged was the creation of a 
platform in order to take management control of 
20 
Alexkor ’s marine diamond operations construct a 
false narrative about the future mining potential of 
the marine mining rights by telling all stakeholders 
that the diamonds will be mined out within five to 
ten years whilst simultaneously stripping the assets 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 66 of 195 
 
and running the town and mine infrastructure into 
the 
ground 
and 
to 
purchase Alexkor ’s 
marine 
diamond operations when government has lost hope 
in any future success and take over the 51% stake 
in the PSJV.”      
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct.  
ADV SIBIYA:   Now why do you say it would be a false 
narrative to indicate that the diamonds would be mined out 
within five to ten years?  
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Well while it is a well-known 
10 
geological fact that Alexkor possesses the most stunning 
deposits of gem diamonds that have ever existed on the 
planet it was being - the PSJV management team under the 
leadership 
of 
Mr 
Carstens 
were 
telling 
the 
portfolio 
committees both the NCOP and the portfolio committee’s 
that Alexkor in five or – if I can quote his exact words in 
one particular sitting that I attended he stated: 
“That in five to ten years there will be no more 
mining.”     
Which is extremely misleading because the actual mining 
20 
of the orange river delta’s diamond place has only just 
begun.  The last one hundred years has only really mined 
probably less than 10% of the overall deposit.   
The balance of the deposit remains in the ocean 
covered 
by 
sediment 
which 
possess 
geotechnical 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 67 of 195 
 
challenges that have preserved it and which now is set to 
be mined due to the evolution of technological advances 
over the past ten years.   
And confirmation of that is seen clearly in the great 
success that the Namibian government and De Beers are 
having on the northern, just on the northern side of the 
deposit because the single maritime boundary between 
Namibia and South Africa passes right through the middle 
of this deposit.  On the northern side of the border you 
have an extremely successful marine diamond mining 
10 
industry that is spending money hand over fist.   
There latest vessel is currently under construction 
here investments in excess of a billion rand to produce 
vessels while they are producing 1500 million carats a year 
and more we are struggling to produce 55 thousand carats 
a year on our side.  
So it is the same deposit but with two very, very 
different, so it is a tale of two cities or a tale of two 
deposits, same deposit two approaches. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And of course the diamonds do not know 
20 
where the boundary lines are.   
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct and I would argue that 
the South African side of the boundary is the most valuable 
because of the Palio River system.  Those are geological 
issues I will not go into now but that is my personal view is 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 68 of 195 
 
that the diamonds that are in Namibia has actually been 
sampled by the current that flows south north from actually 
South African deposits.   
So the major eye of this whole deposit is lying in 
South African waters and that is why there is a major 
boundary dispute going on at the moment between South 
Africa and Namibia.   
ADV SIBIYA:   And of course if you look at the Questco 
plan and the persons mentioned there or the entities 
mentioned there why would they be interested in buying 
10 
Alexkor if there was nothing left to mine? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   It is just incredibly arrogant or 
audacious in my view because it is just shockingly 
audacious in my view that people could think that they can 
actually pull off something like this.   
ADV SIBIYA:   Now you say that this plans was given 
traction as Gigaba had repurposed the Alexkor Board in 
order to implement its emerging black coal miner exit 
strategy.  
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct.  
20 
ADV SIBIYA:   What is this strategy? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   The strategy was to pivot Alexkor 
away from the mining of diamonds which seemed to be a 
very much sound set industry and the narrative that has 
been peddled to the government as the shareholder 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 69 of 195 
 
representative for the people of South Africa in regard to 
the diamond deposits in the sea have been down played 
very much.   
So the strategy that was embarked upon after 2010 
when Minister Gigaba was appointed the Minister of Public 
Enterprises has got a level of rationality to it but it was 
done without having full cognisance of what Alexkor would 
lose as a result of such a disastrous strategy because in 
effect what he was doing either knowingly or unknowingly 
he would be pivoting a State owned company away from 
10 
the most important diamond rights in the world today 
towards a coal strategy in an area where we moving from 
fossil fuels to renewables and it just seemed like a tragic 
strategic blunder to me.       
ADV SIBIYA:   And if I can take you to page – to Bundle 4B 
and page…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Must I keep Bundle 4B here for the rest 
of the hearing, are you going to be referring to it further? 
ADV SIBIYA:   I will ask the Chair to keep it but the Chair 
must please forgive me if I do not refer him to it after this. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you are not sure.  
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   What page? 
ADV SIBIYA:   It is page 1106 and my apologies for the 
way the page is printed Chair it will be corrected. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 70 of 195 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you, are you there Mr Craythorne? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Not quite.  I do have it before me. 
ADV SIBIYA:  What is that document that starts on that 
page? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  It is a document from the PMG 
Parliamentary Monitoring Group’s archives and the heading 
is Eskom Enquiry and Malusi Gigaba Public Enterprises 13 
March 2018. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  Now if you turn the page to page 1107. 
10 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  I have it. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Do you confirm that this is not the whole 
document but just certain extracts from the document? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:  So this is page 3 of 32 is what is marked at 
the bottom on the right hand side. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  I see that ja. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Okay.  Now can you read the highlighted parts 
at the top of the document? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   
20 
“Minister Gigaba.” 
ADV SIBIYA:  And that means he is the one that is speaking, 
am I correct? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Correct.  Do I read the entire paragraph 
or just the highlighted section? 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 71 of 195 
 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes you can read the entire paragraph. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   
“The discussions with regard to specific coal 
contracts of Eskom I did not involve myself in 
those.  I hold myself in a broader policy 
discussion with Eskom.  This was predicated 
on what we were drafting as the emerging 
miner strategy which we started engaging on 
around 2012 when we were saying by 2018 
we would like the 50% plus 1 of Eskom’s coal 
10 
to be provided by Black Coal Miners.  I 
therefore had that discussion with Eskom and 
we had several meetings with the board of 
Eskom.  The strategy itself was being drafted 
by Eskom and spearheaded by the Eskom 
board including the executive directors.  We 
had two consultative sessions with emerging 
coal 
miners 
at 
which 
we 
had 
specific 
discussions around these issues.” 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes and then you have got Advocate Vanara 
20 
saying: 
“There appears to be an outcry even today 
from black emerging miners and this was in 
March 2018.” 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Correct. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 72 of 195 
 
ADV SIBIYA:  To access the business.  What programs did 
you put in place at the time or see to it that the board 
addresses 
the 
transformation 
issues? 
 
You 
read 
the 
response up to the end of the highlighted section. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   
“Minister Gigaba.  The emerging miners' 
strategy eventually was not implemented.  I 
think one of the things we were trying to do 
at the time was that we implemented a 
business case where Alexkor would diversify 
10 
from diamond mining solely to also become a 
coal mine and supplier to Eskom with Alexkor 
as the basis to spearhead this emerging 
miners strategy and bring on board many 
other 
emerging 
miners. 
 
The 
emerging 
miners’ strategy was the biggest plan we 
were working on and would have resulted by 
now in billions of rands being managed by 
Black Coal Miners.” 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  And on the next page 1108. 
20 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Yup. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Read the ex – the highlighted portion 
indicating who is saying it. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   
“Mr Gigaba speaking:  I was spearheading 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 73 of 195 
 
the establishment of a policy intervention.  
The emerging miners’ strategy which would 
have 
resulted 
in 
the 
ending 
of 
those 
evergreen contracts.” 
ADV SIBIYA:  Hm.  And then if you turn the page to 1109.  
Minister Gigaba again unpacks the details of the emerging 
miners’ strategy and he says: 
“One of the objectives was that by 2018/2019 
50% plus 1 of coal supply contracts to Eskom 
must be provided by black emerging miners 
10 
in South Africa.  We agreed with them on the 
approach to take and they were supportive of 
the policy proposal we were creating.  That is 
when we began the discussions between 
Alexkor and Eskom to diversify Alexkor’s 
asset base to involve not only diamond 
mining but also coal mining so that we use 
Alexkor to leverage the involvement of black 
miners in the coal supply program.” 
Now do you accept this statement? 
20 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  It is not entirely true because it – it 
creates the perception that the intention was to leave 
Alexkor in diamonds and extend its focus into coal whereas 
the – the briefings that Alexkor gave to the Portfolio 
Committees in Parliament made it very clear that Alexkor – 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 74 of 195 
 
Alexkor’s strategy was to exit diamonds in the West Coast 
and pivot to coal. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  Now if I take you  few pages back in the 
same bundle to page 1101.  1101.   
MR CRAYTHORNE:  I have it before me. 
ADV SIBIYA:  What is this document that we are looking at? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  It is a media address statement by Mr 
Malusi Gigaba on the 7 September 2012. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  So this was at the AGM of Alexkor. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  Now if you read on page 1101 the 
highlighted portion; the last paragraph of the highlighted 
portion. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  That is the very last paragraph? 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   
“In this regard  I have appointed Mr Rafique 
Bagus as chairperson of the new board who 
will be assisted by Ms Jillian Nothlanda Jyeni 
[?].  Doctor Yvonne Nonno Matsa Matabane, 
20 
Ms Zukiswa Ntlangula and Mr Mohammed 
Baba.  I have given the new board the 
responsibility to fill the vacancies of CEO 
and CFO forthwith by no later than three 
months.” 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 75 of 195 
 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  And the paragraph before that. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   
“I have assessed the needs of the company 
and the capacity of the board to be able to 
execute its fiduciary duties over the state 
owned company.  Our annual review of the 
board has necessitated that we rotate the 
board 
and 
include 
new 
skills 
sets 
and 
expertise to give impotence to the new 
strategic direction that the shareholder wants 
10 
Alexkor to take.” 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  If I can just stop and mention a side 
issue.  I am informed that I am pronouncing the surname of 
Mr Rafieq wrong and it is not Bagus and it is Bagus. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  I beg your pardon that is my fault. 
ADV SIBIYA:  So – yes I know it is your fault Mr Craythorne 
because I asked you how to pronounce it but – yes so 
moving forward I will pronounce it as Bagus. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  I concede. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  On the next page 1102.  We see the line 
20 
that starts: 
“During the past financial year.” 
Can you read that for me Mr Craythorne? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   
“During” 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 76 of 195 
 
ADV SIBIYA:  It is the first line. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Of 1102? 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  The second sentence. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Oh okay 
“The shareholder has retained.” 
ADV SIBIYA:  The second sentence of that line. 
“During the past financial year.” 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Oh okay I have it. 
“During the past financial year Alexkor has 
managed to a large extent to fulfil the 
10 
developmental objectives of government by 
ploughing back to the community in which it 
is operations are based.  This is at the core 
of how the mining industry can contribute 
positively to the development agenda of the 
state by ensuring that the benefits of the 
mining 
operations 
are 
accrued 
to 
the 
communities in which they operate.  The 
Richtersveldt PSJV can provide the country 
with their best practice on how the mining 
20 
industry can become good corporate citizens 
by investing a human settlement for a long 
term economic and social stability.” 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  So as at this date the Minister is talking 
about the developmental objectives of government.  He is 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 77 of 195 
 
talking about ploughing back to the community in which the 
operations are based.  Now how do you contrast this with the 
new strategy that was then being talked about later? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Well it was a completely at odds 
because the – the aversion because my understanding that 
although there would be a PSJV executive team and Joint 
board to oversee the activities of the PSJV executive team 
Alexkor still had a very real responsibility to ensure and 
provide oversight to make sure that the deed of settlement 
and the unanimous resolution were successful projects.  And 
10 
by diverting attention to coal mining in Mpumalanga and 
Gauteng the – the board was completely redirected away 
from what was going on in Alexander Bay and in addition to 
that a large amount of funding that should have been utilised 
for rebuilding the mine and town infrastructure after the long 
Intaniswa [?] in court battles to enable Alexkor to recover 
from the court battle and become a successful state owned 
enterprise.  Because all of the elements were there.   You 
had the human capital; you had the resources; you had every 
possible conceivable comparative advantage that you would 
20 
want and in spite of that we ended up with the disaster that – 
that we have.  And that is in a large part to do with Alexkor 
being redirected away from the activities in Alexander Bay 
and also the redirecting of crucial funding which had been 
allocated to Alexander Bay by way of the MT – the medium 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 78 of 195 
 
term budget and other funding.  A lot of the interest that 
accrued on those funds is all utilised for pursuing coal 
ambitions which had nothing to do with us in Alexander Bay 
and we were in affect funding those activities. 
ADV SIBIYA:  In fact if I can take you back to Bundle 4A that 
has your affidavit.  If I can take you to page 62.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Sibiya. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We have just reached two hours that I 
gave you.  How are you doing? 
10 
ADV SIBIYA:  Chair we will be done before the lunch 
adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are asking for more time? 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes Chair I am asking for more time.  I was 
careful not to promise that I would keep to it but rather to 
indicate that I would try. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you were not asked to promise.  You 
were given a deadline. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I will let you continue until one. 
20 
ADV SIBIYA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us see – just try to focus on the 
important features of Mr Craythorne’s evidence. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright continue. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 79 of 195 
 
ADV SIBIYA:  Thank you.  Page 62 of Bundle 4A.   
MR CRAYTHORNE:  I have it before me. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  In paragraphs 280 to 282 you express 
this frustration of the money that was being spent in pursuit 
of the emerging black coal miner exit strategy and that it was 
in fact being generated by the marine miners of Alexander 
Bay and should have been applied to its maintenance but 
instead about R40 million per year since 2012 had been 
diverted to fund corporate headquarters in Joburg and to pay 
consultants working on this exit strategy.   
10 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Hm.  Now you say that the concealment on 
page 63 that the concealment – paragraph 285. 
“The concealment of the true value of the 
marine diamond assets Alexkor possesses 
and the misrepresentation of the estimated 
life…” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry what page are you reading from 
now? 
ADV SIBIYA:  63 Chair paragraph 285. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
ADV SIBIYA:  It says: 
“The concealment of the true value of the 
marine diamond assets Alexkor possesses 
and the misrepresentation of the estimated 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 80 of 195 
 
life of its diamond mining ventures in the 
region has provided the new board with a 
rationale 
for 
exiting 
its 
diamond 
mining 
business and diversifying into coal.  However 
should it sell off its marine mining business 
under the current manufactured climate it 
would 
seriously 
under 
recover 
for 
its 
business.  It would also mean the individual 
miners would be forced to liquidate their 
mining operations at a substantial loss.” 
10 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  Now you have indicated that there was 
instead a lot more coal that was yet to be mined and you say 
that: 
“Mr Carstens mislead Parliament.” 
In page 62 of your statement. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:  And what did he say on the 20 – on the 22 
November? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Which paragraph? 
20 
ADV SIBIYA:  On paragraph 282 at the bottom. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  282. 
“Since 2012 approximately R40 million per 
year has been diverted to fund the corporate 
headquarters in Johannesburg and to pay 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 81 of 195 
 
consultants 
working 
on 
Alexkor’s 
exit 
strategy. 
 
To 
justify 
this 
Carstens 
has 
continued 
to 
undermine Alexander 
Bay’s 
future 
diamond 
mining 
prospects. 
 
In 
Parliament on 22 November 2017 Carstens 
stated:  In ten years’ time or five years’ time 
there is not going to be a mine anymore.” 
ADV SIBIYA:  Hm.  And yet he say there has been a lot of 
money that had been spent on this exit strategy.  In 
paragraph 284 on page 63 you state the amount that had 
10 
been spent by financial year 2016 as having exceeded R175 
million. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:  And this is money that you say could have 
comfortably recapitalised the entire Alexkor diamond fleet 
with new technology and semi-mechanised mining vessels 
capable of mining through sand over burden.  Had this 
money been properly spent this could have ensured that 
Alexander Bay could once again become a world class 
diamond production centre. 
20 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  So the money was available. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Indeed. 
ADV SIBIYA:  But there was a decision to not plough it 
where it is needed. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 82 of 195 
 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  And according to you or your 
understanding – sorry Chair if you can just bear with me.  
Sorry Chair I have lost my train of thought so I will move 
away from that point.  Now what was your biggest problem 
with the justification? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  The biggest problem was the fact that it 
would ultimately lead to Alexkor exiting its crown jewels. 
ADV SIBIYA:  And what would be the consequence of that? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Well the consequences of that would be 
10 
that you would have a total and absolute monopolisation of 
the entire West Coast diamond mining industry both on land 
which is Brownfields and in the ocean which is the next 
hundred years of global production will be coming out of the 
sea off the coast of Namaqualand. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes monopolisation by whom at whose 
expense? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  The monopolisation of the – the 
interests that are mapped out in the Quesco plan and the 
losers 
would 
be 
the 
South 
African 
public 
and 
most 
20 
importantly the people of Richtersveldt and Namaqualand 
because there would be no [00:20:14] development.  It would 
all just be the same old brute force.  This is what we offer 
you take it or leave it type of scenario.  The would be flown 
out and siphoned out of Namaqualand as it has been done 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 83 of 195 
 
for the past 100 years.  The only difference would be that the 
environmental damage that we sit with on land would now be 
ending up in the sea as well and there are very serious signs 
of 
that 
already. 
 
Enormous 
amount 
of 
environmental 
disruption has already taken place. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Hm.  How you put it in paragraph 286 is – 
please just read that paragraph. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   
“The 
dynamics 
of 
a 
primary 
board 
and 
executive team that is conflicted by a Gupta 
10 
Gigaba coal agenda and a PSJV board and 
executive team that is conflicted by a Trans 
Hex Questco diamond agenda has resulted in 
a decimation of a local economy, dilapidated 
critical infrastructure and a loss of social 
cohesion.  It has also deprived Alexkor and 
the Richtersveldt community of its share in 
what 
could 
and 
should 
be 
a 
lucrative 
diamond 
industry. 
 
This 
has 
served 
to 
dispossess the people of Namaqualand and 
20 
South African tax payers of a mineral asset 
of immense value and strategic importance.” 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  Now tell us about the involvement of 
Bagus, Kellerman, Carstens and Khoza in the Questco plan?  
What role did they play each of them? 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 84 of 195 
 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  The – the – one of the major issues – 
problems with the Questco document is that it makes 
provision for a shareholding I – if I recall correct of 9% to be 
[00:22:30] for the PSJV management which has hopelessly 
conflicted anybody that has had ever time been involved in 
the operational management of the PSJV’s operations having 
been promised a – a share of the – the final consolidated 
enterprise that was proposed in the Questco document 
places all of those individuals in a position of conflict.  It is 
almost as if they had decided that the Questco plan was a 
10 
fait accompli.  You can manage this enterprise into the 
ground.  The more you manage it into the ground in fact the 
better because it simply means that government will have 
greater levels of fatigue and the pursuers of these assets 
will have to pay less. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Hm.  Yes.  And in addition to that can you 
explain to us the role of each person in the decision making 
process? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Well the – while former Minister Gigaba 
claims in his testimony before Parliament in the Eskom 
20 
inquiry that the idea was to keep Alexkor in diamonds and 
just redirect Alexkor into coal.  The Parliamentary briefings 
that were given by the Alexkor board under the chairmanship 
of Mr Rafique Bagus made it very clear that Alexkor was 
exiting diamonds and that the best thing for the people of 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 85 of 195 
 
Namaqualand and Alexander Bay and Richtersveldt would be 
for Trans Hex and De Beers to take over the operations and 
that documentation I have provided in annexures. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Hm and as you have already said what would 
be the point of anyone buying Alexkor if there was nothing 
left to mine. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Hm.  Now if I can – you say in your statement 
– in your affidavit that you brought these concerns to 
Parliament. 
10 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  I did. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. And you refer to a date where you raise 
this issue as November 2016. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  That is the first time at which I publicly 
raised concerns over state capture although that was not – 
state capture had not at that point really become centred 
around the Gupta’s.  But it had certainly been around for as 
long as South Africa’s been on the map.  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well 2016 is when Mr Jonas went public 
about the meeting that he had at the Gupta house is it not? 
20 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought he would – he went public in 
March 2016 about a meeting that had happened in October 
2015.  He public in March 2016. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Thank you; thank you Chair.  Look if I 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 86 of 195 
 
had been a little bit better informed I might have been more 
concerned about – at that stage about the – I only became 
more aware of the Gupta Links. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And of course not only that – or not only 
that Mr Jonas went public in March 2016 about allegations of 
an offer of the job of Minister of Finance and money that he 
said was offered to him but three years earlier in 2013 that 
being the Gupta landing – Gupta landing at Waterkloof which 
had captured the attention of the whole country.  So it cannot 
be true that in 2016 the country had not heard about 
10 
allegations of state capture by the Gupta’s. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  You are correct Chairman I would – I 
will agree with that but I do not think the country was taken it 
seriously enough. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Ms Sibiya. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Thank you.  In effect what you are saying is 
you at that time were not concerned about the state capture 
by the Gupta’s. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Well I – I was concerned not in a sort of 
a general way because I had witnessed what had transpired 
20 
with the Imperial Crown Trading affair and the Iron Ore 
assets that they tried to capture and what concerned us is 
the EAC is that at that particular time we were trying to 
reach out to the Department of Mineral Resources regarding 
issues of concentration in our industry and monopolisation 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 87 of 195 
 
and while we had immense difficulty in that the Gupta’s had 
their situation fought all the way to the constitutional court.  
So you had the Department ignoring our pleas for attention 
on our industry while at the same time spending hundreds of 
millions of rands in tax payers’ money trying to defend the 
Gupta’s hijacking of iron ore assets through Imperial Crown 
Trading.  So that – that irked us as the EAC a fair amount. 
ADV SIBIYA:  And you referred us to the presentation to the 
Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises that appears in 
Bundle 10 – in Bundle 4B on page 1042. 
10 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  1000 and? 
ADV SIBIYA:  and 42 – 1042. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I have it in front of me. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  Now you say this is when you raised 
these matters. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   The matters of State Capture. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Now what was the response by Alexkor? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Well, as I attended this Portfolio 
20 
Committee briefing, I listened to the board confirming its 
continued insistence of waiving(?) diamonds towards coal.  
And 
even 
more, 
investing 
in 
funding 
in 
a 
diamond 
beneficiation project.  And that just amplified my concerns.   
 
And subsequent to the portfolio briefing, I had a chat 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 88 of 195 
 
with 
Zukiswa 
Nthlangula 
and 
I 
said 
to 
her: 
 
Look 
...[intervenes]    
ADV SIBIYA:   Who is Zukiswa Nthlangula? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   She stood in for the chairlady, Hansi 
Matseke, because she had a family emergency.  So Zukiswa 
Nthlangula was a board member who was the stand-in 
chairperson for the duration of the briefing to parliament. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   So subsequent to that encounter with 
Ms Nthlangula in parliament, I approached her and I said to 
10 
her:  Look, you really need to reconsider the strategic 
direction that you are embarking upon.   
 
And I said that I had written an extensive document 
outlining what the true potential was for Alexander Bay as a 
marine diamond mining centre going forward which she had 
not been given.   
 
I had given the report to Mr Carstens earlier that year, I 
think in April, but he had not distributed it to the board of 
Alexkor because that would have not supported the Questco 
plan at all.   
20 
 
Because it was very convenient for the Questco Team to 
have the Alexkor Coal Team stay focussed on coal.   
ADV SIBIYA:   Now as a result of your interaction with 
Zukiswa on that day, what else did you do? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I then undertook to provide her with 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 89 of 195 
 
further information by way of an email.  I informed both 
Zukiswa Nthlangula and Honourable Zukiswa Rantho who I 
addressed my correspondence to, and I included also 
Ms Terry Stander from the DA as well, who was also present 
at that meeting that I attended.   
 
And I said:  Look, this is what I think is going on.  You 
are dealing with a situation where there are strategic 
blunders currently unfolding which you need to address.  And 
I am prepared to author a document.  Put a document 
together for you.  But I will need some assistance.   
10 
 
And they were very pleased to hear this.  And a month 
later, I were called into a meeting by Mr Mervyn Carstens 
and Ms Raygen Phillips who – this was just before the mine 
close, a day before the mind closed in December 2016 – and 
they were extremely irate.   
 
They confronted me with the fact that I had suggested to 
parliament that Alexkor had been captured by Transnet.  And 
I said to Mervyn:  Well, I am afraid Mervyn, I feel you 
betrayed us.   
 
And they thought that it was outrageous that I was 
20 
interfering in strategic matters.  And I felt as a serious 
investor - and my wife and I have invested everything into 
our business in Alexander Bay. 
 
And for us to have that investment be jeopardised by ill-
informed and bad decisions, in my view, was unacceptable.  
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 90 of 195 
 
And I was not prepared to keep quiet about it. 
ADV 
SIBIYA: 
 
 
Now 
you 
say 
that 
you 
– 
on 
the 
30t h of November on page 52 of your affidavit in Bundle 4A. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Page 52? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I have it in front of me. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay.  In paragraph 230, you say that the 
equitable access campaign travelled to Cape Town to hand 
over a warning about the serious government problems and 
state capture at Alexkor to numerous portfolio committees. 
10 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  How – what did you tell them? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Well, my fellow ESC colleague, 
Mr George Nicolai who is in the gallery today, took a 
document outlining the situation at Alexkor as I saw it as 
someone who was very deep inside the affairs of both 
Alexkor and the PSJV.  And he drove down to Cape Town.   
 
The idea was to print multiple copies but it would have 
been too expensive for us.  So Mr Nicolai then made 
electronic copies on some drives and went door-to-door in 
20 
parliament to numerous portfolio committees and handed 
some drives of the document which I authored, setting out 
the state of capture in regard to Alexkor.   
ADV SIBIYA:   And was there a response? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   There was a limited response but 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 91 of 195 
 
nothing concrete that raised out of our interactions with 
parliament. 
ADV SIBIYA:   What – do you confirm that this was not the 
first time you reported it to parliament? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I confirm that. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And in fact, you had previously written to 
Minister Brown. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And the result had been the report that we 
referred to earlier where there was an investigation that 
10 
came back with no real findings. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Actually – okay if you are referring to 
the ARC Report, the ARC Report was a consequence of the 
complaint from Mr Korabie.  What flowed out of my complaint 
to Minister Brown, was a letter of response, thanking me.  
She then made contact with the board of Alexkor.   
 
And as a consequence of that, I was invited to attend a 
board meeting in Kimberley.  And I then travelled down to 
Cape Town, flew up to Kimberley to attend that board 
meeting.   
20 
 
And at that board meeting I raised some of my concerns 
in relation to the poor diamond pricing, the strategic 
realignments 
that 
were 
unfolding 
and 
the 
lack 
of 
transparency and public accountability. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  Chair, if the Chair can give me one 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 92 of 195 
 
minute?  Just to bear with me for one minute. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you.  Yes, thank you Chair.  In fact, in 
– I have lost – I am not sure which bundle I last referred you 
to.  So in Bundle 4B... 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:   On page 1127. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat the page. 
ADV SIBIYA:   1127.  One thousand one hundred and twenty-
seven.  This is a letter that you sent to Kim Davids.  Tell us 
10 
about that. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   This is a letter that I addressed to 
Ms Davids on the 9 t h of March 2017. 
ADV SIBIYA:   H’m. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   After attending a – when the ESC as an 
organisation concerned with the rights of the small scale 
marine miners in Namaqualand, we became convinced and 
there was overwhelming evidence to the effect that there 
was corporate, major corporate realignments that were 
taking place without us being consulted as a stakeholder.   
20 
 
And it has become clear to me – to us as an 
organisation that the level of a stake hold and materiality for 
the marine miners is zero.   
 
And we then tried to muster support from our members 
to confront what the revelations that were being made by 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 93 of 195 
 
accident, by way of the Questco document and formally 
parliament by way of the briefings to parliament concerning 
the exit strategy and other very, very serious decisions, you 
know, in a hope to try and raise our level of stakeholder 
materiality.   
 
Immediately after that, we were sent quite a harsh letter 
from Ms Matseke, denying that there was any corporate 
plans to exit diamonds or anything of that nature.  So.   
 
Well, it said to me that it was pointless trying to raise 
the EOC’s concerns with the Alexkor Board in relation to 
10 
these major realignments, that one have to reach out to the 
minister.   
 
And the purpose of contacting Ms Davids was to reach 
out the minister in this regard and try to get her intervention.   
ADV SIBIYA:   H’m.  And in fact, she responded to your 
letter on page – her responds appears on page 1145 of the 
same bundle.   
MR CRAYTHORNE:   1145.  I have it before me. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  Is that the response that you got from 
the minister? 
20 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And, in effect, in paragraph – in the third 
paragraph, there is the department who conveyed the report 
which you had prepared to the Department of Mineral 
Resources for review and consideration.   
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 94 of 195 
 
 
And furthermore, the Department notes the results of the 
survey undertaken to assess the level of satisfaction 
amongst the Alexkor Pooling and Sharing Joint Venture 
contractors.   
“I recommend that you approach the board of 
Alexkor 
and 
Alexkor 
PSJV 
to 
address 
your 
concerns.” 
 
Had you not already done this? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Pardon? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Had you not already done that? 
10 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Yes.  There were two letters written to 
Minister Brown.  And I am not sure of the sequencing. 
ADV SIBIYA:   H’m. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   So I am not sure if this was the second 
or the first one.  But I think this is what led to the visit to...  I 
beg your pardon.  This was the response that I got from 
Minister Brown. The second time I think I reached out to her 
was when we were being sued by Webber Wentzel. 
ADV SIBIYA:   H’m.  Yes. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   And – or thereabouts.  Or when we are 
20 
being threatened to say:  Look, you know, we are no better 
off after having gone and you know try to meet the board 
and...  I beg your pardon.   
 
We are not as an organisation and as a group of 
contractors, there is an important segment of the Alexkor 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 95 of 195 
 
operations, we are – the situation is deteriorating.   
 
So the first attempt reaching out to Minister Brown was 
successful because it led to a meeting taking place or a 
board meeting and me being me invited to attend the board 
meeting in Kimberley.   
 
When I tried to raise the issue around the Questco 
document to a person, Hansi Matseke refused to discuss it.  
And directed it to operations on the mine and the lack of 
transparency in relation to the diamond prices and the 
deteriorating relations between the contractors and the PSJV 
10 
Management. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And the minutes of that meeting appears on 
page 1146 to 1148.  Is that correct? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  If the Chair can give me one second to 
check with my teammate? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you, Chair.  Chair, from our side that is 
the evidence that we would like to present in this forum.  But 
I would like to invite Mr Craythorne if there is anything that 
20 
is burning him that he feels I may have left out. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Is there something Mr Craythorne?  
And is contained in your affidavit or annexures that you think 
is very important that you have not been given a chance to 
cover in your oral evidence? 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 96 of 195 
 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Thank you very much Chairperson.  
Through this whole period of State Capture, are there many 
issues and things that have disturbed me but of all the 
phenomenon that had disturbed me the most.   
 
The failure of parliament to protect us is for me the most 
disturbing because we approached parliament over and over, 
so many times.  Going back to 2010 even.   
 
And when I am reading PMG summaries, statements 
made in parliament by – for instance Honourable Cathy 
Labuschagne from the NCRP, putting on record that the 
10 
NCRP was told to stay away from Alexkor.   
 
I want to know who told Cathy Labuschagne to stay 
away from Alexkor.  Because that, I think, is just the tip of 
the iceberg and I think if parliament had done a job, I would 
not be sitting here and extending my time.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, that is something very important 
Mr Craythorne.  I think we are going to adjourn for lunch.  
But I am very interested in that aspect as I have indicated 
before.  I would like, if it is possible, when we come back at 
two, I am going to hear about Eskom’s witness for today.   
20 
 
I will hear from the evidence leader who is going to lead 
that evidence and about the rest of the week.  But when we 
come back, before I hear what they have to say, that is that 
work stream, I would like you to – Ms Sibiya ...[intervenes]  
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, Chair. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 97 of 195 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...to lead him on those specific issue – on 
that specific issue. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   With special reference to the dates of his 
communication or their communication to parliament, what it 
was about, when was it, was there a response.  If there was, 
what was the response.   
 
Because it is quite important that the Commission 
establishes what parliament was busy doing as some of 
these things were happening in state owned entities.   
10 
 
In particularly when these matters were brought to their 
attention.  Did they do their job?  If they did not do their job, 
why did they not do their job?  What was going on?  That is 
quite important.  So we will adjourn.  But you confirm that 
that is the part that you wanted to bring to my attention? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Indeed, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright.  We will take the lunch 
adjournment.  We come back at two.  Then Ms Sibiya will 
deal with that.  But obviously, because you know your 
documentation much better than us, you will also have a look 
20 
and will be able to say to her here is the relevant 
correspondence, that is the date, that is the page and this is 
what the response was or there was no response.  I want 
that – I am very interested in that. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Thank you very much. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 98 of 195 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Okay Ms Sibiya, we will take the 
lunch adjournment.  We will take the lunch adjournment now 
and resume at two.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Ms Sibiya, shall we cover that 
particular point about parliament’s role? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Chair, I must first explain something.  Chair, 
the 
witness 
has 
had 
a 
lot 
of 
correspondence 
with 
parliament but the correspondence is not in the affidavit or 
10 
the annexures and yes, Chair, there are reports that he has 
given. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SIBIYA:   That are part of the evidence and the 
annexures but the correspondence itself is not included 
and 
we 
would 
seek 
an 
indulgence 
to 
prepare 
a 
supplementary affidavit because it is evidence that in 
existence.  So we would need to prepare that.  And, Chair, 
in addition, while I am talking about a supplementary 
affidavit, during the course of last week in preparation for 
20 
coming here, a number of affidavits were received from 
parties that had been implicated by Mr Craythorne that he 
would need to respond to, so he would need to prepare 
supplementary affidavit in response to those as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay but that correspondence, Mr 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 99 of 195 
 
Craythorne, exists – it is there somewhere at home or your 
office. 
MR 
CRAYTHORNE: 
 
 
It 
is 
even 
a 
machine 
here, 
Chairperson, but it would be awkward and time-consuming 
to …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   To deal with it without first preparing. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   To deal with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is in order so what will 
be necessary therefore would be a supplementary affidavit 
as Ms Sibiya says.  It may be a separate supplementary 
10 
affidavit 
separate 
from 
any 
other 
affidavit 
that 
Mr 
Craythorne may prepare to respond to other parties who 
have filed affidavits, simply a special affidavit that deals 
with this particular issue and refers to correspondence and 
then copies of the correspondence can be attached. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Dealing with it very systematically to say 
on this date this is what we wrote to parliament about, this 
is what they said in response or they said nothing. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then on such and such a date we wrote 
about the same thing or about something else again, there 
was no response or this is the response we gave.  Such 
and such a date we went there, we met with so and so, we 
raised our issues but nothing happened after that.  Or this 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 100 of 195 
 
what we were promised but nothing came of it, that kind of 
systematic narration of the issues.  Okay, no, that is fine, 
then we do not need to deal with it today. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that affidavit will be furnished and 
then a decision can be taken at that stage whether it would 
be necessary for Mr Craythorne to come back and give oral 
evidence about it.  It may be that the affidavit will be 
enough and that it can then be given to the relevant people 
in parliament to say respond to this affidavit, to these 
10 
allegations and then we take it from there. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Perfect. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no, that is alright, then it means I 
should excuse you now, Mr Craythorne.  Thank you very 
much for having come to give evidence and if necessary we 
will ask you to come back but if possible, if at all possible 
20 
we will try and avoid that but if necessary we will ask you 
to come back.  But thank you very much, you are now 
excused.  Thank you. 
ADV BHAM:   Mr Chair.  Mr Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I am sorry, I am sorry.  Mr Bham, I 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 101 of 195 
 
am sorry. 
ADV BHAM:   Not a problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I saw you in the morning but I think I did 
not see you now.  Yes, yes. 
ADV BHAM:   In this Commission I always try to keep out 
of the – Mr Chair, can I just briefly state that on behalf of 
the State Diamond Trader you may be familiar with the 
affidavit that we filed on behalf of - by Mr Mnguni on behalf 
of the STD. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no, I have not seen it. 
10 
ADV BHAM:   But it does not really matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV BHAM:   We have listened over a day and a half 
carefully 
to 
Mr 
Craythorne’s 
evidence. 
 
We 
have 
considered the paragraphs we have been referred to in the 
notice and we have come to the conclusion that there is no 
need for the SDT to trouble this Commission with any 
cross-examination and I thought I would just place that on 
record and may I ask if we may be excused. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, thank you very much, Mr 
20 
Bham, you are excused. 
ADV BHAM:   I am grateful, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I always say that the advantage of 
having 
experienced 
counsel 
representing 
parties 
is 
because experienced counsel knows the issues that are 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 102 of 195 
 
important and they will not want to just cross-examine for 
the sake of cross-examining. 
ADV BHAM:   I am glad you say so, my wife does not 
always agree.  Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are excused, thank you, Mr Bham.  
Is the Eskom work stream team here?  Mr Seleka is 
supposed to be here. 
ADV SIBIYA:   It does not appear so at the moment but the 
junior is present. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [indistinct] 06.10 do you know anything? 
10 
ADV SIBIYA:   Chair, in addition, they need a short 
adjournment because the witness will be testifying via 
media, so …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the evidence leader must here 
first.  Is his junior here? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, please come forward, tell me what is 
happening?  Yes, good afternoon.  Yes, switch on the mic?  
Yes? 
ADV JAGGANATH:  I must apologise for [indistinct] 07.18 I 
20 
am not entirely sure why he is not present, we had made 
arrangements to meet at the venue by one.  So I did send 
him a message, I assume he is driving.  But, Chair, may we 
ask for a short adjournment so that I could call him 
telephonically to find out his whereabouts as well as the 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 103 of 195 
 
fact to give us a short opportunity just to link up with the 
witness who is not going to be present. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, is that Ms Nteta? 
ADV JAGGANATH:  Yes, Dr Ayanda Nteta. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I assume that Rule 3.3 notices were 
served quite a long time ago with regard to her evidence 
because she was going to testify some weeks ago. 
ADV JAGGANATH:  Indeed so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV JAGGANATH:  She was going to testify last year, 
10 
December. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV JAGGANATH:  And then there was – it was in the last 
week so… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright.  No, that is fine then 
we are going to adjourn but I need to talk to Ms Sibiya 
before we adjourn.  Thank you. 
ADV JAGGANATH:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Sibiya, do you want to come back to 
the podium?  In terms of the way forward with regard to 
20 
Alexkor, I know that the – you have a commitment that 
makes you unavailable from a certain date.  Is it from the 
18 t h? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, it is from Monday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Up to when? 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 104 of 195 
 
ADV SIBIYA:   Until the 22 n d, 21 February. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So you would only be available 
after that to finish whatever needs to be finished in regard 
to Alexkor? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, yes, Chair, I would not be – it would 
not be proper for me to be engaged in …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, I accept that you will not be able 
to… 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I was just making sure that you will be 
10 
available after… 
ADV SIBIYA:   Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so the witnesses that you still 
have are Mr Bishop? 
ADV SIBIYA:   And Mr Dekker. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then Mr Dekker. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And then the implicated parties. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You need to have Mr Carstens. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Mr Bagus. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Korabie and Mr Bagus. 
20 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Certainly 
we 
need 
to 
have 
their 
affidavits. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then we can see where there might 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 105 of 195 
 
be no need for oral evidence and where there might be 
need but we certainly need to have all of those in as soon 
as possible.  I would like that all attempts be made to 
make sure that by end of January all those affidavits are in 
and obviously when they come in, copies need to be given 
to people like Mr Craythorne and maybe Mr Bishop and 
whoever whose evidence might be disputed by those 
people in certain respects. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that we reach a point where we say 
10 
all affidavits are in and everybody has commented on 
everybody’s versions that relate to them and then we can 
take it from there. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, Chair, thank you very much, we will 
attend to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  I am going to hear in terms of 
the rest of the week as far as the work stream – the Eskom 
work stream is concerned.  It may well be that there might 
be days this week when they are not going to – that they 
are not going to be able to use.  Now if that were to 
20 
happen, subject to your own commitments for this week, it 
might be something to think about whether Mr Peter Bishop 
could be brought in when a day becomes available or half 
a day to come in and give his evidence.  But if your 
situation does not permit because that was not in the 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 106 of 195 
 
original plan, that is fine, I will understand, then Mr Bishop 
can give his evidence after you have become available. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you, Chair, it would not be possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It would not be possible.  Okay, no, that 
is alright.  I am going to take a ten minutes adjournment to 
enable the Eskom work stream to get ready.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Your leader is not here?  I am told he 
said he is still going to be about ten minutes.  Junior 
10 
Counsel is supposed to be always ready to take over, I 
want you to take over.   Let us continue, your leader can 
take over when he arrives, if that is fine, otherwise you can 
lead, okay. 
ADV JAGGANATH:   Indeed so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I don’t have any file here.   There might 
be no reason why you might not lead the witness up till the 
end.   Yes, are you ready? 
ADV JAGGANATH:  Chair I am ready.  The witness that we 
are calling is Dr Ayanda Komotso Lindiwe Nteta.  If we may 
20 
start. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay are we going to use Eskom Bundle 
14? 
ADV JAGGANATH:   Indeed so Mr Chair.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright and the next witness is 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 107 of 195 
 
Ayanda Komotso Lindiwe Nteta? 
ADV JAGGANATH:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV JAGGANATH:   Mr Chair we have also indicated on a 
previous occasion that this witness is situated in Durban, 
as a result thereto we have requested her evidence by led 
via – remotely via Teams or Zoom.   She is on line. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja no I was told by the request and I 
authorised that she can give evidence via videolink.  
Before you start leading her do you want to assist the 
10 
public by just telling me where her evidence fits in, in the 
whole Eskom saga? 
ADV JAGGANATH:   Indeed so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV JAGGANATH:   Mr Chair this witness at the time, or 
her evidence being led she was the Acting Senior Manager 
of Fuel Resources at Eskom, in the period of March 2015 
or from April 2015.  She will – her evidence revolves 
around the coal supply agreements so it is basically the 
Tegeta transactions in respect of OCH, which is the 
20 
Optimum 
Coal 
Mines 
as 
well 
as 
the 
prepayment 
transactions which – those are the two areas that her 
evidence in essence will cover. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay.  That’s fine.   Please 
administer the oath or affirmation. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 108 of 195 
 
REGISTRAR:   Please state your full names for the record.  
DR NTETA:   Ayanda Komotso Lindiwe Nteta. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
DR NTETA:   I do not. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
DR NTETA:   I do. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you swear that the evidence you will 
give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing else but 
10 
the truth, if so please raise your right hand and say so help 
me God. 
DR NTETA:   So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.   Her screen needs to be 
moved a bit, I don’t think it is where we usually have the 
screen, can you move her screen a bit, I think normally it 
is a little towards that side yes.   Is it in the same 
position? Oh the room is different.   If you move the screen 
what will happen, if you move it towards this way, yes like 
that, it shouldn’t affect her.  Okay I think that’s much better 
20 
ja, okay, alright. 
AYANDA KOMOTSO LINDIWE NTETA:   [duly sworn, 
states] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, you may continue. 
ADV JAGGANATH:   Thank you Mr Chair.  Mr Chair I must 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 109 of 195 
 
apologise before you walked in we actually were just – I 
am not sure if the witness has the links of the files 
because I need to take her through her statement, if I can 
just ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you can check with her. 
ADV JAGGANATH:   Dr Nteta an email link was sent to you 
shortly, have you had a chance to open it? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am not sure if your voice is naturally 
soft or low or whether you should speak closer to the mic 
or you should raise your voice, try your best. 
10 
ADV JAGGANATH:   I will indeed.  Dr Nteta? 
DR NTETA:   Okay I am currently opening my emails. 
ADV JAGGANATH:   Thank you.  There should be links 
that would have been sent to you, the first one would 
contain, it should say Exhibit Bundle 40, or it will read 
Exhibit U28. 
DR NTETA:   Okay I have not received either, the last 
email I received was the meeting request, I am refreshing 
my emails. 
ADV JAGGANATH:   Thank you.  
20 
DR NTETA:    I have not received it.  I am not going to look 
into, I am just trying to get – ja, now it has come through, 
Exhibit U28. 
ADV 
JAGGANATH: 
 
Would 
you 
be 
able 
to 
quickly 
download?  
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 110 of 195 
 
DR NTETA:    Okay.   I am also just getting the password 
sorry, I am just writing it down so that I ...  
ADV JAGGANATH:   No problem. 
DR NTETA:   I am entering the password.  It is currently 
downloading, it indicates one unit left. 
ADV JAGGANATH:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is she going to be looking at the 
documents on her computer? 
ADV JAGGANATH:   Yes Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As opposed to hard copies? 
10 
ADV JAGGANATH:   Yes, we did not, we didn’t have the 
opportunity to courier the  documents down to Durban 
because it was a last minute arrangement from Friday 
where we were confirmed that she would be testifying via t 
he link. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mmm. 
ADV JAGGANATH:   There is just one more bundle that 
she also has to download, it is in respect of the Tegeta 
reference which would be ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   When you refer to specific page numbers 
20 
will she have no problem identifying those? 
ADV JAGGANATH:   There should be no problem Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV JAGGANATH:   Because it is exactly, it is basically 
our files that have been electronically uploaded, so we will 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 111 of 195 
 
– I will quickly check with her now to make sure she has 
the black and the red numbers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV JAGGANATH:   Mr Chair she will also have to 
download the Tegeta reference bundle which would be – Dr 
Nteta have you managed to secure the Exhibit, Eskom 
Bundle 14? 
DR NTETA:   What I have just done is U28, Nteta A 
Affidavit and Eskom Bundle 18.     
ADV JAGGANATH:   Wonderful. 
10 
DR NTETA:  Is there a second one that I should be looking 
for?  
ADV JAGGANATH:   No Eskom Bundle 18 is the second 
bundle, that should read the Tegeta reference bundle? 
DR NTETA:  Okay, that’s it.   Okay, I am opening it, it is 
called Bundle 18, it is Exhibit U – yes 34, Tegeta reference 
bundle and ...[indistinct] there is writing in black and there 
is also some writing in? 
ADV JAGGANATH:   Red. 
DR NTETA:  Yes. 
20 
ADV JAGGANATH:   That is indeed so, that is actually the 
two references that the electronic pagination for the 
exhibits that is used at the Commission, we will be referred 
to the black numbers so the numbers on your left hand 
side, on the document. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 112 of 195 
 
DR NTETA:   Okay, alright. 
ADV JAGGANATH:   Mr Chair my leader has just walked 
in. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Has he said he wants to take over, if he 
doesn’t say that you can continue? 
ADV JAGGANATH:   He nodded to me indicating that he is 
willing to take over. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  We will continue while he is busy 
until he is ready. 
ADV JAGGANATH:   Thank you Mr Chair.  Dr Nteta like I 
10 
have indicated we are using the black reference numbers, 
so if we look at U28, the first one, it starts on page – it 
says Eskom 14 which refers to the Exhibit number or the 
reference, and then the page number is 63, if you look at 
page 63 and go up to page 84 you confirm that is your 
statement? 
DR NTETA:   Yes I do.  
ADV JAGGANATH:   Okay ma’am if you turn then to page 
84 you would see the affidavit was signed by yourself on 
the 5 t h of July 2020 do you confirm that is correct? 
20 
DR NTETA:   Yes I confirm that signature, the date I cannot 
see well but I confirm the signature. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well ...[intervenes]  
DR NTETA:   I see the stamp of the South African Police 
yes the 6 t h of July, yes. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 113 of 195 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well the stamp of the South African 
Police reflect 5 July 2020 but the Commissioner of Oaths 
said that you certified that you acknowledged that you 
knew and understood the contents of the affidavit which 
was signed and so on before him at July on the 5 t h day of 
June 2020, is that July or is that something else, do you 
see what I am reading? 
DR NTETA:    Yes sir I see what you are reading. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Does it look like July or is it the name of 
a place that looks like July?   Do you remember the place 
10 
you went? 
DR NTETA:   Yes the place was Midrand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so it is July then there’s June and it 
cannot be both. 
DR NTETA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What’s your recollection was it July or 
June, or you cannot remember? 
DR NTETA:   I cannot remember, right now I am inclined to 
say July because my signature under above looks like it 
says 07. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NTETA:   So I am inclined to say July. 
CHAIRPERSON:   July, ja, okay, alright.  Continue.  
ADV JAGGANATH:   I think a simple way to put it would be 
ma’am on the day that you signed your signature do you 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 114 of 195 
 
remember being at the Midrand Police Station? 
DR NTETA:   Yes, yes, I do. 
ADV JAGGANATH:   And you would have commissioned 
this statement in front of the Commissioner at the police 
station, and the stamp would read July, so I think it is was 
just an error where there’s 15 July, June, I think the 
statement was drafted around June but signed in July. 
DR NTETA:   Right.  
ADV JAGGANATH:    Ma’am as indicated that this is your 
affidavit to the Commission, so for the record you have 
10 
confirmed that it is your signature and it is your statement 
that you have provided.  Can you ...[intervenes]     
DR NTETA:   Yes I confirm.  
ADV JAGGANATH:   Okay for the record would you be able 
to place your qualifications? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just for the sake of completeness do 
you confirm that the contents of the affidavit are to the 
best of your knowledge true and correct? 
DR NTETA:  Yes I confirm that – yes I confirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, continue. 
20 
ADV JAGGANATH:   Mr Chair my Silk is asking if he may 
then now take over the proceedings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that is fine. 
ADV JAGGANATH:   May I then be excused. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 115 of 195 
 
ADV JAGGANATH:   Thank you for the indulgence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I apologise for the delayed arrival 
Chairperson, I understood that the witness of this morning 
might take longer than discussed with my learned friend 
yesterday but I was told after two he was excused. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well when we started in the morning I 
specifically said to Ms Sibiya that I would give her two 
10 
hours to finish and part of the reason why I mentioned that 
in the open hearing was so that wherever you may be you 
would know because you should be keeping an eye on what 
is happening in the proceedings, you should know that we 
were going to finish at about twelve, so we didn’t finish at 
twelve, so I thought by one o’clock you would be here.   
One o’clock you were not here so I thought at least when 
we come back at two you would be here and then you were 
not here still, so later on I had to ask your junior to take 
over. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I hardly watched, but when 
preparing ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well you had to watch if you wanted to – 
if you knew you were going to have to start after the 
witness had finished who had started in the morning, you 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 116 of 195 
 
had to keep an eye or get somebody to check if something 
changed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I was amiss, I was. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright, let us continue.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I have been observing on the issue of 
the signature of Ms or Dr Nteta’s affidavit.   Dr Nteta on 
the last page of your affidavit the Commissioner has put a 
stamp, the South African Police Service Supply Chain 
Management Midrand, the stamps shows a date of 5 July 
2020, can you see that? 
10 
DR NTETA:   Yes I can. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then the date of five your 
response with what is handwritten under oath and the 
month of July which is misplaced is put – the month is 
written in the space for the place, can you see that. 
DR NTETA:   Yes I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That has been covered. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That has been covered by your junior. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair, so we can accept 
20 
that your statement could have been commissioned on the 
5 t h of July.  Chairperson for the purposes ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think your junior had just started 
asking her to deal with her qualifications and she – when 
you took over. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 117 of 195 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And she was still to deal with her 
qualifications. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair is it sufficient, the affidavit 
is in Exhibit U28. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The affidavit has not been admitted as 
yet, but the part you sought to cover has been covered, so 
if you ask me to have it admitted that can be done and 
then you can ask her about – then you can start asking her 
questions starting with her employment history at Eskom 
10 
and her qualifications. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So do you want to admit this affidavit? 
ADV SELEKA SC   Yes Chair it is Exhibit U28.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The affidavit of Ayanda Komotso Lindiwe 
Nteta starting at page 53 of Eskom Bundle 14 is admitted 
together with its annexures as Exhibit U28.1. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  Chairperson for the 
purposes of the audience I could also briefly point out the 
issues on which Ms Nteta will be testifying on.  Can I do 
20 
that, thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So Ms Nteta – it is predominantly of 
Eskom Chairperson, she was there in 2015 in the Division 
of Fuel, the Unit of Fuel Sourcing with the Division of 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 118 of 195 
 
Primary Energy so she would have been responsible for 
fuel sourcing.  The point that she is going to testify on 
mainly relates to the prepayment submission that was 
made for the prepayment of R659million to Tegeta in April 
2015.  She will tell the Chairperson that she was in fact the 
person who initiated the drafting of that submission which 
was ultimately signed by Mr Koko and submitted to the 
BGC in a meeting of the 11 t h of April for approval.  She will 
also tell the Chairperson about her interactions with the 
Gupta family, in this case specifically in her affidavit she 
10 
addresses her interaction with Mr Tony Gupta.  She will 
deal with as well her interaction with Mr Ravindra Nath who 
the CEO of Tegeta at the time, and tell the Chairperson 
how the transactions between Tegeta and Eskom in regard 
to 
Brakfontein 
and 
this 
particular 
transactions 
of 
R6 659million came about. 
 
Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Ms Nteta then in regard to your 
qualifications just by way of background and introduction 
20 
could 
you 
please 
tell 
the 
Chairperson 
what 
your 
qualifications are? 
DR NTETA:   Okay, I currently have a doctorate in 
Business Leadership, which I obtained from Unisa School 
of Business Leadership in Midrand.

Page 119 of 195 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see that you say you also have 
qualifications in Masters in Business Leadership? 
DR NTETA:   Yes I have a Masters in Business Leadership, 
obtained from the same institution, I also have a Bachelor 
of Arts degree which is my undergraduate degree. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I assume you obtained your doctorate 
after you deposed to this affidavit? 
DR NTETA:   Yes, I did, formally. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Congratulations. 
10 
DR NTETA:   Thank you sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.   Dr Nteta, I will call 
you doctor then, when did you start at Eskom? 
DR NTETA:   So I started at Eskom in June 2012 I think it 
is, and I started as a senior manager within the Field 
Sourcing 
Division 
which 
falls 
within 
Primary 
Energy 
Department. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  As a senior manager?   
DR NTETA:   Yes, as a senior manager. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see that from your affidavit you would 
20 
have held this position from then June 2012 to about July 
2015? 
DR NTETA:    Yes sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And what position did you occupy 
thereafter? 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 120 of 195 
 
DR NTETA:   So after the position of senior manager I was 
then in August 2015 I was the Acting General Manager also 
within Fuel Sourcing, also within the Primary Energy 
Division, and that was until February 2017 where I was 
then Senior General Manager for Primary Energy Division.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thereafter? 
DR NTETA:   A position that I held up until April 2018, I am 
just trying to remember, where I then left the employ of 
Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, do you have your affidavit in front 
10 
of you? 
DR NTETA:   I am just trying to get to that.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, that is in Eskom bundle 14, Eskom 
Bundle 14. 
DR NTETA:   Yes sir.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is on page 64, which is the black 
numbers on the left, top left hand corner. 
DR NTETA:   Yes I have that, and I have it in front of me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.   So the period of interest 
for present purposes is the one from August 2015 to 
20 
January 
2017 
when 
you 
were 
the 
Acting 
GM 
Fuel 
Resourcing? 
DR NTETA:   Yes sir.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well we could actually take it back to 
June 2012, because of my next question.  When – tell the 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 121 of 195 
 
Chairperson 
when 
did 
you 
have 
engagements 
or 
interactions with the Gupta Family or members of the 
family? 
DR NTETA:   So my interactions with them, I had indicated 
that I do not recall the exact date but it would have been if 
I was to put a line in the sense after they had obtained 
their Brakfontein Coal Supply Agreement which they were 
awarded in I think it was 2015, where they were awarded 
that particular agreement.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, no I have looked at the evidence, 
10 
even your affidavit, I see that that contract was signed on 
the 10 t h of March 2015.  
DR NTETA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That Chairperson you find on page 69 
of Dr Nteta’s affidavit, paragraph 6.16.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you see that Dr Nteta? 
DR NTETA:   Yes, paragraph 16 yes it was signed on the 
10 t h of March 2015. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is right.  
20 
DR NTETA:   My interactions would have been post that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It would have post that, but would you 
please, just before we got into the details of your 
interaction with them would you please give us the 
background to the conclusion of the Brakfontein  contract?   
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 122 of 195 
 
In a nutshell how did that contract come about what role 
you played in the build up to the conclusion.  
DR NTETA:   So ...[indistinct] from my perspective from – 
between June 2012 and December 2012 where I was 
requested by my then Manager, Johan Bester, to engage 
on the supply of coal from Tegeta, and from that point 
there were several interactions with various people from 
the organisation, from the CEO to the General Manager 
etcetera, and that culminated in the conclusion of an 
agreement 
in 
March 
2015, 
where 
we 
had 
various 
10 
negotiations, the final negotiations was with my then 
manager, Johan Bester, to then conclude the Coal Supply 
Agreement then. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now on page 65 of your affidavit, and I 
am always referring to the black numbers on the top left 
hand corner, page 65, paragraph 6.3, it reads that during 
2013 I together with representative from inter alia the 
technical, environmental and coal operations departments 
within PED, which is Primary Energy Division, is that 
correct? 
20 
DR NTETA:    Yes that is correct.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, and the Eskom Legal Department 
engaged primarily with Mr Ravindra Nath and Mr Satish 
Modalia from Tegeta Exploration during initial engagement 
that Eskom had with Tegeta the two resources to supply 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 123 of 195 
 
coal from namely Vierfontein and Brakfontein mine.  Is this 
interaction which you referred to during 2013 should in fact 
be dated June 2012 and onwards?  From June 2012 
onwards. 
DR NTETA:  In terms of the – that particular date why I am 
saying from June 2012 it was not exactly June 2012 I joined 
Eskom in June 2012. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
DR NTETA:  I cannot recall the exact date when Mr Bester 
requested that I engage with the supplier.  There were 
10 
several engagements that we had. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
DR NTETA:  So I am – I cannot tell you the exact date but I 
do believe that there are some emails with regards to that 
that we might get closer to the date. do believe that there 
are some emails with regards to that that we might get closer 
to the date. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Okay but is it correct that these 
engagements would have been based on an unsolicited if I 
may use that word which I see from your affidavit – an 
20 
unsolicited approach is made by Tegeta. 
DR NTETA:   Yes those engagements would have been from 
unsolicited approach made by Tegeta. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  From Tegeta.  So no… 
DR NTETA:  Yes. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 124 of 195 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  This was not an engagement. 
DR NTETA:  If I can … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Carry on. 
DR NTETA:  If I can just indicate before they were Tegeta I 
believe they were called I think it was Idwala but yes in 
terms of the – the gentleman that we engaged with from the 
organisation. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It was the same as the [00:01:48]. 
DR NTETA:  Yes and Mr Satish. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Satish. 
10 
DR NTETA:  Moodley. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So there was procurement process 
necessarily followed here? 
DR NTETA:  In terms of a tender that went out no. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No. 
DR NTETA:  But the – ja. In terms of a tender no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the time of your engagement at that 
stage were you aware that there had been no tender that had 
been advertised or that had gone out? 
DR NTETA:  Yes so at the time of my engagement yes I was 
20 
aware that there was no tender that had been issued.  In 
terms of our engagement within Eskom at the time we 
engaged with suppliers based on unsolicited offers.  So we 
would get suppliers coming through to us to indicate that 
they have a potential to supply us with coal and that is how 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 125 of 195 
 
we would engage them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you engaged them after they have 
made that approach to you unsolicited proposal would it be – 
would your engagement with them be on the basis that you 
are just exploring exactly what they have in mind but in due 
course a tender would be issued or was it understood that if 
it is an unsolicited proposal there would be no tender issued.  
You would discuss with them and if you reach agreement you 
conclude 
a 
agreement 
with 
them. 
 
What 
was 
your 
understanding and experience of how Eskom was dealing 
10 
with such proposals? 
DR NTETA:  My understanding and experience was that you 
would engage with suppliers to the point of conclusion into a 
coal supply agreement where they would supply us.  At that 
point there were – we did not go out on tender and we would 
– we would conclude agreements with suppliers based on 
unsolicited offers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was your experience and that was 
your understanding? 
DR NTETA:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it had happened with a number of 
unsolicited proposals made by different suppliers in the 
past? 
DR NTETA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Or maybe before we move 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 126 of 195 
 
on.  You may not have been a procurement person but I 
guess being at senior management level you – one should 
expect 
that 
you 
would 
know. 
 
Did 
you 
have 
any 
understanding as to what Eskom’s justification was for not 
going out on tender in such cases? 
DR NTETA:  So the justification that – that Eskom had with 
regards to the procurement of coal was based on a medium 
term mandate that was entered into in 2008 that said that the 
– we could then engage with suppliers in order to secure 
coal.  The reason – the rationale of the justification was that 
10 
in terms of getting coal the mandate was to secure it 
because of the lack of availability of this coal particularly the 
volumes that Eskom was looking for as well as the quality.  
So it was within the medium terms mandate and what we 
were requested to do periodically is to then provide the – the 
board tender committee with feedback in terms of how we 
are faring against this mandate that we had. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I can imagine that if supplier A 
approaches Eskom and says I have a mine from which I can 
supply you with coal.  I can image that obviously that coal – 
20 
that is their mine and that is their coal.  If there is nobody 
else who can supply you with coal there might – there might 
not be any issues about not going out on tender.  But I leave 
that aside for the time being.  But I can image that if 
somebody approaches you on the basis of an unsolicited 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 127 of 195 
 
proposal and seeks to conclude a coal agreement with you 
as Eskom and you do have a need for coal; you do want 
people who can supply you with – with coal there is no 
reason why as Eskom you cannot go out on tender let 
somebody else who might have – who might be able to 
tender or put in a bid – also put in a bid and this one can put 
in a bid as well and then you might either take both if your 
need is great or take the one that gives you the best offer.  
Are you able to say something on this thinking that I am 
having?  Because you as senior management. 
10 
DR NTETA:  With regard to the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You as senior manager you might be – you 
might have knowledge of the dynamics at Eskom that I might 
not know.  But I am just saying my immediate reaction is it 
does not look like there would be justification not to go out 
on tender because what if there is somebody else who can 
offer you coal at even a better price that you are not aware 
of and who has not put in an unsolicited proposal?  Do you 
want to say something on that? 
DR NTETA:  So – yes I can say something.  So the – the 
20 
2008 medium term mandate was a result of the – I want to 
call it an insatiable appetite that Eskom has for coal and 
having to look to secure it.  So at the time the thinking was 
that we should look at all mechanisms that are available to – 
to secure coal and which is why looking in terms of the 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 128 of 195 
 
speed in which we also secure coal which is why they had 
the mandate which was open for a large volume and it was a 
mandate that said as long as you are within this particular 
volume that they have put in as well as in terms of the 
pricing parameters then the primary energy head would then 
be authorised to conclude on the agreement.  So that was 
one of the mechanisms that was made available because of 
the – the coal requirement.  The second dynamic comes in in 
terms of the qualities that Eskom specifically looks for and 
so there could be a mine that does have that particular 
10 
quality or does not have that particular quality.  So it – we 
also would look in terms of those various parameters when 
looking to secure coal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well you will tell me if this is something 
that you – you would not be able to deal with because of the 
position you held.  But it seems to me that that mandate that 
you talk about could not authorise Eskom officials to do 
something that is unlawful.  If the law required that you go 
out on tender that is the law.  That is what you are supposed 
to do.  The board or somebody could not write a mandate 
20 
that says to the executives do not bother about the law; do 
not go out to tender when in circumstances where the law 
says go out on tender.  You understand what I mean? 
DR NTETA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that something you are able to say 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 129 of 195 
 
something on or is that something you are not able to say 
something on to try and make me understand why Eskom 
would not go on tender in these circumstances – would not 
go out on tender in these circumstances? 
DR NTETA:  I am – no I would not speak on that in terms of 
the legalities of that or the specific mandate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is alright.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Dr Nteta but the aspect 
is that the – the BTC mandate of 2008 was not specifically 
relied upon for the Brakfontein contract.  I see that you refer 
10 
to it when you deal with the pre-payment of the R659 million.  
So do you know for sure or are you now surmising as to that 
being the reason for why the Brakfontein contract was 
concluded? 
DR NTETA:  So the – the 2008 mandate looks in terms of the 
securing of coal of a specific volume and specific rand per 
ton – or rand per gigajoule and it would then – so for the 
Brakfontein contract it would be within that particular 
mandate.  Similarly for the – the pre-payment for the aspect 
of the security of the coal it would be within that particular 
20 
mandate in terms of that.  But when you then begin to talk to 
and I am going to assume that we will talk to that you talk to 
the aspects of the pre-pay – of the payment and the finances 
then that is a separate matter. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 130 of 195 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Seleka and Dr Nteta.  I am 
going back.  I want to go back to the issue that we were 
dealing with a few minutes ago.  Maybe I was being too soft 
on you to leave the issue where it was.  You might not be 
procurement 
person; 
you 
might 
not 
be 
qualified 
in 
procurement in terms of paper and so on I do not know.  But 
I would imagine that senior managers in any institution 
including Eskom would at least have some understanding of 
the basics of procurement so that even if they might not 
have deep knowledge of procurement procedures and so on 
10 
they would know at least is that before you conclude a 
contract with a supplier generally you are supposed – Eskom 
is supposed to go out on tender unless the situation falls 
within certain exceptions.  And if there are not sure they 
would ask procurement – the procurement unit or division 
within Eskom is it right that we should not go on tender – out 
on tender on this?  Because you would not as a senior 
manager want to involve yourself in a transaction where you 
might be accused of having breached procurement policies 
of Eskom or procurement laws that are binding on Eskom, is 
20 
it not?  You would have that kind of basic knowledge would 
you not? 
DR NTETA:   Yes I would have that basic knowledge. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NTETA:  So when looking at the medium terms mandate 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 131 of 195 
 
it is the – it was the practice within Eskom when looking to 
secure coal we would work towards that particular mandate 
for coal.  So I would say that at that time probably about 
80% of the transactions within the division were done within 
that particular mandate.  It was a ten year mandate open for 
that period. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did – did it – that is that mandate – did it 
specifically say that procurement policies or procedures 
need not be followed in those cases where there was an 
unsolicited proposal? 
10 
DR NTETA:  So I have not looked at the mandate recently 
but my understanding and recollection of that particular 
mandate it indicated in terms of what should be done with 
regards to concluding coal supply agreements.  So it would 
look in terms looking in terms of those qualities and in terms 
of also looking at the – the price and also it was quite 
specific about the volumes.  So it indicated what should be 
done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So… 
DR NTETA:  I think your question to me was that does that 
20 
particular mandate then override the – the laws of the 
country? 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the policies which I assume Eskom 
has in – had in relation to procurement which a lot of state 
owned entities had which require that the entity should go 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 132 of 195 
 
out on tender; should issue tenders unless the particular – a 
particular case falls within certain specified circumstances – 
exceptions. 
DR NTETA:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so… 
DR NTETA:  So the history of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja continue – continue. 
DR NTETA:  Sorry Sir.  So the history of the institution in 
terms where primary energy comes from it was a – in terms 
of the standalone unit that had its own managing director at 
10 
the time.   And that is where the – the policies and the 
procedures etcetera came from that in terms of this 
particular standalone unit has its unique nuances and 
therefore the procurement processes would be then dictated 
by – at the time it was that particular mandate.  But I – I am 
hesitant to get into the details because I would like to rather 
allow those who know better to talk about the – the history of 
that particular mandate where is comes from etcetera. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine. 
DR NTETA:  So the primary energy division did do its 
20 
procurement in a particular way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no that is fine but obviously what 
you are able to do is talk about what your own understanding 
was which may or may not be in line with what they will say 
is the – was the position.  But you certainly had your own 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 133 of 195 
 
understanding of how – what was supposed to be done and 
what was not supposed to be done.  Is that right? 
DR NTETA:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your own understanding you are saying 
was that with regard to unsolicited proposals there was to 
your knowledge no need or requirement to go out on 
competitive 
tender, 
is 
that 
right? 
 
That 
was 
your 
understanding. 
DR NTETA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
DR NTETA:  That was my understanding and that was the 
practice at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that was the practice at the time.   
DR NTETA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it is in line with your understanding of 
the mandate that you have talked about? 
DR NTETA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Dr Nteta well the 
mandate is not attached to your affidavit.  I know that you 
20 
have referred to it elsewhere in your affidavit but it is not 
attached.  I have had the opportunity to see that mandate 
and the question which the Chairperson is asking whether 
the mandate allowed the deviation from a procurement 
process that mandate you would have seen in fact it does 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 134 of 195 
 
not have the deviation from a procurement process.  The 
mandate contemplated the conclusion of medium term 
contracts.  You will recall that? 
DR NTETA:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  And the mandate did not envisage 
unsolicited offers.  So you had to determine as Eskom that 
you needed coal and then you could invoke that mandate. 
DR NTETA:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  There is a paragraph of particular 
interest in your affidavit which is on page – it starts on page 
10 
64. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka before you proceed.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can arrangements be made for me to see 
that mandate and for Dr Nteta to have access to it because I 
think we probably will not finish with her evidence today. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If we continue tomorrow she would be able 
to refresh her memory on what it says and maybe answers 
some questions tomorrow. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Indeed Chairperson.  Dr Nteta I was then 
referring to page 64 that paragraph on 5.2 – paragraph 5.2 
of your affidavit.  You talk about the reasons why you left 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 135 of 195 
 
Eskom in that paragraph.  You give a primary reason and you 
give what you say are secondary reasons.  Are you on that 
page 64 paragraph 5.2? 
DR NTETA:  Yes  Sir – yes I now am. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You are there.  Yes.  So the primary 
reason you said it was for you to study – to pursue your 
studies.  You see that? 
DR NTETA:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And then at a secondary level you give 
quite an extensive explanation there which the essence of 
10 
which is that you were essentially moving away from 
pressure being brought to bear on you by the executives to 
do certain things.  Speak to me. 
DR NTETA:  Yes so my affidavit indicates that my primary 
reason for leaving Eskom yes is to pursue my studies.  The 
secondary reason was that the area that I was within 
procurement which is the Primary Energy Division within 
Field Sourcing.  There was a lot of interest in terms of the 
transactions that were in that area from my superiors up until 
board level and at the time there had been a new board that 
20 
was entering within Eskom and what I noted in terms of the 
new board that came in there still seemed to be the same 
interest in terms of coal transactions and I just felt that I did 
not want to partake in it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So the interest you are referring to are 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 136 of 195 
 
you able to explain to the Chairperson what you mean by 
that? 
DR NTETA:  So with regards to interest in terms of coal 
transactions throughout my tenure at Eskom I would be 
asked about specific transactions as to how far we are within 
negotiations; how far we are within concluding.  We from the 
Field Sourcing department are required to put together 
documents that go to the board tender committee so I would 
be asked questions in terms of those – you know various 
transactions at different times.  And in my opinion I just felt 
10 
that  
1. My level within the organisation I should not be asked 
those questions.  There are people who are more 
senior to me who should be asked those questions. 
2. And secondly that in terms of my level I do the 
transactions and so I did not want to continue to – to 
have that kind of pressure. 
I was hopeful with the entering board that it would be 
different and it was not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Now are you able to tell the 
20 
Chairperson whether or not in the conclusion of the 
Brakfontein contract did you have the same experience of 
pressure being brought to bear on you or interest being 
shown in this contract? 
DR NTETA:  Yes I did. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 137 of 195 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So you did have the same experience? 
DR NTETA:  I had – yes.  There was questions I was being 
asked to report in to my immediate manager in terms of 
where the transaction was.  I had to report in.  The last 
negotiations that we had my immediate manager joined into 
those particular negotiations.  That was the last and final 
negotiation before the conclusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I imagine that your immediate supervisor 
or manager would not be one of the people that you were 
concerned about in terms of asking you questions about 
10 
transactions that you were doing because obviously your 
immediate manager or supervisor is entitled to ask you to 
see what progress you are making and maybe if he or she 
thinks the progress is slow to push you to try and conclude 
the transaction as soon as possible.  You accept that? 
DR NTETA:  I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I suspect that the people – the pressure 
that you are talking about which you seem to have found 
unacceptable would come from other people you are not 
talking about with your immediate manager.  You are talking 
20 
about pressure that was directed at you or questions that 
were being put to you or inquiries by other people, is that 
correct? 
DR NTETA:  Correct.  So with regard to the conclusion of the 
particular transaction with Brakfontein yes I would get 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 138 of 195 
 
questions from my immediate manager and the frequency of 
the feedback that I had to give was weekly.  I also would 
have to provide that same feedback to my managers’ 
immediate manager in terms of the progress in terms of that 
particular transaction.  We as a department Primary Energy 
Department were also called in to a meeting and it was only 
our department by our chairperson who spoke in general 
about our – how we are interacting with our suppliers which I 
also felt was inappropriate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And… 
10 
DR NTETA:  I am providing you with examples. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you refer to your chairperson are 
you talking about the chairperson of the board of Eskom at 
the time? 
DR NTETA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who would that have been at the time? 
DR NTETA:  Mr Tsotsi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Tsotsi.  Okay.  So let me go back to 
getting more clarification.  The people who were putting 
pressure that you found unacceptable on you would some of 
20 
them have been members of the board of Eskom? 
DR NTETA:  So the – the member of – so this particular 
transaction for Brakfontein is that the question Sir? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I am still at general level.  You said you 
– the secondary reason why you left Eskom was because of 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 139 of 195 
 
pressure that was being brought upon you in various 
transactions.  So I am talking at a general level, at this 
stage.  
DR NTETA:   Okay thanks.  Thank you for that clarity.  At a 
general level, on coal transactions, the main – in terms of 
the chairman of the board – I gave an example of them 
calling us in and discussing in terms of our – how we engage 
in terms of our – the suppliers and that you get board level.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
DR NTETA:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
DR NTETA:   So.  Ja.  It should – maybe at that level.  But 
that also be within the executives. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It would all – pressure would also come 
from within the executives, other than your immediate 
manager. 
DR NTETA:   Other than my immediate manager, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Obviously, you regarded this 
pressure as not legitimate.  Is that right? 
DR NTETA:   I regarded the pressure as, that it is not 
20 
required. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
DR NTETA:   And it is not necessary. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
DR NTETA:   Why I say so, is that, whether the medium-term 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 140 of 195 
 
mandate is right or wrong.  We have a process that we 
follow. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
DR NTETA:   And I provide the feedback to my immediate 
boss. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
DR NTETA:   He – as you have indicated, if he thought I was 
working too slow, he would let me know, et cetera. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
DR NTETA:   But I just felt that if I have to give feedback 
10 
every week on the transactions and me dealing with quite a 
few transactions, then I am providing more – the work that I 
am doing is providing more feedback than actually attending 
to the transactions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
DR NTETA:   And I thought that was inappropriate.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   Thank you, Chairperson.  Dr Nteta, 
your immediate boss was Mr Johan Bester? 
DR NTETA:   Correct. 
20 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   Is that correct? 
DR NTETA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA (SC):   So providing feedback to him would be 
in order.  Then you have mentioned the executives who 
would put pressure on you.  Do you mind telling the 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 141 of 195 
 
Chairperson, the ones that comes to your mind in this 
regard? 
DR NTETA:   So for example.  Mr Johan Bester reported to 
the senior manager for Primary Energy.  And I would give 
feedback to that senior general manager for Primary Energy.  
And I felt that it is not required because I do have an 
immediate boss and should he require information, he should 
receive it from there. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   Who was the Senior GM, Primary 
Energy at the time, 2012/2013? 
10 
DR NTETA:   It was Mr Mboweni.  
ADV SELEKA (SC):   I have seen the affidavit of Mr Bester.  
When talking specifically about Brakfontein contract, he 
details the time period taken prior to this contract concluded 
on the 10t h of March.  So, as you quite correctly say, the 
engagement with Tegeta or the approach by Tegeta dates 
back to 2012.  2012 ...[intervenes]  
DR NTETA:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   Thank you.  2012, 2013, 2014.  That is 
three years.  And only in March 2012... 2015, was the 
20 
contract concluded.  He ...[intervenes]  
DR NTETA:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   He says...  Sorry, just repeat your 
answer. 
DR NTETA:   That is correct. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 142 of 195 
 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   Correct.  Thank you.  He says then, 
during that time, even though you were reporting to him, he 
observed that you were being requested by persons like 
Mr Mboweni, Mr Amabeleni(?) [00:04:41] and Mr Matshela 
Koko to report directly to them.  What is your comment on 
that? 
DR NTETA:   Yes.  So as I have indicated.  The weekly 
report that I had to write was to Mr Mboweni. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   Yes. 
DR NTETA:   And – at his request.  And I would then copy 
10 
Mr Bester because I wanted him to know that I am seeing 
these reports and I also informed Mr Bester that I had been 
requested to provide weekly feedback in terms of the 
transaction.  The progress on the transaction. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   Yes, but he specifically says, he had 
concerns that you had to be asked to report directly to 
Mr Koko in regard to this Brakfontein negotiations.  Your 
comment. 
DR NTETA:   I...  Ja, I did not report directly to Mr Koko with 
regards to the Brakfontein negotiations.  I think what 
20 
Mr Bester – I have not seen his affidavit.  I think what he is 
referring to is that, at the negotiations that we had with 
Brakfontein.   
 
I did receive a call from Mr Koko where he asked me 
where Mr Bester was.  And I went to Mr Bester and told him 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 143 of 195 
 
that Mr Koko is looking for him during those – when we were 
in those negotiations.   
ADV SELEKA (SC):   So he testified in the first phase of the 
Commission.  I will provide you with his affidavit but there is 
a passage in his affidavit where he says: 
“I always knew that there was interest in the Tegeta 
Platform contract from higher up.” 
 
So that seems to resonate with what you said earlier.   
“Even since 2012, a significant pressure and focus 
came from the start of 2015.  Brakfontein by then 
10 
had it water use license and we had run out of legal 
excuses to keep betting them away.   
From the beginning of 2015, we had to provide 
Mr Matshela Koko with weekly progress report.   
Also, I suspected, that Mr Koko was engaging 
Ms Ayanda Nteta directly although she reported to 
me.  He never directly put pressure on me but he did 
on her.” 
 
Your comment on that? 
DR NTETA:   So with regards to that.  I do not know where 
20 
my reports went, my weekly reports went to. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   H’m. 
DR NTETA:   So Mr Bester would be better – he would be 
better able to advice as to where those particular reports 
went to.  I know that I sent my reports to him and to mister – 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 144 of 195 
 
to the senior general manager which is Johan Bester.  Where 
they would go further, I do not know. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   H’m.  But can you say in regard to 
putting pressure, where you experienced that pressure was 
been brought today on you by Mr Matshela Koko? 
DR NTETA:   Not with regards to that particular transaction. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   Okay.  Mr Bester continues, and as I 
have said, I will provide you with his affidavit. 
DR NTETA:   H’m, h’m. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   In another paragraph, he says: 
10 
“I realised later that Mr Koko and his handlers had 
two games running each with their own timelines. 
The primary run was to get rid of Finance Director, 
Ms Tsholofelo Molefe and Group Capital Executive, 
Mr Dan Marokane. 
In hindsight, it made sense why we came under such 
pressure from Mr Koko and Mr Mboweni, as those 
pulling the strings needed to effect the suspension 
of the four executives including Mr Koko as a ruse.” 
 
In brackets he puts [as a ruse against the name of Mr 
20 
Koko]. 
“And the Brakfontein contract was taken longer than 
they had anticipated, and I guess they were worried 
that without Mr Koko they would not be able to apply 
any leverage over PED, which is Primary Energy. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 145 of 195 
 
It is well-documented that the contract was signed 
on 10 March 2015 and that Mr Koko was suspended 
on 11 March 2015, the next day after the contract 
was signed but few have joined the dots.” 
 
So you understand the message he is conveying?  So 
from 2015, he says pressure was brought to bear to have 
this Brakfontein contract concluded as soon as possible.   
 
Because now when he reflects back, he can see that 
okay those who were putting pressure, they would have 
realised that without Mr Koko, the contract may not be 
10 
concluded.  You follow the reasoning? 
DR NTETA:  Yes, I do. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   Do you have any comment on that? 
DR NTETA:   My comment is that, as I have indicated to the 
final negotiation that we had was when Mr Bester joined the 
negotiation and that was final.  
 
At the time, I had just thought he felt I was taking too 
long and that is why he joined because he wanted to 
conclude the agreement.   
 
So he and ...[indistinct - 00:11:17] and Mr Mboweni 
20 
would have tried to shield me from the pressure that they 
were receiving.  So they would ask me to do those weekly 
reports of which I did to them. 
 
As I have indicated to you.  I do not know where they 
went – where those reports went to after that. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 146 of 195 
 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   I see.  Now just ...[intervenes]  
DR NTETA:   But I understand his reasoning. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   Yes.  Bu you say they – he would have 
tried to shield you from the pressure? 
DR NTETA:   I will assume so.  As he is my direct manager, 
he would try and do that. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   Just the one ...[intervenes]  
DR NTETA:   So he is... 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   Go ahead. 
DR NTETA:   Sorry/ 
10 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   Just go ahead. 
DR NTETA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA (SC):   You may proceed. 
DR NTETA:   No, I said I will assume that he would have 
done that.  So your statement that you have read to me, say 
that Primary Energy was getting pressure from outside of 
Primary Energy.   
 
The pressure that I was feeling and received was within 
Primary Energy from Mr Bester as well as from Mr Mboweni 
who I had within.  So they would have received it elsewhere 
20 
and filtered and then asked me to do those weekly reports. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   Ja.  But we are going that line because 
we thought you could also tell the Chairperson more about 
what you are saying in that paragraph 5.2 as your secondary 
reason for leaving, that you experienced pressure from the 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 147 of 195 
 
executives and the board members.  So we were seeking to 
have you say more to the Chairperson on that.  
DR NTETA:   Yes.  So the Chairperson had asked me to talk 
about it in general of which I did.  So the events leading to 
the conclusion of the Brakfontein contract.  As I have 
indicated, was having to provide constant feedback.   
 
Other events that happened were.  Primary Energy, as a 
whole, was called into a meeting by the Eskom chairperson.  
I thought that was unprecedented.  So those are the kind of 
pressure that I felt that as we deal with the coal transaction 
10 
are unnecessary. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   Let me read just the last passage from 
Mr Johan Bester’s affidavit.  He says: 
“The medium mandate had worked well until then.” 
 
And I suppose he is talking about the 2008 mandate for 
medium-term ...[intervenes]  
DR NTETA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   Yes. 
“It worked well until then.  And in fact, I still 
believed that even the Brakfontein contract was 
20 
valid and properly negotiated and although entered 
into under pressure, did not compromise Eskom. 
Eskom was compromised when Mr Koko suspended 
those trying to implement the conditions of the 
contract. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 148 of 195 
 
The system was not broken.  People like Mr Koko 
tried to compromise the system that was in place.  
And 
people 
like 
Mr 
Mboweni 
appeared 
to 
be 
powerless to push back. 
Interestingly, in this instance, Mr Mboweni signed.  
He was probably told to do so to ensure that validity 
of the contract would not be questioned.” 
 
You may comment if you have any comment in regard to 
the first part which I read about the system not being broken 
but that Mr Matshela Koko tried to compromise the system 
10 
that was in place.  Whether you have any knowledge of this 
and people being suspended? 
DR NTETA:   I will agree with Mr Bester in terms of the 
medium-term mandate because I do believe that it served 
Eskom well.  And that particular agreement fell within that 
medium-term mandate. 
 
With regards to the suspension of executives, et cetera.  
I will not comment because I really did not follow that entity.  
So I would rather not comment on it. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   I see.  Thank you. 
20 
DR NTETA:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   So the contract is concluded, the 
Brakfontein contract concluded on the 10t h of March 2015.  
You say you would have interactions with the Gupta’s.  In 
particular here, you specifically mention Mr Tony Gupta after 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 149 of 195 
 
the conclusion of that contract. 
DR NTETA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   Now please relate to the Chairperson 
how those interactions came about, how many were they and 
what did they entail? 
DR NTETA:   Okay.  So the interactions.  And why I say it 
was after the conclusion of the agreement because the first 
interaction, I was actually requested by Mr Rabindranath who 
is the 
CEO 
of the 
organisation.  
We 
would engage 
...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   The CEO of which organisation? 
DR NTETA:   Oh, sorry.  Of Tegeta. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  H’m. 
DR NTETA:   Sorry.  So he had requested that I meet with 
him to discuss – at the time, we were discussing the volumes 
because the agreement that was put in place had a ramp-up 
of the volumes based on the mind being able to produce the 
coal.  
 
So at the time, we were discussing in terms of that 
particular ramp-up of the agreement.  So he requested a 
20 
meeting with myself to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on.  Hang on Dr Nteta.  Hang on. 
DR NTETA:   Yes? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Your interactions with Mr Tony Gupta, did 
they happen after the conclusion of the Brakfontein contract 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 150 of 195 
 
or not? 
DR NTETA:   Yes, they did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or some was – happened before and 
others after? 
DR NTETA:   It was after. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They happened after the conclusion of the 
Brakfontein contract? 
DR NTETA:   Yes.  Yes, it happened in the execution of the 
contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In the execution of the contract? 
10 
DR NTETA:   After. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  In that event, Mr Seleka.  We need 
to cover the evidence up to the conclusion of the contract.  I 
was seeing that in her affidavit it appears that up to 
paragraph 6.16 which is at page 69... 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Unless I have missed something.  I seem 
to not have seen where before that part she talks about the 
singing of that contract, I see that at 6.16, she says...   
ADV SELEKA (SC):   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   SA was signed by Mr Mboweni on 
10 March 2015.  Is that the Brakfontein one? 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   That is 6.16. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  If I have missed something – maybe I 
have – but I would like the evidence of the discussions and 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 151 of 195 
 
the negotiations and the happenings that preceded the 
conclusion of the contract to be covered. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that we know this is how the contract 
got to be concluded. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then if we then deal with the 
execution 
of the contract 
and what 
happened in the 
connection with the execution of the contract, we can then 
deal with that.  Then we know that it is after the conclusion 
10 
of the contract. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   Thank you, Chairperson.  Dr Nteta, you 
follow? 
DR NTETA:   I follow. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   Yes. 
DR NTETA:   I am concerned because I thought you were 
dealing with that pre-payment but I will respond to the 
questions to the best of my memory. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  You know, there is reference to – we 
have had some discussion about the conclusion of the 
20 
Brakfontein contract.  And it seems to me to be left hanging.  
But both the evidence leader and yourself doctor, you would 
know more about the background to the affidavit.  Both of 
you can alert me to something that I might have missed. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   Yes. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 152 of 195 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But for the story and the evidence to be 
easy to follow, it is much better if we say this is what 
happened, the contract was concluded and then where the 
pre-payment fits in.  Then, obviously, that can be dealt with 
where it should be dealt with.  Mr Seleka, you will tell me if 
there is something I have missed. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   No, Chair.  I think you have not missed 
anything Chair but you are correct that we have not given 
the Chairperson the details as set out in Dr Nteta’s affidavit 
in regard to the Brakfontein contract.   
10 
 
Dr Nteta, maybe we could go into the detail insofar as 
you set them out in your affidavit because they are there in 
your affidavit.  So.  And that starts on page 65 of your 
affidavit.  Just by way of a guidance, under paragraph 6.   
 
Indeed I had certain questions to ask you in regard to 
the progress and exchanges made during the negotiations 
stages.  So what we have established from you is that the 
negotiations or the approach by Tegeta would have taken 
place back in June 2012.   
 
So Tegeta would have come to Eskom and said:  We 
20 
would like to offer coal to Eskom.  Correct?  Supply coal to 
Eskom. 
DR NTETA:   Yes.  So the engagements with Tegeta 
preceded myself.  They came to Eskom and they engaged 
with – and please excuse me, I think there are emails to this 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 153 of 195 
 
regard.  They dealt with various seniors within Eskom prior 
to my engagement.  I just cannot recall the exact date.   
ADV SELEKA (SC):   So prior to you being employed at 
Eskom? 
DR NTETA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   In fact, Tegeta had already approached 
Eskom to supply coal to them. 
DR NTETA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   When you did ...[intervenes]  
DR NTETA:   Yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   When you became employed at Eskom 
in June 2012, you became engaged in the – what is it – 
interactions or negotiations that were already ongoing. 
DR NTETA:   So.  Yes.  So prior to my employ at Eskom, 
Tegeta had been involved with various people.  Apologies, 
that I just cannot get specific – all the specific names.   
ADV SELEKA (SC):   Ja? 
DR NTETA:   I joined in Eskom late – not as in terms of the 
date that I joined, then when I asked to look at Tegeta.  I 
joined Eskom and I am going to estimate, perhaps six to ten 
20 
months after I had joined Eskom, Mr Bester then asked me to 
lead 
the 
negotiations 
with 
regards 
to 
this 
particular 
transaction. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   I see.  That engagement is what you 
deal with in paragraph 6.3 of your affidavit on page 65. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 154 of 195 
 
DR NTETA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   You say ...[intervenes]  
DR NTETA:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   ...during 2013. 
DR NTETA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   So during 3013: 
“I, together with representatives from inter alia, the 
Technical 
Environmental 
and 
Coal 
Operations 
Department 
within 
PED 
and 
the 
Eskom 
Legal 
Department 
engaged 
primarily 
with 
10 
Mr Rabindranath.” 
 
So we had read that passage. 
DR NTETA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   And they were proposing to offer 
Eskom coal from two mines, Vierfontein and Brakfontein.   
DR NTETA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   Vierfontein did not succeed.  Only 
Brakfontein remained on the table as of that date.   
DR NTETA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA (SC):   Just speak to the mic. 
20 
DR NTETA:   Yes.  So at the – my first engagements with the 
supplier, they had indicated they had two offers.  The 
Vierfontein, why we did not progress with that because in 
terms of one of the requirements for the conclusion of an 
agreement is that the source has a water-use license.   
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 155 of 195 
 
 
So if my memory serves me correctly.  The Vierfontein 
was further back in terms of that application for a water-use 
licence.  And that is why we did not continue with this 
because the Brakfontein source was further along in terms of 
the application.   
 
There could have been other environmental issues that 
the Environmental Team may have brought up which I cannot 
recall at this time. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   Yes.  You, in fact, do refer to 
environmental issues in regard to Vierfontein.  In the last 
10 
sentence of your paragraph 6.3 but that is on page 66. 
DR NTETA:   Okay.  Okay, yes. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   Well, talking of the water-use license.  
That is P-66 Chairperson, the top paragraph.  Talking of the 
water-use license.  In 2012 and 2013, Tegeta also did not 
have a license in regard – a water-use license in regard to 
the Brakfontein Mine.   
DR NTETA:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   Could you have concluded a contract 
with them at that stage? 
20 
DR NTETA:   No.  So in terms of what we were doing, in 
terms of unsolicited offers, we would engage with various 
suppliers and we would have advised them in terms of the 
requirements for the conclusion of an agreement.   
 
So because – particularly when it is new sources, there 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 156 of 195 
 
are a lot of things that would happen and the negotiations, 
generally, take about 18 to 24-months, unfortunately.  And 
we recognised it in that – at that time, a water-use licence 
would take about 18 to 24-months.   
 
So we would engage with various suppliers on aspects in 
terms of their coal, et cetera.  There are also options in 
terms of the environmental issues if they do a box cut and 
we get coal.  In terms of – from the box cut, there are certain 
requirements that would not be as a full blown mine.   
 
So we would engage with suppliers.  At some point, and 
10 
there is a memo which I would ask them at Eskom to find, 
where the senior general manager then indicated that from 
this point onwards that we should ensure that we do actually 
– that we conclude only agreements with them.   
 
So to answer in a longwinded way.  We would engage 
suppliers even if they did not have a water-use license but 
we would not conclude an agreement. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   Yes.  And that engagement with the 
supplier who does not have a water-use license, I mean, 
what would it entail? 
20 
DR NTETA:   So the engagement.  We would be looking in 
terms of the quality that we have.  We would look in terms of 
the pricing that they have to offer.  We would also look in 
terms of the – a potential legal agreement, that we would 
look at – so there would be quite a few engagements, 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 157 of 195 
 
different aspects.   
 
We would also remind them that they need to – we also 
would ask for progress in terms of how far they are in terms 
of the water-use license and remind them that they will need 
to have it. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   You know ...[intervenes]  
DR NTETA:   Previously, we would actually conclude 
agreements without a water-use license. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   Yes.  When you talk about negotiations 
will take 18 to 24-months.  I am reminded of the tender 
10 
process that was ongoing in April 2016 where – and that was 
in respect of the Amot Power Station, supply to Amot Power 
Station.   
DR NTETA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA (SC):   In April when the question was asked 
how long was that process going to take.  You say you 
responded to ...[indistinct] members on a teleconference 
that it will be completed in September 2016. 
DR NTETA:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which is much less than six months. 
20 
DR NTETA:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So how do we understand – how 
should we understand your explanations? 
DR NTETA:   So one of the things that I tried to do when I 
was acting general manager for fuel sourcing was one, to 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 158 of 195 
 
institute issuing out of tenders and to then have – to try 
and get a more robust process in terms of the tendering 
process and requirements and to try and streamline it so 
that it takes a much shorter time and that is why we were 
able then to then – I was able then to say we had 
anticipated to be concluded in terms of September. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So are you saying that explanation 
would 
apply 
in 
2011, 
that 
a 
shorter 
time 
period 
…[intervenes] 
DR NTETA:   No, that is – no, so that explanation would 
10 
not have applied in 2011 because the process at the time 
was looking one, in terms of what the requirements were, 
were different.   
And so two, it was looking in terms of an unsolicited 
offer where the supplies then indicated that we needed x, 
y, z but the practice of what would happen is that we would 
indicate to the supplier that we need x, y and z, the 
supplier would then go away and we would not actually 
give them any timeline, they would come back to us within 
30 days or something like that.  We would actually just wait 
20 
for the suppliers to come back and some of them took two 
to three months and then they would come back once they 
were able to rectify an element that we would ask them to 
rectify. 
So the process in going out on the tender, we really 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 159 of 195 
 
tried to – we tried to streamline it and try and do it more 
efficiently and effectively. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, I would have thought where you 
are approached by one supplier, unsolicited, they have all 
the information, that would be a more expedited process 
than when you go through a tender process. 
DR NTETA:   It could be if the supplier then came back 
timeously but the general practice is that the suppliers, 
some suppliers would come back in two weeks, three 
weeks, other suppliers would come back in three months 
10 
and we would leave it open for them to come back when 
they are ready. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NTETA:   Whereas in a tender you have to submit 
everything by a certain time and we were quite stringent in 
terms of what are the requirements that we want them to 
continue what we were evaluating to try and make it more 
efficient. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, we are at four o’clock now.  
Sometimes we will work until late but it does not help to 
20 
work until late if later in the week we are going to have 
days that might not be used.  So what is the position with 
regard to other witnesses tomorrow and beyond? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, I believe Mr Koko is coming 
tomorrow. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 160 of 195 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He will take us the whole day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Have 3.3 notices in regard to his 
evidence been sorted out? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Not yet, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if 3.3 notices have not been sorted 
out, how are we going to proceed with his evidence? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair.  I attended speaking to the 
Chairperson about it so that I could also communicate if 
…[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let us talk about it when they are 
here tomorrow because they are affected. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And after that, the next witness and 
beyond, what is the position? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   On Wednesday we had scheduled Mr 
Anoj Singh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Anoj Singh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I had a meeting with his attorney and 
counsel I think last week.  Last week Friday, Chair.  There 
is a default of filing an affidavit on his part, they want to 
regularise that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They want? 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 161 of 195 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   They want to regularise that and 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why have they not filed it up to now?  
As I understand there was a 10.6 directive. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Absolutely, Chair.  I have written to 
them a letter, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Setting 
out 
the 
position 
and 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I guess with regard to him there are 
10 
no 3.3 issues, there are no Rule 3.3 issues with regard to 
him because I take it most of the time he is implicated and 
he is responding to that or what is the position. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, we have not seen his affidavit, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no I mean from your side. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are not able to say there are 
problems with 3.3 notices because there is nothing you 
were supposed to serve on other people. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So he has been …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Summoned. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He has been served with a summons. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 162 of 195 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   For Wednesday. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   For Wednesday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Therefore he should be here and when 
he is here he is going to need to explain why he did not 
comply with the 10.6 directive. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I have indicated that much to his legal 
representative, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so he must be here and he will need 
to explain that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that seems to be fine with regard to 
him. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And from what I remember, the deadline 
by when he was supposed to furnish an affidavit in terms of 
the 10.6 directive has long passed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That that was the 4 September, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it is completely unacceptable.  Well, 
he will need to take the stand here and explain.  So that is 
fine for Wednesday. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And how – he could be long in terms of 
his evidence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson, the way I have planned 
him is to be one day – a full one day with them. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 163 of 195 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but would he – or, by the way, he 
would cover Eskom only. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he would not cover Transnet, he 
would have to come back for Transnet. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But your estimate is that one day would 
be enough for him. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It should be enough, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright.  And then Friday? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then Thursday, before Friday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, Thursday, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Thursday then we have Ms 
Mosilo and [indistinct] 07.58.  We have also scheduled Ms 
Matsietsi Mokholo. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then Friday is Mr Brian Molefe. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  And with regard to Brian 
Molefe, 
who 
much 
time 
have 
you 
considered 
to 
be 
adequate?  Is it a one day also with him? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   One day but shorter than a full day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, shorter than a full day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, now persons who implicated Mr 
Anoj Singh and Mr Brian Molefe, have they been given 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 164 of 195 
 
whatever affidavits – I know you said Mr Anoj Singh has 
not filed an affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I know that Mr Brian Molefe did file 
affidavits, I think.  Have they been given to the witnesses 
who implicated them and have those witnesses commented 
on their version? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Brian Molefe’s affidavit – Chair, I 
cannot recall offhand.  I know we have exchanged the 
affidavit of Mr Koko certainly and we would have also 
10 
exchanged the written submission of Mr Anoj Singh at the 
Parliamentary Portfolio Committee with the witnesses.  In 
regard to Mr Brian Molefe, I cannot recall offhand and I 
know that he does not implicate people, as such but 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, he might not implicate them but they 
might have something to say about his version. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Insofar as he mentions them, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But I think I have exchanged his 
20 
affidavit with Ms Suzanne Daniels, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you must check. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because the best scenario is where you 
have got all the information when the witness takes the 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 165 of 195 
 
stand. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Well, in that event, I think we 
should continue at least with this witness until five. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Five, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then we take it from there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Dr Nteta, we are going to 
10 
continue until five o’clock, is that alright with you? 
DR NTETA:   That is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  So Dr Nteta, 
we were – you were explaining the time period it takes to 
negotiate this agreement and I was saying to you that it 
seems to me that if a supplier comes to you unsolicited, 
the process might be expeditious as opposed to when you 
follow 
a 
tender 
process 
but 
you 
have 
given 
your 
explanation.  Can I ask you this because you seem to have 
20 
given two different answers.  One the one hand when I ask 
you whether could you conclude an agreement with Tegeta 
in respect of Brakfontein if they did not have a water use 
licence?  You said no but then you gave an explanation, 
subsequently you said in the past you did conclude 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 166 of 195 
 
agreements with suppliers who did not have a water use 
licence.  So which answer applies? 
DR NTETA:   Mr Seleka, when I said we, I said Eskom have 
concluded agreements with suppliers without a water use 
licence.  There was an memo or a directive that was sent 
through by the senior general manager at the time that 
indicated that we must ensure that a supplier has a water 
using licence and that was in the time of the engagements 
with Brakfontein.  So, I  - we did that – for Brakfontein we 
could not have concluded the coal supply agreement 
10 
unless they had a valid water use licence, were able to 
produce it. 
 ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, I understand.  So at a time of 
the Brakfontein negotiations a new dispensation was 
introduced. 
DR NTETA:   Yes.  Yes, a new dispensation was 
introduced.  However – yes.    
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  So in that dispensation you 
were precluded from concluding a coal supply with a 
supplier who did not have a water use licence. 
20 
DR NTETA:   Who was not able to produce one, yes.  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Because without... 
DR NTETA:   Yes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes because without the water use 
licence they are precluded from mining.  They cannot mine.  
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 167 of 195 
 
DR NTETA:   I do not want to answer that because that is 
on the environmental side because I think they can mine 
on a box cut but I am really not an expert to the extent of 
that, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In those cases where in the past Eskom 
did conclude coal supply agreements with suppliers who 
did not have a water use licence do you know whether it 
would have been a condition of the agreement that they 
obtain such a licence?  Or, as you understand it, the 
10 
position was that that would not be a condition to say that 
they must obtain a water use licence within a certain a 
period and if they did not get it then the agreement would 
fall away? 
DR NTETA:   That is my understanding but I am not 
confident on that understanding because I personally did 
not do it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
DR NTETA:   But I would make an assumption that it would 
be a condition. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NTETA:   That you must have it within a certain period. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  So you personally 
have no experience concluding a contract with a supplier 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 168 of 195 
 
who did not have a water use licence? 
DR NTETA:   Not that I am aware of. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You personally.  Okay.  Now, let us go 
through this period of negotiations in respect of the 
Brakfontein.  I am on page 66 of your affidavit.  66. 
DR NTETA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now there is an aspect I want to raise 
with 
you 
during 
this 
negotiation 
period 
because 
in 
November 2014 you say you send an email to Tegeta and 
that email attached the supply agreement.    
10 
DR NTETA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now maybe you can explain because 
at his stage of the negotiations Tegeta has not obtained a 
water use licence and you have a memorandum that you 
have referred to which introduces a new dispensation that 
you cannot conclude a contract with a supplier who does 
not have a water use licence.  So can you explain to the 
Chairperson why did you provide them with a coal supply 
agreement 
at 
a 
time 
when 
you 
are 
precluded 
from 
concluding a contract with them?   
20 
DR NTETA:   So the practice at Eskom is that particularly 
for suppliers that have not engaged with Primary Energy 
and have not seen our coal supply agreement would be to 
send them a copy of the coal supply agreement so that 
they have an opportunity  to view it, provide comment on it 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 169 of 195 
 
and if there are issues that they believe would be a 
concern, they are able to raise it and then it also becomes 
part of the negotiation process because the process in 
terms of concluding a supply agreement, as I have 
indicated, can sometimes take 18 months, 12 to 18 months.  
We try and do as much as possible in parallel.   
So the email that I would have sent to them would 
have been a copy of a draft coal supply agreement.  I 
stand to be corrected but I do believe in my email I do 
indicate to them that it does not – you have nice legal 
10 
words, but it does not constitute an agreement and so I did 
put a disclaimer in that email but it was an opportunity for 
them to have a look at that agreement.   
We do that with suppliers that do not – have not 
engaged and do not know our terms and conditions 
because our supply agreements are about 65 pages. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NTETA:   Eskom’s supply agreements are 65 pages. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, the events leading to the 
signing of the agreement that she, Dr Nteta, deals with in 
20 
her affidavit, you would know how important they are. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
DR NTETA:   To be covered on by way of oral evidence.  If 
there is no particular significance to them, things like Mr 
Bester took over the chairing of a certain meeting and so 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 170 of 195 
 
on, we can move on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if they have a particular significance 
which emerges later then that is fine.  So I know that I said 
we have not covered the conclusion of the Brakfontein 
contract but you would understand this in terms of some of 
these things better.  If there is no significance then just put 
in 
there 
just 
to 
indicate 
what 
happened 
before 
the 
conclusion of the contract then you do not need to dwell on 
them. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, Chair, thank you.  I understand 
fully what the Chairperson is conveying to me.  Dr Nteta, 
on this very point I am at, the email that you sent, did you 
send it on your own accord or were you told to send this 
email? 
DR NTETA:   I would have sent it on my own accord so that 
they can be aware of the agreement because I have done 
that before.  When you supply them, you do that for new 
suppliers. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see you also talk about tests that 
20 
were conducted in respect of the coal that was to be 
supplied by Tegeta.  Can you recall what the test results 
were because I do not see it in your affidavit. 
DR NTETA:   I think there were several tests that were 
done with several reports but the members of the technical 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 171 of 195 
 
team would be better placed to talk to those tests because 
that would be their responsibility. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
DR NTETA:   So I think there was a queue stand done, 
there were several tests. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Then the water use licence was 
only granted in December 2014 and Mr Johan Bester said 
thereafter there was pressure brought to bear at least on 
him.  He thinks there was also pressure on you but you 
have explained yourself.  Then in 2015, talking of 2015 – 
10 
and I am now on page 68 of your affidavit – there is a 
request you refer to for Tegeta to be registered as a vendor 
but 
even 
at 
that 
stage 
Tegeta 
has 
not 
signed 
the 
agreement of Eskom.  Do you recall that? 
DR NTETA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Because now things seems to move 
fairly fast after they have obtained a water licence.  In fact 
it took only less than three months for that agreement to 
be concluded on the 10 March 2015.  Before I go into that, 
can you explain, if you know, what was the delay from 2012 
20 
to March 2015, for three years?    
DR NTETA:   I can only talk to - you know, I can only talk 
to the period that I was engaged with them and I would say 
really the major delay, which is an issue when we have 
unsolicited is that we would discuss certain elements with 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 172 of 195 
 
a particular supplier and they would then go away and 
attend to those issues.  They would then come back to us 
when they are ready to do so.  So at times – and I think 
there are some minutes that I attempted to do, you would 
see that there is a month or two delay where the supplier 
is attending to something or other and that is the main 
reason why it takes long because the suppliers normally 
take a while to come back to us. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja and I am grappling to understand – 
go ahead? 
10 
DR NTETA:   So – and I am talking to the time when I was 
engaged with them.  Prior to that I think they came to 
Eskom in 2011, I stand to be corrected.  I do not know what 
the delay was. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Yes, no, correct, we are taking 
your engagement from 2012, is it not, after June 2012. 
DR NTETA:   20 – ja, I think 2013, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  And I am grappling to understand 
what are these issues because you only gave them a copy 
of the draft agreement in November 2014.  I mean this is 
20 
where, if you like, serious engagement takes place and 
they will go home and look at the draft, do comments and 
so on and so forth and then come back to you and we can 
see it is a short period of space from November 2014 to 10 
March when the agreement was signed.  It is about four 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 173 of 195 
 
months. 
DR NTETA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So what was the delay for three years?    
DR NTETA:   So the delay would be a few things, as I have 
indicated, and if you look at some of the minutes you might 
say to them – some of the delay also is from our – from 
Eskom’s side where we were doing combustion tests and 
that takes a bit of some time.  It could be that for whatever 
reason they would be attending to certain issues, it could 
be that maybe they are not prioritising it.  I cannot answer 
10 
to the reasons why they delay but it is not – I will not say it 
is not uncommon because a lot of times suppliers will come 
to Eskom and say I have coal, what do you need?  And 
then when we advise them what we need then they will go 
back and sometimes they can even take six months to get 
whatever is needed from Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, so did the reason not have to do 
with the water use licence or the absence thereof? 
DR NTETA:   So I was about to say that it could be that 
they did not prioritise this transaction because they 
20 
understood from my engagement with them that, you know, 
we can go as far as we can but until you have got your 
water use licence we cannot conclude an agreement.  So 
they could have decided not to prioritise it but I do not 
want to speak on their behalf. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 174 of 195 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  But then also on Eskom’s side 
whether you would push enough, hard enough, if you know 
that they do not have this licence. 
DR NTETA:   Yes, so in general we do not – we would 
advise in terms of the suppliers, Eskom would advise the 
suppliers what is required and generally we do not really – 
we do not always follow up with them, you know, to say 
that okay, you have not come to see us after two months, 
what is the issue? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
DR NTETA:   Because we would also be dealing with other 
suppliers at the same time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  But now here we see before 
March 2015 before the signing of the agreement you take 
steps to have them registered as a vendor. 
DR NTETA:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct?  But it does not end there.  
You do say in your affidavit that you tell – you told the 
vendor department or the vendor management, the vendor 
management department, that Tegeta has been awarded 
20 
the contract.  That is in paragraph 614 on page 68.   
DR NTETA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now explain that to the Chairperson 
because you do not have a contract with Tegeta, you are 
going to be placing them as a vendor on Eskom’s database 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 175 of 195 
 
but you do not only do that, you tell the management that 
in fact we have already awarded the contract to them, 
when you had not at that stage.  This in February 2015.  I 
wanted to suggest to you a possibility that maybe I should 
let you explain to the Chairperson why do you take the 
steps, why do you do this? 
DR NTETA:   So we negotiated with Tegeta in January 
2014 with Mr Bester.  At the end of that, Mr Bester sent 
them through an offer, offer letter, and in terms of that, 
that is one of the – we have in the past, and it is not 
10 
correct, had coal supply to Eskom based on that offer letter 
because it sets out the pricing volumes and qualities and 
that then constitutes an agreement that we have with the 
particular supplier.  So we had done that.  Also, having had 
the discussion with Mr Bester, he understood that from the 
vendor requirement side of things, it takes some time in 
terms of their additional requirements that the supplier 
has.  So he had requested that I start that – get that 
process 
going 
to 
get 
them 
registered 
while 
we 
are 
finalising the longer term supply agreement.  
20 
 
So my email is incorrect.  I should have said that 
we have sent them a letter, an offer letter, and not 
necessarily to say an agreement.  However, we have, 
wrongly so, had coal supply based on those offer letters. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Wrongly, you say? 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 176 of 195 
 
DR NTETA:   Yes, it is not often. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NTETA:   And it is not best practice, I agree. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, okay.  What I thought was going 
on here – and tell me if I am incorrect – I am looking at the 
context of the affidavit of Mr Bester.  He talks about 
pressure being brought to bear on him.  I am looking at 
also what you have stated is the intervention by – the 
interest in this and some of the Board members and putting 
pressure you asking every week what is going on.  I 
10 
thought what was happening here was a reaction to the 
pressure that was being brought to bear was as a 
consequence of the pressure that was being brought to 
bear.   Your comment?  
DR NTETA:   So, having heard your – the affidavit of Mr 
Bester read to me right now, and looking in terms of that 
period from January to March, where I was being asked to 
provide weekly feedback and Mr Bester ’s involvement 
because prior to, let me say, December 2014 he was not 
involved in the transaction but after, in 2015, he was.  So, 
20 
having put all that together, I can understand why Mr 
Bester will say that there was pressure and why he would 
then be involved in, you know, in the agreement to the 
extent that he is involved in that agreement because of the 
pressure that he was receiving and also sending it through 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 177 of 195 
 
to myself and my pressure also from his senior.  So, I 
agree with you, that it could have been a consequence and 
he was feeling that pressure and exerting it on myself. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chair, I think that is my part, sufficient 
in regards to the Brakfontein. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no that’s fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, I could then go into Dr Nteta’s 
meetings with one of the Gupta brothers, that should be 
fairly short, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you can do that. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Dr Nteta, so the agreement is in place. 
DR NTETA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You were relating about how the first 
meeting with Mr Tony Gupta came about. 
DR NTETA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.   
DR NTETA:   So, I had been engaging with Mr Nath, who is 
the CEO of Tegeta with regards to the – now the on 
boarding of this contract looking in terms of the volumes 
that are available and the general aspects of his contract.  
20 
He’d asked the question from myself that we – for a 
meeting and at the time I was quite busy so we were trying 
to see the best time and then I’d indicated to him that, yes, 
I am going through to Sandton for some other meeting so 
that we could possibly meet.  He then indicated to me – I 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 178 of 195 
 
said, okay send me the address where we can meet and 
that’s what he did. I put in the address and I arrived.  The 
place that I arrived was in Saxonwold, at arrival it was 
quite – it’s a huge complex and so I made the assumption 
at the time that their offices, Tegeta…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say Saxonwold? 
DR NTETA:   At Saxonwold. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say the place that you went to 
was Saxonwold? 
DR NTETA:   Sorry, I didn’t hear that…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say the place that you went to for 
that meeting, was Saxonwold? 
DR NTETA:   Yes, it was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright, continue. 
DR NTETA:   So, on arrival – sorry sir? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Continue. 
DR NTETA:   So, on arrival, I made that assumption that it 
is – the offices are there because it is quite a big complex 
and I came in and when I walked into the residence, I was 
introduced to, by Mr Tony Gupta as Tony and I then 
20 
indicated to him that I’m here to see Mr Nath for a meeting.  
He proceeded to ask me some questions with regards to 
the coal supplier agreement, the mechanics of how it works 
etcetera, and it was only in the realm of the Operations 
Department.  so, I indicated to him that I normally deal 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 179 of 195 
 
with the agreements up until the agreement is signed.  The 
question that he is asking me about the mechanics of the 
agreement are in the realm of the Operations Department 
and I then indicated to him that, through his CEO he 
should then engage with the Operations Department so that 
he can understand how that contract goes and I did keep 
asking him in terms of where Mr Nath is.  I suspect I may 
have irritated him because after a few, asking of where Mr 
Nath is then he then said, thank you, then I left. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The address…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say he said, thank you and you 
left? 
DR NTETA:   Yes, because I’d been asking him in terms of 
– he’d been wanting to get more details with regards to the 
operations of the agreement and I, to the best of my 
knowledge, I tried to answer him but I think, as I said to 
him, 
I 
think 
I 
may 
have 
irritated 
him 
because 
my 
understanding was, I was meeting Mr Nath, so I kept on 
asking, is Mr Nath coming, is Mr Nath coming, where he 
was still trying – asked me about how the agreement runs.  
20 
So, it wasn’t long then I left, without seeing Mr Nath. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he ever say what was the story about 
Mr Nath and the meeting because one would have expected 
that he would call him for you, if he was not…[intervenes]. 
DR NTETA:   Yes, so he never – he actually never really 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 180 of 195 
 
answered the question in terms of, you know – each time I 
asked him he would sort of be a bit evasive and then he 
asked 
me 
more 
questions 
about 
the 
coal 
supplier 
agreement.  So, you know, he just never really answered 
the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How long would you say you took, having 
this discussion with him? 
DR NTETA:   I’m going to say maybe fifteen, twenty 
minutes I would guess. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, Mr Seleka? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  The address itself 
would have indicated that the location is at Saxonwold, 
isn’t it, the address given to you by Mr Nath? 
DR NTETA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, this is in 2015 and would you have 
known about the Guptas at this stage, in 2015? 
DR NTETA:   Not really, the name had been in the news, 
but I wouldn’t – I don’t follow it greatly, so I would probably 
know who the Gupta is but not intimately. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, so you would have, or would you 
20 
have, become aware of media reports about the Gupta’s? 
DR NTETA:   To be very honest with you, I don’t fully follow 
in terms of what is happening in terms of the media, so I – 
it’s a very difficult question for me to answer because I 
don’t know, I might have known, like okay, there’s an 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 181 of 195 
 
organisation by the name – there’s a family by the name of 
the Gupta’s but I really did not follow. 
ADV SELEKA 
SC:  Ja, well just generally, general 
knowledge, not the details.  So, really the question is, 
when you are introduced to him as Mr Tony Gupta, is the 
name, the first time you hear or is it a name that sounds 
familiar to you? 
DR NTETA:   So, the surname of Gupta is familiar to me, 
interestingly enough he introduced himself as Tony and not 
with the surname, but I mean, it’s Tony Gupta.  So, it would 
10 
– I would understand who he is but as I said I don’t fully 
follow media and things like that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, how did you make that connection? 
DR NTETA:   So, the connection that I made was in terms 
of also he’s been asking me about the Brakfontein and I 
also then recall saying, well I see – the connection that, at 
the time, I did not understand that they were part of 
Oakbay, so I remember just thinking, okay this transaction, 
the shareholders it’s Oakbay and some other individuals, I 
think it was a lady etcetera, so then I then got an 
20 
understanding that, okay, this is a shareholder and I think 
he did say he is a shareholder within Brakfontein and I 
want to understand the mechanics. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, but my question is, if he 
introduced himself to you, only as Tony, how did you make 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 182 of 195 
 
the connection that he’s Tony Gupta? 
DR NTETA:   So, he said his name is Tony, he may have 
said later on Tony Gupta, I’m Tony Gupta but in the 
interaction, he will always say Tony.  So, I made the 
deduction that, Gupta, it must be part of the Oakbay and 
then also part of the transaction, and I do believe he then 
said to me, I’m a shareholder in terms of the Brakfontein. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
When 
you 
saw 
the 
address 
which 
included, Saxonwold, do you remember whether that may 
10 
have – that might have given you the idea that this could 
be the Gupta residence at the time or is that something 
that didn’t click with you at the time? 
DR NTETA:   So, on getting the address and saying, 
Saxonwold, I – yes, I understood that it could be their 
address but also understanding that that’s probably – 
because I didn’t actually know where the Tegeta offices 
were so then just thinking that it could have been in that 
area. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But as you were interacting with Tegeta, 
20 
you knew the connection between Tegeta and the Gupta’s 
or did you not know it? 
DR NTETA:   So, my first – I’m going to collect a light bulb 
moment, what actually, at the end of the agreement, the 
negotiations so then realised okay this is Oakbay, this is 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 183 of 195 
 
Oakbay, Tegeta, Gupta and that really was at the end but 
in my initial negotiations with them, I actually did not put 
those two together but by the time that I did meet them, I 
had then understood that because also there was media, 
I’m not going to say that I did not know totally I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, thank you Chair.  So, that would 
have been before the conclusion of the agreement which is 
10 March 2015 that you would have had this knowledge 
about them? 
10 
DR NTETA:   I’m actually going to say, probably at the end 
of it, so probably April/May after the agreement, so prior to 
that, not really and as I said, I’m not one to be following a 
lot in terms of the media but from March onwards – I 
actually want to say round about May but I stand to be 
corrected. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, well to the extent that you knew 
about them, Dr Nteta, prior to this meeting with Mr Tony 
Gupta, well it was a meeting as you say, intended to be 
with Mr Nath, but it ended up with Mr Tony Gupta, did you 
20 
make a decision that this meeting will never take place – 
or a meeting such as this will never take place again?  In 
other words, that you are not going to have a meeting 
anymore again with Mr Tony Gupta or any of the Gupta 
brothers? 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 184 of 195 
 
DR NTETA:   So, when I left there at the time, I was 
annoyed that I had been summoned there, believing that I 
was meeting Mr Nath, so that was more, if I can put it, my 
irritation with regards to that and that was my sentiment at 
the time.   I didn’t engage as to whether I would meet them 
again or not meet them again at all.  It was just more, you 
know, why was Mr Nath not there? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So, in paragraph 9.3 of the affidavit, 
JJZ2, you refer towards, he talked to you about, Mr Tony 
Gupta.  So, you say he proceeded then, the second 
10 
sentence – the third sentence,  
“He proceeded to ask me about coal sampling 
processes 
and 
predominantly 
coal 
operations 
processes – operations, I beg your pardon, coal 
operations processes at Eskom”. 
DR NTETA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Please tell us what are these topics 
about?  What exactly do you mean by…[intervenes]? 
DR NTETA:   So, when I say coal op – so in the discussion 
that I had with him,  it is, when I say coal operations, I’m 
20 
talking about the coal supply agreement of the operations 
in terms of the mechanics of a coal supplier agreement.  
So, in terms of Brakfontein, how did they go about 
sampling, you know, what is the process in terms of 
sampling, how is the coal agreement, what are the 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 185 of 195 
 
operations and the mechanics in terms of executing the 
contract. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I see, so he wants  you – he wants to 
obtain information from you on how the contract – well let 
me put it this way. On what is entailed in the execution of 
the contract? 
DR NTETA:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is that right? 
DR NTETA:   What is the process and the procedure, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, but these are things that the 
10 
supplier is expected to know, isn’t it? 
DR NTETA:   So, yes, what seems to happen in terms of 
Eskom and the engagements that I’ve had with coal 
suppliers is that you have coal suppliers where there’s the 
operations and you’d have the Executives within the 
organisation, the CEO, the COO and those who are running 
the mine per se, and its often times different from the 
actual shareholders.  So, in – for whatever reason there 
are some suppliers, for whatever reason, the operations 
versus the shareholders, there’s a disconnect and the 
20 
shareholders may feel that, you know, we want to know 
more, we want to hear it from Eskom as to how things, the 
mechanisms of the agreement, whether they want to verify 
what the Executives are saying etcetera. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 186 of 195 
 
DR NTETA:   So, the Executives would know how to 
execute the contract, not necessarily the shareholders. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, no that’s correct but if a 
shareholder wants to meet with you, the shareholder is not 
going to trick you into, you thinking that you are meeting 
Mr 
X 
and 
then 
you 
suddenly 
end 
up 
meeting 
the 
shareholder.  You’re going to know that I’m going to meet 
the shareholder. 
DR NTETA:   Normally I would know that I am going to 
meet the shareholder, yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, I’m saying…[intervenes]. 
DR NTETA:   Because the shareholder would contact me or 
sometimes, I’d meet – the CEO would say or let me say the 
Executive would then say, I would like to – I would like you 
to meet with our shareholder. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, so you would know…[intervenes]. 
DR NTETA:   They want – he wants to, sometimes – ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, the point is you would know 
beforehand that the request is for you to meet with the 
shareholder? 
20 
DR NTETA:   Yes, I would be told that – ja, normally I 
would be told that either by the Executive or by the 
shareholder contacting me directly. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  In this case, you were not told? 
DR NTETA:   No, I was told that I was meeting the CEO – 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 187 of 195 
 
the CEO requested the meeting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, and it really isn’t Eskom’s 
business as to what’s happening between the Executives of 
a supplier and its shareholders, isn’t it? 
DR NTETA:   It’s – I don’t want to say it’s not our business 
to say because we’ve had situations, if there’s some 
disconnect between, he two, it can jeopardise the potential 
for us to supply coal.  So, if there’s disgruntlement 
etcetera, it then affects us in terms of the security of coal 
and one of our biggest mandates from the fuel sourcing 
10 
perspective was security of supply. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, but in this case, you know nothing 
about the concerns of the shareholder, they haven’t been 
raised with you beforehand, you haven’t been told that, 
look the shareholder has X, Y and Z which is of concern to 
him or her or them and would you please address the 
shareholder on such a date at such a meeting.  This 
meeting, 
arranged, 
is 
between 
you 
and 
the 
CEO 
and…[intervenes]. 
DR NTETA:   So, at the time I didn’t know there’s a 
20 
disgruntled shareholder, no but it’s not uncommon that 
there would be a disgruntled shareholder. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, but you haven’t said here that he’s 
disgruntled, he doesn’t seem to be disgruntled here, he’s 
actually asking you information…[intervenes]. 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 188 of 195 
 
DR NTETA:   No, no – yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay, ja, so there’s no disgruntlement, 
he’s simply asking you information that seems to be 
information of more operational – at an operational level. 
DR NTETA:   Correct, of his agreement, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
DR NTETA:   When I say disgruntled, I made the 
assumption that sometimes there are shareholders that are 
not happy in terms of…[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja but just confine it to this one, just 
10 
confine…[intervenes]. 
DR NTETA:   Sorry, apologies, no he’s not disgruntled, he’s 
just trying to understand the mechanics of his agreement. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did it not surprise you – well you said 
you were angry or upset, did it surprise you that he was 
asking information at that level of operations? 
DR NTETA:   It didn’t surprise me that he’s asking that 
information at that level because I’ve had shareholders ask 
me in terms of, take me through, you know, how to get a 
contract in terms of Eskom, what needs to happen.   So, 
20 
his questions didn’t surprise me because I’ve experienced 
them before, as I indicated, sometimes it’s because the 
shareholder feels that he’s not getting relevant information 
from his employee. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay, then you do relate, in your 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 189 of 195 
 
affidavit, the second meeting with Mr Tony Gupta. 
DR NTETA:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Would you tell the Chairperson about 
that one? 
DR NTETA:   Okay, so the second meeting, I was called by 
Tony to meet with him…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry Dr Nteta, before you talk about 
the second meeting, for the sake of completeness, tell me 
whether, subsequent to your first meeting with him, which 
was meant to be a meeting with Mr Nath, whether you 
10 
connected with Mr Nath or he connected with you and what 
was his explanation for not turning up at the meeting? 
DR NTETA:   So, I did have quite a few engagements with 
Mr Nath, so I did indicate to him that he needs to take – 
that I met with his shareholder and he needs to take him 
through the process of coal operations and also that 
perhaps he needs to be meeting with the coal operations 
team, just so that he can understand it and Mr Nath then 
said that – it appeared to me that, Mr Gupta is the one who 
wanted to meet so he says, no – so I got a sense that, that 
20 
was the intention that he wanted to get an independent 
view. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Okay, 
were 
you 
mistaken 
in 
understanding, 
 
prior 
to 
going 
to 
Saxonwold, 
in 
understanding that your meeting was with Mr Nath? 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 190 of 195 
 
DR NTETA:   Yes, I was mistaken. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, the intention on his part, that is, Mr 
Nath was that you meet with Mr Gupta as you subsequently 
understood? 
DR NTETA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But why wouldn’t Mr Tony Gupta have 
said to you, no, no you are meant to meet with me not with 
Mr Nath.  You kept on asking about Mr Nath and he never 
said, why what are you talking about, I’m the one you’re 
supposed to meet with.  Do you ever understand why he 
10 
wouldn’t have said that, if his own understating too was 
that you were there to meet with him? 
DR NTETA:   I can’t speak to that – I can’t speak to his 
understanding as to why he didn’t just tell me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you – are you saying that Mr Nath did 
explain why he didn’t pitch up for the meeting and he 
explained it on the basis that you must have misunderstood 
the meeting that he asked you to go to was a meeting with 
Mr Tony Gupta? 
DR NTETA:   Yes, so I did ask him – it appears to me that, 
20 
that was the intention.  That the intention was for me to 
meet with Mr Gupta, the intention of both parties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that because that’s what he told you, 
Mr Nath, or is that because you didn’t ask him directly, why 
did you not turn up at the meeting, but you inferred that he 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 191 of 195 
 
was not meant to meet with you? 
DR NTETA:   So, I asked Mr Nath in terms of, I said, you 
requested the particular meeting, you were not at the 
meeting and he indicated that Mr Gupta is the person who 
wanted to meet with me and I said, well he was asking me 
in terms of information about coal operations and things 
like that, which, firstly is not within my area but also it’s 
something that I felt, you could have explained to him and 
then he did indicate that he wanted to understand it and 
wanting to understand that particular agreement and – so 
10 
that’s why I’m saying to you that it was the intention that I 
meet with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It’s very strange – ja it’s very strange.  
Ja, okay, alright maybe it’s not so important, continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, but Dr Nteta, what the Chairperson 
was trying to establish with you, and I think you gave an 
answer that you didn’t appreciate the question.  The 
question is whether, were you mistaken when Mr Nath is 
asking you to come to a meeting, are you mistaken that it’s 
Mr Nath calling you or you know that it’s Mr Nath calling 
20 
you for the meeting? 
DR NTETA:   So, Mr Nath – I’m not mistaken that it’s Mr 
Nath because he asked to meet with me and he made the 
arrangements to meet with me and because I’d been 
engaging with him, that’s – it was my understanding that, 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 192 of 195 
 
I’m meeting with Mr Nath. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, so you’re not mistaken, as if, you 
read incorrectly  the request for the meeting, do you 
understand what I’m saying? 
DR NTETA:   No, I don’t. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You didn’t read incorrectly that, oh I 
thought I was called to the meeting by Mr Nath by now I 
see the request was actually made by Mr Tony Gupta, you 
follow? 
DR NTETA:   Mr Gupta didn’t make the request it was Mr 
10 
Nath who contacted me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It’s just strange – it’s just strange to me 
how 
it 
would 
be 
possible 
to 
have 
that 
kind 
of 
misunderstanding.  Mr Nath is the one you had been 
dealing with, I think from what you are saying now, you 
were not mistaken that the interaction or discussions you 
had, had with him were to the effect that you were going to 
meet him, am I right? 
DR NTETA:   Yes, that’s what my understanding. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON: Ja and one would have expected that if he 
was not going to meet with you, he would have said so 
expressly to say, look there’s a need for a meeting, it’s 
Tony Gupta who wants to meet with you, I’m not going to 
be able to be there but I’m just setting up the meeting, this 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 193 of 195 
 
is what he wants to talk about.  One would have expected 
that to be something quite clear, then have a situation 
where you come all the way on the basis that you are 
meeting this one person, even as you are talking to Mr 
Gupta you keep on asking where is this person and he 
doesn’t say, why do you keep on asking about that person 
because you are supposed to meet with me.  He doesn’t 
say that you actually end up leaving and you are unhappy 
because you haven’t met the person that you were 
supposed to meet and he doesn’t say, I’m sorry you must 
10 
have misunderstood, didn’t he tell you that you were going 
to meet with me?  He doesn’t say any of those things, can 
you see what my difficulty is, the natural reaction one 
would have expected from him if he knew that you were 
meant to meet with him and not with Mr Nath, would be 
when you asked where Mr Nath was, look you are 
supposed so meet with me not Mr Nath or he is not coming 
but I’m the one that you’re supposed to meet with, with 
you, didn’t he tell you?  That’s what one would expect but 
from what you have said he kept on avoiding telling you 
20 
about where Mr Nath was until you left, this whole thing – 
it’s strange that in the arrangements you would think that 
you were going to meet with Mr Nath when actually, that’s 
not the arrangement and then it’s strange that when you 
were – when Mr Tony Gupta was having this discussion 
11 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 325 
 
Page 194 of 195 
 
with you, while you kept on saying, where is Mr Nath, 
that’s the person I’m supposed to meet, that he never says, 
no, no, but you’re supposed to meet with me, I’m the right 
person that you are meeting.  He doesn’t say anything of 
that but keeps on asking questions and from what – he 
avoids giving you direct answers about Mr Nath, until you 
left and you are unhappy.  Do you understand why I find it 
strange? 
DR NTETA:   I hear you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, okay but in the end maybe it 
10 
might not be important.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Dr Nteta do you know to the extent 
that you say you gave only general information and you 
encouraged Mr Tony Gupta to engage with Primary Energy 
of Eskom, whether that happened?   Did he engage with 
Primary Energy? 
DR NTETA:   I don’t know. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, let us go into the second meeting 
then.  Explain to the Chairperson ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us not go to the second meeting 
20 
because it is five o’clock now.
