PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 18 MARCH 2021 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Seleka, good morning 
everybody. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We are ready Chairperson and we 
sincerely apologise for the late start. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Anoj Singh is represented by 
Counsel 
and 
the 
attorney 
they 
would 
like 
to 
place 
10 
themselves on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Counsel can do so from where 
they are if that is convenient. 
ADV 
VAN 
DEN 
HEEVER: 
 
Good 
morning 
again 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning – good morning. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER: Advocate Van Den Heever 
instructed by Mr Tshepo Mathopo of Mathopo Attorneys. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  And we represent Mr Singh in 
20 
these proceedings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Before my learned friend – first 
of all we are going to apologise we had a little discussion 
just pertaining to my learned friend’s approach today. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 4 of 328 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Some points that he brought to 
our attention sought of compels us at this point to ask you 
Chairperson if we could have an opportunity to consult with 
our client just to deal with some of those issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   And I do not want to go into the 
details. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Of what my learned friend said 
10 
to us but it would be very unfair to my client that we go 
down that route and he has not had an opportunity to 
discuss my learned friend’s approach.  And I mean I am 
indebted to my learned friend for playing open cards with 
us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   But we want to place our client 
in the best position to – to deal with the issues before you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How much time would be necessary for 
that interaction with your client? 
20 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  My suggestion would be a 
maximum of thirty minutes.  It just depends how long it be 
up – we might be finished a lot quicker and we will then 
make sure that that we – we advise your Registrar that we 
are ready to proceed. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 5 of 328 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  There are two ways of dealing with it.  
One is to adjourn now to give you that opportunity.  
Another one is for us to start on the understanding that Mr 
Seleka will not pose questions relating to those issues 
until you have had that opportunity with your client.  And if 
we go that route we could see whether we add time to the 
tea break or we add time to the lunch break it just 
depends.  I would prefer the latter approach if possible but 
obviously I do not know whether in terms of your plan Mr 
Seleka it is possible to deal with other issues until there 
10 
has been that opportunity for counsel for Mr Singh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  It is possible Chair to put it on the 
side-line. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Even up to lunch time? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Any time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja anytime. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair anytime. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Exactly. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Chairperson that was exactly our 
20 
discussion this morning and again I do not want to go into 
the details. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Suggested to my learned friend 
that we start with – with a certain line. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 6 of 328 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  And that we stand – the issues 
that he wish to start with but down. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  But I understood my learned 
friend and I am not going to be prescriptive to him he is 
the evidence leader that he has got his own plan and he 
wished to start with the issues pertaining to McKinsey and 
Regiments and it is on that score and some of the issues 
that he wished to raise that we actually would like the 
10 
opportunity to just have a discussion with the client.  As I 
said it is – we did try and solve it inter parties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes ja. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  But I do understand Mr Seleka’s 
approach in this right we are not allowed to be prescriptive 
as to how he approaches. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No, no that is fine.  Let – let us 
start. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when we come to the tea break I will 
20 
indicate whether we will take a longer than usual tea 
break. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or whether we will only do that in respect 
of the lunch hour so we take more than an hour. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 7 of 328 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, no just for the benefit of my 
learned friend it is only that limited aspect which I can put 
on the side regarding the disciplinary action.  So the rest I 
will pursue as planned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Is – I take it that there is 
agreement that the issues can be ring fenced and dealt 
with later? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Chairperson we indebted to you 
if we can – if my learned friend can then proceed on the – 
on the basis that if my client feels that he is not in a 
position to answer a specific question and if for instance 
wish to first go and refresh his memory or have regard to 
certain documents that he be allowed to do that before he 
commits himself and he have not had regard to certain 
documents that now excludes the issue that we wished to 
consult on. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Well I guess let us play that by ear. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us see if we get to any such point 
and we will take it from there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 8 of 328 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Please administer the oath 
or affirmation please.

prescribed oath?

conscience?

you will give will be truth; the whole truth and nothing but 
the truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so 
help me God. 
MR SINGH:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  You may be seated Mr Singh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I assume Mr Seleka that there is also a 
topic that you have raised with Mr Singh’s legal team 
relating to another day for evidence? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I did – I did Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did and I guess I will be informed in 
due course. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What – what anything came out of that 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 9 of 328

ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Singh. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Chairperson sorry before my 
learned friend continue for some reason there is a very bad 
echo and I cannot always hear with clarity what is being 
said.  I have already moved here to keep it not better but I 
still have difficulties in – in… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you think that might be the aircon? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is the aircon Chair. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  It might be that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is the aircon ja.  Okay they will – they 
will attend to it.  Thank you.   
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 12 of 328 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is still on.  Okay it is off now.  Thank 
you.  Just by way of introduction and for the purposes of 
the viewers Mr Singh.  Mr Singh is a former employee of 
Eskom in the position of CFO.  He has provided two 
affidavits to the commission dealing with essentially three 
aspects of her evidence to the commission.  One being his 
secondment from Transnet to Eskom who approached him 
and asked him to be seconded.  The other is matters that 
once he was at Eskom he had to deal with – those matters 
relate 
to 
the 
McKinsey 
and 
Regiments 
contract 
for 
10 
McKinsey and Trillian contracts and the payments made 
pursuant to those transactions. 
 
Mr Singh will outline the role he played in regard to 
those transactions and what decisions were made.  Mr 
Singh will also deal with – or he gives evidence also on 
matters pertaining to Tegeta.  The pre-payments that were 
made in regard to Tegeta, the decisions in relation thereto 
and to the extent he can or I suppose he will also deal with 
the – the penalties the R2.17 billion penalties.  Perhaps let 
us see how we progress.  It is a full plate.  Thank you 
20 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Singh let us start off with your 
secondment to Transnet – to Eskom. I beg your pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe just so that I do not forget I think 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 13 of 328 
 
when we take the tea break let both teams see me to 
discuss the matter that you are still discussing about 
between yourselves. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Singh let us start with your 
secondment to Eskom.  Would you please just tell the 
Chairperson 
how 
your 
secondment 
came 
about; 
who 
approached you and requested you to make yourself 
available for secondment and when officially were you 
10 
seconded to Transnet – to Eskom? 
MR SINGH:  Thank you Mr Chair.  In response to the 
question I was approached by the then Minister of Public 
Enterprises Ms Lynne Brown to consider a potential 
secondment to Eskom.   
 
If memory serves I think it was in the period of 
sometime in June 2015 or so.  And that then resulted in my 
official secondment to Eskom on the 1 s t of August 2015. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So the – you saying it was the Minister 
Lynne Brown who approached you? 
20 
MR SINGH:  Yes Sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Around June 2015. 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And what exactly did he – did she ask 
you? 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 14 of 328 
 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair it was basically to understand 
whether I was willing at that time to consider a potential 
secondment to Eskom given the issues that Eskom was 
currently experiencing at the time in terms of financial 
hardships and load shedding and the issues relating to the 
new bill. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And when did your secondment come 
into effect? 
MR SINGH:  1 s t of August 2015. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  Now you have – you have read 
10 
the affidavit of Ms Mateko and I am sure listened to her 
evidence. She has given evidence before the commission 
about the meetings she says you had with McKinsey and 
Regiments including herself during July 2015.  She gives 
dates of 8 July 2015, the date of 24 July 2015 that these 
meetings were taking place at some hotels and what is the 
other place – Maboneng and they were discussing what she 
said was Project Pandora a proposal which McKinsey and 
Trillian were making at the time in order to offer services 
to Eskom but you were not at Eskom at the time.  What is 
20 
your comment on her version? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair in context I think the affidavit – my 
affidavit deals with this aspect in detail.  Indeed there were 
meetings that were held with McKinsey and the version that 
we have on affidavit is supported by the McKinsey version 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 15 of 328 
 
in that the – I think it was Doctor Weiss that gave evidence 
before the commission that stated that the on boarding 
process that they had undertaken with Mr Molefe and 
myself was part of those processes and they were 
processes that they would undertake as the normal part of 
their engagement with client.  In terms of the Regiments 
component he also confirmed that the on boarding process 
that was undertaken by McKinsey was at their behest or 
their 
initiative 
and 
Regiments 
was 
invited 
to 
those 
meetings 00:18:39. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So you are – you are confirming or are 
you so that I am clear on your response are you confirming 
to the Chairperson that the meetings did take place? 
MR SINGH:  Yes Mr Chair in the context of the on boarding 
process that meetings he had outlined they did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I take it that – that includes the 
meetings with as I understood Mr Seleka’s question to you.  
Meetings that allegedly took place before you were – were 
seconded to Eskom? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct Mr Chair and it was on the 
20 
assumption that the Minister had requested the – of me to 
provide her an indication as to whether I would be willing 
to do so and I had given her the indication that I would do 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so your confirmation is yes there is 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 16 of 328 
 
certain meetings took place relating to Eskom matters 
before – in which you attended before you were actually 
seconded to Eskom. 
MR SINGH:  That is correct Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and you say but that happened after 
the Minister had approached you. 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that what you are saying? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
MR SINGH:  And to – to complete Mr Seleka’s questions 
the issues relating to the matters that were discussed 
effectively covered the issues of on boarding in terms of 
the Eskom environment, what are the current issues in the 
Eskom environment, how did they see the – the solutions 
for the problems that Eskom currently faced.  So that was 
the context of the meetings. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Just keep your microphone on.  Ja she 
testified that this was called Project Pandora. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You confirming that term? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Do you confirm that? 
MR SINGH:  I think Mr Chair McKinsey from time to time 
did put names to projects – if they did at the time maybe it 
was I do not – I do not recall exactly if there was a name.  
I think for me it was as I described an on boarding session 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 17 of 328 
 
that they had arranged which I know you know all client – 
all service providers from time to time do.  I think as a 
professional courtesy even Ms Mathopo herself would have 
done that as part of her duties at Regiments. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Would have done what? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is – is your answer you cannot dispute 
that the project was called Project Pandora, is that 
correct?  You cannot dispute that.  You are aware that 
McKinsey did put names to projects but you cannot 
remember whether this project was called Project Pandora, 
10 
is that what you are saying? 
MR SINGH:  That is what I am saying yes Chair. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Chairperson before Mr Seleka 
continues insofar as his dealing with evidence that was 
given by Ms Mathopo without being prescriptive I think it is 
quite important that he directs Mr Singh to the portions in 
the transcript that he – that he relies on otherwise we are 
going to end up in a situation where there is total 
confusion as to exactly what my learned friend is referring.  
If he deals for instance with an affidavit or if he deals with 
20 
the evidence visa vie the transcript. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it might not be necessary to specify 
where you base your question on but if there is an issue – 
there is a dispute whether the witness did say that then we 
can go to – to the relevant part.  But we can move on if 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 18 of 328 
 
nobody thinks it is not put accurately.  Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  No that is fine Chair but in any 
event I was intending to show the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Where Ms Mathopo – because there are 
email invites. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Which are sent by – from McKinsey by 
Mr 
Thomoebotse 
Kgoaripe 
and 
the 
subject 
there 
is 
Invitation Project Pandora discussion with CFO.  So those 
10 
emails are attached to Ms Mathopo’s affidavit and she said 
that that was the description of the project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think what I – what I seek to protect. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Please Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that if you have got the facts on your 
fingertips. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of what the witness said. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether it is in an affidavit or whatever. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You – you can and should be able to just 
put what you need to put to the witness. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Without necessarily referring to where it 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 19 of 328 
 
is to be found. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Until either the witness or his counsel 
says no I think that might not be accurate then we might 
need to go there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I agree Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – but you – obviously you are free to 
do it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In whatever way but it can be quicker 
10 
when you have got your facts. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On your – in your fingertips. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you – and the witness is able to just 
respond 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair I – ja and Project 
Pandora is mentioned and discussion with the CFO so she 
20 
said it was reference to yourself.  So what she said also 
was that in her testimony that the use of the word Project 
Pandora – or Pandora Box was kind of a – there was some 
secrecy about the discussions in regard to what the group 
was doing.  Any comment? 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 20 of 328 
 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I have no reason to have thought at 
the time that there was anything secret about it.  As Mr 
Seleka said there were email invites and I am sure those 
email invites indicates who was invited thereto and I am 
sure it must have been an extensive list could have not 
just been me and one McKinsey person or Ms Mathopo for 
that matter.  So I do not think there was anything secret 
about these meetings.  They were open meetings and as I 
said there was nothing sinister about the topics that we 
covered in these meetings. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But is there a reason why they were 
taking place at private hotels? 
MR SINGH:  Sorry Sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is there a reason why they were taking 
place at a private hotel or one she said that an airport and 
the other one at Maboneng and not at office premises. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I think they were – the one was I was 
told obviously working for Transnet at the time too it would 
have been when and if there was a schedule or gap in my 
diary relating to Transnet work that these things would 
20 
happen and it was McKinsey normally would have done 
these things because they were in a workshop style that 
these things were then held and they would then be held 
offsite and that is the reason.  There is again I do not 
believe anything sinister relating to the fact that they were 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 21 of 328 
 
offsite. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you recall how many such meetings 
took place before you were actually seconded to Eskom? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I would be guessing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Many – few – several? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair given the dates I think she met in 
three dates so I would think it is probably … 
CHAIRPERSON:  About three. 
MR SINGH:  Sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:  About three? 
10 
MR SINGH:  I think Mr Seleka mentioned three dates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  I would then hazard to say that that would be 
in an indication. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes but you have no independent 
recollection? 
MR SINGH:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  But Ja I do not – it is not – it is not ten Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes not ten. 
20 
MR SINGH:  Or twenty for that matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR SINGH:  It is probably.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it might be three or four? 
MR SINGH:  It is probably in the region of three to five. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 22 of 328 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  To five ja okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes  Okay you say the Minister – this 
was happening after the Minister had approached you – 
you know about June 2015 let me put to you what… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry did you say intervene? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No they had this meetings after the 
Minister has approached her – him in or about June 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh alright.  So the approach by the

Minister to you was it in June 2015? 
MR SINGH:  That is what I have said Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Now I know you also have Doctor 
Weiss’ affidavit because you make reference to some of 
what he says in his affidavit.  I also want to say – read 
from his affidavit paragraph 17 where he says: 
“Around May 2015 – May 205 McKinsey began to discuss 
the possibility of a larger turnaround program with Mr 
Molefe, Mr Singh and others at this meeting.  We 
20 
eventually agreed with Eskom to conduct this larger 
turnaround program in conjunction with the …” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just indicate where you reading in his 
affidavit? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 23 of 328 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  What paragraph or what – where we find 
it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is the McKinsey – it is Eskom 
Bundle 15(c). 
MR SINGH:  Sorry Sir.  I did not hear you Sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Eskom Bundle 14(c)  
MR SINGH:  I got you there Sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  On page 688. 
MR SINGH:  688. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  688.  Paragraph 17.   
10 
MR SINGH:  I am there Sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  So paragraph 17 it is the one I 
was reading. 
MR SINGH:  Yes Sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   
“Around May 2015.”   
I will just wait for the Chairperson.  Just remember as I 
said prior to starting that I will put to you the versions of 
others and let you comment on them, so that we get to see 
exactly what happened. 
20 
MR SINGH:   Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Page 688.  I have got it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Paragraph 17, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   This is an affidavit of Dr Weiss.  He 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 24 of 328 
 
was with McKinsey and he writes: 
“Around May 2015, McKinsey began to discuss 
the 
possibility 
of 
a 
larger 
turnaround 
programme with Mr Molefe, Mr Singh and 
others at Eskom...” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say...  I do not know if I...  It 
sounded like you say – you read, he says around late May? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Around May 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, maybe I am hearing things this 
morning. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is it how I sound?  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Okay.  Ja, around May 2015. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So.  Yes, the Chairperson can 
read.  But Mr Singh, he is putting it, even before the 
Minister approaches him, he puts these discussions in May.   
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I can categorically state that I had 
not met Mr Weiss specifically.  Oh, sorry.  Not Mr Weiss, 
Dr Weiss specifically before these interactions.  The 
interactions that I had up to that point in time was purely 
Transnet related interactions and the individual that I 
20 
interacted with at that time, would either have been 
Dr Fine or....   
ADV SELEKA SC:   So.  You see, he is specifically saying:   
“Around May 2015, McKinsey began to discuss 
the 
possibility 
of 
a 
larger 
turnaround 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 25 of 328 
 
programme with Mr Molefe, Mr Singh and 
others at Eskom. 
We, eventually, agreed with Eskom to conduct 
this 
large 
turnaround 
programme 
in 
conjunction with the Top Engineers Programme 
and to train a greater number of top engineers 
than previously discussed...” 
 
So he is specific about this being in relation to 
Eskom.   
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I do not deny that that is exactly 
10 
what he stated. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   What I deny is the fact that he engaged with 
me at that time relating to Eskom related matters. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   The reason why he is stating that is because 
of the time.  If you look at the events that occurred which 
is related to, it is the time at which the, I would say, the 
request for confinement for McKinsey was being prepared 
by Eskom.   
20 
 
At the time I had no influence, nor input or 
knowledge of the fact that that was happening.  It is just 
post that that I then got to know that these things were 
occurring at that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, he, in paragraph 17, might not 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 26 of 328 
 
necessarily intent to say he was personally involved in the 
discussions 
that 
involved 
you 
and 
Mr 
Molefe, 
as 
I 
understand it.  It is open to an interpretation that would 
mean that he was also involved but it is also, it seems to 
you, open for interpretation that he is talking about 
McKinsey representatives having these discussions with 
you and Mr Molefe which may or may not have included 
him.   
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, as I have stated, at that time my 
only interaction with McKinsey was relating to Transnet.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   [Indistinct]  
[Speakers intervening each other – unclear.] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay.  So to the extent that he 
means that there were meetings between yourself and 
Mr Molefe or there were discussions involving you and 
Mr Molefe and representatives of McKinsey in May.  You 
say, no, that is not true insofar as his talking about 
discussions relating to Eskom. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, sir. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Singh, I know that you have quoted 
some of the paragraphs from his affidavit when addressing 
certain aspects of the McKinsey/Trillian payment and 
transactions.  Is there a reason why you did not deal with 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 27 of 328 
 
this allegation in your affidavit, this particular one? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I am not sure.  I think it was just an 
oversight on our – on my part. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It was...  Sorry, it was what? 
MR SINGH:   I said it was probably an oversight on my 
part. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh.  Now you got seconded effective 
August 2015.  Prior to that, you have had these meetings 
with the McKinsey/Regiments’ teams.  Ms Mothepu says: 
“These meetings, not only did they entail your 
10 
plan for the first hundred days but they also 
dealt with this Top Engineering Programme 
and the services that were intended to be 
rendered 
in 
terms 
of 
a 
Service 
Level 
Agreement...” 
 
Is that correct? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, at that time I would have not known 
the difference between what was hundred days for Top 
Engineers because at that time it was just an induction.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me go back to the meetings.  I am 
20 
sorry Mr Seleka ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...for interrupting your plan.  But I want 
to go back to the meetings that you have admitted that 
took place and before your secondment to Eskom with 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 28 of 328 
 
McKinsey that related to certain proposals or plans that 
McKinsey had in mind for Eskom.  Did those meetings 
involve the person who was acting CFO of Eskom? 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, Chair, at the time? 
CHAIRPERSON:   At the time. 
MR SINGH:   No, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Are you able to say why meetings 
that were discussing Eskom matters which it was thought 
required your presence as somebody who was possible 
going to be seconded to Eskom as CFO?  Do you have an 
10 
idea why the person who was then the current acting CFO 
of Eskom was excluded from those meetings?   
 
I would have thought that if the idea was that 
you needed to be briefed about matters that you will have 
to deal with once you were seconded, I would have thought 
that the presence of the then current acting CFO of Eskom 
would be important. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, the meetings were called at the 
instance of McKinsey.  I, actually, did not consider that at 
the time.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   I think the first time that I consider it is now 
that you mention it.  I guess, when ... McKinsey did not 
deem it necessary at the time.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But it is just not McKinsey, it is also you, 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 29 of 328 
 
h’m?   
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I would have thought that - and you must 
tell me if your thinking is different.  I would have thought 
that, firstly, you might be – if you were called by a service 
provider or a potential service provider to Eskom to a 
meeting to discuss Eskom matters at a time when you were 
not part of Eskom but on the understanding that you 
possible would be seconded to Eskom.   
 
I would have thought that you would insist that 
10 
the person who was occupying the position that you would 
be occupying should be there because that is the person 
that those matters actually that that person should be 
seized with those letters at that time because you are not 
part of Eskom.   
 
And those matters relate to or affect his or her 
portfolio and that you will say:  Well, I am not comfortable.  
He must be here or she must be here.  After all, if I get 
seconded, I will take over from him or her.  What do you 
say to that? 
20 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I think as the purpose of the 
sessions, as described, were on boarding sessions to the 
extent that the sessions were, as we discussed for on 
boarding, it was really McKinsey’s view of the world in 
terms of what they believed that needed to be done.  And 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 30 of 328 
 
where they believed the, let us call it pain-points in Eskom, 
as it stood at the time.   
 
Now, 
and 
that 
was 
really 
just 
to 
provide 
information about the environment that I was going into 
and as we have also stated, that it may have included 
maybe of what the next hundred days would look like.   
 
It is not to say that was the be all and end all of 
the input.  When I eventually got there, I then got also my 
direct report to basically brief me on what the exact state 
of each of the environments was.   
10 
 
And that provided me to a better insight into the 
exact state of the organisation visa vie what, let us say the 
health check that McKinsey had presented, visa vie the 
actual state that my direct reports would effectively give 
me at that time. 
 
So I would exactly know what is the expectation 
in terms of where McKinsey pictures it versus where the 
organisation actually is visible the assessment that each 
individual would give me at the time.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But it seems to me that that may be all 
20 
the more reason why you should have insisted that the 
then current CFO should be present because does it not 
look strange that you get briefed by an outside to Eskom 
before you are briefed by the organisation itself by the 
person whose position you will be taking? 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 31 of 328 
 
MR SINGH:   I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I would have thought that, first, you 
would rather be briefed by this person or whoever else 
from Eskom or at least when you are briefed by an outside, 
that person should be here so that you get a full picture of 
what is the current position, what is his or her attitude on 
some of these matters.   
 
Obviously, when you get seconded, you will 
make your own decisions but I would have thought that you 
will say:  No, no.  It is important that the current person 
10 
should be present.  I do not want to be seen to be having 
discussions behind his or her back on matters that affect 
Eskom when I am not even at Eskom yet.  That is what I 
would have expected. 
MR SINGH:   Well, Mr Chair, maybe also by way of 
background.  I think, I guess at the time there was a lot of 
media reporting around the state of Eskom and the reasons 
for the state of Eskom...  And I think the then board 
instituted and investigation relating to the veracity of 
information that emanated from Eskom itself.  
20 
 
I think also the War Room was seized with 
issues relating to the information flow and the accuracy of 
information that was being shared between the board, the 
War Room, Public Enterprises, Ministry of Finance and all.  
So there was an issue associated with the credibility of 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 32 of 328 
 
information that emanated from within Eskom at the time. 
 
And maybe in hindsight, you are correct, maybe 
it would have been better to have the person but given the 
situation that existed as the time, in my view, it would have 
– in my view today and I certainly did not think of it then, 
as I have said, but in my view today, given what we know 
about the information flow and the accuracy of the 
information, I would so say, that it would probably have 
been better for me to have an independent view from 
McKinsey or any consultant for that matter, relating to the 
10 
state of Eskom. 
 
I mean, we talked about McKinsey today, for 
example, but there was Deloittes, there was JP Morgan, 
there was Citibank.  There were, you know... reports.  All 
of that information I utilised to be able to get myself 
appraised of what that current state of Eskom was 
independently of what the environment was before I got 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  And prior to you actually being 
seconded, did you have any similar meetings with any 
20 
Eskom officials, particularly, the person who was acting 
CFO? 
MR SINGH:   I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or you got the chance to hear what they 
have to say about what was going on at Eskom? 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 33 of 328 
 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I do not recall specifically the 
finance people or any of my direct reports that reported to 
me when I got there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR SINGH:   But I certainly remember interacting with 
Mr Freddie Dahl(?) and he was the – I think he was the 
group – I think he was the division – the title of either 
Divisional Executive or General Manager in the Office of 
the CEO or relevant information and stuff like that.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Well, Mr Seleka will proceed.  I 
10 
just want to say.  There is something that appears, from 
the face of it, to be a bit unusual where somebody who is 
not part of the organisation, even if it is seconded later, he 
possible may be part of the organisation as usual, has a 
number of meetings about that institution with an outsider 
not involving anybody within the situation.   
 
And then if I take what you have said, never has 
any similar meetings with people from within the institution 
until he is seconded.  But I just wanted to put to you what 
is in my mind but it may be that it will be clarified as we 
20 
proceed. 
MR SINGH:   I think, Mr Chair, in the context of clarifying. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   I think I have also tried to clarify that in the 
context of what existed at the time.  In my view, there was 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 34 of 328 
 
a need to separate an independent assessment of what 
was happening visa vie what was actually happening.  And 
I think when Mr Seleka leads us further ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   ...you will see an example, which I will try to 
remember to highlight, at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think you can tell the Chairperson. 
MR SINGH:   Sorry? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You can tell the Chairperson. 
10 
MR SINGH:   Oh, okay.  I think...  The example that comes 
to mind, Mr Chair, is the issue of Eskom being in a liquidity 
crisis in January or in around January 2015, for example.  
Now in that case, you try and understand why is that the 
case, okay.  And if you go to Eskom and asked them why 
were you in this position, you are going to get three 
hundred different reasons as to why they were in that 
position.  And then some of them might be legitimate, some 
of them might not be legitimate.   
 
Yet if you ask an independent person from the 
20 
outside, why did you – why did Eskom have liquidity crisis, 
you will get a very concise answer that may or may not be 
biased.  And then in the end it is up to you to decide 
whether it is so or not so.   
 
And in this case, Mr Chair, if you then go to 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 35 of 328 
 
trying to understand why that was the case, it goes back to 
the Funding Plan that was prepared.  The Funding Plan 
that was prepared for that year, would supported a, I think 
it was a two or three hundred borrowing billion borrowing 
programme all of two pages.   
 
So that is the environment in which – or that was 
this type of environment that was there at the time.  So in 
order for us to get to that answer, for example, with the 
Eskom environment at the time, would have taken a month 
of Sundays to get it.   
10 
 
Having had input from the McKinsey’s of the 
world or the Citibank’s of the world of JP Morgan’s of the 
world, you very quickly get to that answer.  And it is not on 
the basis that you accept that answer completely.  It is on 
the basis that it is a very quick answer to understand why 
there was a problem to get to a root cause. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it is sounds a very – sounds a 
strange proposition to me.  Say, if you want to know 
exactly what is happening to Eskom, you do not go to 
Eskom. 
20 
MR SINGH:   In the context ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   To go to somebody else from outside. 
MR SINGH:   In the context of what was happening at 
Eskom at the time, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because, you see, I think if you spoke to 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 36 of 328 
 
the CFO of Eskom, acting CFO at the time, even before 
you were seconded, on the basis, if all that was left was 
the formality of the paperwork but the decision to second 
you had been made. 
 
If you said to the acting CFO:  You know, I will 
be coming there.  All stakeholders have approved, the 
Transnet Board, the Minister and the Eskom Board.  So I 
would like to begin to understand what is going on.   
 
It is seems to me that if you wanted certain 
documents from within Eskom, that you believed he would 
10 
give you the true picture.  That in all probability you would 
be given those documents by that person as long as he or 
she was informed definitely you would be coming over.   
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, that was process was undertaken 
through ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  And those documents might 
be documents that they would not give to an outsider, 
some of it, but could give to you because in those 
20 
circumstances.  So I am mentioning this to say, for me, 
there is still a question mark of, why not go to Eskom even 
if you listened to an outsider but also listened to Eskom 
and preferable listen to Eskom first and then listen to an 
outsider. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 37 of 328 
 
 
But even if you start the other way but then 
come to Eskom while you are listening to whatever they 
say, rather than exclude Eskom or the relevant Eskom 
officials all together prior to your secondment and have 
about five – three, four, five meetings with an outside 
without any input from within the institution. 
 
So that – but that is what I wanted to mention.  
You have given me that example but as we go along, there 
are questions, you know, maybe the picture might be 
different that emerges.  Okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Ja-no, it...  Mr Singh, are you 
saying, during these meetings there was nobody from 
Eskom who attended these meetings? 
MR SINGH:   Not that I recall, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did Mr - Dr Eric Wood attend these 
meetings? 
MR SINGH:   I think so.  Yes, Mr Chairman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did Mr Salim Essa attend these 
meetings? 
20 
MR SINGH:   No, sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, but you did know him at that time? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, as I have testified before, I had two 
interactions with Mr Essa. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 38 of 328 
 
MR SINGH:  One or two interactions with Mr Essa but it 
was certainly in my Transnet days, not... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did those interactions also refer to the 
meetings you had to attend with Mr Henk Bester? 
MR SINGH:   No, sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But do you know of those meetings? 
MR SINGH:   I do know – well, I do know of the meetings 
via Mr Bester ’s affidavit which we have denied in my 
10 
previous session ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh.  Oh, I see.  Yes.  So when did you 
get input, if you did at all, from Eskom officials in regard to 
your on boarding?  Did you get input at all, information 
from them on what is happening within Eskom, what are the 
issues that trouble you and why are they there and what 
can we do to resolve them? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, as I have said, there were two 
processes that were utilised by me to then engage with 
Eskom.  One was through Mr Ndo prior to me arriving at 
20 
Eskom to get the relevant information as Mr Chair has 
indicated. 
 
And the second process was to actually have a 
one-on-one session with each of them and then a workshop 
with the finance team in its entirety to understand what 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 39 of 328 
 
was the state of each of the, how can I say, sections within 
finance was at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Please do not forget your 
question Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can I take you back to when Minister 
Brown approached you ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...with the idea of your secondment to 
Eskom? 
10 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did she indicate or did anybody, 
subsequent to that, indicate to you whether there was 
anything wrong with the then current acting CFO of Eskom? 
MR SINGH:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In other words, why were they going 
outside of Eskom to get a CFO when there was an acting 
CFO?  Did anybody ever tell you that whether there was 
any problem? 
MR SINGH:   No, sir. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Nobody told you? 
MR SINGH:   H’n-‘n. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Ja, and when did you say 
that was, when you got – did you say the finance persons 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 40 of 328 
 
from Eskom? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   When was that? 
MR SINGH:   I would assume that would have been in the 
course of the 1 s t of October. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Just remind me.  In your 
affidavit, did you not deny that these meetings took place 
with McKinsey and Trillian before you were seconded to 
Eskom? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I will have to go and check.  I think 
10 
those are one of the issues that we – counsel was 
requesting us time to canvass but ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   ...if you can point me to those paragraphs, we 
can have a look at it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, your affidavit...  Well, I cannot 
recall.  I am trying to remember how do you deal with these 
meetings.  Page 615 of Eskom Bundle 16, paragraph 65.  
So 62 you say – I have read the statement made by 
Mothepu.  615. 
20 
MR SINGH:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  62, as I have read the statement 
by Ms Mothepu dated October.  Paragraph 65, then you 
say: 
“I deny that McKinsey was negotiating the LSA 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 41 of 328 
 
with 
me 
in 
June 
2015, 
as 
asserted 
by 
Ms Mothepu for the following reasons. 
- I only joined Eskom on 1 August 2015. 
- The BTC approved the mandate to negotiate 
a contract with McKinsey in July 2015.  I 
was not the delegated authority...” 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, that paragraph is correct.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, 65. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, 65. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   65 is correct? 
10 
MR SINGH:   Yes, because Ms Mothepu was – and it is 
again, like, mister – in paragraph 17 of Mr Weiss’ 
statement. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Ms Mothepu makes the allegation that she – 
that we, sorry, in these meetings, we are negotiating there 
on the site(?) but they were clearly not MSA’s negotiations.  
They were on boarding sessions as Mr Weiss clearly 
stated.  So that is the denial.  The allegations relating to 
the fact that we were negotiating the MSA in those 
20 
meetings. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  But both of them do add the 
turnaround strategy, the Top Engineers Programme, as 
having been discussed.   
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, as I – originally when I approached 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363

the subject around the meetings, it was the current state of 
Eskom, the issues at Eskom and potential solutions to 
Eskom.  Whether those potential solutions included the 
MSA or not at that stage, I was not aware. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the – in this paragraph of your 
affidavit that Mr Seleka has read in part you talk about 
negotiations relating to I think the MSA.  Now what you 
have said earlier is that certain meetings did take place 
between yourself and McKinsey prior to your secondment 
to Eskom and you said those you believe started in June 
10 
2015.  Now are you making a distinction between those 
meetings and negotiations or are you talking about same 
thing? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I think Ms Mothepu is referring to 
the same meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   Vis-à-vis June and now the dates that Mr 
Seleka refers to as July. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   So the affidavit that we had to respond to at 
20 
the time, referred to June.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   I think she has now clarified it further and I 
stand under correction, I have not seen those dates. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 43 of 328 
 
MR SINGH:   She clarifies it further to be these dates, as 
the ones in July. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   So the meetings that I referred to are the July 
meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Negotiation. 
MR SINGH:   The July meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Which she refers to as June in her affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but I think what I want to establish 
10 
is whether you are saying the meetings that you attended 
with McKinsey about which you talked earlier were not 
negotiations or whether you are saying no, really, whether 
there was negotiations or not negotiations is really neither 
here nor there for me, there were discussions in which I 
attended with McKinsey and as far as Ms Mothepu may 
because talking about negotiations or meetings where 
negotiations took place, as far as I am concerned, those 
were discussions, those were meetings so I am not making 
a distinction or I can make a distinction between meetings 
20 
that not involve negotiations and meetings that involve 
negotiations. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I state that no meetings that I 
engaged with McKinsey prior to me arriving at Eskom 
entailed negotiations of any sort regarding the MSA or any 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 44 of 328 
 
other contract and that is what I state in relation to these 
meetings that Ms Mothepu refers to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the ones that you talked about earlier 
and said you attended am I right to say you said you think 
that was June? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or when they started it, you said. 
MR SINGH:   My discussions with Minister Brown was in 
June. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, was in June.  Okay. 
10 
MR SINGH:   These meetings, according to Ms Mothepu 
now according to Mr Seleka occurred in July. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MR SINGH:   But her affidavit that I responded to them 
referred to meetings in June. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, but your recollection is 
when?  Is when did these meetings that you attended with 
[indistinct – dropping voice] 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, it could not have been in June 
because that is the time I only had an engagement with the 
20 
Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.   
MR SINGH:   So it would have had to have been some time 
in July. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I would have to be after June. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 45 of 328 
 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you would say July. 
MR SINGH:   July.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:      Just to confirm, Mr Singh, she also 
wrote in her affidavit 8 July 2015 and 24 July 2015.  So 
Regiments and McKinsey met regularly with Anoj Singh in 
his capacity as Acting CEO of Eskom at various hotels 
within the Gauteng Province and discussed this and 
programmes and prepared priorities in an action plan for 
10 
his first 100 days, funding plan and the utilisation of R350 
billion government guarantee.  When specifically we met 8 
July 2015, 24 July 2015 at conference facility at Maropeng 
in Johannesburg, Boutique Hotel in Rivonia and the Airport 
Hotel at Oliver Tambo at a conference facility in Maropeng.  
So the dates are the same.  I think the person who puts 
meetings earlier is Dr Weiss, he says around May 2015. 
MR SINGH:   But, Mr Seleka, you are asking me to respond 
to Ms Mothepu’s affidavit which I have responded to in 
paragraph 65 that states: 
20 
“I deny that McKinsey was negotiating the MSA with 
me in June 2015.” 
So I am assuming that in her affidavit she mentioned June 
2015.  This affidavit that you are referring to is probably an 
updated affidavit. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 46 of 328 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:      No, it is updated.  No, I see what 
you are saying there but I am saying her dates are the 
same in her affidavit and during her testimony saying 8 
July and 24 July 2015. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Seleka, I am not sure what we – I have 
agreed to the dates of 2015 and I am agreeing to a date of 
June 2015 which was in an affidavit that I responded to as 
well. 
ADV SELEKA SC:      Sorry? 
MR SINGH:   I am saying I am not sure what we are 
10 
debating or what conclusion we are trying to reach because 
I concede that those meetings are more likely to have 
happened. 
ADV SELEKA SC:      Yes, no that a June meeting. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, no, because my point was on the 
negotiations.  Well, the meetings, not the negotiations. 
MR SINGH:   Yes because I am categorically stating there 
were no negotiations. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, no, no, sorry, let me clarify my 
20 
question.  My question was I seem to recall that you are 
denying that there were these meeting prior to you starting 
at Eskom on the 1 August. 
MR SINGH:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is when we went to your affidavit. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 47 of 328 
 
MR SINGH:   No, no, the July meetings are correct as Ms 
Mothepu has stated. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
MR SINGH:   The context within which she states it relating 
to the negotiations… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   That is which I deny. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is? 
MR SINGH:   That is which I deny because of the meetings 
as we have explained, was on boarding session. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but Dr Weiss – I am saying then, 
Dr Weiss and Ms Mothepu, they seem to agree on what 
was discussed which was not only the on boarding which 
is, I suppose when you say on boarding, you referring to 
your first hundred days plan? 
MR SINGH:   Indeed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But they talk about other things.  The 
turnaround strategy which you deal with in paragraph 66.1 
of your affidavit. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I think it is going to be he said, she 
20 
said for the entire day.  As I said in my view there were on 
boarding session that dealt with the current state of 
Eskom, the challenges that Eskom faced and potential 
solutions.  If those potential solutions ended up in an MSA 
or a Top Engineers’ programme then that you know 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 48 of 328 
 
subsequent to those meetings. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, it is fine, so …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let me put this to Mr Singh.  It 
would appear from what you are saying and from what is 
written in your affidavit, paragraph 65 and 66, that if one 
has regard to have both what you have said and what is 
written here, that one, you do say negotiations between 
Eskom and McKinsey did happen or start in July, is that 
correct? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, Sir. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Two, you deny that you took part in 
such negotiations. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Nevertheless you admit that in July you 
had a series of meetings with McKinsey. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that those meetings concerned 
McKinsey’s proposals or plans in regard to Eskom. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that right?  Now the question arises 
20 
whether in circumstances where in July McKinsey was 
negotiating with Eskom, whatever they were negotiating 
was also not what they were discussing with you in 
separate meetings. 
MR SINGH:   But, Mr Chair, yes, that would have to be 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 49 of 328 
 
confirmed by the negotiating team [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but obviously from you because you 
became CFO or acting CFO initially in August, later CFO, 
you would have known what they had been negotiating in 
July, is it not? 
MR SINGH:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   After you came on board, you – and you, 
because you say here, those negotiations between Eskom 
and McKinsey it started in July, went on up to November 
10 
2017 which is when you were there. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Mr Chair, but I was not part of the 
negotiating  team relating to the MSA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I would imagine you would have 
been briefed, you would have been getting reports, is it 
not? 
MR SINGH:   I think as I have said in the affidavit, Mr 
Chair, as and when required, I would be consulted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Because of the impact of the initiatives. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR 
SINGH: 
 
 
Having 
an 
impact 
of 
the 
financial 
environment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Or financial outcomes. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 50 of 328 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if they were – if McKinsey and 
Eskom were negotiating in July the MSA, obviously that 
was about the future, is it not? 
MR SINGH:   Indeed, Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that future, to their knowledge was 
going to be when you would be around as either acting 
CFO or CFO. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Mr Chair.  But as I have mentioned, Mr 
Chair, the discussions in the meetings where centred 
around on boarding, which dealt with the current state, 
10 
where they believed there were problem areas and what 
they believed needed to be done to resolve it.  He did not 
go into procurement discussions or any of those type of 
things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  It is just difficult to think that here 
they were negotiating with Eskom what it seems to be was 
quite a big project, contract, seems strange that they 
would be so keen to discuss Eskom matters with you about 
the future of Eskom even before you could get to Eskom 
but not talk about such an important project that they were 
20 
busy negotiating with Eskom when they know you were, so 
to speak, the future as far as the finances of Eskom was 
concerned. 
MR SINGH:   Well, Mr Chair, in my view it is not 
unreasonable. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 51 of 328 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   At the end of the day they knew that I had no 
executive powers at Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   So anything that they had discussed with me 
or not discussed with me would not pull any weight at the 
time, so – and I think, Mr Chair, to be quite honest, the 
correct person to have resolved this issue would have been 
Mr Weiss when he was here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
10 
MR SINGH:   He would have canvassed those issues and 
given you a very candid answer as he is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Oh, so your final position is you 
had discussions with McKinsey during July and during the 
same month they were having negotiations with Eskom 
about the MSA but they never discussed the MSA with you 
in those meetings which you attended.  That is what you 
are saying. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  Mr Seleka. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  I understood you 
differently, Mr Singh.  I understood you to be saying it was 
the procurement issues you did not discuss.  However, 
whatever was discussed, you would not have known 
whether it falls under MSA or not. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 52 of 328 
 
MR SINGH:   Which is what I think Chairman is saying. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, it is different. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it is different. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is different. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because you specifically say to me they 
never discussed MSA issues with you. 
MR SINGH:   So when is say MSA issues, as – okay, 
maybe …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or the MSA. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  I said the MSA.  
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So but – ja because you need to be 
clear to the Chairperson.  What you are saying is, as I 
understand you… 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   These issues were discussed but I do 
not 
know 
whether 
they 
were 
MSA 
issues 
or 
not.  
Procurement you know it was not discussed. 
20 
MR SINGH:   Well, let us put this way… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   The MSA included initiatives, okay?  Those 
initiatives would have resulted in commercial [indistinct] 
for Eskom and McKinsey and [indistinct].  Okay?  Those 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 53 of 328 
 
initiatives …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Face the Chairperson. 
MR SINGH:   Sorry.  Those initiatives, Mr Chair, as I have 
alluded to, I did not know whether they are MSA or non-
MSA. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so they were discussed? 
MR SINGH:   Sorry? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So they were discussed at the 
meetings? 
MR SINGH:   Well, as I am saying to you, Mr Chair, I did 
10 
not know whether they were MSA or not MSA and to be 
quite honest, as I have said to you now, the outputs of 
those meetings were challenges, current state challenges 
and potential solution.  They did not go into MSA, non-
MSA, this stream, that stream as the MSA was constructed.  
Okay?  Procurement-related issues which I term as let us 
say the terms and conditions of the MSA, were never 
discussed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you see, as I see it, to be able to say 
they never discussed the MSA you need to know what the 
20 
MSA issues were or what was – what the MSA entailed, 
that would be my inclination.  So that if you do not know 
what the MSA was at that time, your answer would be we 
had some discussions, I know what we discussed, whether 
that falls under MSA or not, I did not know and I still do not 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 54 of 328 
 
know or I did not know at that time but subsequently I 
realised that what they were discussing with me included 
MSA issues or I know now that MSA issues were not 
included because I now know what the MSA issues were.  
That would be my expectation. 
MR SINGH:   So I think, Mr Chair, so that everyone is on 
the same page, I think it is your third summary. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, which is you – they discussed 
various issues with you.  You are saying at that time you 
did 
not 
know 
what 
was 
MSA, 
what 
was 
not 
MSA, 
10 
subsequently you got to know what …[intervenes] 
MR SINGH:   Some of them may have found its way into 
the MSA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, some of the MSA issues may have 
been discussed but at that time you did not know they were 
MSA issues.  That is your financial position. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Adjournment for tea. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Maybe this is the right time for 
the tea break. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am inclined to let us a longer lunch for 
purposes of the consultation that counsel for Mr Singh 
needs with Mr Singh so that our tea break would be the 
normal 15 minutes.  Is that fine? 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 55 of 328 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is fine, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   When do we see the Chairperson?  
Now? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I would suggest you see me now. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If – because you spend few minutes with 
me, we need to add a few minutes more on the tea break, 
then we will do that just – ja, okay, alright, we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
10 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON: Okay, let us continue.   
ADV SELEKA SC: Thank you Chair.  Yes, just to clarify I 
think Mr Singh there is a paragraph which I think you had 
in mind, which refers to June 2015 in Ms Matsepo’s 
affidavit and you may have had that in mind.  You can take 
off your face mask and put on your microphone, where she 
says: 
 
“Regiments and McKinsey were negotiating the 
master service agreement with Arnold Singh in 
20 
his capacity as chief financial officer when I 
joined Regiments in June 2015.” 
 
I think that is what you had in mind.  Is that 
...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:  That is correct.  
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 56 of 328 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And that was an affidavit in October 
2017.   
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  So you do have two affidavits from Ms 
Matsepo. 
MR SINGH:  Ja.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  So she said when she joined.  It seems 
to tie in with what Dr Vice is saying, if he is to be the 
authority as you say, he would be the one to conclusively 
answer the question because he is saying in May already 
10 
we were discussing, which included the you, Mr Molefe and 
others at Eskom, what he refers to as the turnaround 
strategy which ultimately got to be incorporated in the top 
engineer ’s program. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, I cannot talk about or to the 
assertions that Mr Vice has, Dr Vice has made.  All I can 
say is that I deny the contents of his affidavit that is 
related to paragraph 17.  Relating to the meetings that 
happened in May. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think Mr Seleka is saying you said 
20 
earlier the right person to answer the question would be Dr 
Vice. So he is saying Dr Vice says you were involved in 
discussions with McKinsey and you were involved with Mr 
Molefe already in May.  
 
So if we are to take what you said that is the right 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 57 of 328 
 
person who can deal with that, is Dr Vice.  Mr Seleka is 
saying that is what Mr Vice, Dr Vice is saying.  
MR SINGH:  Well, Mr Chair, with all due respect.  The 
contents within which I made the reference to Mr Vice was 
who was he negotiating with post the 1 s t of July.  He could 
be able to tell us that.  I cannot, because I was not there.   
 
In the context of the meeting that happened in May, 
I was obviously not there.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So you are saying with regard to 
negotiations that is what you were talking about as to who 
10 
was there.  
MR SINGH:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you say that in regard to that you 
think he would corroborate your version that you were not 
part of the negotiations, but with regard to the meetings, 
you were in the meetings and therefore you are able to say 
who was there and who was not there and when did they 
start those meetings that you attended.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Indeed sir.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka.  
20 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER SC:  Chairperson, there is one 
further issue.  I approached my learned friend during the 
break and it relates to the start of my learned friend’s 
questions to Mr Singh and he referred to two emails that 
were attached to an affidavit, and Chairperson would recall 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 58 of 328 
 
at that stage my client says is this a new affidavit.  
 
I in fact approached my learned friend, because 
either I am growing old or my memory is failing me, but I 
could not recall seeing such emails attached to the 
affidavit that came to us in terms of the regulation 10(6) 
directive.  
 
As Chairperson was coming in we were trying to 
ascertain ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER SC:  So maybe to save time. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER SC:  If my learned friend can go to 
those emails with reference to the affidavit, the date of the 
affidavit and the annexure numbers.  That might just assist 
us so that Mr Singh can look at those and he can see in 
what context and when these affidavits were presented.  
 
Ag, not the affidavits, the emails ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER SC:  Were presented to the 
Commission. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, I know my learned friend was 
trying to do that during ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  The break. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The break, could I make a suggestion 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 59 of 328 
 
Chair that we do that when we take the lunch adjournment.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, that is fine.  You could finalise your 
discussions ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
During 
the 
lunch 
adjournment 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  To establish where those emails are. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct, correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay alright.  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Singh, so you were at Eskom.  The 
Eskom officials, McKinsey officials, Regiments officials 
have had these discussions.  They have I suppose by this 
time, 1 August 2015 or thereafter I have given you your 
first 100 days plan, correct?   
 
But I would like you to talk about what we see from 
the interaction between Eskom and McKinsey Regiments as 
the corporate plan and the MSA will make a distinction 
between the two to the Chairperson and if you recall what 
the one entails and what the other entails, just before we 
20 
go further into that.  
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, in terms of the corporate plan it was 
really the development and preparation and finalisation of 
the corporate plan that was required to be submitted to the 
Minister of Public Enterprises  by the 25 t h of May, on the 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 60 of 328 
 
28 t h of February each year in terms of the PFMA. 
 
The MSA, basically that was a very I would say 
shorter time assignment with a very specific deliverable 
which was the corporate plan.  The NSA was more of a 
turnaround program as I understand it and that entailed 
longer term initiatives that were specifically identified to, 
as the word suggest turn around Eskom in various aspect.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it a kind of a global plan?  When I 
say global I mean looking at Eskom as a whole, in terms of 
its main challenges that needed to be addressed? 
10 
MR SINGH:  Well Mr Chair, not holistically. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:  But it certainly dealt with the burning issue 
such as the New Build program, the energy availability 
factor which you would have dealt with Chair.  New Build 
would also have dealt with load shedding.  The, on the 
finance side it was the cost of planning the energy and 
claims reduction. 
 
So those were the main elements that I remember if 
I recall correctly at this point.  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Which one of the two, corporate plan or 
MSA / service level agreement involved balance sheet and 
cash unlocking initiatives? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, the MSA would have also included 
that under the finance tree.  
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 61 of 328 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Let us deal with the corporate plan 
first.  Did you, can you recall when was who was appointed 
in fact to render services in respect of the corporate plan?   
MR SINGH:  I think Mr Chair, it was McKinsey and 
company. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  McKinsey and? 
MR SINGH:  McKinsey and company. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  McKinsey and company was appointed.   
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Was Regiments appointed to do this 
10 
also? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, the if I recall correctly, the 
appointment required a BEE or empowerment partner and if 
I recall correctly at the time Regiments or Trillian was the, 
well at the time that it was awarded I would assume that it 
was McKinsey and Regiments that was intended to be 
[indistinct]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I want you to tell the Chairperson, I am 
asking you these questions we can free flow, giving the 
Chairperson the facts and face them.  I do not think we 
20 
heard you.  So you are saying McKinsey and Co was 
appointed to render the services.  
 
McKinsey and, the contract required McKinsey and 
Co to have a BEE partner.   
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 62 of 328 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, and that BEE partner which 
McKinsey and Co brought on board which one was it?   
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, I think again as Mr Vice put it in his 
affidavit which I concur with at the time, they had engaged 
with Regiments and I think it was the intention that they 
would conclude a subcontractor agreement with Regiments.   
 
During that period of time, the Regiments Trillian 
transition as I would put it, was occurring.  So the 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Was? 
10 
MR SINGH:  Occurring.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, thanks.  
MR SINGH:  And the ultimate eventual payment that was 
then made, was made to Trillian.  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
And 
not 
to 
McKinsey 
and 
not 
to 
...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:  No sir, the payment was made to McKinsey. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  As the main contractor.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
20 
MR SINGH:  And then as a subcontractor, a payment was 
then made to Trillian. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, you remind me of a question I 
wanted to raise.  I cannot remember whether it was you 
under Transnet, when you were testifying under Transnet 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 63 of 328 
 
or somebody else.  Oh no, I think it may have been Mr 
Daniels under Eskom. 
 
I would have expected that if a main contractor has 
been awarded a contract and they had a subcontractor, 
that the client Eskom in this case, would they remain a 
contractor and that the arrangements as to payments 
between the main contractor and the subcontractor would 
be their business, their own business and that the client, 
Eskom, would not be responsible for ... would not be 
directly responsible for paying a subcontractor.  
10 
 
So when you say as did one of the witnesses I think 
in the context of McKinsey and Regiments, that Eskom 
would pay the subcontractor.  That seemed strange to me, 
because I would have thought that your contract would be 
with the main contractor and the subcontractor has a 
contract not with you, but with the main contractor.  
 
How much work they would do as a subcontractor is 
something that is discussed between them.  Of course 
legitimately Eskom could say a subcontractor should not do 
less than so much of the work, that is fine and they enter 
20 
into an arrangement.  
 
But one would expect that I would expect that the 
main contractor would pay the subcontractor.  Is that not 
how it worked with Eskom generally and in this particular 
case, is that not how it worked?   
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 64 of 328 
 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, the I think the ... if you look at both 
Eskom and Transnet, they adopted a policy that enabled 
them to pay a contractor directly, and it emanated from I 
would say the issue of paying a main contractor, who then 
had the discretion as to whether it needed to pay the 
subcontractor and when and how and how much. 
 
So those issues became only issues for the entities 
you deal with, because eventually it became the entities 
issues.  So I think both entities adopted the policy that 
enabled subcontractors to be paid directly in certain 
10 
conditions.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But the end client, whether Eskom or 
Transnet, 
would 
still 
not 
have 
a 
contract 
with 
a 
subcontractor, even in that situation.  In other words 
Transnet or Eskom would pay the subcontractor without 
having a direct contract between the two of them. 
MR SINGH:  No sir, there would need to be a contract 
between the main contractor as well as the subcontractor.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no but I am saying there would 
be no contractual relationship between Eskom or Transnet 
20 
with a subcontractor.  There would be a contract between 
the main contractor and the subcontractor and there would 
be a contract between the main contractor and Eskom.   
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But no direct contractual relationship 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 65 of 328 
 
between Eskom and the subcontractor.  
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, the subcontract would reference the 
main contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But they would not have a contract as 
such with Eskom. 
MR SINGH:  If I recall, the MSA I would be guessing if I 
had to answer that question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and that would be the same with 
10 
Transnet.   
MR SINGH:  Again I would be guessing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Given your time. 
MR SINGH:  Again Mr Chair, I would be guessing if I 
answered that question.   
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no I thought you answered it, I 
just wanted to make sure that I understood you correctly. 
MR SINGH:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What you did say is that for certain 
reasons, Transnet and Eskom had taken the decisions to 
20 
pay the subcontractors directly. 
MR SINGH:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I was simply saying this would happen 
in circumstances, this would happen despite the fact that 
Eskom would not be having any direct contract between 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 66 of 328 
 
itself and the subcontractor.  
MR SINGH:  It could have been that way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  ja, you say it could have been.  You 
would know whether it was that way or was not.   
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, contract management is an area 
outside of finance, so again as I said, I would be ... I 
understand that that policy existed because of the fact that 
finance needed to pay.  So hence I understand that the 
policy exist. 
 
The mechanics of how the policy was actually 
10 
implemented within the organisation, I would not have first-
hand knowledge.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But would the finance department which 
would be headed by the CFO I would imagine.  
MR SINGH:  Yes sir.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Would the finance department not have 
the obligation before it authorised any payment or made 
any payment to say do we have a contract with this entity 
that you are saying we must pay.  
MR SINGH:  Yes sir.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then it is difficult for me to understand 
how 
you 
would 
not 
know 
whether 
you 
were 
paying 
subcontractors without having a contract with them or not.  
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, I think you are asking me the 
question would Transnet have had a subcontract with 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 67 of 328 
 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  A contract. 
MR SINGH:  With the subcontract? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR SINGH:  And my response to that was I am not sure as 
to whether that particular point ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  Exists.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  
MR SINGH:  The policy position is that we allowed that to 
10 
happen in certain conditions ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  As we stated.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  As per whether I knew what the actual 
requirements were for that to happen Mr Chair, Eskom and 
Transnet are a very big organisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  And I would not know every single contract 
that is concluded and how it is concluded.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So would you say that your, you would 
say the basis for the finance department paying or making 
a payment to a subcontractor would be the policy? 
MR SINGH:  Indeed so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the policy did not contemplate that 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 68 of 328 
 
there would be a contract before payment would be made.  
MR SINGH:  No sir, I am saying ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  As you understood it.  
MR SINGH:  No sir, I am saying the policy would 
contemplate a contract.  I am merely stating that I am not 
sure whether I can answer your question as to whether the 
contract would have been with Eskom or would have been 
per reference to the main contract.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Well, obviously there would be 
a contract with the main contractor I would imagine. 
10 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So what I was really looking at is whether 
this was a situation where a subcontractor would be paid, 
despite the absence of any contract with them, but I think 
what you are saying is you do not know whether factually 
there 
was 
such a 
contract 
in the 
McKinsey Trillian 
Regiments situation with Eskom, and you do not know 
whether in the case of Transnet, in those cases where it 
paid subcontractors directly, you do not know whether 
there were contracts directly between Transnet and those 
20 
subcontractors, but all you are able to say is there was a 
policy.  
MR SINGH:  That governed that relationship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but you also say that policy did 
contemplate that if you were going to make a payment, 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 69 of 328 
 
there should be a contract.  
MR SINGH:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that if there were no contracts, then 
probably such payments would be in breach of the policy. 
MR SINGH:  Indeed sir.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  Actually when we go through the corporate 
plan you see the process that is actually followed.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  In terms of how those payments are actually 
10 
made.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
And 
these 
direct 
payments 
to 
subcontractors by Eskom and Transnet, and I know that I 
am now including Transnet when you are here only for 
Eskom, but these direct payments, do you know whether 
they were general in terms of subcontracts, subcontractors 
were 
paid 
directly, 
all 
subcontractors 
or 
most 
subcontractors after the decision had been made or it was 
20 
only certain specific subcontractors? 
MR SINGH:  I think Mr Chair it was more of a general 
policy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  Yes, that was adopted.  
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 70 of 328 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  I think by word of mouth I think the industry 
gets to know ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR 
SINGH: 
 
That 
we 
adopt 
this 
policy 
and 
most 
empowerment companies would prefer to be paid directly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, Mr Singh we can cut to the chase 
because in this case for the corporate plan the invoice was 
sent to you of 30.6 million. 
10 
MR SINGH:  Sorry, I did not hear you? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The invoice of 30.6 million was sent to 
you from Mr Lebelo of Trillian.  
MR SINGH:  That is correct, if I recall.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, and the payment for services said 
to have been rendered in respect of the corporate plan was 
made? 
MR SINGH:  Sorry, repeat your question? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The payment was made of the 30.6 
million? 
20 
MR SINGH:  You said met or made? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  What was made. 
MR SINGH:  Was made, yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  In April, if I recall correctly. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 71 of 328 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, it was made on the 14 t h of April. 
MR SINGH:  That is correct.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is right, 2016.  But a couple of 
things there I want you to address to the Chairperson.  
One is that the contracts, I will take them one by one.  One 
is that the contract for the corporate plan when this 
payment was made, had in fact not been signed.   
 
The 
contracts 
gets 
to 
be 
signed 
by 
Eskom 
represented by Mr Mabelane only on the 4 t h of May 2016, 
and okay.  Did you know that?   
10 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, I was not aware of the fact that this 
contract was signed on the 4 t h of May by Mr Mabelane, and 
if I recall correctly the corporate plan was actually 
delegated to Mr Koko. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Well, then tell the Chairperson about 
the contract.  What do you know about the contract or the 
corporate plan, when was it concluded? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, there is a letter of, sorry I am 
referring to page 650.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, which bundle? 
20 
MR SINGH:  Eskom Bundle 16. 
CHAIRPERSON:  16? 
MR SINGH:  Yes.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is that where your affidavit is, is that 
where we find your affidavit? 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 72 of 328 
 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the page number again? 
MR SINGH:  650.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
MR SINGH:  Yes, so there is a notification of acceptance of 
provision of consulting services that you will notice on 
page 651, signed by Mr Koko on the 29 t h of September 
2015.  That ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay, let me allow you to proceed.  
MR SINGH:  That in turn is then accepted by Mr Vice on 
10 
the 29 t h of September 2015.  The 653, 653 is an NEC 
professional 
services 
contract 
which 
relates 
to 
the 
corporate plan and that is accepted by Mr Vice on page 
1655, if I am not mistaken, on the 29 t h of September 2015 
as well.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Singh, that figure at the 
bottom of page 650, starting with 98, is that not before 27 
there or is it 98 billion?   
MR SINGH:  Sorry sir, I just ... have you got the point? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The agreed fee.  Is that 98 billion? 
MR SINGH:  No sir, it is 96.  98 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is just that I do not see a dot before 27 
or is there a dot? 
MR SINGH:  No, there is a dot there sir.  
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 73 of 328 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, the Chair is asking whether is that a 
million or a billion? 
MR SINGH:  No, it is a million sir.  
CHAIRPERSON:  He says million, but I do not see a dot 
but he says there is.  
MR SINGH:  No Mr Chair, there is definitely a dot.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you able to see it Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I cannot, ja no ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  There is some fade thing there.  
MR SINGH:  Ja, maybe it is my glasses, but I can definitely 
10 
see a dot.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, right continue.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  So that is 98 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  So it was meant to be 98 million 
something.   
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And maybe it is just, there is just that the 
dot is not so clear.  Okay, alright.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, Mr Singh I think you got the point, 
of the date.  
20 
MR SINGH:  Oh, yes.  So it was accepted by Mr Vice on 
the 29 t h of September 2015.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Accepted by Mr Koko you mean? 
MR SINGH:  No, no sir it was accepted by McKinsey.  
Presented by Dr Vice on the 29 t h of September 2015.   
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 74 of 328 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but what is the basis for saying he 
accepted that on the 29 t h? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, because his signature appears on 
page 655.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, ja that is what I want because I was 
looking at underneath Mr Koko’s, 655 you say.   
MR SINGH:  Yes sir, and then ... yes Mr Chair, that is the 
contract relating thereto.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Is it 29?  Looks, okay maybe it 
is 29.  I am not sure if there is a 20, probably 29.  Okay, 
10 
now I understand your answer.  You may continue Mr 
Seleka.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Can you answer the Chairperson?  Give 
the 
Chairperson 
the 
answer 
to 
the 
question 
I 
was 
...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:  Okay.  Mr Chair, I was not aware that the 
contract was signed by Mr Mabelane on the 4 t h of May 
2016.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   So Chairperson the payment in respect 
of the Corporate Plan, 30.6, just over R36.6million, was 
20 
made, as Mr Singh testified, in April 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   April 2016? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   2016 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the Corporate Plan had been 
completed when? 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 75 of 328 
 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair we would have to submit the 
Corporate Plan on the 28 t h of February. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Were they being paid for assisting in 
putting the plan together? 
MR SINGH:   As part of the McKinsey contract for the 
corporate plan? 
CHAIRPERSON:   So they – and that was R80million?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   That was R30.6million.  
CHAIRPERSON:   R30.6million? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, Chair.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   But then that is another issue.  So 
what I was pointing out to Mr Singh was that by the time of 
that payment, the contract relating to the corporate plan 
had not been concluded, but not been signed by Eskom.  It 
only gets to be signed on the 4 t h of May 2016.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So we were going through this 
exercise to determine that date and that date, you see it on 
page 657 which is Mr Mabalane signing on the 4 t h of May 
20 
2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is his signature the one just under the 
words of the employer? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr. Singh?  
MR SINGH:   That is correct, sir, if I recall. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 76 of 328 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that is 20 t h of May, no, that is 4 t h 
of May 2016.  Is that the date? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So in other words, the purported 
services were rendered, and subsequently payment made, 
without there being a contract in the two parts. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair there well, as I said, I was not 
aware of the fact that there was the contract had been 
signed on the 4 t h of May 2016, as you find on page 657.   
10 
I have only been pointed that out now, however, Mr 
Chair there had been an acceptance of the letter of award, 
or the notification of acceptance that was signed by Mr 
Koko on the 29 t h of May 2015 and there was an acceptance 
thereof by Mr Weiss on the 29 t h of May 2018 and the 
contract that was presented to McKinsey, also was signed 
on the 29 t h September 2018.  
So technically, there was no signature relating to 
this contract from an Eskom perspective on the 14 t h of 
May, or 14 May 2016 but I guess, given the information 
20 
before us, there was a meeting of the minds in terms of 
what was the law. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you mean, 14 April? 
MR SINGH:   14 April, sorry.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 77 of 328 
 
MR SINGH:   There was ostensibly a contract between the 
parties given what is before us today.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But was the rule not or policy, that there 
must be a contract first before you can make payment? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, that is correct, in all instances, how 
and why this payment was processed in the manner it was 
processed Mr Chair the finance team or the procurement 
team would need to provide the details. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But of course, you were in charge of the 
finances there? 
10 
MR SINGH:   Indeed, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so ultimately, the buck stops with 
you. 
MR SINGH:   Indeed, sir, but not every single process 
payment that is processed in Eskom is processed by 
myself.  Ja, policies and processes that are put in place for 
employees to abide by and follow and in this case, it would 
seem that there were processes that were not followed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And are the amounts in terms of rand 
value of contracts or projects where you were obliged to 
20 
personally see whether there was an existing contract 
before payment were made, and this does not happen to 
fall within those categories, or was there no such a rule? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, in terms of the delegation of 
authority they would, there is a requirement for certain 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 78 of 328 
 
authority levels to approve contracts once those are 
approved, and the payment process then does require that 
to come back to me, for example, for me to say yes, okay, 
we approve this contract again.  
So 
the 
policy 
and 
process 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
processing of the payments covers that, so again the 
procurement department would have had to make sure that 
the contract was loaded into the system.  So the finance 
people would have reference to that, and make sure that 
all the necessary documentation and sign offs that were 
10 
required for that would have been implemented. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think my question is whether in 
terms of the amounts I would imagine the saving is, that is 
maybe R500million should not be paid by Eskom without 
the CFO knowing that everything was in order about that 
payment. Would that be unfair to expect?  
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, not in – maybe at I am stretching 
my imagination, if I think back in Transnet but certainly at 
Eskom I was not called on to approve any payments that 
were in the context of the way you describing. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so but would there be amounts, like 
R1billion for example where everyone would expect that 
Eskom cannot pay R1billion with the CFO of the company 
knowing about it, and having satisfied himself that this 
payment can go ahead? 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 79 of 328 
 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I have to take you back again to the 
delegation of authority.  The delegation of authority would 
empower individuals to do certain things.  So those values 
that you talk about, in terms of the physical payment, those 
would be delegated to the head end of the – let us call it 
payments section, whoever it may be.  
So let us say if there was a payment that needed to 
be made for, let us say, for Capital Equipment, and there 
was a contract that was put in place for Capital Equipment. 
Now the delegation would say, let us say the contract the 
10 
equipment was for a R100million, the delegation would say 
Mr Singh, can approve contracts up to R50million.  
So in that case, I would not have the delegated 
authority to approve the contract.  It would then need to go 
to a higher authority, maybe it needed to go to the CEO for 
example, that delegated authority would look at that 
contract and then effectively approve the contract.  That 
contract would then go to the procurement department and 
they would then upload it into the system and basically 
keep it on file.  
20 
What 
happens 
thereafter 
is 
that 
that 
capital 
equipment would then arrive there, someone would then 
take custody of that capital equipment, when they take 
custody of that capital equipment in terms of the contract, 
they would have to do a whole lot of checks and balances 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 80 of 328 
 
and make sure that the equipment is in working order and 
it is…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is the right thing. 
MR SINGH:   It is the right thing.  So in other words, they 
would in the finance team, even I mean the finance 
terminology, either sign a delivery note or a goods 
received, note accepting that whatever the supplier had 
delivered, was in terms of the expectation, that would then 
be followed by an invoice from the supplier.  
So what would happen is that someone within the 
10 
finance environment would make sure that they – well the 
procurement people would upload the contract, so that 
would have been in there and it would be approved by the 
appropriate delegated authority, then the finance team 
would basically do two things.  
Someone would generate this goods receive note, 
or a delivery note that says this equipment has arrived and 
it is in working order and it is within our expectation.  Now, 
that would normally be a person that actually requested it 
in first place.  So it will be the person that actually was 
20 
going to use the equipment.  So they would generate this, 
it will go up into the system, then you would have the 
finance people that would then receive the invoice.  Let us 
say, this contract was for R50million, what was the number 
we used, no R100million, there is the invoice for a 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 81 of 328 
 
R100million. 
So what would then happen in the finance area is 
that the invoice would then be matched with the delivery 
note, would be matched with the purchase order that 
emanates from the approved contract.  If those three 
things are in place, the finance system would generate a 
payment, it then go to somebody and that somebody would 
then release that payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then authorise it. 
MR SINGH:   Authorise payment, and then depending on 
10 
the payment terms, that supplier would get paid in 30 days 
or 45 days.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairman, Mr Singh insofar 
as you say that, from the documentation here, it appears 
that process was not followed.  You think you could say to 
the Chairperson, there was some negligence here and if 
you look at the amount even gross negligence, that amount 
of over R30.6million? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair that will be difficult for me to say, 
20 
not having regard for the facts relating to the manner in 
which the payment was processed.  I know for example, 
that the services were delivered, that was confirmed 
through a process between McKinsey and Trillian.  There 
was a process that was followed to ensure that McKinsey 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 82 of 328 
 
agreed that the amount can be paid directly to Trillian.  
 
So from that perspective, Mr Chair, there was due 
process that was followed, relating to validate that work 
was done, and that the amount that was being paid was a 
value that was derived by as well, and that the main 
contractor was comfortable, that the amount would be paid 
directly to Trillian, and the fact that they were comfortable 
with the work that was delivered at the time. 
Ja, in terms of this aspect relating to…[intervene] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, that is the aspect I am talking 
10 
about. 
MR SINGH:   …the actual payment itself and how that 
occurred Mr Chair, again, I am not privy to the facts, 
relating thereto. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, no the other part that we will 
come to, but this is the aspect that I am talking about that 
before 
the 
conclusion 
of 
the 
agreement, 
before 
the 
agreement is put in place, which only happens on the 4 t h of 
May 2016 Eskom allowed services in respect of the 
intended contract of the corporate plan to be in respect of 
20 
the corporate plan to be rendered and paid an amount of 
over R30.6million before the contract had been completed.  
You said, when you look at the documentation, just 
on that limited basis, it appears that processes were not 
followed, correct?  
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 83 of 328 
 
MR SINGH:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then I was asking you, could this be a 
question of negligence? 
MR SINGH:   I would say so, sir.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So then we can go to the next - which 
is what services were rendered because you and Ms 
Mothepu talk different languages.  On the one hand is the 
services and on the other hand, is who in fact rendered 
services.  And I want you to tell the Chairperson your 
version, who rendered the services in respect of the 
10 
corporate plan? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, again, it would be difficult to 
explain this but for all intense and purposes, as I 
understand it, when Mr Seleka introduces this topic, I said 
that Regiments and Trillian were in a transition process 
during this period of time.  And as I am given to 
understand, there was a sub-contractor agreement that was 
agreed 
to 
between 
Regiments 
and 
Trillian 
for 
the 
secondment of certain stuff for the Eskom consignment 
relating to the corporate plan. 
20 
And that was the nexus for the corporate plan to be 
delivered by Trillian at the time, and Mr Weiss in his 
testimony I think, through that extent, alludes to that fact 
that there were McKinsey people, there were Regiments, 
people, there were Trillian people, and all of them 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 84 of 328 
 
interacted interchangeably on the contract.  But, as I 
understand it, not on first-hand knowledge, but in terms of 
the information that we have been provided thus far, it 
would seem like that there was an underlying sub-
contractor agreement between Regiments and Trillian, 
regarding some secondment of certain stuff that would give 
rise to the services being provided, ostensibly, by Trillian 
and, therefore the payment being made. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but I want you to be clear to the 
Chairperson who rendered the services in respect of the 
10 
corporate plan? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, it was both McKinsey and their sub-
contractor at the time, Trillian.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is your evidence? 
MR SINGH:   That is my evidence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So it was not Regiments which 
rendered services in respect of the corporate plan? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, as I understand it, and this is what 
I was trying to clarify, was that there was a secondment 
agreement between Regiments and Trillian that existed at 
20 
the time that enabled Trillian to deliver the services.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, well, let us deal with that because 
I thought you would be open and frank, in regard to this to 
the Chairperson, because the evidence you would know 
that Trillian did not render the services in respect of the 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 85 of 328 
 
corporate plan.  Your comment on that, you stand by what 
you're saying?  
MR SINGH:   That is correct, sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You stand by what you said, when were 
the services in respect of the corporate plan rendered?  
MR SINGH:   Between the period I would say November of 
- this thing was signed September, so maybe the 1 s t of 
October through to the 28 t h of February. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   October 2015? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To February 2016.  In your affidavit 
page 620 let me start there. 
MR SINGH:   620? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   620, yes Eskom bundle 16…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I wanted you to give the full 
reference for purposes of the transcript. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Eskom bundle 16, page 620.  An 
allegation gets to be made by Mr Koko which you deny in 
paragraph 82.  Now 81 reads Mr Koko makes reference to 
Trillian employees who were present at Eskom from 
20 
January 2016.  You said 82: 
“I also deny.” 
And that also is important because somebody else in fact, 
other people have denied.   
“I also deny Koko statement that Trillian employees 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 86 of 328 
 
were present at Eskom from January 2016.” 
And you are correct they were not there, in fact not until 
March 2016 that employees moved from Regiments to 
Trillian. 
MR SINGH:   Can I respond? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, please.  
MR SINGH:   I think Mr Chair in this case, there is a clear 
error in the affidavit that I had submitted.  The comments 
that I intended to make in this paragraph relating to Mr 
Koko’s reference to January 2016.   
10 
In actual fact, what I intended to say here was that I 
disagree with the date and it actually was prior to January 
2016 in terms of the contract that we had agreed with 
McKinsey at the time.  So it would have predated January 
2016.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So what you intended to say is not 
expressed here? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And when you say also, you also deny 
who else do you know has denied that Trillian had 
20 
employees in January 2016?  
MR SINGH:   I think it was Ms Goodson I think at the – I 
think Mr Koko referenced Ms Goodson’s affidavit as well in 
terms of a date as to when McKinsey or Trillian employees 
arrived at Eskom.  But from my perspective, in delivering 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 87 of 328 
 
the 
corporate 
plan, 
the 
corporate 
plan 
engagements 
occurred on almost a daily to a weekly basis, and I had 
engaged with Eskom, McKinsey, Regiments, Trillian people 
from way before 2016 or January 2016. So what was 
actually happening on the ground was certainly not 2016 or 
January 2016.  
And Mr Chair, further the corporate plan process as 
envisaged in the agreement was a period probably about 
six months, and we do not, it is not practically possible to 
deliver an Eskom corporate plan from January to February. 
10 
So the reference to January is misguided.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, well, your denial here is that you 
deny the allegation that Trillian employees were present at 
Eskom from January 2016.  
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, as I have indicated, I think it is an 
error on my part but the factual statement that I can make 
today is that the corporate plan began when the contract 
was awarded in probably around the first week of October, 
and ran through to probably the middle of February 
because there is probably two or three weeks that you 
20 
need to print the document as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it not the position that Trillian did not 
exists until at the earliest than January 2016 and what you 
had before that was Regiments, and there was, it would 
seem a fallout among the partners or the directors as a 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 88 of 328 
 
result of which Trillian was established, and I think, if I 
recall correctly from evidence and documents that I have 
seen, and that I have heard there was some tension 
between the two about some of the jobs that had to be 
done and so on.  Is that not the position as far as you 
know as well? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I think, you know, we got Mr Weiss 
to come and try and explain the issues relating to 
McKinsey, Regiments in Trillian.  We now have me here 
today trying to explain the McKinsey, Regiments and 
10 
Trillian scenario or scenarios.  Again, I would suggest that 
the best people to explain that is maybe Regiments or 
Trillian themselves. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I am not sure that Mr Singh, you can 
get away with it as easily as that because Eskom had to 
know who it had obligations with whom.  It could not just 
pay people money without knowing whether those people 
are the right people to pay because they rendered services 
or not, because I think that is where the question, Mr 
Saleka’s question was, if I understood it correctly it started 
20 
with the payment. 
 To the extent that the payment was for Trillian and 
Trillian rendered a service, if I remember correctly, I 
thought that was the line but I may have – Mr Seleka am I 
thinking along the correct lines? 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 89 of 328 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is Chair, it has…[intervene] 
MR SINGH:   Can I respond to Chair? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You want to – okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, we did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, firstly, I do not try and get away 
from this thing as you put it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SINGH:   Eskom did in its defence, do what was 
10 
required in terms of the processes to establish who needed 
to be paid.  They engaged with McKinsey, they obtained a 
letter from McKinsey, for approval for the payment for 
Trillian.  
The individuals paid relating to the approval to pay 
Trillian 
was 
very 
senior 
people 
within 
McKinsey 
environment.  It was the head of legal, it was the head of 
accounts and so on.  So, we also got approval from 
McKinsey to the extent that the deliverables that we 
agreed, have been delivered.  
20 
So, from that perspective, Mr Chair Eskom had 
done, in my view, what it needed to do to establish who 
should be paid and what was delivered.  Which is, again, 
the process that are outlined in terms of was the goods 
received, was the goods delivered and is there a payment 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 90 of 328 
 
to be made, and who is it to be made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if the services were rendered in 
October 2015, November 25, or even earlier and as a 
matter of fact Trillian did not exist at that time.  It cannot 
be said that it is Trillian who rendered those services 
during that time, is that not correct? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, that is why I am trying to provide 
you with context around what I understand to be a sub-
contractor 
agreement 
that 
existed, 
or 
a 
secondment 
agreement that existed at the time between Regiments and 
10 
Trillian. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no I think I understand what you are 
saying what you are telling me is what steps Eskom 
took…[intervene] 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   …to try and make sure that it paid the 
right entity.  
MR SINGH:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
CHAIRPERSON:   That may be fine and well but I am 
20 
addressing the equation of whether factually it could be 
said that Trillian, which was being paid had rendered 
services, if the services were rendered in October or 
November, when it did not exist, whether or not Eskom 
acted reasonably in the steps that it took to try an 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 91 of 328 
 
ascertain who was the right entity to repay might be 
another issue. 
 That might arise to say, we may have paid the wrong 
entity, but we took steps that we regarded as reasonable 
and maybe we were misled, you know I am just making an 
example.  But if factually that entity did not exist, then 
factually that entity could not have provided services, there 
might be another explanation why Trillian was paid but it 
cannot be ...[indistinct – audio/word cut out] Trillian 
provided, rendered the services in that situation. 
10 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I will go back to the – I will make two 
points.  The first point is it is my understanding that a 
secondment agreement existed that enabled Regiments staff 
to act as Trillian employees. So they were there – they were 
on the ground they were doing work.  Okay. 
 
Secondly we took steps as you said to identify the 
party that needed to be paid.  If those steps indicated X we 
paid X.  If indeed we paid the wrong party then we were 
misled by the individuals that participated in that process.  In 
this case would be McKinsey.  Okay. 
20 
 
And again I am not saying that they misled us I have 
outlined the steps that Eskom had taken which had been 
confirmed by McKinsey and which Mr Weiss again confirmed. 
 
Thirdly if the – if the 00:01:09 services were then 
rendered by Regiments as we are trying to establish Eskom 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 92 of 328 
 
never received an invoice from Regiments.  From the time – 
from the time that this assignment had been conducted and 
concluded to the time I had left I did not receive a claim from 
Regiments relating to proper claims. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But going back to what I said earlier on as 
I understood you the services in connection with the 
00:01:45 were rendered during 2015.  Is that correct? 
MR SINGH:  From I would – yes, yes Mr Chair around 2015 – 
October 2015 through to February 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so into 2016? 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 16 – February 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja okay.  And the question of when 
Trillian came into existence are you also able to accept that 
it only came into existence in 2016 that seems to be my 
recollection of the evidence or is that something you do not 
know? 
MR SINGH:  I do not know that Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  So you know the 
evidence of Ms Bianca Goodson who you mentioned who 
says that even as at March 20 – well the end of February 
2016 in the office at Trillian as employees it was herself, the 
CEO and a gentleman who was the COO.  She was an 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 93 of 328 
 
employee – she was the CEO of Trillian and she says we did 
not render services in respect of the corporate plan. 
MR SINGH:  So then who did the corporate plan?  As Mr 
Weiss confirmed and I confirm today there were Trillian 
employees, there were Eskom employees and there were 
McKinsey employees and there were Regiments employees. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But there could not have been Trillian 
employees in October and November 2015 because Trillian 
did not exist as I understand it.  I hope I am not mistaken.  
Only – at least it only – I think she said she was the first 
10 
employee. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of Trillian that is Ms Goodson and she 
began in February – in February or mid- - or January? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  January. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh January. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So to the extent that services were 
provided or rendered prior to January 2016 as I see the 
position they could not have been rendered by Trillian.  They 
20 
may have been rendered by employees of Regiments some 
of whom may have later in 2016 gone into – into.. 
MR SINGH:  Trillian. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The employ of Trillian but she was not one 
of those employees; she had not been employed by 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 94 of 328 
 
Regiments before. 
MR SINGH:  That is correct Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And she says as Mr Seleka says as at 
even much it was just herself and the COO. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But at least as of February she says it was 
just the two of them and she says they did not render such 
service. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair if we reference back to the meeting 
that Ms Goodson had with Mr Koko I think Ms Goodson – 
10 
well Mr Koko references an invoice that Ms Goodson 
requested direct payment for and that is the exact same R30 
million invoice that we are talking about now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but – but she was talking exactly about 
the same in effect and Mr Seleka will tell me if I am 
misrepresenting Ms Goodson saying in effect Eskom was 
being asked to make a payment to us in respect of services 
that we did not render. 
MR SINGH:  But they knew Mr Chair why did she not raise 
that issue with Mr Koko on the day and say that we cannot – 
20 
you cannot do this.   
CHAIRPERSON:  But before you pay Trillian you must make 
sure they have rendered services to you. 
MR SINGH:  Which in my view we can 00:06:13 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm – but you cannot say that Trillian 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 95 of 328 
 
rendered services when you cannot say that they were 
Trillian employees who rendered services because she says 
January, February it was just the two of them and she says 
we did not render that service. 
MR SINGH:  But Mr Chair on your own version or in your 
own interpretation as you were putting it to me you said 
there was a period of time when Regiments employees would 
have rendered services. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SINGH:  In terms of the secondment agreement. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
MR SINGH:  There would have then been a point in time 
when those people would have been seconded into Es – into 
Trillian. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
No 
they 
were 
not 
seconded 
as 
I 
understand it. 
MR SINGH:  Oh they moved – moved over as employees. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They moved over and became employees. 
MR SINGH:  As some section. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They left Trillian. 
20 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They left Regiments. 
MR SINGH:  Regiments into – into… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  Into Trillian. So when – when I am responding I 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 96 of 328 
 
am responding to the extent that we were recipients of this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were? 
MR SINGH:  We were recipients of this process.  The 
contract – the sub-contractor relationship is not one that 
Eskom manages.   
CHAIRPERSON:  But you are paying them.  You are paying 
them millions. 
MR SINGH:  And that is why Mr Chair – and that is why Mr 
Chair there are processes in place that enables us to verify 
who we paying and what we paying and that is the process 
10 
that we followed.  Our – our processes require us to confirm 
that with the main contractor which is what we did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But as you sit there is it not true or would 
you not concede that you are not able to say that Trillian 
existed or had employees for January 2016? 
MR SINGH:  Well Mr Chair as I said I do not know when they 
were incorporated so… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you do not know when they were 
incorporated.  Now somebody who was employed as the CEO 
of Trillian Ms Goodson has come before the commission and 
20 
said under oath in January 2016 I was the first employee of 
Trillian.  Then there was the COO.  In March it was still just 
– in February it was still the two of us.  We did not render 
any service for which Trillian was supposed to be paid this 
amount.  I am saying to you are you in a position to dispute 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 97 of 328 
 
that evidence? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I am in a position to dispute it to the 
extent that Eskom followed a process to verify the payment 
prior 
to 
have 
been 
made 
and 
that 
process 
entailed 
engagement with McKinsey and McKinsey confirmed what 
was required to be confirmed for that payment to be made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no but you – you not dealing with the 
question.  You as Eskom took certain steps before you made 
payment. 
MR SINGH:  Yes Sir. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  To satisfy yourself on whatever you wanted 
to satisfy yourself on.  But the position is the CEO of Trillian 
at the time says I was the first employee of Trillian in 
January 2016.  Then I think a little later COO joined and by 
February or in February it was still the two of us.  We did not 
render that service that Eskom is talking about and so I am 
suggesting to you that I cannot see how you can deny when 
she says we did not render that service.  You might say I 
think we were justified in making the payment to Trillian 
because of ABCD but I cannot see how you can deny the 
20 
evidence – her evidence that was I did not render that 
service and it is the COO was the only other employee of 
Trillian except myself also did.  You are not going to be able 
I would imagine to say I saw them rendering that service and 
when they were rendering that service they were rendering 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 98 of 328 
 
that service in their capacity as employees of Trillian. 
MR SINGH:  But Mr Chair on – on Ms Goodson’s statement 
as it relates to her rendering the service I am not too sure if 
she rendered any service because she did not interact with 
me.  So to that extent I cannot dispute what she is saying.  
But I can certainly tell you what we had – steps we had done 
as Eskom to ensure that we – services were delivered and 
that the entity that was being paid was contemplated as part 
of this main contractor agreement with McKinsey. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  But of course also you would agree 
10 
as a general proposition and I would leave it at that that if 
Regiments was the entity that was a sub-contractor in regard 
to the corporate plan and its employees had rendered 
services but they later moved to Trillian as a general 
proposition one would expect that you would still as Eskom 
pay 
Regiments 
because 
those 
employees 
would 
have 
rendered 
services 
not 
in 
their 
personal 
capacity 
but 
employees of Regiments if you had – if that was the 
situation.  Would you agree with that at a general level? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I would agree to the extent that 
20 
Regiments then raised an invoice on Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  But Regiments never did so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  But Regiments could not raise 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 99 of 328 
 
invoice directly to Eskom because Regiments would have 
been a sub-contractor to McKinsey and you had nothing to 
do with the sub-contractors as Eskom. 
MR SINGH:  I do not understand your question Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh he is saying – he is saying if 
Regiments was involved it was not involved as a contracting 
party with Eskom.  It would have been involved as a sub-
contractor to McKinsey and therefore being a sub-contractor 
for McKinsey it had no – it would have had no basis to raise 
an invoice directly with Eskom because it had no contract 
10 
with Eskom.  It had to raise whatever invoice with McKinsey 
and I am now obviously elaborating on his question.  So the 
expectation would be that when McKinsey raised its invoice 
with Eskom it would incorporate whatever it needed to pay 
Regiments because Regiments was their sub-contractor.  
Regiments would not be entitled to send a separate invoice 
directly to Eskom when they had no contract with Eskom. 
MR SINGH:  But Mr Chair my point still stands respectfully.  
In my view if Regiments had a legitimate expectation to be 
paid they will have raised an invoice to McKinsey on your 
20 
version directly else they would have raised an invoice 
directly to Eskom on my view.  And in neither instance have I 
heard that Regiments ever raised an invoice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was your understanding of the 
relationship between Regiments and McKinsey during 2015 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 100 of 328 
 
in the context of the corporate plan?  Was it your 
understanding that they were sub-contractors to McKinsey – 
Regiments during 2015? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair as I think it is common cause by now 
that there was an envisaged transition and that would 
happened due to the – how can you say?  The merger and 
acquisition discussions that were happening between the 
Regiments partners at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the – that may have happened 
towards the end of the year but I am just talking during – let 
10 
us say during the second half of the year you joined Eskom 
in August – beginning of August 2015. 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And actually prior to that you had 
discussions with McKinsey even before being seconded to 
Eskom. 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So was your understanding throughout 
those meetings and after you had been seconded to Eskom 
but 
prior 
to 
the 
end 
of 
February 
2016 
was 
your 
20 
understanding 
that 
there 
was 
a 
relationship 
between 
McKinsey and Regiments. 
MR SINGH:  Ja definitely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was that? 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 101 of 328 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And did you understand them to be a sub-
contractor or did you understand them to have some other 
relationship with McKinsey? 
MR SINGH:  Well Mr Chair I think for you to be a sub-
contractor there needed to be a specific main contractor. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course yes. 
MR SINGH:  That then enabled you to be a sub-contractor. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  But my understanding at the time was that 
McKinsey and Regiments had a strategic relationship. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  ja. 
MR SINGH:  That if and when. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  They… 
CHAIRPERSON:  The contract was concluded. 
MR SINGH:  The contract was concluded they would then be 
a preferred sub-contractor. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  Depending on the type of contract that they got. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay no okay.   
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Well I see we are at one – two 
minutes past one Mr Seleka.  Do you have one or two 
questions you want to put or we can adjourn? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I think it will be appropriate to adjourn 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 102 of 328 
 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright.  Let us adjourn now I am 
going to add thirty minutes then to enable Mr Singh’s legal 
team to consult with him.  So we are going to resume at half 
past two.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Chairperson may I be allowed 
10 
just to quickly place something on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  And you have to forgive me I will 
have to refer to the information that I got on Whatsapp we 
will make sure that we give hard copies to yourself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  I have taken the liberty of 
forwarding the information to my learned friend so the – 
what we have done is my attorneys went and obtained the 
CIPC records of Trillian Management Consulting Services 
20 
and that is the entity that you will recall that Savier refers 
to,. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  And it is clear from here that the 
registration date Chairperson is the 13.04.2015. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 103 of 328 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh the registration of Trillian? 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  And then according to the 
director details Bianca Smith nee Goodson as we know was 
appointed on the 19 November of 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  To become a director. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  So I just thought that we just set 
10 
the record straight pertaining to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that – that is important. Let us obtain 
that information.  It may well be that Ms Goodson may have 
said she was appointed at some stage in 2015 but I 
thought that the actual commencement of her employment 
she said was January 2016. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that might – it may be that she was 
appointed in 2015 but actually started working in 2016.  We 
will need to check because she dealt with that in her 
20 
evidence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that information is important. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  No Chairperson I – if my memory 
serves me right her evidence was actually you will recall I 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 104 of 328 
 
cannot remember the entity that she left to take up this 
position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  And she actually gave evidence 
that she started early.  She was supposed to start with the 
contract I think in 2016 but she started working somewhere 
in 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. Okay. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  As I said I just speak from 
memory now.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  I cannot recall exactly what she 
said but that is my recollection and if I am incorrect forgive 
me please. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no that is fine we must just 
double check what the correct information is. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  YEs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if necessary she may be asked to 
clarify whatever may need to be clarified but it might be 
necessary to just go back to the transcript because in her 
20 
evidence she deal – dealt with that.  And there you may be 
right she may have said that before January 2016 she may 
have started doing some things for Trillian even though she 
may not have formally commenced her employment with 
Trillian.  She may have said something – I think – I think 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 105 of 328 
 
somebody will just need to check so that we have got those 
facts right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chair I know. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  And then – sorry Mr Seleka if I 
may 
just 
continue 
one 
– 
with 
one 
further 
issue.  
Chairperson you will also then remember that my learned 
friend almost at the onset of leading the evidence of Mr 
Singh referred him to certain emails and maybe just to 
make it easy for us all it relates to Pandora  or Project 
Pandora.  My learned friend has very graciously provided 
10 
us with the said emails 23 June 2015 that is – that 
emanates from Mr Vikas Sagar of McKinsey and on perusal 
of same and again we have informed my learned friend all 
the person lists – all the people listed here are all Transnet 
people. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  So it is – I do not see any 
reference here to Eskom that is number 1.  And then I also 
had copies of the – or I looked at the ones very briefly 
because we had to take screenshots of it of the ones that 
20 
was attached to Ms Goodson’s affidavit MM2 and MM3 and 
again I say this very quickly because the photographs are 
not that clear.  Also in respect of them I do not see any 
direct reference to Eskom itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.   
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 106 of 328 
 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Can I start with the 
first one Chair?  The affidavit of Ms Goodson she does say 
she signed the agreement on the 17 t h of November 2015 
officially commenced 1 January 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of finishing where she was 
employed before being employed by … 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Trillian. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Trillian does – does she say when she 
stopped working for whatever the entity was or does she 
not deal with that? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  She does say but I cannot recall 
offhand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But I know that she was serving her 
notice period I think and nonetheless she said she went to 
Trillian in December 2015. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That she was doing certain things in 
December. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Certain things ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja but officially started on the 1 s t of 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 107 of 328 
 
January. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is one.  Number 2 about the 
emails. The first ones my learned friend referred to I have 
not introduced them yet and I could – I can do so now.  The 
second one she is referring to which are the annexures to 
Mr Motephu’s affidavit they are attached as evidence of Mr 
Mothepu’s version.  So what we are only doing Chair is 
putting to Mr Singh the evidence substantiated by those 
emails of Mr Mothepu.  Mr Mothepu is the one saying we 
10 
had meetings with the CFO and in regard to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Eskom 
ADV SELEKA SC:  In regard to Eskom but he was at 
Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  And Mr Singh has said there were 
no officials of Eskom that he can recall in those meetings.  
So it would not surprise me if there are no emails about 
you know either specifically Eskom or specifically a person 
in Eskom in that communication.   
20 
 
The first set of .. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what – one thing that is – that is 
established because Mr Singh … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Admits it. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 108 of 328 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I was going to say that as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that before he was seconded to 
Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He did have meetings with McKinsey in 
regard to Eskom matters. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That – that is common cause now. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Which is the evidence of Mr Mothepu. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The second – these emails which I will 
now introduce Chairperson they also have the subject line 
Pandora or Project Pandora and I wish to introduce them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do the emails that seem to refer to 
Transnet according to counsel for Mr Singh do they refer to 
anything relating to Eskom such as the – such as Project 
Pandora or whatever it was called?  Do they refer to 
anything that is attached or relates to Eskom in the text or 
20 
anywhere? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  They – they have a subject Project 
Pandora. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I see there is an attachment which is 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 109 of 328 
 
not printed out so we do not have a specific documentation 
that makes reference to Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if Project Pandora was an Eskom 
project and not a Transnet project then – then one could 
say it – they contain a heading that relates to an Eskom  
project although it was a McKinsey project for Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is right Chair and that is what I 
wanted to put to Mr Singh. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  To explore.  Ja but the text does not 
seem to say anything that can specifically be … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Identified with Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Chairperson just one more thing 
I think that it is quite important is that this issue of Project 
Pandora there is no affidavit anywhere in the – in the 
Eskom neither in the Transnet bundle for that matter 
20 
dealing with this.  We do not know what it is, we do not 
know where it comes from, there is nobody that deposed to 
it to explain what it is.  And then just going back to the 
affidavit – ag to the emails that my learned friend wish to 
introduce.  All the parties listed here Yusuf Mohammed, 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 110 of 328 
 
Transnet Corporate, Norman Mbaso, Corporate Transnet 
Corporate.  It is – it is all related to people that is within 
Transnet.  So it is – you cannot even from that draw an 
inference that it relates to – to Eskom because it is 
specifically directed at Transnet employees. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I think what we should do is I do 
not know whether Ms Mothepu said anything in her affidavit 
but in her oral evidence she certainly dealt with the – what 
she called Project Pandora.  So there is something in her 
transcript – there would be something in her transcript. 
10 
What may need to be explored but again it just depends 
how important it is to – to spend time on it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What – to say what was that project – 
what did that – was that project confined to Eskom or did it 
spread over a number of entities such as Transnet?  But 
again it just depends how important it is.  As I say what is 
common cause is that Mr Singh did have a series of 
meetings with McKinsey. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before he was seconded to Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is common cause. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 111 of 328 
 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Chairperson just – sorry this 
would be my last remarks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  The second affidavit you will 
recall that when Mr Singh – when he was confronted with 
these emails he clearly states it to my learned friend it 
might be a second affidavit I have not seen it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  We want to place on record that 
we were not served with the 3.3 Notice in respect of this 
10 
affidavit.  Came to our attention basically because of this 
because you can imagine the – the reference, the link that 
was sent through to us I think it was last Friday contained 
a vast number of documents that we had to work through 
and then lastly I want to place on record but I will – we will 
deal with it in due course that – and I think the record 
would reflect it.  I think I must mention it.  When Mr Seleka 
and I do not point fingers at him started off with this issue 
he put it to Mr Singh against a certain backdrop if I can 
call it and I think the record will reflect that that backdrop 
20 
visa vie this is incorrect.  So one must then see Mr Singh’s 
answer in relation to what was put to him without showing 
him the actual emails and then asking him to comment on 
this.  But we will – will deal with that in due course and I 
think it is important just as I said to mention it especially 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 112 of 328 
 
since it is stated by yourself that it is now common cause.  
I 
think 
we 
need 
to 
explore 
that 
more 
against 
the 
background of what we have now learnt once we have had 
a look at the relevant emails.  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No, no, that is fine.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  I am getting a date 
for services of Rule 3.3 Notices Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Chair I could deal with these 
emails very quickly. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may do so if it is… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja just very quickly Mr Singh sorry I 
want to hand up one to Mr Singh and to the Chairperson.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may proceed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Mr Singh these emails I will 
refer to them in light of the response by – or the 
explanation by you that you did not have meetings in June 
2015. 
 
Now these 
emails 
you 
can see 
there is 
a 
handwritten marking there; there is three pages of them.  
On the first page you have number 1 and then number 2.  
20 
Number 1 is an email from Mr Yusuf Mohammed Transnet 
Corporate JHB and it is written to Mr Vikas Sagar of 
McKinsey and there is no – Norman Mbaso copied.  
Norman Mbaso at Transnet and the date is 23 June 2015 
subject is Venue Pandora.  And the email reads: 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 113 of 328 
 
“Hi please advise on the venue for your 
session 
with 
Anoj 
tomorrow. 
 
Regards 
Yusaf.” 
And then email… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, I am sorry.  Oh yes reading 
the bottom email … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  On the first page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On what you have marked as first page. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay this is from who to whom? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is an email from Mr Yusaf Mohamed 
to Mr Vikas Sagar of McKinsey in which he copied Mr 
Norman Mbaso of Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that line that is drawn just above 
where you might … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You – page 1. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is in a wrong place.  It should be above – 
it should be just below Vikas Sagar Director McKinsey and 
20 
Company Johannesburg and the 00:17:02 there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  28 Chair it would – it would appear to 
be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because it makes – it creates the 
impression that the information about it relates to the top 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 114 of 328 
 
email. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  But – correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well for my own understanding I am 
going to  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Or except Chair the message below the 
line is exactly the same as the message above the details 
of the email address from whom it was sent to whom it was 
– it was sent.  You read the message the fonts which are in 
blue it also says: 
“Hi please advise on the venue for session 
10 
with Anoj tomorrow.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The date is still 23 June 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  Okay.  Yes you may continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Singh I am going to take you 
through all of them and then I will ask you to comment on 
this.   
 
Then the second email at the top of the page it is 
from Mr Vikas Sagar of McKinsey on Tuesday 23 June 2015 
it is addressed to Yusuf Mohamed of Transnet copied 
20 
Norman Mbaso say: 
“Hello Yusaf the open 20 Kruger Street 
Maboneng Precinct we are starting at 9am.” 
So that seems to be a response to Mr Yusaf and gives the 
address of the venue – of the meeting – address for the 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 115 of 328 
 
meeting and the starting time.  And then please turn the 
page to what is marked as number 3.  I think there the 
details are given.  The subject is 00:18:02 Condola the 
location is the Open Top Floor the Main Change 20 Kruger 
Street Maboneng Johannesburg.  The start time date and 
time are given.  Meeting status not yet responded.  And 
then the organiser is indicated to be Anoj Singh.   
 
And you turn to the last page which is marked page 
4 – I mean email on the 4 t h it has – it has the same details 
in fact as the previous one but in the middle of the page 
10 
there is an email from you Mr Anoj Singh on the 23 June 
2015 at 4:47 pm to Anoj Singh Corporate Yusaf Mohamed 
Transnet – subject is Project Pandora – when 24 June 
2015 7:30am – where the Open 4 t h Floor the Main Change 
20 Kruger Street Maboneng Johannesburg. 
 
And the question I would like to ask you Mr Anoj – 
Mr Singh and maybe you could explain to the Chairperson 
is whether this Project Pandora is the same as the one you 
were dealing with in July 2015 as referred to by Ms 
Mothepu? 
20 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair as I testified earlier and I do not 
recall the Project Pandora specifically that is what I 
testified to earlier okay.  For me to confirm whether this 
Pandora and the Eskom Pandora is the same unfortunately 
I cannot do that. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 116 of 328 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But can you tell the Chairperson 
whether at Transnet did you call any project Project 
Pandora? 
MR SINGH:  Well Mr Chair as I testified I would not call a 
project Pandora it would be McKinsey that called or named 
projects. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes but specifically at Transnet was 
here a project called Project Pandora? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair as I testified I do not recall. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But now in the last page of the email 
10 
the subject – the email comes from you on the 23 r d it has 
that subject Project Pandora. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair this… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  What can you say about that? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair as you would see these emails or the 
meeting status is not yet responded.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
MR SINGH:  The meeting status has not yet responded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is not yet responded. 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  So these meetings when – this particular 
meeting was not accepted or confirmed okay.  Secondly 
this Anoj Singh Corporate for example the access to my 
diary at Transnet was accessible to my PA, was accessible 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 117 of 328 
 
to Mr Yusaf Mohamed and was accessible if I am not 
incorrect to Mr Mbaso who is Norman.  So anyone of these 
people could have initiated, changed, made amendments, 
postponed, cancelled these meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There may be a need to look at other 
information or emails or so on that may throw light but on 
the face of it it does not seem likely that if it is true what 
they wrote here that you were the organiser of the meeting 
I guess I am looking at page 3 as well as page 4 or is it 
email 3, email4? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Rather than page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the face of it it would seem unlikely 
that people who had been invited to a meeting that you 
were organising would be told it is a meeting about Project 
Pandora without you the organiser knowing that this is – 
this meetings is about Project Pandora. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair that is not what I am disputing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Heh? 
20 
MR SINGH:  That is not what I am disputing Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
MR SINGH:  All I am saying is that even Mr Mohamed, Mr 
Mbaso or my PA Ms Khanye could have arranged this 
meeting but in all likelihood it seems like Mr Yusaf would 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 118 of 328 
 
have been setting up the meeting given the context at 
number 2 okay and all I am trying to suggest is that the 
email show what they show but the meeting may have not 
happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no, no I think we may be speaking at 
cross purposes.  What I am dealing with is the question of 
whether you knew about Project Pandora or not that is 
what I am… 
MR SINGH:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is what I am dealing with.  You 
10 
have said I think you – you have no recollection – I am 
sorry.  I normally switch off my phone – I do not know what 
happened today.  I – you said you do not recall. 
MR SINGH:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A project called Project Pandora so all I 
am simply saying is if you were the organiser of a meeting 
or meetings where those who were invited to the meeting 
were told that the subject matter of the discussions would 
be Project Pandora on the face of it it – it seems unlikely 
you would not be aware that the subject matter is on 
20 
Project Pandora.  You have no issues with that? 
MR SINGH:  No Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Singh turning 
lastly back to the page – the first page the email – it is not 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 119 of 328 
 
from you but it specifically says: 
“Advice on the venue for your session with 
Anoj tomorrow.” 
And then the time is given and the venue being Maboneng 
Precinct which coincidentally is the same venue that Ms 
Mothepu mentions as one of the venues you had a meeting 
at.  The meeting was to start at nine o’clock according to 
this email did you – did you have this meeting? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I think – I would be remarkable if I 
could remember the specifics of this meeting or the day on 
10 
which it occurred.  I do not recall this meeting. As I said or 
as I testified earlier I acknowledge the fact that we had 
meetings as Ms Mothepu has outlined in her affidavit 
during July.  If we had a meeting in the last week of June 
then we did.  I do not recall it.  Based on this it does seem 
like there is any confirmation in terms of the meeting had 
occurred but if it possibly could. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Sorry Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Again and as I said I do not want 
20 
to unnecessarily intervene but what is put to Mr Singh visa 
vie the affidavit of Ms Mosilo Mothepu is not correct 
because in her paragraph 22 in the affidavit the one that 
we said we only learnt of later she says: 
“The meetings were during Anoj’s time as 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 120 of 328 
 
acting CFO at Eskom.” 
Nothing to do with Transnet.  So to try and establish this 
link on the face of emails that is totally different is …o to 
try and establish this link on the face of emails that is 
totally different is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no, no, no.  Everyone accepts that Ms 
Mothepu’s evidence related to meetings that took place 
involving Mr Singh that related to Eskom.  Everybody 
accepts that.  There is an issue as I understand it about 
when those meetings took place.  Mr Singh says I think he 
10 
says his recollection is that it was July.  I do not know 
whether he is definite than that – that it was – it could not 
have been or was not June but my understanding is that he 
says his recollection was that they were in July.  As I 
understand it either Ms Mothepu or somebody seems to say 
they did or some meetings involving Mr Singh did happen 
before July and Dr Weiss might be one, I am not sure, and 
so on.  I took it that Mr Seleka is trying to explore the 
question of when those meetings happened, whether they 
happened before July or not. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because Dr Weiss places those 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 121 of 328 
 
meetings in May 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But my learned friend should read to 
you, Chair, the entire paragraph because the paragraph 
reads: 
“Regiments and McKinsey were negotiating the 
Master Service Agreement with Anoj Singh in 
his capacity...” 
 
Which is where my learned friend is referring to. 
“...as acting Chief Financial Officer...” 
10 
 
Then she says: 
“...when I joined Regiments in June 2015...” 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now you know in June 2015 what was 
the position in regards to Mr Anoj Singh.  Then she goes 
on to say: 
“However, Singh...” 
 
I will say Mr Singh because she just writes 
Singh. 
“...Singh was, in fact, still an employee of 
20 
Transnet at the time...” 
 
And that is the point you are trying to make 
Chair to my learned friend. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m.  Okay I think let us continue.  
Let us all try to just establish what the position is. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 122 of 328 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Mr Singh then, during – 
just before the lunch time, we went through the agreement, 
the MSC, the letter of acceptance, the MSC, the date when 
the agreement was signed which is by Eskom on the 
4 t h of May 2016. 
 
We have dealt with the issue about who actually 
rendered the services and Ms Goodson has said Trillian did 
not render the services in respect of the Corporate Plan.  
10 
Ms Matshepo has said it was Regiments.  She was an 
employee of Regiments when services in respect of the 
Corporate Plan were rendered. 
 
You have sought to indicate and maybe you can 
confirm that that is your evidence, that Trillian is in fact 
the 
one 
which 
rendered 
services 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
Corporate Plan.  Is that your position? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I thought your position was not 
20 
exactly that but you – I will give you a chance to clarify.  I 
thought your position was, particularly when I was asking 
you some questions before lunch, I thought your position 
was. 
 
You cannot dispute Ms Goodson’s evidence that 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 123 of 328 
 
Trillian did not render services but you as Eskom people 
took various steps which you have regarded as reasonable 
to establish who should be paid and you may have been 
mislead 
but 
you 
then 
paid 
Trillian 
because 
on 
the 
information you had, Trillian was the entity to pay. 
 
I understood you to be saying that.  I may have 
understood you. 
MR SINGH:   Certainly Mr Chair.  I think my or my 
summation at the time was premised on the basis that you 
had put to me that Trillian did not exist at the time.  Now 
10 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I was saying on the evidence of 
Ms Goodson’s. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   Hence I am saying now.  The evidence that 
we now know is that Trillian was in existing at the time.  
Not only was it in existence at the time, Ms Goodson was 
actually a director of the company during the period – time 
when the Corporate Plan Service was being delivered(?).   
20 
 
She 
also 
attended 
meetings 
with 
McKinsey 
relating to the activities that were happening between 
Eskom and McKinsey at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Even went to the extent, as I said, presenting 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 124 of 328 
 
the Corporate Plan invoice to Mr Koko. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I am not sure...  I think what you 
are saying suggests to me that what you are – what your 
position is now is different from what it was before lunch 
because before lunch you were not aware that Trillian was 
incorporated sometime in – early in 2015.   
 
And you might also not have been aware that 
Ms Goodson was appointed in November at Trillian.  And 
now that you know that you are saying your position is 
different.  Is my understanding correct? 
10 
MR SINGH:   That is correct Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   And I would like to emphasise that she was 
appointed as a director ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR SINGH:   ...to Trillian in November. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  But...  Well, let me start here.  
I did not – I do not know whether your counsel, when she 
told me what the information was that she obtained about 
her appointment. 
20 
 
I am not sure whether that information was 
indicating when she actually commenced employment with 
Trillian, namely, in November or whether it might be a case 
of 
having 
been 
appointed 
in 
November 
but 
only 
commencing employment in January.  So I am not sure 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 125 of 328 
 
about that part. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, let me ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What has transpired is that, at least as 
far as Mr Seleka has been able to recall or check.  In her 
evidence, Ms Goodson did say she did begin to do some 
Trillian functions, I think, before the end of 2015, towards 
the end of 2015. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, exactly what she did, you 
know, maybe that can be checked, but I am surprised that 
10 
this information makes you change your position on 
whether or not Trillian rendered services because I would 
imagine that whether or not you know that Trillian rendered 
services, 
would 
depend 
on 
whether 
you 
saw 
them 
rendering the services or you have so proof of them 
rendering that service. 
 
And my – from all that you have said, I did not 
understand you say:  I did see them rendering the service 
that – for which we were paying them, for which we paid 
them.  And I did not hear you say:  Although I might not 
20 
have seen them rendering the service, I did see proof that 
they had actually rendered the service. 
 
You understand where my concern is about you 
changing your position? 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson? 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 126 of 328 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Sorry, I beg your forgiveness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   But I understood the – what 
happened or the discussion between yourself and Mr Sing 
that whilst he was explaining to you what Eskom did.  In 
that discussion he also mentioned to you they did in fact 
perform services there and he was aware of that fact.  I 
think the records ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   He may have.  He may have. 
10 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is why I am asking him because I 
want to make sure my understanding is correct. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If he says:  No, I did say because I did 
know, then that is fine.  I am just saying my understanding 
of – this is my understanding of what you said and then 
you can say:  No, I think you misunderstood.  I did say I 
did see them render the services or I had proof of the 
services they rendered.  So do you want to clarify? 
20 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I did say that I did see them 
rendering services. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   And the extent to which I can confirm that, 
Mr Chair, is that the Corporate Plan is not a simple 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 127 of 328 
 
process to accomplish because it brings together technical 
aspects, operational aspects, financial aspects, marketing 
aspects, HR aspects.  Every aspect of the business into a 
document.   
 
That requires an enormous amount of... and 
planning and alignment.  And those session used to 
happen, probably, on a weekly basis between myself, my 
team, the McKinsey Team, the Regiments/Trillian Team. 
 
And that is how I knew that anyone who is 
actually on the ground doing work.  I may have not seen 35 
10 
Trillian employees or Regiments employees or for that 
matter 
25 
McKinsey 
employees 
but 
based 
on 
those 
meetings that happened on a weekly basis, I got feedback 
from my people, I got feedback from McKinsey people, I 
got feedback from the Regiments/Trillian people. 
 
So from that perspective, Mr Chair, I have no 
doubt that people were on the ground doing what they 
ought to have done to deliver the Corporate Plan... 
CHAIRPERSON:   And when you talk about those meetings 
that you talked about and you see people rendering a 
20 
service, are you including the period, the 2015-period and 
you are not mixing it up with what may have happened in 
January and February 2016? 
MR SINGH:   No, Mr Chair, I think once I got to Eskom, in 
order for me to get up to speed with what was actually 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 128 of 328 
 
happening on a day to day basis, also when I needed to 
get up to date in what was due in the next three months, 
the next months, the best way to have done that, was 
actually to have these weekly meetings.   
 
And weekly meetings normally happened on a 
Monday, 
first 
things 
on 
a 
Monday 
morning 
and 
in 
preparation for the meeting on Monday morning, we 
normally have a debrief session on a Friday to understand 
who needs to talk about what on Monday. 
 
And those meetings normally used to happen in 
10 
the morning and should run through until eleven, twelve 
during the day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Now, are you able to say that 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
2015-period, 
those 
meetings 
were 
happening between Eskom and Trillian staff or are you only 
able to say meetings were happening between Eskom and 
certain people and I think they may have been Regiments, 
they may have been Trillian or both? 
MR SINGH:   So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or are you able to say, nobody can say 
20 
to me it was only Regiments staff? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I think, I certainly cannot, as I said 
to you, pinpoint who was who at what point in time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR SINGH:   So hence I used them interchangeable 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 129 of 328 
 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR SINGH:   ...and said Regiments fork ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR SINGH:   ...Regiments... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because the reason why I raise it is.  
Ms Goodson’s 
evidence, 
that 
seems 
to 
be 
quite 
categorical, that she was the first employee of Trillian and 
she formally started in January but I think, as Mr Seleka 
says, should they have done some tasks of Trillian during 
10 
November and December.   
 
I do not think we went into details about those 
where – but she – what did she says, which Mr Seleka, I 
think, referred to is, that she never rendered to Eskom the 
services that related to this payment of R 30 million.  I 
think she was categorically in regard to that.   
 
So that is why it becomes important to establish 
whether in your own mind you were – you are able to say:  
No, I know who was Trillian’s staff, I know who was 
Regiments’ staff.  So when I say in November/October 
20 
there were meetings relating to Eskom and Trillian and/or 
Regiments...  I know when they were together in meetings, 
I know when they are separate, I knew who is associated – 
who was associated at Trillian and who was associated 
with Regiments.   
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 130 of 328 
 
 
But I think from what you say, you say you are 
not sure.  You could not separate.  That is why you say 
Regiments/Trillian.  Am I right? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, because that was factual state at 
the time as I understood it.  I have also said that I am 
aware that there was an agreement or a secondment 
agreement between Regiments and Trillian relating to the 
secondment of certain staff. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay. 
MR SINGH:   So and we went then through the issue of 
10 
whether Regiments had a claim against either McKinsey or 
Eskom and on that basis I concluded that there was no 
claim that Regiments had made... or for that matter against 
Trillian.   
 
So from my perspective, as I understood it, for 
all intense and purposes, Trillian was McKinsey’s sub-
contractor of choice in the living Corporate Plan for which 
McKinsey confirmed at that stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do we know whether during 2015, there 
was a formal Regiments contract between McKinsey and 
20 
either Regiments or Trillian or both?  Mr Seleka, do we 
know that? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The secondment agreement between 
Regiments and Trillian, we are not aware of that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja-no, I am not talking about the 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 131 of 328 
 
secondment.  I am talking about...  Mr Singh has just said 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes? 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...I think he said Trillian was McKinsey’s 
subcontractor. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  So I am asking whether we know 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...whether that there was a formal 
10 
contract between McKinsey and Trillian during 2015 in 
terms of which Trillian could have rendered ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...a subcontracting service to McKinsey. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There was never a subcontract 
agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Do we know whether there was a 
subcontract agreement between McKinsey and Regiments 
20 
during 2015 in relation to Eskom? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   May I just...  Apparently there was a 
draft.  It was never signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 132 of 328 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But is that in line with your recollection? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I think Mr Pule is ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Seleka. 
MR SINGH:   ...produced the draft relating to the Corporate 
Plan.  There is a draft relating to the MSA that was never 
signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  But in terms of your recollection, 
what is your recollection in relation to McKinsey and 
Trillian in 2015?  Do you know whether there was a formal 
subcontract between the two of them in 2015? 
10 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I would be guessing but I do not 
think there was as Mr Seleka correctly states. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   But equally so.  I do not think there was an 
agreement between McKinsey and Regiments.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR SINGH:   ...Corporate Plan. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay.  Whatever there may have 
been, if there was, in relation to the Corporate Plan, as far 
as you are concerned.  So ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I can help ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   ...and the Commission, Mr Chair.  On the 
Transnet stream, the commission has produced a judgment 
relating to the Eskom/Trillian/McKinsey matter.   
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 133 of 328 
 
 
In that judgment, Mr Chair, I – if I follow it 
closely, and in that court papers there is the explanation 
associated with how this secondment happened, when it 
happened, who was part of it and why it happened.  So if it 
pleases the Commission, we will get access to those 
copies ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   ...and present them to you(?). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, no.  That is fine, ja.  No, that is 
fine.  So that would be good but your recollection is that 
10 
they do not say there was a contract that might explain 
how it worked but your recollection is not that anybody 
says there was a contract? 
MR SINGH:   Regiments and McKinsey ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   McKinsey, ja. 
MR SINGH:   ...for a Corporate plan... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, and that was my response to the 
20 
Chairperson.  So we are talking the same thing.  There was 
no subcontract between McKinsey and Regiments, you say, 
and Harry(?) had said even between McKinsey and Trillian. 
MR SINGH:   I did not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Even if there was a draft.  If it was not 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 134 of 328 
 
signed, it might not be worth anything because it was not 
signed. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Chair, but the inference is different 
though.  You will have to agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
MR SINGH:   That if there was a subcontract between 
Regiments and McKinsey, then the inference that we were 
discussing previously relating to the pain that they may 
have had ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
10 
MR SINGH:   ...becomes even greater.   
CHAIRPERSON:   No, if it was ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Exactly and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
...the 
draft 
is 
not 
good 
enough 
...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Hence I am saying I dispute the fact that 
there was a draft.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but all I am saying is ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...even if there was a draft, if it was not 
20 
signed, it does not mean anything on the face of it, you 
know, because no obligations will arise out of a draft that 
was never signed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Generally speaking. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 135 of 328 
 
MR SINGH:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I think we are on, more or less, the 
same page.  Ja. 
MR SINGH:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Because Mr Singh, 
what I was going to say is.  The date of existence or 
10 
incorporation of Trillian does not change the fact – it may 
have existed in 2015 but you know – we know from 
Ms Mothepu, she was at Regiments.   
 
They rendered the services to Eskom in respect 
of the Corporate Plan as Regiments in October, November, 
December or whenever they did.  It was not Trillian.  You 
have the CEO of Trillian who says to you – and I am saying 
insofar as you have referred to her with the meetings of 
Mr Koko - Ms Goodson has said Trillian never rendered 
services to Eskom in respect of the Corporate plan, which 
20 
is exactly what Ms Mothepu is saying.   
 
It is not Trillian that rendered services, Ms 
Mothepu is saying, it was Regiments.  Both of them say 
that.  And this court case that you are referring to of 
Transnet are in relation to Transnet of – it originates in 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 136 of 328 
 
Regiments against Trillian.   
 
It also shows in the papers there that Mr Wood 
left Regiments by the end of February 2016 and he 
commenced at Trillian on the 1 s t of March 2016.   
 
So you have that mounting evidence to deal with 
if you say:  I insist that...  Perhaps you do not insist, and I 
will not put words in your mouth, that Trillian rendered the 
services in respect of the Corporate Plan.   
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, give him a chance to ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I am. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I am Chair.  [laughs] 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, but the – I go back to my original 
statement.  In my view these issues relating to Regiments 
and Trillian and Ms Mothepu and Ms Goodson needs to be 
dealt with by Regiments and Trillian, with all due respect. 
[Speaker is not clear.] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, just speak up a bit. 
MR SINGH:   Needs to be dealt with by Regiments and 
20 
Trillian.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   Because they were officials and employees of 
those companies at those times.  My obligation was to 
ensure that the Eskom processes were followed to the 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 137 of 328 
 
extent that I have demonstrated in my affidavit, the Eskom 
processes were followed to the extent that the Eskom 
processes indicating that work was delivered.  I have said 
work was delivered.  I have said I met the people.  I have 
said there was a secondment agreement which no one 
seems to want to accept relating to the people that would 
have moved from Regiments to Trillian.  The Commission 
refuses to accept that that is the factual position.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   No ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Because you continuously stating that there 
10 
is this mounting evidence.  The mounting evidence that I 
have a view and that view is that work was done, we 
obtained what we needed to obtain to ensure that we were 
paying the correct payment(?) for work that was divided. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, there is no accepting or not 
accepting anything at this stage.  It is just proving to get 
clarification Mr Singh.  What you say now – what you have 
just said when you say, you know, Trillian’s or Regiments’ 
employees must come and testify what the position was.  It 
seems to be inconsistent with my understanding of what 
20 
you were saying earlier.   
 
I understood you earlier to be insisting that 
Trillian did provide services but what you are saying now 
seems to be saying, maybe the people who know would be 
Regiments employees and Trillian employees.  They must 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 138 of 328 
 
come and testify. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I was mentioning – I was referring 
to, let us say maybe the shareholders or the directors of 
Trillian and Regiments themselves. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, yes, yes. 
MR SINGH:   To provide clarity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   But I have also offered to provide to the 
Commission ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR SINGH:   ...the court papers that relate to Eskom 
versus Trillian ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   ...and McKinsey, which I would assume have 
this information that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no, no.  That is fine.  It may be 
that we have dealt with this sufficiently.  You have said 
what Ms Mothepu said and she was working for Regiments 
towards the end of 2015.  Is that right? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To...  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then she moved to Trillian in 2016. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, March, the 1 s t of March 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And you said she said they 
rendered the services in regard to the Corporate Plan as 
Regiments. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 139 of 328 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Goodson has said what she said 
about she not having been ordered(?) to render the 
services.  Mr Singh has said what he has said which 
includes the – these are the measures they took to 
establish who should they pay.  And there is clarity to the 
effect that Trillian was incorporated in May or there about, 
2015.  And Ms Goodson was appointed November by 
Trillian.  So I do not know whether you want to take it 
further? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, there was something I had in mind 
Chair, that the secondment agreement, Mr Singh, that you 
are referring to is between who and who? 
MR SINGH:   As I understand it, I have not seen a copy of 
it ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, but you see ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Between Regiments and Trillian. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, but you see, it is as you 
understand.  It is not as you know.   
MR SINGH:   ....to the Commission that I would go and get 
20 
the court papers and present it to you.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I...  Obviously, one would see what is 
there.  Based on the evidence I have heard, I doubt that 
there was a secondment because those who created 
Trillian appeared to have had tensions with those who 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 140 of 328 
 
remained at Regiments, at least the bosses.   
 
My understanding is that those who went to 
Trillian were not going on secondment.  They went to take 
up employment under a different employer.   
 
Because a secondment means you remain the 
employee of the first employer, Regiments in this case, but 
you go and physically work under another employer and 
then the two entities make arrangements, who is going to 
pay you and so on and so on but you remained the 
employee or your original employer.  My understanding is 
10 
that Regiments employees went to Trillian, became Trillian 
employees 
and 
did 
not 
continue 
to 
be 
Regiments 
employees. 
 
But 
you 
might 
not 
be 
using 
the 
term 
secondment in that sense.  I am just saying when you say 
secondment, I look at it in that way. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, if I can suggest that – allow us the 
opportunity to make ourselves available …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Those papers. 
MR SINGH:   Those court papers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR SINGH:   Let us study what is contained therein. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR SINGH:   If there is something that is of relevance to 
the Commission on this matter, we will present it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no, that is fair enough, ja.   
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 141 of 328 
 
MR SINGH:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  I think I will also 
provide Mr Singh and his legal representatives with the 
application that a director and shareholder of Regiments 
brought against Mr Eric Wood to be declared a delinquent 
director and there the – which is the application Ms 
Mothepu provided as well when she was here, they deal 
with the issues of conflict between them and Mr Eric Wood 
particularly at Transnet that he invoiced in the name of 
10 
Trillian when services were rendered by Regiments prior to 
March 2016  They deal – they go into the details of the 
conflicts in their minds that Mr Eric Wood allegedly 
invoiced 
Transnet 
for 
payment 
when 
services 
were 
rendered by Regiments, but we will provide you with that 
application. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I am not [indistinct] providing me 
with that will make any difference to our issues at hand.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   But again it proves the point that if the 
20 
Commission requires answers relating to Regiments and 
Trillian, call the relevant people to answer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, of course but you remember how 
we go there, we got here because you say you must know 
who rendered services to you for you to pay R30 million.  
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 142 of 328 
 
Who rendered these services, that is where we started. 
MR SINGH:   And with due respect, Mr Chair, I think I have 
adequately 
demonstrated 
that 
we 
took 
procedures 
necessary to identify that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Well, those directors and 
shareholders have been called, Ms Mothepu and Janke, 
they were at the top of the ladder in those entities.  So let 
us go to the services rendered having said all what we 
have said because Ms Mothepu who rendered the services 
10 
is able to speak about the services and whether it was 
worth paying Trillian 30.6 million because she says to the 
Chairperson you asked them, as Regiments, to prepare a 
corporate plan and it was – I think she says on a Friday 
that you asked them to do so and you wanted a corporate 
plan to be ready on Monday.  Now I am looking at her 
transcript which is her testimony here.  She says: 
“Something very strange happened because I got 
that instruction on Friday, late afternoon, and Mr 
Singh wanted his funding plan by Monday.” 
20 
They then went into drafting this plan.  They presented it 
to you according to her and you trashed it because you 
said it was not good.  After that Mr Andre Pillay say you 
called him to do the plan. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 143 of 328 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I know you deal with his affidavit in 
your affidavit.  And he says he knew that you had 
instructed Regiments to the plan, the corporate plan, but 
he did not ask why are you asking me?  Ms Mosilo says, on 
the other hand, they called for the assistance of Mr Andre 
Pillay who finally [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, is that Ms Mothepu? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Mothepu, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Ms Mosilo Mothepu, yes, Chair.  
10 
After you then said the plan is not good they then engaged 
Eskom treasury, a team of Mr Andre Pillay who helped 
them put together a plan which they did and she says this 
is the work that Eskom treasury could have done, she does 
not know why you asked them to do it.  Your comment? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I go back to my original comment 
that I made this morning that the very same Mr Andre 
Pillay was part of the treasury team that created the two 
page borrowing plan that was presented in the corporate 
plan …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry?  He was part of the…? 
MR SINGH:   He was part of the same treasury team that 
created the two page funding plan that was in the 
corporate plan for the previous year which led to the 
financial or the liquidity crisis that occurred in January 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 144 of 328 
 
2015.  Now I find it strange that Ms Mothepu would not be 
in a position to do a funding plan, firstly, given that she is 
a director of Regiments or Trillian Management Consulting 
or whichever one you want to use and secondly, reference 
back to Mr Pillay who had created the financial crisis of the 
liquidity crisis in January 2015.  It is just inconceivable. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you – I am not sure whether what 
you say is an answer to what Mr Seleka puts to you.  As I 
understand it, he is saying after you rejected the plan that 
they prepared over the weekend, they namely, Regiments, 
10 
Ms Mothepu, approached Mr Pillay to help them put 
together a plan that they thought you would accept.  Is that 
correct, Mr…? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  What you did not say is whether 
the plan that was the product of the collaboration between 
Ms Mothepu and Mr Pillay was subsequently presented to 
Mr Singh and whether he accepted it, is that where you 
were going ultimately? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it was presented to him. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he accepted it as far as Ms Mothepu 
is concerned. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes and Mr Pillay says Mr Singh 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 145 of 328 
 
suggested some changes …[intervenes]3 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, let him finish.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Singh suggested some changes and 
there is a trail of emails but I wanted to take you step by 
step, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because I did not want Mr Singh to 
attack Mr Pillay before he addresses my question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  So let us hear that.  What 
10 
do you say, Mr Singh, to what Mr Seleka is putting to you, 
namely that Ms Mothepu says after you rejected their 
weekend plan they approached Mr Pillay and Mr Pillay I 
assume hand them – Regiments, Ms Mothepu, produced a 
plan.  Now I do not want to say another plan and this plan 
which was the product of their collaboration was presented 
to you and you accepted – I do not know whether you 
accepted it with some minor suggestions or you made the 
minor suggestions before it was finally brought to you, 
what do you say to that? 
20 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I reject that assertion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say that – was there another plan 
that was presented to you after you rejected Ms Mothepu’s 
plan? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, my affidavit covers these aspects 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 146 of 328 
 
quite extensively.  If you would allow me, I will find it and I 
will deal with this matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, we can go there.  I take it that it is 
bundle 16 where we will find your affidavit? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Well, I think I am still on your 
affidavit and the one starts at 591, I do not know whether 
that is the one, bundle 16, page 591 black numbers.  I do 
not know whether that is one or it is another one that you 
want to look at. 
10 
MR SINGH:    Sir, it is the one that starts at page 591. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Singh, it is on page 610. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You mean the relevant portion? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is from page 610. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   610. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Okay, there is corporate plan 
contract with McKinsey. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   If that is what you want. 
20 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I think I would like to start 
…[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   As you go there, can I understand what 
is it that you are rejecting, Mr Singh?  Are you rejecting 
that Ms Mothepu was requested by you, either you asked 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 147 of 328 
 
Mr Eric Wood or Regiments and his employees to do a 
corporate plan on a Friday afternoon and you wanted it on 
Monday?  Are you denying that? 
MR SINGH:   I do not recall that but it sounds like 
something I would have done. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja but just face the Chairperson, but 
you are not denying it.  You do not recall it but you cannot 
deny it. 
MR SINGH:   It seems like something I would have done, 
Mr Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that what – what is it that seems like 
something you would have done? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, the assertion that Mr – the question 
that Adv Seleka is putting to me is that would I have not 
requested intervention on a Friday for a Monday/ 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, after rejecting the first plan. 
MR SINGH:   No, the initial portion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR SINGH:   The issue of the intervention that was 
required. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   And my response is that it is not unlikely to 
have requested an intervention.  If I saw something that 
was not appropriate, okay?  So where I was starting was 
paragraph 35 of page 603 where I say: 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 148 of 328 
 
“It is correct that Eskom treasury …[intervenes]3 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are we still on the same affidavit of 
yours? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say paragraph 35? 
MR SINGH:   Paragraph 35 on page 603. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR SINGH:   I say: 
“It is correct that Eskom treasury was responsible 
for drafting the funding plan to be included in the 
10 
2016/’17 corporate plan as alleged by Pillay which 
has, as its main objective, the mitigation of liquidity 
risk.” 
Simply put, Eskom must have sufficient cash to meet its 
payment obligation on any given date.  At that time 
McKinsey had as its appointed supply development partner 
in preparing the plan but there was nothing untoward in 
requesting Ms Mothepu to assist in the preparation of the 
plan. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And that is not my suggestion.  That is 
20 
definitely not my suggestion. 
MR SINGH:   But again, if you look at the paragraphs that 
follow, it is clear that the funding plan was not a weekend 
exercise as alleged by Ms Mothepu.  The funding plan, if 
you have reference to the affidavit, actually went through 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 149 of 328 
 
probably seven iterations or seven versions.  Those seven 
versions, Mr Chair, was the product – and I even concede 
that it was a product of Eskom treasury and myself and Ms 
Mothepu and her team.  So the suggestion that this plan 
was an Eskom product alone is rejected.   
 
And secondly, that very same Eskom team prepared 
a two page funding plan that was incorporated in the 
previous year ’s corporate plan.  The suggestion that that 
very same team was capable and had the ability to mitigate 
Eskom’s 
liquidity 
risk 
which 
in 
real 
terms 
actually 
10 
happened in January 2015, I cannot accept.  
 
And lastly, if Ms Mothepu alleges what she alleges, 
in those weekly meetings why did she not raise the issue 
with me to say we are adding no value in this process 
please can we be excused because you have a team that is 
fully capable of doing this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us …[intervenes] 
MR SINGH:   Or raise it with any person that she felt 
comfortable to with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let me understand what you are 
20 
saying.  You accept, do you not, that ultimately the 
corporate plan that you accepted or that was used was the 
product of efforts of Ms Mothepu or Regiments or her team, 
Mr Pillay and/or Eskom treasury and yourself? 
MR SINGH:   And McKinsey, just so that… 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 150 of 328 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And McKinsey. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SINGH:   But if we are doing the corporate plan then it 
is all other Eskom divisions as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja, okay.  So that you accept. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja and you accept that that happened 
after you had rejected the weekend plan that Ms Mothepu 
had presented to you after the weekend she is talking 
10 
about. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, sorry to interrupt 
you again. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   I think there might be a 
miscommunication, there is a difference between the 
funding plan and the corporate plan and I understood the 
point that Mr Seleka was trying to make that yes, that he 
was dealing with the funding plan and not with the 
corporate plan.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  Oh, okay, no, no, that – is that the 
position, Mr Singh? 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, Sir? 
CHAIRPERSON:   What you were saying in terms of the 
plan that was the product of all of these people namely Ms 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 151 of 328 
 
Mothepu, Mr Pillay or Eskom treasury and yourself and you 
said there may have been other people, that was the 
funding plan not the corporate plan, is that correct? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, Mr Chair, the funding plan 
would form part of the corporate plan. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, that is my understanding. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the one that Ms Mothepu was talking 
about which he says you asked him – her to do, work on 
over the weekend, which you rejected, was that a funding 
10 
plan or the corporate plan? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair firstly …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I accept that the funding plan is part 
of the corporate plan, I just want to make sure that we are 
on the same page. 
MR SINGH:   I agree, Mr Chair, there were – from my 
recollection there was no corporate plan – sorry, there was 
no funding plan that was prepared by Ms Mothepu. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Over the weekend, that was rejected. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   My recollection of events was that Mr Pillay 
had prepared a funding plan which I was not happy with, 
which I then engaged …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Mothepu. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 152 of 328 
 
MR SINGH:  Mr Woods. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   To facilitate and improve. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   And that is why Mr Pillay in his affidavit 
states 
that 
he 
knew 
that 
I 
had 
requested 
Woods’ 
assistance to draft the plan, hence he did not understand 
why I was requesting the plan with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MR SINGH:   And hence my paragraph 35 to say Mr Pillay 
10 
was at all times – at all relevant times aware that the 
funding plan was his responsibility. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay, okay.  It seems to me that 
from what you are saying, where Ms Mothepu talked about 
a corporate plan in regard to that weekend, as far as you 
were concerned, she was talking about a funding plan. 
MR SINGH:   A funding plan. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And when you talk about a plan 
that was the product of the efforts of all of these people 
including yourself and Mr Pillay and Ms Mothepu you are 
20 
talking about the funding plan. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, so …[intervenes] 
MR SINGH:   And the reason why I focused on that, Mr 
Chair, is because Regiments’ speciality was the financial 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 153 of 328 
 
environment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Can capital markets and so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   So they were intimately involved in the 
production of the corporate plan – funding plan, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Funding plan, ja. 
MR SINGH:   And they also assisted McKinsey as the – the 
trading development process for themselves on other 
aspects of the corporate plan. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   Bu their main focus was the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Finance. 
MR SINGH:   Funding plan. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Funding plan.  Okay, alright.  So – but 
you say the process was that Mr Pillay of Eskom treasury 
worked on a funding plan presented to you, you were not 
happy with it, you then asked Mr Wood, Dr Wood, to assist 
and Dr Wood, Mr Wood, was part of Regiments at that 
time? 
20 
MR SINGH:   Well …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So Regiments [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
MR SINGH:   This identity crisis. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Okay.  And to the extent 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 154 of 328 
 
that Ms Mothepu got involved in this plan this would have 
come from – she would have been asked by Dr Wood, Mr 
Wood.  Are you suggesting that you never spoke to her 
directly asking her to do the plan or you might not recall 
that? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, by and large …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   It might not matter. 
MR SINGH:   By and large most of my interactions were 
with Mr Wood. 
CHAIRPERSON:   With Mr Wood, ja. 
10 
MR SINGH:   In terms of these requests. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   I would have had interactions with other 
members of the team. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   In the weekly meetings that I have 
mentioned. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, okay.  But what you do say is that 
this funding plan was not Mr Wood or Ms Mothepu would 
have worked on over a weekend or whatever the period 
20 
was, was not brought to you and you rejected it.  You did 
not reject it as such, is that correct? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, my recollection was the efforts of 
Mr Pillay was rejected. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is the initial one. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 155 of 328 
 
MR SINGH:   Which then led to the engagement of Wood 
and Ms Mothepu. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Wood and Ms Mothepu, yes. 
MR SINGH:   And that which is …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Came out of that. 
MR SINGH:   Came out of the engagement was the 
eventual plan that ended up in the corporate plan. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That you accept, yes. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, over this let us say seven and eight 
week period. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, alright, I hope that at least 
clarifies the position as far as Mr Singh is concerned at 
least.  What is does result in is that as far as he is 
concerned, the plan that ultimately got accepted, funding 
plan at least, as far as he is concerned, was the product of 
the efforts of a number of people including Mr Pillay, Ms 
Mothepu/Mr Wood and himself.  That is correct. 
MR SINGH:   Over a period of time, Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Over a period of time. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess that obviously, Mr Seleka, you 
can still explore the issue that you are saying Ms Mothepu 
raised mainly they had no need to be involved in this 
because they were not adding value, Eskom could have 
done this, blah, blah, blah, blah  
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 156 of 328 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But explore what you want to explore, I 
just wanted to make sure we are – I understood what Mr 
Singh was saying, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, what Mr Singh said.  Yes because 
there is no dispute, Mr Singh, I think from the evidence of 
the witnesses that Eskom treasury has always been 
responsible to draft a funding plan that becomes part of 
the corporate plan.  I think that is not in dispute. 
MR SINGH:   No, Sir.  What is in dispute is the quality of 
10 
the plan. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Where you part ways with the two 
witnesses before the Commission for present purposes of 
the evidence I am present to you is who in 2016 did the 
first draft of the plan, of the funding plan.  Ms Mosilo says 
it was Regiments which was contacted, they prepared the 
plan which you required them to present to you on Monday, 
she says she contacted Mr Pillay, so I called Mr Andre 
Pillay and he had no idea about Mr Singh’s instruction for 
us as the consultant to draft this funding plan because it is 
20 
annually – it is performed by treasury so he had no idea 
that – at the funding plan because I was trying to get an 
extension but they then present to you: 
“Over the weekend we worked alone, not with Mr 
Andre Pillay and we submitted without Treasury’s 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 157 of 328 
 
input.  Because, if you recall, Mr Andre Pillay had 
no idea about the instruction to draft the funding 
plan.  Then he says that was the funding plan you 
were not happy with.  That is her version.  Upon 
you saying you are not accepting that funding plan, 
they engage Mr Andre Pillay with his team at 
Treasury and that is the funding plan ultimately with 
your 
changes 
and 
suggestions, 
collective 
collaboration that gets to be used.” 
Now that is your version. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Mr Singh has responded to that 
version. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you were saying what you rejected 
was Mr Andre Pillay’s …[intervenes] 
MR SINGH:   No, now you raise a further contradiction. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja? 
MR SINGH:   Because Mr Pillay, on his affidavit, states 
that he was under the expectation that it was them initially 
20 
to have developed the plan and he could not understand 
why I expected him to develop the plan hence my response 
to paragraph 35 of my affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, but remember, Mr Pillay, is 
approached for the second time.  This is the first time he is 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 158 of 328 
 
approached.  He gets approached for the second time after 
Ms Mothepu says you rejected their plan but he says you 
asked him, Mr Pillay, he says you asked him to intervene 
and he did not ask but why are you asking me because you 
had asked the consultant to do it.  Remember that is his 
version. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, as it relates to Mr Pillay’s version I 
would have to respectfully request that I get dates and Ms 
Mothepu’s dates, the Monday, which date is it.  The Friday, 
what date is it?  So I can then fit into the timeline of the 
10 
emails that we have referenced in my affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think that should be fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, we can fine that.  We will ask – 
have t ask them.  Mr Pillay’s evidence I did not lead, he 
came before us here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But what you need is the transcript of 
their evidence and their affidavits, what do you need? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I think I understand what Mr Pillay 
has asserted. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   If I have I misunderstood what Mr Pillay has 
asserted then my response here is probably incorrect. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR SINGH:   The assertion that Mr …[intervenes] 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 159 of 328 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Seleka. 
MR SINGH:   No, what Ms Mothepu is making. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, Ms Mothepu? 
MR SINGH:   Yes.  Is making relating to her role, I am 
requesting 
that 
we 
understand 
that 
Friday 
and 
that 
Monday, which are those dates. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR SINGH:   So I can then understand how does it 
interrelate with Mr Pillay’s version which I have already 
commented on. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The dates might or might not be in the 
affidavit in the transcript, hey? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, they are not in the transcript, 
Chair. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, else it is just a random Monday and 
a Friday. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The transcript is accessible on the 
internet.  Okay, we will do our best to go to Ms Mothepu 
20 
and get the information but then ...[indistinct – word cut] 
was this, that even though Mr Andre Pillay and the 
treasury, Eskom treasury were ultimately the people who 
assisted in putting the corporate plan that was ultimately 
acceptable to your  funding plan, she did not understand 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 160 of 328 
 
why they were requested to do the funding plan when 
Eskom treasury could have easily done the job.  
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, we will come back to this point and I 
make a point of saying I do not think we have a point of 
departure regarding who was involved and how they were 
involved.  The point of departure relates to the quality and 
adequacy of the plan. 
 
A two page funding plan to borrow 300 billion in 
funding that was included in the 2015, 16 corporate plan, 
in my view was [indistinct].  I cannot put it stronger than 
10 
that sir.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So what you are saying is you dispute 
any suggestion by Ms Matsepo that Eskom treasury was 
capable on its own to come up with an acceptable funding 
plan, because of and you say that because of what has 
happened the previous financial year? 
MR SINGH:  And having given Mr Pillay and his team the 
opportunity to develop the plan.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  On my version. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  Which was again lacking.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  Which then required the intervention of Ms 
Matsepo and her team.  
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 161 of 328 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  In so far as that 
aspect is concerned Mr Singh, that you had given Mr Pillay 
to do the job, I have looked at the emails that you are 
attaching, in order to show that the corporate plan was 
developed over time.  
 
I have looked at these emails and I see that it is 
mainly emails with Mr Andre Pillay, between you and him 
and he is saying I have incorporated the changes, updated 
as proposed and then there is Ms Maya Bana, she wants to 
10 
explain how the wording should read.  
 
 
But all throughout is you and Mr Andre Pillay.  
There is once an email that came from a gentleman from 
McKinsey through Mr Andre Pillay and it said, it reads: 
 
“Please find attached comments from Anoj, re 
the funding plan.  Also attached are the DPE 
comments on the overall plan.  They have 
some comments on funding.  We can help with 
making the changes.  I will give you a call to 
discuss the comments, and where you want us 
20 
to help.  Regards.” 
 
The 
emails 
are 
replete 
with 
Mr 
Andre 
Pillay 
communicating with you.  Nowhere is Regiments.  
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, there is a simple explanation for 
this.  
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 162 of 328 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  As I mentioned to you, in the Monday 
meetings there was an integrated meeting that brought 
together a number of streams.  In that streams you would 
have had Ms Matsepo and her team or Dr Wood as the 
case may be, who was whoever was available.   
 
[indistinct] that you refer to the McKinsey guy, he 
would have been there.  Dr Vice would have been there.  
Mr Sega would have been there.  There would have been 
all of these guys.  My modus operandi was to deal with my 
10 
people.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Was to? 
MR SINGH:  Deal with my people.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, the Eskom people when you say 
...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:  My Eskom people.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Eskom treasury. 
MR SINGH:  Whether it was Eskom treasury, whether it 
was Eskom finance or whether it was ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but Eskom ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR SINGH:  But Eskom people.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Staff, ja.  
MR SINGH:  Yes.  So yes, the if you look at other emails 
relating to other streams, you would find it going through 
the respective responsible people relating to that area.  
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 163 of 328 
 
For example, primary energy would go to the primary 
energy person.  
 
Yes, there will be discussions there.  I would give 
feedback, but I would give feedback to both the consultant 
as well as the Eskom person, but it was the Eskom 
person’s responsibility to make sure that the plan was 
delivered or any aspect relating thereto was delivered.  
 
Even if you look at the MSA for example.  MSA was 
coupled.  There was an Eskom person and a consultant.  
Whenever we engaged, we engaged with the Eskom 
10 
person, as we would do originally from this morning.  So it 
does not surprise me that those comments are directed to 
Mr Pillay in any way, shape or form.  
 
The reason why we have attached those emails Mr 
Chair, was because Mr Pillay also tried to contribulise[sic] 
the impact that Trillian / Regiments had had on the 
corporate plan and more so to suggest that the input that 
he was receiving from them or from me for that matter, 
were surreal.  
 
I am saying over a period of seven versions, you 
20 
cannot suggest that those were trivial.  Secondly, if you 
look at the comments that are referenced in the first email, 
there are fundamental and significant changes that were 
required to the plan.  
 
Whether that was directed at Regiments or at 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 164 of 328 
 
treasury, it is equally damning, because you have a 
consultant that is supposed to be helping you fix it, yet you 
receive 
a 
perfunctory 
product 
and 
you 
have 
Eskom 
employees that are being paid to use the same product and 
it is still performative.  
 
So from that perspective whether the emails were 
directed to them or not, they were part of the process.   
CHAIRPERSON:  But is there not something that must take 
somebody [indistinct] professional to come to a forum such 
as this and say with the whole world listening, when I was 
10 
part of that team working on that project, I was not adding 
any value.   
 
What would make Ms Matsepo come before the 
Commission and say that about herself and the team if 
indeed they were adding value?  What would you say? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, I cannot speak for Ms Matsepo or 
her motive, but what I can say for myself, is that on 
objective evidence that I have spoken to you about and 
presented here today, Eskom was not in the position 
...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  They were adding value? 
MR SINGH:  They were adding value in that Eskom was not 
in a position to produce this plan.  Mr Chair, I can tell you 
categorically if I have a view that Eskom was in a position 
to develop the plan, I would have not gone to the board 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 165 of 328 
 
and asked for 100 million rand to be spent on preparing a 
plan.  
 
If that was the case where I would just want to 
spend money, the next corporate plan that we developed, I 
would have got McKinsey and Trillian to help us again.  
Yet, because we went through the process that created the 
basics, that created the template in 2015, 16 and Eskom 
now understood the extent and the quality that was 
required for an organisation as complex as this one, we 
were able to produce the plan ourselves.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, Mr Singh a couple of things but let 
me say this.  The emails again you say the first email, the 
comments are substantial, but when I look at the first email 
which was from you to Mr Andre Pillay and others, it says 
27 January 2016: 
 
“Hi guys.  Overall comment on the funding and 
financial plan is that both of, both of ...” 
 
I think there is a word either missing there: 
 
“Lack and overall strategy.” 
20 
 
So let us start here: 
 
“Other than the detailed comments sent under 
cover of previous emails.  Maya, the list of 
issues we have with national treasury must be 
dealt with in the CP.  Let us address this 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 166 of 328 
 
ASAP.  Further comments will follow in due 
course.” 
 
That is on page 705. 
MR SINGH:  Seven zero five? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Ja, 705.   
MR SINGH:  So Mr Chair ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  So what we do not see are the 
substantial comments you are talking about.  
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, with all due respect.  If I received 
an email like this from my boss ...[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry, let me go to the email.  Where 
about is it?   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Page 705.  Eskom Bundle 16.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes, I am there.  Do you want to 
repeat your question Mr Seleka so that I will appreciate Mr 
Singh’s response? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, so Mr Singh was saying, if you see 
the first email I will make substantial comments.  So this is 
the first email in the sequence of the emails you have 
attached.  So I was saying I struggle to see the substantive 
20 
comments you were mentioning to the Chairperson.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Singh, what is your answer?   
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, I think again one has to appreciate 
the purpose for which a corporate plan is put together.  
The purpose of the corporate plan is to provide strategic 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 167 of 328 
 
direction to an organisation, over the next five years as a 
state owned company and it is a requirement of the PFMA.  
 
This comment, as in that context, basically says we 
have a performatory plan.  Because it lacks overall 
strategy.  There is no strategy relating to where we are 
going, so it is fundamentally broken.  So if you wanted me 
to write a long email of 50 pages, to suggest that the plan 
was performatory, I did not need to do that.  
 
Because there was no strategy associated with the 
plan, so where were we going?  So that was, and as I was 
10 
going to say if I had received an email like this from my 
boss, 
I 
would 
have 
been 
shocked, 
shattered 
and 
bewildered.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, I am not ... I do not know whether 
you answered the question.  
MR SINGH:  I did sir.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Where? 
MR SINGH:  I said the extent of the email ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  Should not reflect the effect of the email.   
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh. 
MR SINGH:  The fact that it is two lines, does not mean 
that it is not impactful, and that is what I was trying to 
explain to the Chairperson.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh.   
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 168 of 328 
 
MR SINGH:  Is that the strategy, the purpose of a 
corporate plan is to provide strategic direction for a state 
owned company over a five year period.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, no I hear ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:  So to the extent that it lacked overall strategy, 
you are not even in the starting block sir.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  You are not? 
MR SINGH:  You are not even in the starting blocks as it 
relates to the purpose of the corporate plan.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
10 
MR SINGH:  And more so Mr Chair, with all due respect, 
the two most important portions of any corporate plan, is 
the finance plan and the funding plan.  If you do not have a 
view of where the organisation is going financially or 
whether it can actually fund its activities, there is no point 
in putting together any other portions of the plan.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I see Mr Seleka, that in the next 
page that is 706, there is an email from Mr Singh 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  To Mr Pillay and others, where in the first 
line he says: 
 
“The current funding is not coherent and 
uninspiring ...” 
 
I guess is uninspiring he means: 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 169 of 328 
 
 
“And does not give comfort that the funding 
will be raised.” 
 
That would be consistent with your criticism of the 
plan? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  So, and I see Mr Eric Woods is also in 
there.  
MR SINGH:  Yes sir.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  So that goes to, your comments goes to 
10 
all of them? 
MR SINGH:  Yes sir.  
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
Your 
internal 
people 
and 
the 
consultant? 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And I think one can refer to your second 
paragraph 2.  You have got two paragraphs 2 in that email.  
But the second one, in the second one you say: 
 
“Why do we say the 335 billion rand is doable 
if last year we said we cannot do 237 billion 
20 
rand.” 
MR SINGH:  That is correct Chair.  Mr Chair, and in that 
line now that you pointed it out encapsulates the thinking 
and understanding of Eskom at the time, which obviously 
was the previous year.  Now I understand the purpose of 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 170 of 328 
 
the corporate plan. 
 
Certainly from where I sat as the CFO it was my 
primary document to engage with relevant stake holders, 
primarily in the finance area, in the funding area.  So we 
presented it to banks, to rating agencies, to potential 
funders.  
 
It 
actually 
created 
the 
basis 
from 
which 
we 
launched international bonds and the like.  Now we 
prepared a two page plan, borrowed 235 billion and in the 
plan itself we say to potential funders by the way we do not 
10 
think we can raise 237 billion. 
 
That 
was 
the 
context 
within 
which 
this 
team 
produced the previous plan.   
CHAIRPERSON:  In paragraph 9 you say, that is at page 
707: 
 
“What is our plan B for the expensive USD 
funding 
and 
how 
do 
we 
reduce 
cost 
of 
[indistinct] and swapping.  The plan must be 
robust, coherent and must provide confidence 
that all risks have been considered and the 
20 
plan has been de-risked and is executable.” 
 
Okay, okay.  No, I just ... those features of that 
email caught my attention. 
MR SINGH:  Yes Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 171 of 328 
 
MR SINGH:  So the Eskom internal team just got their 
salaries, the consultants got 30.6 million.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sorry, I could not hear you sir? 
MR SINGH:  The Eskom internal team, they simply got their 
monthly salary.  A consultant got over 30.6 million.  But so 
did I, I also got my salaries. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Say again? 
MR SINGH:  I also only got my salary sir.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  You also? 
MR SINGH:  Only got my salary.  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh, you also only got your salary? 
MR SINGH:  Yes.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  So why did you give the consultant over 
30.6 million? 
MR SINGH:  That was a contractually agreed value sir.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Before they rendered services? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, the contract was concluded at the 
98 million that you pointed out this morning and the 
contract allocated 30% of the contract value to the BEE 
subcontractor.  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, and that contract we saw that did 
not exist.  
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, I would like to correct Mr Seleka.  I 
think I made reference to it this morning.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 172 of 328 
 
MR SINGH:  That the letter of acceptance Mr Chair, even 
in the absence of the contract, serves as the contract, 
based on the wording of the letter of acceptance.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  The letter of acceptance serves as a 
contract?  Is that what you are saying? 
MR SINGH:  Yes sir.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is on page 650.  
MR SINGH:  Six?  
ADV SELEKA SC:  650. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, if I am correct in my recollection of 
10 
what you were talking about in the morning and if that is 
what you are talking about, obviously the fact that there 
was an acceptance of the offer of award, does not help if 
the policy of the company or the requirement is that there 
must be a contract.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes sir, I agree Mr Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You were mentioning what you were 
mentioning I guess, in mitigation.  To say you plead guilty 
so to speak to saying well, there was no contract and you 
were supposed to ensure that there was a contract before 
20 
we could pay, but you know there had been these 
developments.  
 
That is what you were saying, is that right? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Chair, if you would allow me? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 173 of 328 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I will just read a provision of 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course I am using plead guilty, not 
seriously, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, if you allow me Mr Chair, I would 
read a, on page 651 of the letter of acceptance? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  “We confirm that a contract will exist 
between Eskom and McKinsey and Company 
on the above basis, which sets out the terms 
10 
and 
conditions. 
 
Please 
indicate 
your 
acknowledgement thereof by signing below and 
deliver the undersigned.” 
 
That is which then, on the next page, which is 652 
we record the following: 
 
“We acknowledge receipt of your notification of 
acceptance, dated 29-09-2015, confirming that 
a contract will exist between Eskom and 
McKinsey and Company from 1 October 2015 
or soon thereafter.” 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I take it that you read that to emphasise 
the correctness of the proposition I was putting to you. 
MR SINGH:  Yes sir.  
CHAIRPERSON:  That you are pleading guilty to making 
payments when there was no contract, but you were saying 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 174 of 328 
 
in mitigation look at what the position was.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  If you were ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, it is okay, alright.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, because it says it will, it will.  Page 
650, there is contract, the terms and conditions of the NEC 
professional services contract will apply, which is then the 
one you referred us to on page 653 and page 656 says: 
 
“Notwithstanding anything contained herein, 
this agreement comes into effect on the date 
when 
the 
tenderer 
receives 
one 
fully 
10 
completed original copy of this document, as 
the NEC, including the schedule of deviations.” 
 
The funny thing is, this form is not signed.  What 
they signed is the deviation page, but they did not sign the 
contract part on page 656.  That is the form that should be 
signed and sent back.   
MR SINGH:  Indeed sir.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  It seems to make it even worse.  
MR SINGH:  Well, there is a formal offer and acceptance 
on page 606, if that would satisfy you sir.  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, but it says the NEC terms will 
apply, which is this document.  
MR SINGH:  But form 606 which is form and acceptance, is 
part of the NEC contract, is it not?   
ADV SELEKA SC:  No.  It is a separate document.  It is on 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 175 of 328 
 
the Eskom, you can see it is on the Eskom ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:  The contract starts on page 1, on 604 and it 
says page 1.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry sir.  The 606 that I am looking 
at does not seem to be the same as the 606 that the two of 
you are looking at.  I am at Bundle 16.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, Eskom Bundle 16.   
MR SINGH:  No, no I am, sorry sir.  I am reading the red 
numbers instead of the black ones.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
MR SINGH:  But I have done well today, I have only done it 
once.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  The contract, the contract starts on 
page 653.   
MR SINGH:  You attached it as Annexure A55. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  So that is the contract, correct? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
20 
MR SINGH:  Which is the NEC professional services 
contract.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  Which starts on page 1.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 176 of 328 
 
MR SINGH:  It then goes to page 2. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  On 654. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  And then page 3. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  Which is on page 655 is the form of offer and 
acceptance.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  Which is signed.  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, by only one party. 
MR SINGH:  I agree, but I am just saying ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  But the next one did not sign, on the 
next page.  
MR SINGH:  I assume that is just an administrative 
oversight by Mr Vice.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  The contract is not concluded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Speak up Mr Singh, you said something 
but I did not hear?   
MR SINGH:  I am saying Mr Seleka says that the 656 which 
20 
is page 4 of the contract is not signed.   
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes.  
MR SINGH:  And I am saying ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  On mine it does look unsigned.  
MR SINGH:  Yes, and I am saying I can only assume that it 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 177 of 328 
 
was an administrative oversight on the part of Dr Vice, as 
he signed or extensively signed.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  No. 
MR SINGH:  All the other parts.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, no Mr Singh.   
MR SINGH:  But the initials is there.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, no Mr Singh, go to the previous 
page.   
MR SINGH:  Page 1, page 2? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Page 655. 
10 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  There is the form of acceptance.  
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  This page is signed by the tenderer. 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  For the tenderer, do you see that? 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  The next page ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Where does it say tenderer, oh for the 
tenderer, ja I can see.  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  He signs.  The next page is to be 
signed by the employer.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, I am sorry.  Signature 
...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:  So this would have been signed by Mr 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 178 of 328 
 
Mabelane.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mister? 
MR SINGH:  Mabelane. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mabelane.  
MR SINGH:  He signed.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sorry, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me just get this.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Give the Chairperson a moment.  
CHAIRPERSON:  On page 655, at the bottom of that page 
that is where there is supposed to be a signature or 
10 
signatures.  
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Then there is a signature.  I think that 
signature is that of Dr Vice, because below that it says 
name or names and it is Doctor Alexander Vice.  Then it 
says capacity, director and then says for the tenderer and 
then there is something written there.  
 
It says McKinsey ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  And company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And company incorporated or whatever, 
20 
there is something there, and then the address seems to 
be given and then email signature of witness, then there is 
a name.  So ja, so ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  So the tenderer has signed.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 179 of 328 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Then you turn the page.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  To page 656. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Then this must be accepted.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  They have tendered, must be accepted 
by the employer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Then you go all the way down, just 
10 
before signature.  There is notwithstanding anything, that 
paragraph, contained herein.  This agreement comes into 
effect on the date when the tenderer receives one fully 
completed original copy of this document.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Including the schedule of deviations if 
any.  Then it must be signed.  Signature, names, capacity 
and then for the employer.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And there is no signature.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  There is no signature there, but they 
20 
signed the schedule of deviations which is the next page, 
but not the contract itself.   
CHAIRPERSON:  What do you say to that Mr Singh? 
MR SINGH:  Well Mr Chair, I started off by saying it must 
have been an administrative oversight by Dr Vice, but I will 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 180 of 328 
 
assume that it is an administrative oversight by Mr 
Mabelane in that case.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is a fatal oversight.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And what is the page at 657?   
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is page 5.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 5? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, at the bottom of the page.  But 
that is just ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  But how could, how could mister, how 
could Dr Weiss sign page 3 and sign page together with Mr 
10 
Mabelane without signing page 4, which had that space for 
signature which appears to me to be one that you can see 
easily.   
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, again I think you are asking me to 
explain something that somebody else did which is difficult 
for me to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, well I am not ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:  Having regard to the issue at hand, in terms 
of whether there existed a valid contract or not, if I 
reference the paragraph that Mr Seleka has read, it says: 
20 
 
“Notwithstanding anything contained herein, 
this agreement comes into effect on the date 
when the tenderer ...” 
 
Which is McKinsey in this case: 
 
“Received one fully completed original copy of 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 181 of 328 
 
this document.” 
 
And I am assuming he received it on the 29 t h, 
because he signs it on the 29 t h: 
 
“Including a schedule of deviations, if any ...” 
Which is what is on page 657.  This contract was 
effective the date on which Dr Weiss sent it, and I assume 
the lady received it the date on which he signed it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But that clause you read requires that 
the original copy that he receives must be a fully 
completed 
original 
copy 
and 
this 
would 
not 
have 
10 
...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Well Mr Chair this obviously ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...been a fully completed one if this part 
was not completed.  Isn’t it?   If this part was not 
completed the original would not be a fully completed 
original copy. 
MR SINGH:   As it relates to the signature Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Well it depends on who signs the contract 
first. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   No ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   This says it would have been ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, as I understand it what this clause 
says is we might not care about other things in this 
contract but the thing we care about for it to be effective is 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 182 of 328 
 
that when it is received by whoever it says received it must 
be fully completed.   In other words if it is not fully 
completed then it does not come into operation or it does 
not become effective or is not valid, but if it is fully 
completed but there may be some other mistake it is still 
effective, but the one thing that should not happen is that it 
should not be incomplete. 
MR SINGH:  So Mr Chair by incomplete you are saying that 
Mr Mamalane’s absence through his signature on page 656 
means it is incomplete? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is what I am putting to you, that if 
this was not filled, was not completed, he did not sign here 
and put in all this information would it not mean that 
something that was supposed to be completed had not 
been completed in the document?  
MR SINGH:   Well Mr Chair I think that would be – that will 
only be the case where they have signed first but in this 
case there is from the evidence you have seen that they 
provided it to Mr Weiss to sign. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, but when he did receive it, it would 
20 
not be fully completed, isn’t it? 
MR SINGH:   That sounds ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you accept that is how it at least 
seems? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair I am not a legal person, an attorney, 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 183 of 328 
 
but if you say so then I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no, no that is fine, it may be that 
– it may be that somebody would present a different 
argument but I am just saying Mr Seleka as I understood 
his proposition it was that the agreement contemplated that 
before it could be effective it should be fully completed and 
if – and he was saying this one was not fully completed, ja, 
okay, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is not your fault. 
MR SINGH:   No, no, I am not saying it is my fault sir, I am 
10 
not accepting any liability associated with this.  I am just 
putting forward an Eskom position at the time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Should we take a short adjournment, I 
see we have gone past half past four.  I know that we have 
an evening session. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In terms of your plan will it be that we 
would start with the evening session – what is your 
proposal, at five, at half past five or how long will you be 
20 
with the next witness, the evening witness?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair we might take one hour thirty 
minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   With the evening witness? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I would propose we adjourn Mr 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 184 of 328 
 
Singh’s evidence now so that when we come back from the 
adjournment we go to the next witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I would like us to use as much time 
as we can for Mr Singh simply because we need more time 
for him because he has to deal with many issues.  Well 
why don’t we take maybe a ten minute break and maybe 
you continue for at least another 30 minutes to try and 
cover whatever you can cover with Mr Singh, before we go 
to the evening session, and of course both teams will tell 
me, will report back to me on the suggestion that I raised 
10 
with both teams. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Okay 
let 
us 
take 
a 
ten 
minute 
adjournment now and then we will come back and continue 
for maybe thirty minutes and then adjourn and then we go 
into the evening session. 
 
We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Singh I was saying 
it is not the prob – your problem that you fault that the 
contract is not signed but you know your only fault could be 
making the payment without checking that there is a 
contract. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 185 of 328 
 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I did not make any payments so that 
also cannot be my fault unfortunately. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But you received the invoice. 
MR SINGH:  Indeed Sir I did receive the invoice and I sent it 
to the relevant people for processing.  I did not give them 
any instruction to not comply with any policies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What does processing mean? 
MR SINGH:  Sorry Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What does processing mean?  You sent it 
to some people for processing. 
10 
MR SINGH:  To follow the steps that I have outlined Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  To pay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your – oh the – do they include checking if 
they… 
MR SINGH:  Checking. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They have a valid contract. 
MR SINGH:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  But I am saying is at that stage 
20 
when you receive it that you should say this check is 
everything in place, the contract in place.  Even the services 
you saying were rendered. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair as I have testified before I do not think 
for it – it is expected of the CFO of an entity as large as 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 186 of 328 
 
Eskom to make sure that people’s whose function it is to 
make sure that processes and policies are followed that the 
CFO can do the same thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well – well I am not sure if I would accept 
that because should they not report back to you to say we 
have checked, everything is in order before they pay?  Or 
should you not say to them here is an invoice that we have 
received but this is quite a large amount I do not want the 
risk that Eskom might make a payment in the circumstances 
where it would be irregular because there is no valid 
10 
contract. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then report back that everything is in – 
placed before you actually pay. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would you not say that? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair there is a reasonable expectation of 
any employee in any organisation to carry out the policies 
and procedures of that organisation.  In the case of Eskom 
we were very clear policies and procedures as to what 
20 
needed to be done as I have explained to you earlier this 
morning in terms how payments are processed.  That as I 
said is an expectation that anyone has when a payment is 
being processed.  Because there are specific people with 
specific functions that has specific policies and processes 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 187 of 328 
 
that they need to follow.  To the extent that there is a 
deviation there is an expectation then for that particular 
employee to come back to a relevant delegated authority to 
say I have a problem.  That then would result in a different 
process that is followed where that specific person would 
then request that – the relevant delegated authority to 
approve a deviation to a certain specific policy 
CHAIRPERSON:  What level would – would the employees 
have been that would have had to check whether all these 
steps were in place? 
10 
MR SINGH:  Sorry Sir I did not hear you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the level in the hierarchy of the 
organisation would the employees have been at who were 
required to check whether there was a valid contract or not? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair there would probably be I would say 
relevantly senior employees in the organisation what level 
exactly I am not too sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because you see I – there is something 
that does not sit well with me if the position is that no matter 
how much the amount is that is involved the CFO is never 
20 
expected to ensure that before payment is made these steps 
– these requirements have been met.  There is something 
that does not sit well with me there.  If you say … 
MR SINGH:  If you allow me to explain Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  If you say – I will allow you.  If you 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 188 of 328 
 
say up to a certain amount I do not have to check it is 
sufficient if so and so checks.  I can understand but if – and 
then if you say once it reaches a certain amount because the 
amount is quite large then I must oversee that and I must – 
nobody must pay that without seeing my signature that I am 
approving that payment can be made.  Then I would 
understand but in terms of what you have told me so far in 
terms of the processes before payments are made the 
impression I get is the CFO never has to satisfy himself that 
these requirements have been met.  Other people, junior 
10 
people to him have to do that. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair if I can fill the gap? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SINGH:  In your understanding.  Mr Chair you have to 
appreciate that the role of the CFO or any senior executive 
is to establish policy and processes and monitor … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And implementation is it not? 
MR SINGH:  I am getting there Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And oversee implementation. 
MR SINGH:  I am getting there Sir. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  So firstly we start with establishing the policy 
and processes.  Now in Eskom’s case a big portion of the 
how can I say compliance to policy process and procedure is 
automated okay.  So it comes back to how the systems were 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 189 of 328 
 
designed.  So to the extent that internal audit and external 
audit audit the systems and are satisfied that they are – 
adequate controls in place to make sure that the checks and 
balances that you refer to are in place we have the 
reasonable assumption that the processes that are built into 
the system are checking and doing what they ought to be 
doing. To the extent that I have an oversight function I agree 
Sir that I do have an oversight and that oversight comes – 
function comes from again our own managers. So a person 
that directly reports to me for example in the case I have 
10 
spoken about Mr Pillay for example.  Mr Pillay had a duty to 
ensure that his treasury environment complied with all the 
policies, procedures, legal acts and so on – and so forth 
applicable to a treasury [?] with the systems that we had 
provided. So my function was to provide him with the 
direction, the systems, the tools that he required.  To the 
extent that he found deviation.  He had a responsibility to 
report it to me.  If there was a weakness he had a 
responsibility to tell me there is a weakness here we need to 
fix this.  Or again based on reports that I found maybe 
20 
reports that come to if I identified a weakness it would then 
be incumbent upon me to again improve the environment.  
But our biggest source of how can I say oversight came from 
internal audit and external audit in any large organisation 
they talk about the three lines of defence which is 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 190 of 328 
 
management, internal audit and external audit.  So in that 
case Mr Chair that is where that assurance came from. So to 
the extent that there were deviations that were identified that 
is when we would have played a role to understand why did 
the deviation come about?  Was it due to system override?  
Was it due to negligence?  Was it due to fraud?  And then 
you – then you basically go through an improvement 
process.  If there was negligence or fraud or any of these 
other let us call it irregular issues that were identified in 
terms of the deviation you would then go through what we 
10 
termed a disciplinary process for the particular 00:09:29. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that is – that is after the effect 
disciplinary process. 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am looking more at measures that are put 
in place to minimise the chances of for example a large 
amount even by Eskom’s standards being paid out in 
circumstances where it should not be paid out because there 
is no contract and I am saying that I would have expected 
that the transactions would come – would reach a level of 
20 
monitoring early where it would be said you know we need 
our top finance person to approve this before it can be paid 
not junior staff and not middle management for this kind of 
amount – for this kind of transaction we will – we as Eskom 
want to rely on the judgment of our top finance person the 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 191 of 328 
 
CFO.  That is – that is where my query is. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair you are – you are – I would put it this 
way.  As I have explained the policies, procedures and 
practice with an organisation as large as let us say Eskom 
and Transnet get incorporated into the computer system let 
us call it that and in Eskom and Transnet was basically the 
same process.   Now the payments process for example let 
us say in this case right.  In this case this was not a 
financial deviation this was a procurement deviation in that a 
process – a payment was processed with a contract that was 
10 
dated post the actual payment being processed.  Now there 
could be a number of reasons for that right.  Firstly they 
could have identified that there was this anomaly and 
therefore sought the required deviation and that deviation 
would have been on the system. So we can actually go back 
and find out who authorised this deviation to enable the 
payment to happen.  So that is inbuilt in the system.  So 
when you say you know it is post the event it is actually not 
post the event. Yes the disciplinary … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I was talking about the disciplinary 
20 
process. 
MR SINGH:  The disciplinary is post. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  But in this case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 192 of 328 
 
MR SINGH:  In this case Mr Chair this would have been 
flagged in that it would not have allow the payment to 
happen because there was no contract yet you had a 
delivery note and you had an invoice.  So the finance guys 
would have said but this cannot happen.  But there would 
have been an intervention before that on the procurement 
side that would have enabled this to happen for the finance 
people to have processed it.  So when we now go back to 
understand and look at the audit trail relating to the 
transaction itself we would be able to identify what did the 
10 
finance person do, what did the invoice guy do, what did the 
contracts guy do and who actually allowed this transaction to 
occur. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So is the gist of what you are saying that 
the internal policies and mechanisms at Eskom included 
provisions that prescribed who should check what before a 
payment such as this payment was authorised and you say 
that was not you and that person can be identified whose 
duty it was to check whether there was a valid contract 
before authorising and that is the person who should have 
20 
checked. 
MR SINGH:  That is correct Mr Chair.  Mr Chair in – in my 
role my obligation is to make sure that there are processes, 
policies and procedures and practice that prevent these type 
of things from happening. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 193 of 328 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
MR SINGH:  And that could either be manual processes or 
checks or automated checks and in this – in the Eskom and 
Transnet environment most of the checks were automated.  
So – and again on your second point yes Mr Chair I can 
confirm that if we have to go back to Eskom and find out who 
overrode the system to enable this payment to happen there 
should be an auditor that identifies that person.  And again 
that identification would have happened by internal audit and 
external audit.  Again then I come into play and if it 
10 
happened within the finance environment and I do not 
discipline let us say the finance manager because this 
happened if it was indeed his fault then yes I take 
responsibility for that because then I am letting that person 
perpetuate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Singh but you were 
the gatekeeper. You asked Eric Wood – Mr Eric Wood and 
Regiments to offer services in respect of the corporate plan.  
Their invoice came to you directly for the payment of 30 over 
20 
R30.6 million.  If anybody has to be responsible it is yourself 
as the finance person – the chief of finance – the person 
who asked for the service – the person who receives the 
invoice – the person who sends the invoice for processing it 
should be you? 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 194 of 328 
 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I respectfully disagree with Mr Seleka 
based on the discussion that you and I just had in terms of 
what my role and responsibility in the finance process is and 
I also would like to correct Mr Seleka or Advocate Seleka in 
that I was not the one that requested services from 
Regiments or … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are not the one who?  Just – do not 
swallow your words. 
MR SINGH:  I was not the one who requested services of 
Trillian. 
 
McKinsey 
brought 
their 
sub-contractor 
who 
10 
happened to be Trillian or Regiments as we have spoken this 
morning.  Yes they performed the work as we have explained 
this morning the invoice did come to me and I sent it to the 
appropriate people for them to process.  Had there been a 
problem with this invoice it was incumbent upon them to 
bring it back to me and say listen we cannot pay this for the 
following reason.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you see the contract between Eskom 
and McKinsey in other words what we are seeing now? 
MR SINGH:  No Sir. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you see it at any stage. 
MR SINGH:  No Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  While you were at Eskom. 
MR SINGH:  No Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So how does it happen that you are 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 195 of 328 
 
involved in the discussions prior to coming to Eskom with 
McKinsey obviously this is something quite important to them 
that is McKinsey and maybe to Eskom as well this agreement 
that at that stage they wanted Eskom to buy into as I 
understand the position before you came to Eskom in August 
2015 and ultimately they get to do the work but you do not 
take the trouble to say let me see what contract we have 
with these people because even before I came to Eskom 
they already wanted to brief me and tell me about what they 
– they – what plans they have for Eskom about the future 
10 
and the future included this agreement even though on your 
version they might not have negotiated it with you.  How 
come you would not have wanted to see this agreement even 
as they were rendering the service – the services you would 
not want to see – you would not have been keen to see it? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair the – the – the nexus of the agreement 
emanated from a board resolution that was taken to 
authorise the delegated authority to sign the contract.  The 
delegated authority to sign the contract was identified as – 
as I correctly remember as Mr Matshela Koko who was at the 
20 
time I think the Group Executive 00:19:55 and Commercial. 
So he was the de – and hence I was surprised when 
Advocate Seleka mentioned that it was signed by Mr 
Oberline.  So there was no need for me to look at the 
contract because the contract was – the delegated authority 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 196 of 328 
 
to actually enter into the contract was Mr Koko.  The inputs 
of the contract was contained in the – in the board 
submission. 
The 
Terms 
and 
Conditions 
therefore 
was 
included in the board submission.  It was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  They were included in? 
MR SINGH:  Sorry in the board submission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  That approved Mr Koko to conclude the 
contract.  Those Terms and Conditions found its way into the 
contract and Mr Koko – it was my understanding that Mr 
10 
Koko would have then signed the – my expectation was that 
McKinsey together with Regiments and or Trillian delivered 
the corporate plan.  In whatever shape, manner or form that 
document needed to be delivered and to understanding as I 
have explained to you before the process that we undertook 
to deliver the same – very same corporate plan.  So from my 
perspective I knew that the corporate plan was to deliverable 
from the contract, they had come, they had done what they 
needed to do, they had delivered.  And therefore I was 
satisfied that work had been performed.  Similarly on the 
20 
McKinsey side.  McKinsey may have sent me an invoice as 
well so it would have followed the same process.  So equally 
so Mr Chair this contract is problematic for the McKinsey 
invoice.  So again it comes back to a point as would I have 
had to see this agreement?  Mr Chair I would not have even 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 197 of 328 
 
considered seeing it because in my view it was a – I would 
have expected that the contract would have been concluded 
it would have been concluded for the delivery of the 
corporate plan – I was comfortable that the corporate plan 
was delivered and thereafter if the invoices had come to me I 
would have sent it for processing with the understanding that 
the processes, policies, procedures that ought to have been 
followed or the payment to have occurred would have been 
complied. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what would have been the purpose of 
10 
anybody sending the invoice to you? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I think at the end of the day the 
service providers normally send invoices to the department 
or the person to whom the services were rendered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the services would have been rendered 
to you? 
MR SINGH:  Well I was basically the coordinator of the 
corporate plan.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You – you were – you were the most senior 
person in regard to the project. 
20 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If we call it that. 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And then they sent the invoice to 
you. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 198 of 328 
 
MR SINGH:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I would imagine that the person to 
whom an invoice is sent is supposed to be the person who 
can confirm whether what has been done is what was 
expected of the service provider and whether it was done 
correctly and I guess also whether it was done in accordance 
with the agreement that would be my expectation.  Because 
you would know if the service provider had been expected or 
required to perform service A but it performed service B in 
which case when you look at the invoice and it says service 
10 
B was provided you say no, no, we cannot pay for that.  
Would you not agree with that expectation? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I would agree with your final assertion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  Associated with let us say a glaring error. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  Let us say I received McKinsey invoice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  And it was for Transnet work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR SINGH:  In error. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  That would be glaring and I would say to them 
listen this is not within our expectation there is no need for 
you to send this.  So let us say for example the corporate 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 199 of 328 
 
plan. The corporate plan as per our attached in our affidavit 
Mr Chair both McKinsey and the Trillian invoice went to 
specific people that required them to sign off on specific 
aspects of the work that was delivered by Eskom – oh 
delivered to Eskom.  Those individuals asserted that that 
services were received.  Those pieces of paper or those 
confirmations would then flow into the system.  People would 
then look at who and what was done and who verified what 
in terms of the policies and processes that I have explained.  
And once that process was complete and everyone was 
10 
comfortable they would release the payment but as you state 
Mr Chair if there was something glaring wrong with the 
invoice yes I would probably get up and say listen this is not 
acceptable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it might not be – it might not be what is 
expected of you in terms of objecting whether appropriate to 
paying that invoice.  It might not be limited to situations 
where there is a glaring error but an invoice is presented to 
you is it not your duty particularly if the work that is alleged 
to have been done is alleged to have been done under 
20 
maybe your portfolio or if you are the ultimate person who 
can say no this is not what we asked for, this is not what we 
asked you to do.  Is it not the position that whether it is 
glaring or not you must just satisfy yourself that they have 
done what was required of them? 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 200 of 328 
 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair and I will say it again.  And it relates 
to the corporate plan. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  There was one deliverable the 300 page 
document.  The 300 page document was delivered.  It was 
delivered through a process of these integrated meetings 
that used to happen on a weekly basis. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that – ja. 
MR SINGH:  That I have eluded to earlier.  So through those 
meetings I had a view that whatever this contract envisaged 
10 
was being actioned you see as it relates to me.  So when the 
invoice arrived it was not an unforeseen expectation that the 
work was not delivered.  If that was the case I would have 
not even sent the invoice for processing you see and I will 
give you another example shortly.  If I was satisfied that 
there was reasonable performance it would then go for 
processing.  In terms of the policies and processes and 
practices that I have mentioned no one has the authority to 
override those processes, policies and practices other than 
following a specific process else it is impossible to police the 
20 
volume of transactions that an entity such as Eskom or 
Transnet would have to process.  The other example that I 
would like to use Mr Chair is take for example the external 
auditors.  External auditors provide services over a period of 
time.  They perform it in terms of a budget right.  Invariably 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 201 of 328 
 
budgets sometimes does not meet actions and they are 
overrided.  Who gets that invoice?  The CFO gets the 
invoice.  Who do they report to?  They do not report to me 
they report to the Audit Committee. I do not have authority to 
approve that invoice until the Audit Committee sits and 
deliberates on its fees you see.  Now even on that invoice 
that comes in order for the Audit Committee to form a view 
because we are intimately involved with the Audit process we 
know that they had problems in this area or they overspent 
in this area or there was a complex issue there or you know 
10 
the Eskom people did not provide the information on time.  
So when they provide us reasons for those overrides 
because we are intimately involved in those processes we 
are able to validate those reasons and in my case Mr Chair 
the – the external audit liaison - let us call it the head of the 
financial reporting function.  We first have to look at that 
invoice to understand what are the deviations, to what 
extent are we comfortable with the reasons that are being 
report.  Once we received those reasons, those reasons 
are then analysed again by myself.   
20 
 
I 
feel 
the 
reasonable, 
we 
then 
submit 
an 
application to the Audit Committee to recommend the fees 
or deviations there from and once that approval is 
received, we then consider approving the payment.  So 
that is the process that one would follow for invoice 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 202 of 328 
 
processes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But basically, you are saying that in 
regard to this project you were quite involved in it.  I think 
you said there were these monthly meetings. 
MR SINGH:   Weekly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Weekly meetings, where you met with a 
large group of people involved.  I guess that at such 
meeting, you would have played a leadership role to guide 
where everything should be going because I take it in the 
absence of somebody, like, the Group CEO, you would 
10 
have been the most senior Eskom officials at such 
meetings. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So you would have been given 
guidance as to whether the project was still going in the 
right direction and so on and so on.  and this went on for 
about how many months before it was finalised, this plan? 
MR SINGH:   As I said, Mr Chair, I think the initiative 
started probably in October. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MR SINGH:   And run right up until mid-February, I think. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is about four months or so and 
you are meeting weekly? 
MR SINGH:   Well, the meetings continued over a matter, 
of course. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 203 of 328 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Ja, ja.  It is just, your level of 
involvement gives me some difficulty when I think that you 
were not supposed to see the contract about something 
you were so intimately involved.  You were not supposed 
because that is what you have said.  You said you are not 
supposed to see the contract.  It just seems odd to me that 
– I do not know whether the CFO is the second most senior 
person in the organisation.  Is that correct? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, the reason for the CFO being the 
second 
most 
senior 
person 
in 
the 
organisation 
10 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MR SINGH:   ...is the reason why I would not spend the 
time at looking at ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   ...the context. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...you might put that way but I would 
have thought that the second most senior official of an 
organisation, if he gets intimately involved in any project, 
then one thing he would like to make sure is that there is 
20 
proper – there is a proper contract if there is supposed to 
be a proper contract because you would not like to be 
embarrassed to find that he was so intimately involved in 
this thing and yet there was no valid contract. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, again, coming back to my original 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 204 of 328 
 
statement.  There are policies, processes and practises 
that individuals within Eskom are supposed to comply with.  
That is my obligation to put in place.   
 
The board, for example Mr Chair, in terms of the 
PVA, is required to put in place processes and practises 
and policies to govern the financial environment.  It is not 
a 
requirement 
for 
them 
to 
look 
at 
everything 
of 
a 
transaction. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.  I understand that the board 
might not be required to look at every transaction and I 
10 
understand that not everything goes to the board, you 
know, in terms of transactions.   
 
It might depend on the monetary value of the 
transaction but if you being a senior person, as senior as 
you were, CFO, were so intimately involved in a project 
that every week you were taking your time to attend 
meetings over four months, that you should be so involved 
and yet not think it is necessary to see whether there is a 
valid contract here.   
 
That sounds a little odd to me.  Maybe I am 
20 
unfair to you but that is just giving you what I am thinking.  
And maybe I am going to change my mind when you have 
said what you might wish to say. 
 
But that seems strange to me because I would 
think that you would say:  Well, before I get too involved, 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 205 of 328 
 
where are the founding documents that you have been 
placed about this, what are our obligations?  And because 
also, I can only give guidance if I know what our 
obligations are.   
MR SINGH:   Hence Mr Chair, I began from the founding 
documents relating to the contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   The founding documents were – was the 
submission to the board which I co-signed with Mr Koko.  
Mr Koko was the delegative authority to sign the contract.  
10 
I was at all material times aware of what the deliverables 
of the contract was which was the Corporate Plan and it 
was a fixed price contract and it was over hundred million, 
okay.   
 
I knew that much because of the submission to 
the board.  As you said, Mr Chair, I was intimately involved 
in the project.  Therefore, when the invoices arrived, it was 
not as if the 30% that we paid to Trillian or the 70% that 
we paid to McKinsey was a surprise because it was within 
my expectation at the time, that we were going to have to 
20 
pay 70% to McKinsey and 30% to the subcontractor 
whoever they may have been.   
 
The fact that I was intimately involved in the 
project, let us call it that, also gave me comfort that the 
work had been done notwithstanding, Mr Chairman, the 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 206 of 328 
 
invoice too went through the normal approval processes 
where each lead had to sign off to say but the work was 
done.   
 
And consequently Mr Chair, as I have said, that 
was what my responsibility was to make sure that there are 
policies, processes and procedures in place that people 
adhere to, to the extent that there are deviations, I have a 
responsibility too, understand why they are there and do 
something about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Mr Seleka.   
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  I have a few questions Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then we can adjourn so that we 
can start with Mr Pamensky. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Singh, a couple of things.  If 
Mr Koko was authorised to sign and not Mr Mabelane, and 
as you say, you were surprised to Mr Mabelane having 
signed, that means his signature there, even he had 
properly and fully completed that form, we talked about 
20 
earlier, it would have had no effect to the...  I see you are 
laughing.   
MR SINGH:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You know the answer to – you know the 
question – you know the answer to it? 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 207 of 328 
 
MR SINGH:   All I can say, it was not me.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs]  It was not you. 
MR SINGH:   No, sir.  ...  Oh, yes, I think I just need to – I 
know it was – I am not too sure if it was delegated to 
Mr Koko as his name or his position.  If it was in his – they 
normally delegate in terms of the position.  So they 
delegate to the CFO or the CE and so on.   
 
There was an organisational change at some 
point in time where commercial was taken out of as a 
Group Executive, Technology and Commercial.   
10 
 
So 
that 
may 
have 
been 
the 
reason 
why 
Mr Mabelane eventually signed because as you would see, 
the letter of acceptance was actually signed by Mr Koko.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is one.  Number two.  I am a bit 
confused by your evidence.  Earlier said, your version was, 
Mr Pillay had drafted the proposal – I mean, a plan which 
was not acceptable to you.   
 
Then you went to Mr Eric Wood and you said 
please assist.  When you were reading from your affidavit 
you said there was nothing untoward that.  I say, yes, I am 
20 
not suggesting that.   
 
So you went to them and you asked them to 
assist you with the Corporate Plan on that version.   
MR SINGH:   Again, I may be missing the point, sir.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, I am only reiterating what you 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 208 of 328 
 
said. 
MR SINGH:   Oh, okay.  So there is a point to come? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.   
MR SINGH:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That you went to them and you asked 
them to assist you with the Funding Plan.  That is your 
version, is it not? 
MR SINGH:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So then, that is why I am saying 
to you, and it emphasis the point the Chairperson is trying 
10 
to make with you.  If you approached them and you asked 
them to assist you with the Funding Plan, you then were 
the person, of all the people, who should make sure that 
there is a contract in place.  And that is why I am saying to 
you that you were the gatekeeper.  Let me hear your 
comment. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, in terms of commenting to 
Mr Seleka’s point.  I would reiterate.  Eskom awarded a 
contract to McKinsey for the compilation of the Corporate 
Plan.  McKinsey choice their subcontractor, in this case 
20 
being Regiments/Trillian.  They decided the work that was 
allocated between the parties in terms of the 70/30 split.   
 
Because of Regiments’ technical skill in the 
financial environment, they awarded the finance aspects 
thereof which included the Funding Plan.  As I have stated, 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 209 of 328 
 
Mr Chair, I had done what I was required to do in terms of 
my fiduciary duties relating to the delivery of services 
under the Corporate Plan.   
 
I put in place processes and procedures and 
policies to make sure that all payments followed a certain 
standard as was accepted by internal and external, as it is 
my duty under the PFA, as a board member.   
 
Those policies and procedures are supposed to 
be adhered to by those very specific employees.  That was 
what my gatekeeper role entailed.  My gatekeeper role did 
10 
not entail me scrutinising every single invoice and every 
single contract. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But we are talking one invoice here 
and one contract.   
MR SINGH:   It does not matter, sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Why does it not matter? 
MR SINGH:   Because this contract is not special.  I fail to 
see the specialness which this contract is being dealt with. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is the Funding Plan.  You were 
responsible ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR SINGH:   So let us talk about the R 70 million that we 
paid to McKinsey. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let us talk about? 
MR SINGH:   Let us talk about the R 70 million that we 
paid to McKinsey. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 210 of 328 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   R 70 million? 
MR SINGH:   That emanated from this contract.   
CHAIRPERSON:   What R 70 million is that?  Is that to 
Eskom? 
MR SINGH:   No, sir.  This contract, as you pointed out 
correctly this morning, was R 98 million contract where we 
thought it was R 98 billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   That split of, let us call it a hundred million, 
was split 70/30 between McKinsey and its subcontractor. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   So if we paid R 30 million to, let us call it 
Trillian, 
then 
conglomerate 
we 
paid 
R 70 million 
to 
McKinsey. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   So the issue that they raise around the 
contract is equally applicable for both service providers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, of course. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course.  But does that make a 
20 
difference? 
MR SINGH:   No, and hence I am saying ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   ...I had done what I believed to be my 
fiduciary duties.  My fiduciary duties was to establish the 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 211 of 328 
 
system of control. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, but insofar as you say:  Why 
are we talking so much about the 30% ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Well, in this contract ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...and there is 70%.  But the points that 
are being made are not really dependent on the 30%.  
Whether they apply to the entire payment to both entities. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   I concede that point, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
10 
MR SINGH:   But the point that I am trying to make is.  
This contract in its entirety, the 70% and the 30% is not 
special in any way, shape or form.  It is a normal contract 
that should have went to the normal processes that were 
established within Eskom for it to either be formulated in 
the first place, approved, signed an implemented and 
ultimately paid.   
 
For each one of those processes, or how can I 
say 
it, 
functional 
areas, 
there 
are 
specific 
rules, 
processes, policies and procedures that needs to be 
20 
followed by a specific individual. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, no, no.  That is fine.  I think you 
have made that point.  Let me go back what may link with 
Mr Seleka’s point but maybe not necessarily.  I think what 
you are saying, and you must – I just want to confirm that I 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 212 of 328 
 
understand you correctly.   
 
The version that you are putting up is.  Yes, I 
had...  Yes, McKinsey was very keen to brief me on certain 
matters relating to Eskom even before I got seconded to 
Eskom and I attended the meetings that I attended with 
them.   
 
Yes, I got involved in this project of the Funding 
Plan, Corporate Plan, Funding Plan.  I got involved and I 
got very involved.  Yes, I asked Regiments to actually 
render the service.  Yes, I attended with the meetings over 
10 
four months with a number of people on this project.  Yes, I 
saw the invoice.  It was sent to me.  Yes, I passed it on to 
other people at Eskom for them to do their part.   
 
But notwithstanding that level of involvement, I 
was unaware, I have never seen the agreement or 
contracts between Eskom and McKinsey.  That is what of 
what you are saying.  Is my understanding correct? 
MR SINGH:   Let me put it to you this way, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MR SINGH:   The initial part of where you say I met with 
20 
McKinsey and Regiments prior to me...  [Speaker ’s voice 
drops – unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   I did do that but you need to understand the 
context within which it happened.  The context within which 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 213 of 328 
 
it happened was... and getting me to a point where I will be 
comfortable to take on a challenge as... Eskom and hit the 
ground running.   
 
We had a liquidity challenge in January 2015 
where we had no – where there was no possibility of 
paying salaries.  So that is the context within which those 
meetings happened.   
 
Mr Chair, where you specified that this project – 
I got very involved in this project.  Mr Chair, anything I 
undertake, I get very involved in.  So hence me saying, 
10 
this thing is not special. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright. 
MR SINGH:   If I do anything, I get...   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SINGH:   And hence, my point being that if I was not 
involved in this and I received an invoice for R 500 million, 
the first thing I would do is call – let us say it was a new 
bill invoice, for example.   
 
The first thing I would have done is call Mr 
Masango and said:  Mr Masango, I received this invoice.  I 
20 
do not know.  If he was not able to answer, I would say:  
Mr Masango, you better bring your people here to explain 
this thing.   
 
So the reciprocal is actually true.  If you are not 
involved in something you have a heightened sense of 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 214 of 328 
 
scepticism relating to something that you see and that is 
what 
triggers 
the 
ancillary 
processes 
that 
you 
are 
expecting in this invoice.  Thirdly, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   I have been points to suggest that I did not 
request Regiments to get involved in the preparation of the 
Corporate or the Funding Plan.  It was McKinsey’s initiative 
that was allowed it in Regiments being involved in the 
preparation of the Funding Plan as well as other aspects of 
the Corporate Plan. 
10 
 
Passed it on to relevant other individuals, again, 
within the context of them having to do what they needed 
to do.  In terms of the policies, process and procedures 
that Eskom have in place to ensure that the invoices are 
valid, accurate and complete before a payment is made 
and being valid, means that you have to have a contract. 
 
In terms of not seeing the contract, Mr Chair, I 
think I have explained the issues associated with a 
heightened level of scepticism.  That is when I would call 
for it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  On the liquidity 
issue, Mr Anoj Singh, or the allegation you are making 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 215 of 328 
 
about liquidity.  I am going to give you a reference to 
Ms Tsholofele Molefe’s affidavit, dealing with that specific 
aspect in response to Ms Lynne Brown’s allegation.   
 
So we will deal with that on your return.  I will 
give you the reference and to your lawyers.  It is in Eskom 
Bundle 13 and on page 686.  It starts with – on page 688.   
 
Now talking of her.  She had been approached in 
2014 in respect of the Corporate Plan, the Funding Plan 
which Mr Tsotsi had said the Minister says is not robust 
enough.  And Mr Colin Matjila offered the internal people to 
10 
exist.  Low and behold, that was Mr Salim Essa, they were 
to introduce him to her. 
 
Mr Salim Essa said he will bring Regiments to do 
– to be the service provider in respect of the Corporate 
Plan, Funding Plan.  They met at Monte Casino, I think.  
And Mr Salim Essa undertook to give a proposal in five 
days or Mr Eric Wood, also in that meeting at Eskom. 
 
She says in her version, they... to give a 
proposal within the time they had said they would.  
Instead, after 14-days, they gave a draft agreement to 
20 
Eskom.  And she said that this is not what we were 
promised and she refused to sign the draft agreement even 
against Mr Collin Matjila’s assistance and some of the 
board members stood up for her. 
 
She 
thinks, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
that, 
she 
got 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 216 of 328 
 
suspended the following year and ultimately gotten rid of at 
Eskom.  So it is surprising that under your – on your watch, 
the very Regiments that she had refused the year before is 
now appointed. 
 
You have any comment on that? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, as I have mentioned before.  
Regiments was a function of McKinsey.  It was not a 
function of me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you paid them directly. 
MR SINGH:   Based on the policy and procedures 
10 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not pay McKinsey and left 
McKinsey and Regiments to sort out how they shared the 
payment.  You paid them directly as if Eskom had a direct 
contract with them. 
MR SINGH:   But Mr Chair, I do not see the relevance of 
that to the point that Mr Seleka is raising. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you are saying in response, in 
effect:  Look, we had nothing to do with Regiments.  They 
were McKinsey’s subcontractors.  So in other words, do not 
20 
bring me into the picture about Regiments.   
 
So, but I am saying, it looks like you are saying 
that when it is convenient to say that but you dealt directly 
with them when it is convenient.  You pay them directly.   
 
You do not say:  Well, they are McKinsey’s 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 217 of 328 
 
subcontractors.  We have nothing to do with them.  So 
even when it comes to payment, McKinsey will pay them.   
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, with all due respect, I think we have 
dealt 
with 
this 
process 
in 
the 
morning 
as 
well 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   ...of saying that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But that was before he brings the end of 
that.  He is bringing ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   No, no.  I agree.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:   And I will repeat what I testified to 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   ...is that there is a policy, process and 
procedure 
in 
place 
that 
deals 
with 
payment 
of 
subcontractors directly.  So I did not intervene in that 
process.  I did not favour them in that process.  I did not 
have anything to do with the process.  The process was 
there.  It was established.  They followed the process.  And 
20 
the payment was processed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you recall when it was that Eskom 
started having this policy that subcontractors of main 
contractors should be paid directly by Eskom? 
MR SINGH:   But Mr Chair, it was not – I did not create the 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 218 of 328 
 
past. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   So I will assume in previous ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   When you arrived, they were there? 
MR SINGH:   I was given to understand it was there... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and you – and did you say at 
Transnet when you were there, there were similar policies 
too? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And there too, as far as you know, they 
10 
had been there before you became CFO? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I think the – I stand under 
correction 
but 
I 
think 
that 
policy 
may 
have 
been 
implemented by myself at Transnet ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   ...on recommendation of a procurement 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you still have something to put to 
him or we can adjourn? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, I think we can adjourn Chair.  I 
will check about the police because I hear my investigator 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 219 of 328 
 
saying he was told by Eskom officials that there was not a 
policy of the sorts Mr Singh has referred to, but I am not 
putting anything to you until I have satisfied myself 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...that there is or there was or was not 
a policy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, before we adjourn.  My learned 
friend has to put something on record and I am not letting 
10 
her off the hook. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   [No audible reply] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Well, she looks bewildered.  She 
does not know what you are talking about.  [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Give her a clue.

CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   He wants to me, after I already 
apologised to him, again apologise publicly to him.  It is 
pertaining to Ms Mothepu’s second affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   I indicated this morning that I 
was unaware of such a 3.3. Notice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   It was brought to my attention 
that there was indeed such a 3.3. Notice.  So my only 
10 
excuse will be, like, the dog ate my homework or it went 
into my junk mail but when I said it at the time, that was 
my impression and I accept that there was such a 3.3. 
Notice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Because it was shown to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   So in as much as he might not 
want to suggest that I try to or cast dispersions on him, 
that was not what I wanted to do.

ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  So Mr Pamensky, 
10 
you are aware – I have not read this affidavit, to the extent 
that you need to refer to it, if there is anything want to, you 
are free to do so, I only need the assurance from you that 
it does not implicate anyone. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Adv Seleka, Chair, it does to implicate 
anyone, it was the request from the Chair, Deputy Chief 
Justice Zondo, to please just cover those issues that you 
had issues with from other witnesses, so I duly did that in 
a short space. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, I see, thank you very much.  Let 
20 
us deal first and foremost with the affidavit on page 719 
which is EXHIBIT U39.3. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, Sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see that affidavit has annexures of 
pictures of buildings on page 722, 723, 724 and 725 as 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 227 of 328 
 
well as 726.  Can you please explain to the Chairperson 
what is it that we see there? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, Mr Chair.  The first picture A1 is 
the first building as you drive into Melrose Arch on the 
right hand …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  I think Mr Seleka, start a 
little earlier so that whoever reads will understand. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You start quite some distance because 
you know us to know what the background is.  Mr 
10 
Pamensky, what is this affidavit about that you depose to? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair, this affidavit was a request from 
yourself to please give the location of Mr Salim’s offices in 
Melrose Arch. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In respect of what period? 
MR PAMENSKY:   In respect of the period 2015 and 2016, 
if I am correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, alright and you had 
confirmed that you knew his back offices that he used 
during that time, is that correct? 
20 
MR PAMENSKY:   That is correct, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think take it from there, Mr 
Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh.  Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr 
Pamensky, probably you also need to explain how would 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 228 of 328

occupied by Mr Essa. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair, as you know, I was friendly with 
Mr Essa, so I knew exactly where his offices were. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and you said last time you had been 
to his offices a number of times. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, Chair, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You would have heard also Ms 
Mothepu to – not Mothepu, Ms Goodson, testifying that 
10 
from time to time when she was working for Trillian and 
Trillian occupied offices at Melrose Arch he would meet 
with your from time to time when you go for a smoke break.  
Do you confirm that to have been the position? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair, I confirm that we did have 
cigarette breaks or I did smoke with her. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, what was the address – what is the 
address of the offices that Mr Salim Essa used in 2015 that 
you used to visit?  I see you provide the address in 
paragraph 5.

11A, 
1 s t 
floor,

Melrose 
Boulevard,

Arch, 
Johannesburg.

you used to visit him. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 229 of 328 
 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, alright, take it from there Mr 
Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So then are these annexures – oh, you 
want to say something? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, can I …[intervenes] 
MR PAMENSKY:   Sorry, Chair, you wanted me to explain 
Ms Bianca Goodson and the smoking? 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, let us do it …[intervenes] 
MR PAMENSKY:   No, I wanted to explain this affidavit 
10 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, we will come to that. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Okay, Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, as a result of the request that I 
made to you to assist the Commission in order to identify 
the place where Mr Salim Essa’s offices were located, what 
happened 
after 
you 
had 
left 
the 
Commission, 
what 
arrangements were made for you to show the Commission 
personnel where those offices were? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair, are you asking me what 
20 
happened? 
CHAIRPERSON:   What arrangements were made for you 
to show the Commission personnel where Mr Salim Essa’s 
offices used to be in 2015. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair, my attorney liaised with the

CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   And we met there with my advocate, 
Ms… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, if you do not remember your 
advocate’s name, she is going to charge you for… 
MR PAMENSKY:   Sorry, Chair, I am terrible with names, I 
always have been.  Isabel Goodman attended there with 
me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR PAMENSKY:   I think we met on the 5 March. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Roughly at about eleven o’clock – or 
sorry, twelve o’clock to be precise. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And there were members of the 
investigation team of the Commission who met you there as 
well? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, Chair, there were two investigators. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Cannot remember the names. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   And there was this lovely lady here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, alright.  And at the time you 
remembered the address as well or you just remembered 
where the offices used to be located? 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 231 of 328 
 
MR PAMENSKY:   No, I pointed out where it located. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you did not remember the address 
at the time …[intervenes] 
MR PAMENSKY:   Not the exact address, no, but I knew 
the building. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you knew where they used to be. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you pointed that out. 
MR PAMENSKY:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  And what building were they? 
10 
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair, they were building 1 Melrose 
Boulevard, Melrose Arch, Johannesburg. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  That building did it have a number 
of floors? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes it did, Chair, it has a number of 
floors. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, what floor were his offices? 
MR PAMENSKY:   The first floor. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The first floor.  Do you want to describe 
or to tell me about some of the main features of where – of 
20 
the place or part of the building where his offices used to 
be? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, Chair, it is an open courtyard type 
of building like this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 232 of 328 
 
MR PAMENSKY:   You would walk up the stairs to the first 
floor.  You would walk right across to the end of that area. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   And there was his offices, number 11A. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   And you would open the door.  There 
was a sitting area here too.  There was a boardroom in 
front of you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   And on the right hand side would be the 
10 
PA and the toilets. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   You would go down and on the left would 
be Mr Salim’s office and it had a balcony behind it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   And on the right there was I think 
another office and some desks. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   And that was it, Chair, it was a very 
small office. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now from the street, maybe the 
nearest street or one of the streets around, could one see 
the office, could one see the balcony or not? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, Chair, from Atholl Oaklands Road 
you could see clearly see the balcony. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 233 of 328 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Mr Seleka, do you want to 
take from there? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   And you can refer him to the pictures. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so if we go to the pictures, Mr 
Pamensky, are you able to point to the Chairperson the one 
that would show Mr Salim Essa’s office? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, Chair, if you would look at the 
annexure marked A1.1 you should see it there with the red 
arrow. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe before you do that, tell us what 
A1 depicts, what does it show, that picture at A1, what 
does it [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
MR PAMENSKY:   Oh sorry, that picture at A1 is the 
picture of the courtyard showing the building with ground 
floor, first floor, second floor and a bit of the top floor.  So 
it is the inner courtyard and the inner courtyard is pointing 
at the offices, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but you see the person who was 
taken – I think walking there, there is a picture of 
20 
somebody who was walking, I think, on A1.  Can you see 
where that person is?  he seems to be walking.  Can you 
see that picture on A1 at page …[intervenes] 
MR PAMENSKY:   Oh, A1, sorry, I was A1.1.  Yes, Chair, 
sorry, I see that person walking in A1, sorry, Chair. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 234 of 328 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now on that picture Mr Salim 
Essa’s office would it be on this side. 
MR PAMENSKY:   No, Chair, it is not this side, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is not this side. 
MR PAMENSKY:   No, it is not this side, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can you see it from this side, from this 
picture, can you see the offices or not? 
MR PAMENSKY:   No, you cannot, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, so this is just a view from the 
street? 
10 
MR PAMENSKY:   That is – I would not so – yes, you can 
say at the street but more within the boulevard. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR PAMENSKY:   You are in the boulevard itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  And then I think Mr 
Seleka then referred you to A1.1. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Point 1, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, do you want to take it from 
there? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, please.  Mr Pamensky, if you can 
20 
then explain what we see on A1.1? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair, what I see on A1.1, Chair, is the 
courtyard and you have the first ground level, you have the 
first floor, you have the second floor and you have got a bit 
of a cut-off of the top floor, Chair.  You have an arrow – 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 235 of 328 
 
sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, Chair, you have an arrow pointing 
to Mr Salim Essa’s office. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is a red arrow, is it pointing at Mr 
Salim Essa’s office as it was in 2015? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, Chair, as it was in 2015, that is 
correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  When you went there on the 5 
March do you know whether it is other people who use 
10 
those offices now? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair, we did not walk up, he just asked 
me to point where those offices are, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Point, oh.  Okay, alright.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Who took the photographs? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair, one of the investigators took the 
photographs. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So then the photo marked A1.1, which 
is on page 723, does it show the front part or the back part 
of the offices? 
20 
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair, that shows the front part of the 
office, that would be the entrance into the office. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, this is the entrance into the office? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There is a balcony there, is that correct? 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 236 of 328 
 
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair, there is a balcony behind. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There is a balcony behind? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, so we cannot see the balcony on 
A1.1. 
MR PAMENSKY:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay.  This side is on which 
street’s side if there is a street on this side or is there no 
street? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair, are you talking the – his office, 
10 
which side would it be? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Entrance side. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Oh, the entrance side, no, it would not 
be a street, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It would not be a street. 
MR PAMENSKY:   It would be in the boulevard. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay.  No, that is already.  
Yes, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I think the – I mean, just for one 
to have an understanding, where are you standing here, is 
20 
it on a driveway, or is it – you know, a walkway. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When the picture was taken. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, where the picture was taken 
where are you standing? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair, where we are standing is the 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 237 of 328 
 
entrance just past where you sign in with security. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   So we are on the ground floor looking up 
like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see. Because we wanted to 
understand whether is it a street where cars drive or is it 
just a walkway? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think you said it is inside the bundle. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Correct, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   That side, yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   So maybe this is a better way.  Let us 
just draw a square like that, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Inside the square is an open courtyard. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   And around is the offices. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, I see.  I see. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no that is alright. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Is there a photo that shows us 
the balcony behind Mr Essa’s office? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think we can just go – we can – I think 
there are only three more left, Mr Seleka, we can go to B1, 
B2 …[intervenes] 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 238 of 328 
 
MR PAMENSKY:   Advocate Seleka …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   He can tell us what it shows, what it 
depicts.  The picture which is marked B1 at 724, what does 
it depict or what does it show? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair, the picture is showing the balcony 
outside Mr Salim’s office that you would enter that balcony 
directly through his office, like I explain to you.  So you 
would walk into his office, you would have the boardroom, 
then you would go around, you have got his office and you 
could enter the balcony via his office. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR PAMENSKY:   That is the only way you can get to the 
balcony, via his office. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  And now the side of the building 
…[intervenes]3 
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair, my recollection from my side, this 
is on Atholl Oaklands Drive, so that is the long road.  So 
this overlooks Atholl Oaklands Road. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, so from the – that road you could 
see the balcony? 
20 
MR PAMENSKY:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So it is similar in regard to annexure 
B1.1 on page 725? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, it is very similar, it is just different 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 239 of 328 
 
angle of the picture, it is a different angle of the picture. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The please turn the page to page 726 
and you can – annexure marked C, you can explain to the 
Chairperson what do we see there. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair, that was the building that the 
entire Trillian Group moved into roughly about mid-year in 
2016, that would be the entrance and they would be on the 
very top floor over there, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay, and where is that building 
10 
situated, if you are able to – that is different from the 
building where Mr Salim Essa’s offices were that we have 
just been looking at. 
MR PAMENSKY:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Maybe just give you an explanation.  Let 
us assume you enter from – sorry, excuse, I am not looking 
at you, apologies.  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Just assuming you are coming from 
20 
Atholl Oaklands you would drive in to Melrose Arch.  On 
your right hand side would be Mr Essa’s office at that point 
in time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR PAMENSKY:   And there would be other offices come in 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 240 of 328 
 
and it would just before the gym, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   It could be just before the gym, actually 
opposite JB’s corner. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay.  So JB’s corner was quite 
close to Mr Salim Essa’s offices? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair, in terms of his old office, let us 
say that.  Old office, three, four, five minute walk.  Not 
even three minute walk, it is in a precinct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
10 
MR PAMENSKY:   And in terms of Trillian’s new office, it 
was just across the road, ten seconds. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Ja, okay, okay, alright.  I think he 
has covered what you really needed in regard to locating 
the offices. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Unless there is something that you still 
want to – ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, that is alright.  Mr Pamensky, I 
recall the evidence of two witnesses who came here.  One 
20 
is Ms Daniels, the other is Mr Masango.  Ms Daniels talks 
about an occasion where she was taken where – she drives 
with Mr Koko to Melrose Arch and Mr Koko meets with Mr 
Essa but she is left in the waiting area and Mr Koko goes 
into a boardroom with Mr Essa, they have a chat there and 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 241 of 328 
 
they come out meeting her there and they leave.  So your 
description of the offices of Mr Essa reminded me.  Does 
that accord with that?  There is a waiting area then a 
boardroom and she says she is left in …[intervenes] 
MR PAMENSKY:   Advocate Seleka, you are spot on 
correct, it was exactly what I said to you.  You would walk 
in the door, on the left you would have like a sitting area 
for someone, on the right you would have the PA and then 
directly was the boardroom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right, okay, thank you.  Then 
10 
Mr Masango talks about him being asked to go there.  He 
sees Mr Koko standing on the balcony.  They are talking on 
the phone in order for Mr Koko to give him the direction of 
where Mr Koko is and ultimately when he goes in he says 
he is asked to leave his phone by the receptionist and he 
walks into the boardroom.  So does that also give a picture 
of prior to you entering the boardroom you would have 
seen a reception and a receptionist there in close vicinity? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair, yes and no, correct.  But I do not 
know if there would be a receptionist there, an actual 
20 
person but yes …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
MR PAMENSKY:   I do not know if he had a PA or what the 
story was there but yes, there is on the side there, there is 
the desk for the PA. He used to have a PA, I just do not 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 242 of 328 
 
know if she was there or whatever.  But it does accord 
what you are saying. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, thank you.  Thank you 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, did Mr Masango mention the 
name of the street from which he could see the balcony or 
he could see Mr Koko on the balcony or did he not mention 
the street? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, he did not because he said he did 
not know where is Melrose Arch, he has never been there 
before. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, well he said he was going there for 
the first time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   For the first time, yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but he said from the street he could 
see Mr Koko on the balcony. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Mr Koko I think was according to Mr 
20 
Masango waving at him or directing him while they were 
speaking on the phone as well. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think he said he was waving at him 
maybe to draw attention to say this where I am. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 243 of 328 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, I cannot recall that part but… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or ja, maybe …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The phoning and giving directions was 
– I can remember that definitely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Okay, no that is fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much Mr Pamensky for 
providing that assistance to the Commission. 
MR PAMENSKY:   No problem, thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Mr Pamensky, I am going 
to go to your first affidavit. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   As I do, a couple of things maybe you 
want to – or not a couple of things, there is one thing 
about 
your 
marriage 
you 
want 
to 
correct 
to 
the 
Chairperson? 
MR PAMENSKY:   It is a whole different story, Chair, 
scarier than you and it is in my new affidavit, Chair.  As I 
20 
left you, I arrived home and my wife said to me Mark, you 
were not single, you were married eight months earlier, 
Chair, and you were free to go because she was overseas 
in Italy and she reminded me of it one night, which was the 
same I accorded with guys for like two days.  I immediately 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 244 of 328 
 
emailed my attorney and gave a copy of my wife’s 
passport.  But, Chair, maybe if you give me one minute to 
give a bit of context, Chair.  Blue Label Telecoms, Chair, is 
a massive listed company on the Johannesburg Securities 
Exchange, it has billions in turnover and it is worth billions 
in market capitalisation, so me and the two CEOs shared a 
big office, Chair, because I was single eight years before 
that, I used to go to most of the – 70, 80% of the all invites 
and the events and take people.  Like that is where I met 
Mr Pamalo(?) at the Vodacom awards, so I used to do most 
10 
of the events and do that, Chair.  So when I meant single 
to my wife, I meant I was single before.  I was married at 
that time so, sorry, Chair, sorry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  So the correction is, Chair, when 
Blue Labels received the invitation to the Gupta weddings 
in 2013, Mr Pamensky had said that he told the CEO that 
he will attend the wedding because he is single at the time 
when in fact he was not single, he had been married for 
eight months, so he was married in 2012. 
MR PAMENSKY:   The 8 August 2012.  Yes, sorry, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You will never forget now. 
MR PAMENSKY:    I am not going to forget that again. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Pamensky, in case you forgot 
you got married you would not be the first witness to have 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 245 of 328 
 
forgotten when you got married who appeared before this 
Commission. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair, I am going to use that when I get 
home later. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, okay, that is the one thing, Mr 
Pamensky …[intervenes] 
MR PAMENSKY:   Sorry, advocate, sorry, Chair, it is in my 
affidavit that got filed I have mentioned those facts to you.  
I do not know if you have had a chance to read my latest 
affidavit where …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, I have seen your affidavit for the 
first time, I think Mr Seleka said he has not also seen it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But in due course we will look at it. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, so this – the marriage is 
addressed there? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The correction is made there.  
20 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, the correction is clearly made 
there, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is fine. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Sorry, just to jump in, that other 
affidavit, Chair, you asked certain questions that no one 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 246 of 328 
 
could answer to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   And could I please deal with those to the 
extent they are not dealt with?  And, I did, we made it very 
short for you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   And I hope that …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  No, I remember, I remember I 
asked you to do that.  I think the reason was just so that 
when you come back – when you come back we could see 
10 
at what extent it would be necessary for Mr Seleka to 
canvass those issues depending on a number of things 
including to what extent what you were saying depart from 
what other board members may have said so but the idea 
was that let us have something in writing that puts your 
version on those matters. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Mr Pamensky, how many 
aspects in that affidavit are you dealing with?  Is it four, 
20 
five 
or 
less, 
mean 
now 
questions 
arising 
from 
the 
Chairperson. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Five. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
MR PAMENSKY:   It is five.  I can quickly give you a 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 247 of 328 
 
summary.  One of the questions the Chair asked clearly 
was did we find outside interference within Eskom. That’s 
the one question I answered.   
The second question I answered was the question 
that you put forward to when we did we know when the 
suspensions and that were all coming forward. 
The third one was tell you in my reasoning in more 
detail why I felt Mr Tsotsi would be suspended and you had 
a problem with the charges and I have given you the 
evidence that shows that all the charges were adequately 
10 
catered for by the lawyers and then I summarised even 
more the suspensions just to show the space I have got 
and then I think they asked some question which I 
answered from a small pack, I think of Johan Bester. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, your investigator asked me just to 
answer something on that, did it occur or did it not occur. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh yes I remember that he had been 
asked that he prepares some document for you in – ja, I 
will have to look at his affidavit.  You can remind me, okay, 
20 
please do. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, Chair, Mr Bester wrote in his 
affidavit shortly after my appointment he came to meet with 
me and then thereafter – shortly thereafter he sent a – coal 
on 
a 
one 
document 
via 
Suzanne 
Daniels. 
 
So 
my 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 248 of 328 
 
recollection is I do recall meeting him shortly before – 
shortly 
after 
my 
appointment, 
I 
had 
no 
background 
knowledge into coal at all and I wanted to get an 
understanding and he gave me a high level understanding 
one on one, there was nothing sinister or anything.  I 
would do that in any environment to learn key aspects and 
I put another point in there, at that point in time, if it was 
mentioned, was that [indistinct] was not even coal or 
anything it happened ages later that you have got in my 
affidavit, so there is nothing sinister there.  So I answered 
10 
that for you, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, that is – I see.  That is alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How many – is it one affidavit that you 
have filed recently that deals with the issues that I raised 
in one affidavit? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, Chair, it is just that one.  It is not a 
long one, Chair, it is about – well, maybe not long for you, 
16 pages, Chair, or really 15. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, is that the one you have not 
had a chance to look at? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that is the one, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because I also have not looked at it.  
Was it deposed to yesterday? 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
I 
am 
not 
sure 
when 
it 
was 
…[intervenes] 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 249 of 328 
 
MR PAMENSKY:   No, Chair, it was disposed (sic).  So, 
Chair, what happened after you was we were hoping to 
have a conversation with Advocate Seleka, we arranged it  
– Mr Seleka was extremely busy and he said please just 
answer the questions that you did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MR PAMENSKY:   That was on last Friday and we managed 
to get this out at about seven, eight at night on Tuesday to 
your guys. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  It is dated 16 which would have 
10 
been, is it …[intervenes] 
MR PAMENSKY:   Tuesday. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Tuesday. 
MR PAMENSKY:   It was Tuesday evening, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe we should take a ten minutes 
break for you and me to quickly have a look at this affidavit 
because otherwise if you have not had a chance to read it, 
it is not going to help much. 
ADV BLOU SC:    Chair, just if I might?  So it deals with 
topics which are – there are headings, sub-headings that 
20 
tell you which topic is addressed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV BLOU SC:   It addressed discretely, briefly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV BLOU SC:     I am sure by reading with it if Mr Seleka 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 250 of 328 
 
had questions some might have been answered and 
hopefully, ja, we can narrow the questioning and it will 
facilitate it.  I think that is a better idea. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine, ja.  Okay, let us take a 
ten minutes, maximum fifteen minutes break and then we 
will have a look and then when we come back we then – 
and then we continue. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
10 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Okay, 
let 
us 
continue. 
 
On 
the 
suspensions, Mr Seleka I wonder whether there are any, 
are there any issues that you still need to question Mr 
Pamensky on?   
ADV SELEKA SC:  We have not touched the suspensions 
with him, but I understand the Chairperson’s question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I thought we had, but I have read 
his affidavit, the latest one where he summarises as I 
understand it what he says he said in the previous 
20 
affidavit.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  It seems to me that one, he says he was 
against the suspension of the financial director.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 251 of 328 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is one of the things he says.  Two, 
he says the decision at the end of the board meeting on 
the 11 t h of March 2015, which is the meeting that happened 
I think after the minister had left, he says only three 
executives were going to be suspended in terms of the 
decision that was taken, and they did not include the 
financial directive.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  That ties in with the evidence of one or 
more of other witnesses, but there may be other witnesses 
10 
who says something different.  That is what he says.  G3, 
there is no suggestion on his affidavit that he does not say 
anything that suggests that he knew prior to the 11 t h, that 
there were going to be suspensions.  
 
I am saying he does not say anything that suggests 
that.  Four, he says and this might be something that may 
be looked at.  He says Mr Tsotsi was quite vocal with, I 
understand what he is saying, directive in calling for the 
suspension of the executives, and that he relied on 
allegations 
of 
misconduct 
to 
say 
they 
should 
be 
20 
suspended.  
 
I do not know whether you have picked up anything 
else as far as the suspensions are concerned, that is 
important to canvass with him, other than maybe some of 
those.  
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 252 of 328 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Not on the suspension, I think what the 
Chairperson has just set out is exactly what I have picked 
up on the suspensions.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  I saw something interesting on the 
secondment of Mr Singh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Which was new to me.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, so maybe if there is something on 
the suspensions.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe if we deal with that.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And then after that we can see what 
other topics ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But as I understand it there are not too 
many topics, or am I mistaken there?  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, you are not mistaken. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you need to gather with him. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, you are not mistaken Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Then you can go ahead 
and let us see how it goes.  
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 253 of 328 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, yes.   
MR PAMENSKY:  Sorry Chair, I hope it helped.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no it helped, it did, ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  So we will free flow Mr Pamensky.  If 
you need to refer to your document or you want me to refer 
to it, only at that stage I will do so.  I think you have 
listened to the evidence of others.  You have read the 
affidavits.  
 
Let us start with the first one which you deal with.  
On the 9 t h of March 2015 you saw the question I asked one 
10 
of the witnesses and I said how come on the 9 t h of March 
when the suspensions were not talked about, which you 
confirmed, that you were able to make a statement that you 
do not want to lose the top officials or top executives.  
 
You deal with it in your affidavit.  It was strange 
that you would say so if the suspensions were not 
mentioned on the 9 t h of March.  Are you able to explain 
yourself there?   
MR PAMENSKY:  Yes Chair, I would like to refer you to my 
affidavit to actually see the transcript to actually put it in 
20 
context.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR PAMENSKY:  But fundamentally I was saying that we 
are going to, management time is going to be lost because 
they are going to be tied up doing this inquiry, this report, 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 254 of 328 
 
and I questioned the timing of this inquiry.  After that, Mr 
Tsotsi then said no, the management time will not be taken 
up because they will not be doing the inquiry.  
 
But I just want to read one thing here Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, you may do so. 
MR PAMENSKY:  It would be page 8 at the top Chair, just 
to put it into perspective.  I said:  
 
“Disturbs me ...” ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  What page number? 
MR PAMENSKY:  Oh, sorry Chair.  Page number 734. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR PAMENSKY:  At the top.  Chair, I say: 
 
“It disturbs me specifically during this time in a 
crisis.  We need all hands on board and we 
need everyone focussed.  We have managed 
doing this report.” 
 
That would the inquiry: 
 
“They are doing the wall room, they are doing 
this and that.  When are they going to get time 
to do the actual work.” 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, just [indistinct] part, a little bit away 
from you right, but this is my question is on this aspect 
where you are saying: 
 
“My biggest concern is that we are going on, 
we are going down on this report and it is 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 255 of 328 
 
going to take up a lot of management time, 
and as what we know is the skills set at the 
highest extra level there is a massive problem.  
If we lose top staff members during this critical 
time, it really puts the business at huge risk, 
and that is my biggest concern.  You know, 
skills are very hard to find within this level and 
I think we really need to understand that like 
in a normal process, I understand that an 
invitation, an investigation I beg your pardon, 
10 
wants 
to 
happen 
and 
I 
am 
very 
for 
an 
investigation should it happen, but it is all 
about the timing of the investigations.” 
 
It is that loosing of skill and how to replace it that I 
think we want to understand why that statement was made.  
MR PAMENSKY:  Chair, the statement weighs in the sense 
that we are going to lose the management time, because 
they are going to be involved in doing all these elements, 
and it is very limited skill which we have got there and it is 
going to take up a lot of management’s time, because 
20 
management time will be lost because they will be tied up 
during all the entire investigation, when are they going to 
do the actual work? 
 
So that is what I meant Chair.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, that statement it is well, the 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 256 of 328 
 
explanation itself is also surprising, because what was 
envisaged ultimately with the inquiry is that management 
was going to be asked to step aside.  As opposed to be 
coming ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, maybe before you go there.  Mr 
Seleka, I am sorry ... Mr Pamensky, in that quotation at 
page 733, that last sentence of the first quoted paragraph, 
you say if we lose top staff members during this [indistinct] 
we had to push the business and that is my concern.  
 
That does not seem to me to be talking about a 
10 
situation where temporarily the skills of management are 
focussed on the inquiry and you could be looking at people 
to assist.  It looks like you are talking about losing top 
staff members.  
MR PAMENSKY:  Chair, not at all.  Losing top staff 
members to work, if you look before that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR PAMENSKY:  My biggest concern going down this is 
going to take a lot of management’s time.  So I am implying 
the time Chair.  If we go through the transcript of those 
20 
meetings, the first person was Mr Baloyi and he mentioned 
they will take up management’s time.  
 
Thereafter it was followed by Mr Khumalo who also 
said it will take up management’s time.  There were two 
other members who never mentioned it.  I then came on 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 257 of 328 
 
and mentioned it again about the time.  Mr Tsotsi then gave 
me comfort on the time.  
 
Then I went back to Mr Khumalo and said Mr Tsotsi 
yes, but they are still going to be tied up doing the report 
in the sense that the investigators are going to be talking 
to them.  So Chair, I knew nothing about their suspensions 
before, it is all in relation to management’s time being tied 
up in doing the investigation and the report.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, Mr Seleka.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So I was saying also that the 
10 
inquiry, even if that is your explanation that the inquiry will 
take management’s time, the inquiry was never intended to 
take management’s time.  In fact, it was intended to take 
management out, to remove them and not even have their 
time.  
 
So why would you say this on the 9 t h of March? 
MR PAMENSKY:  Chair, there are two different, sorry.  
They are two different timelines.  On the 9 t h of March there 
is no discussion about suspensions or anything, any 
misdemeanours or anything to that extent, you know.  I am 
20 
told there that the Presidents instruct us to do an inquiry 
and I am concerned it is going to take up a lot of 
management’s time.  
 
That is where it is.  Then on the 11 t h is a completely 
different situation and that is when the decision is made to 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 258 of 328 
 
ask the people to step aside.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
MR PAMENSKY:  So there is no link between the two 
Chair.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  
MR PAMENSKY:  Because there was no discussion. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But here is the link, because your 
question of management’s time being taken away becomes 
even more relevant if management is taken out of the 
picture.   
10 
MR PAMENSKY:  Yes, you are correct and that is why I 
fought for the CFO not to go.  I felt it was unnecessary and 
I needed her at that point in time.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  But what about the others?   
MR PAMENSKY:  My perspective with the others was the 
minister was explaining a lot of things that were untoward, 
you know.  Such as diesel.  If you look at the transcripts, 
sorry.  If you look at the transcript when it comes to me 
defending the CFO, I say there that the minister never said 
there was anything untoward with the finance.  
20 
 
All the minister said was the flow of information was 
correct.  So if my memory tries to serve me correctly that 
those were areas where I believe that pressure could be 
put onto people.  I did not believe it was the CFO.  Chair, 
the start of the meeting was where Mr Tsotsi explained this 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 259 of 328 
 
all to us and when he explained the four departments, it 
was me who was the first person to say well, please can 
you tell me who these people are.  
 
Then he mentions the four people and I go back and 
I say I understand that they can put pressure on those 
people, but explain to me.  Tell me how is the CFO going to 
be put under pressure.  I do not see it and that is where Mr 
Tsotsi said yes.  
 
You know, that is when the CFO was excluded.  
Later on in the discussion another member mentioned the 
10 
CFO and I came back again protecting the CFO saying that 
I do not think it is necessary for her to leave now.  So that 
is the events, on the other side from them leaving, was we 
believed that this was a short three month inquiry and that 
could potentially impede or slow down this inquiry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That what? 
MR PAMENSKY:  That could impede or slow down this 
inquiry as I told you in my affidavit.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
MR PAMENSKY:  Therefore, that was the three that could 
20 
potentially interfere from my onset, because I could not 
see how the FD could put pressure on anyone.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, you see I am struggling with your 
reasoning.  The inquiry is introduced on the 9 t h.  You say 
but on your explanation you say losing skills did not mean 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 260 of 328 
 
we are giving, we are losing them literally.  It meant you 
are going to take their time and channel it to the inquiry.  
 
You are concerned about that.  
MR PAMENSKY:  That is correct.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  But when it comes to it being made 
plain, on the 11 t h of March, that these executives are going 
to be removed, you support that?   
MR PAMENSKY:  I support it because Mr Tsotsi was 
pushing 
for 
misconduct 
and 
me 
explaining 
the 
misdemeanours and he did indicate to us that these people 
10 
could potentially interfere and impede the investigation and 
also my mind set was in terms of this investigation, the 
mere presence of them could create that impression. 
 
So it was a completely different environment to 
what the meeting was on the 9 t h.  There was no discussion 
or thought of suspension.  The meeting on the 11 t h was 
where Mr Tsotsi was pushing for the suspension.  It was 
the first time.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Well, there is a couple of things, but let 
me deal with this one because the board members who 
20 
have come here, particularly Ms Klein and even Mr Tsotsi 
himself, I think Dr Ngubane, have said that there was no 
evidence of these executives in the past having impeded 
an investigation or that they would impede even that 
investigation. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 261 of 328 
 
MR PAMENSKY:  Yes, there was no evidence but he was 
explaining misdemeanours which indicated that they could 
potentially interfere.  That was the impression that I got.  
He was giving us an indication that these people could 
potentially interfere in the business and that was the 
motivation for asking them to step aside for the three 
month period.  
 
I think I am missing you here.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Say again? 
MR PAMENSKY:  I think I may be missing you here.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no you are not missing him and he is 
not missing you.  I think, ja.  
MR PAMENSKY:  So Chair, Mr Seleka, on the 9th there 
was no even thought of the suspension.  The seed was 
planted by the minister on the 11 t h and then Mr Tsotsi was 
motivating for them to be suspended, because he believed 
and he explained that they would potentially interfere in 
the investigation.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Mister, the board members have 
said when the minister came on the 11 t h, not only did the 
20 
minister confirm what Mr Tsotsi said.  So what the minister 
said was in accordance with what Mr Tsotsi said.  Accorded 
with Mr Tsotsi.  
 
I think you also say the same.  
MR PAMENSKY:  That is correct.  
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 262 of 328 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Not only that, but she went further to 
plant the seed of suspensions.  Do you also agree with 
that? 
MR PAMENSKY:  I agree with that.  The principle was 
brought up by the minister.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Did you express your views to the 
minister because she, the board members have said she 
mentioned four areas, which included finances which meant 
the FD should also be asked to step aside.  Did you raise 
your concerns with the minister? 
10 
MR PAMENSKY:  No, I did not.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you ask the minister whether there 
is a report that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, let me ask the question maybe Mr 
Seleka.  At the time the minister mentioned the four 
portfolios and said the heads of those portfolios would be 
suspended, did you understand that that meant the head of 
the finance department, namely the financial director was 
also to be suspended? 
MR 
PAMENSKY:  Yes 
Chair, I 
understood the four 
20 
departments were the four people, but as I said to you 
before. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR PAMENSKY:  What I recall of that what she said we 
are not going to protect them anymore.  
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 263 of 328 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR PAMENSKY:  And she did not mention any names, but 
it was a moot point for me, because that decision had to be 
determined by us.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR PAMENSKY:  As the board.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR PAMENSKY:  And what I found behind that was I knew 
the minister would support us after she mentioned those 
comments.  So you knew you had the minister ’s support, if 
10 
you 
are 
determined 
to 
suspend 
any 
of 
those 
four 
executives.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but I think the point that arose is, or 
that Mr Seleka is putting forward or was putting forward 
earlier, was you appear to have failed strongly after the 
minister had left, that the financial director should not be 
suspended.   
 
If you understood when the minister was speaking 
to the board that she was suggesting that the heads of the 
four portfolios, including the financial director, should be 
20 
suspended why did you not raise your concerns with the 
minister.  
 
I think that is part of what he was putting to you. 
MR PAMENSKY:  Oh, sorry Chair.  First of all, you know I 
think it is quite hard when you are talking to the minister.  I 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 264 of 328 
 
mean it is like coming to talk to you.  So you do not really 
you know go and ask those questions.  You sit and you 
take in everything that she says and then you have the 
discussion at the board meeting.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR PAMENSKY:  So it was not like, I cannot be like I am 
out, like this.  It is the minister you know.  So you sit and 
you listen, and if I recall but I cannot hundred percent 
recall, but normally you ask a few questions.  Chair, that is 
something new to me.  
10 
 
You ask a few questions and then the minister 
responds.  I remember the one question was why was the 
board meeting cancelled, because we wanted to know.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, but Mr Seleka that is, you say after 
the minister had left and the board was deliberating on the 
issues of suspensions, you were quite vocal in saying the 
financial director should not be suspended? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is correct Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So the minister has said the inquiry and 
20 
the suspensions or the stepping aside.  Was she asked 
about whether there has been any investigation into the 
conduct of the executives that would justify them to be 
asked to step aside, go on forced leave or be suspended? 
MR 
PAMENSKY: 
 To 
my 
best 
recollection 
I 
cannot 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 265 of 328 
 
remember anyone or I do not recall, I do not remember 
anyone asking that to the minister.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  I have also said to members who 
have come here about or witnesses who have come here, 
and you would recall about the report that Mr Baloyi kept 
on asking for Mr Tsotsi, and Dr Ngubane’s response was 
that well, there might be a report out there but that is not 
Eskom’s report, we must take this decision. 
 
You were in that meeting.  Did you object to that?  
To his view? 
10 
MR PAMENSKY:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You heard him say that? 
MR PAMENSKY:  I heard him say that.  It is factually 
incorrect that his comment disposed of that report.  If you 
look at the end of the transcripts, the company secretary 
specifically says to Mr Tsotsi: 
 
“Please can you hand the report to ARC and to 
PMG?” 
 
And he says: 
 
“Yes.” 
20 
 
I thereafter asked specifically also: 
 
“Please can you give us the report because we 
need it to finalise the corporate plan.” 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So if you say his statement should not 
be interpreted or construed as the disposing of the need 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 266 of 328 
 
for that report, why ... what do you think he was saying 
about that statement? 
MR PAMENSKY:  Sorry Chair, I would assume he was 
saying that we do not need that report, but we need to do 
our 
own 
report 
you 
know, 
we 
must 
do 
our 
own 
investigation, it is true.  You know, you have to do your 
own report, so maybe you were saying we did not need that 
report.  Maybe that was his opinion.  
 
But in my mind we needed that report and I 
specifically asked for that report.  It was one of my 
10 
deciding factors where I supported the inquiry and the 
suspension.  So it was based on that report and I 
specifically asked for it, and if I recall Mr Baloyi later on, 
roughly about the 13 t h also re-asked again for the Chair, 
Mr Tsotsi to please give us that report.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, no Mr Baloyi wanted that report 
throughout and he got that response from Dr Ngubane, that 
it is not Eskom’s report.  We must make our own decision.  
But in addition to that Mr Pamensky, you know that Mr 
Tsotsi was not charged with failing to provide the report.  
20 
 
It was not one of the charges.  
MR PAMENSKY:  Chair, that is not my understanding.  Mr 
Baloyi was very vocal.  He wanted to ensure that all the 
charges 
were 
included. 
 
Mr 
Baloyi 
then 
started 
communicating with their attorneys and the attorneys came 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 267 of 328 
 
back and said all his concerns were adequately addressed.  
 
Such as the report which was for me in my key 
element, was included.  It was an all encompassing Clause 
1.4 if I am correct and 1.5.  That is what the attorneys said 
on a high level.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, that suggests you may be moving to 
the charges, Mr Seleka?  If you are moving to dealing with 
the charges because they are a separate item.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I wanted to ask some questions in 
10 
relation to the suspensions.  Maybe let me do that whether 
or not you are moving to a separate item.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, no it is just ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  It is still in the same ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Because the issue of charges comes up. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And you will need to ask questions to the 
extent that you might not have done so previously. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the charges.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But I want to go back to the issue of the 
suspensions.  Your decision to support the suspensions, 
were you saying that as far as you were concerned, you 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 268 of 328 
 
were 
supporting 
the 
suspensions 
of 
the 
executives, 
because you said you did not support the suspension of 
the 
financial 
director, 
because 
of 
the 
allegations 
of 
misconduct or not, because the evidence from the other 
members was that the allegations of misconduct did not 
form the basis of the decision to suspend the executives.   
 
Are you with them on that part? 
MR PAMENSKY:  I am with them on that part, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  So the issue of allegations 
of misconduct did they play any role at all in the 
10 
suspension of the executives at that stage? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair, the truth is I do not remember him 
explaining 
the 
three 
misdemeanours. 
 
You 
know, 
I 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that Mr Tsotsi? 
MR PAMENSKY:  Mr Tsotsi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR PAMENSKY:  He did explain them but maybe they did 
not sink in to me, so I do not recall ... I do not recall what 
he said number one, number two, in the meeting you can 
20 
hear 
Dr 
Ben 
mentioning 
something 
to 
do 
with 
did 
something with someone will come out later, which implied 
that Mr Tsotsi did so, but if you ask me now I just do not 
remember Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 269 of 328 
 
MR PAMENSKY:  But it would have played potentially, if I 
was probably in that position at that time, a secondary 
matter.  My primary matter was they could potentially 
interfere or impede this investigation as I said.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  Now I am not sure that every 
board member has said that the final decision of the board 
after the minister had left the meeting that happened 
immediately after the minister had left, I am not sure that 
every board member who has testified has said that the 
decision of the board to suspend the executives, was 
10 
limited to three executives and did not include the financial 
director.  
 
I seem to think there may be one or more who may 
have said even though during the discussions there may 
have been some members of the board who questioned why 
the financial director should be suspended, but in the end 
she was included among the executives suspended.  
 
So I just want to raise this to check whether your 
recollection is clear, that the decision of the board to 
suspend the executives, did not include the financial 
20 
director or whether you are not sure about that. 
MR PAMENSKY:  Chair, I am one million percent sure.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR PAMENSKY:  And it is also in the minutes.  I left after 
that twelve o’clock meeting that ended at one thirty. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 270 of 328 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR PAMENSKY:  When I left, the CFO was not included.  It 
is as clear as day light even in the minutes.  We left there 
was three.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR PAMENSKY:  I left for the day Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR PAMENSKY:  I was not there.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR PAMENSKY:  There were two other meetings that 
10 
occurred that I got to learn from here.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR PAMENSKY:  There was an ARC meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR PAMENSKY:  And there was the people in governance 
meeting, and as I understand in that people in governance 
meeting, the CFO was included again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR PAMENSKY:  And then there was the three o’clock 
meeting which was the people in governance which I did 
20 
not attend and that is where Nick Linnell was introduced.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  
MR PAMENSKY:  And if I recall some evidence which you 
guys were saying, is even the company secretary said was 
are you sure it was not three, but not four.  So Chair, I am 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 271 of 328 
 
a million percent sure.  When I left that board meeting and 
if you look at the transcript, I ask again please let us make 
sure it is not these people.  
 
I double check at the end.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR PAMENSKY:  So it was three people when I left.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So on your evidence, although the 
minister suggested to say the least, that the financial 
director be included among those executives who should 
be suspended, and I know that she was at pains to say I 
10 
cannot instruct the board what to do, but you would say in 
the meeting that took place after the minister had left, the 
board did not follow her suggestion as far as suspending 
the financial director is concerned.  
MR PAMENSKY:  That is correct Chair, and the other board 
members supported me on that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, so ultimately we know that the 
board suspended four, but this is what is interesting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe put it this way.  Maybe the way to 
20 
put it is we know that ultimately the financial director was 
suspended.  Is that correct?   
MR PAMENSKY:  That is correct Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and her suspension on your version 
would have occurred as a result of something that 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 272 of 328 
 
happened after the Board had made the decision to 
exclude her. 
MR PAMENSKY:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it may have been the PMG 
Committee that included that? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair those are the facts that has come 
out here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   At one thirty I left, PMG met and I 
understand that PMG, that the CFO was then included 
10 
again. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   I was unaware of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but of course the full Board 
subsequently got to know that the financial director was 
included in the suspensions, it would have got to know 
subsequently. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, subsequently Chair, I do not know 
when but subsequently. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, did you say – hang on how come the 
20 
financial director was included because we the Board, the 
highest authority at Eskom had excluded that? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair, I found out on the 12 t h but it was 
from the press and obviously, I assumed that the people 
met thereafter, and they must have had their reasons.  So I 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 273 of 328 
 
did not query that is the truth to Chair.  Like I said they 
must have had their reasons I did not query. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, would they have been authorised to 
include her in circumstances where the full Board had 
excluded her? 
MR PAMENSKY:   That is a good question, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
I 
mean; 
you 
cannot 
tell 
the 
Board…[intervene] 
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair, I cannot really answer that 
because I am not sure if the Board delegated it to PMG 
10 
where they could make their decision but…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, but the Board could not exclude her 
and delegate the…[intervene] 
MR PAMENSKY:   That is correct, if you actually think 
about that it sounds correct, but I am not sure maybe we 
did delegate it to PMG but my understanding was, it was 
three people when we left. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because my understanding or my 
recollection of the evidence that has been given is that the 
PMG Committee or whatever committee was asked to look 
20 
at this matter further what it was asked to do was simply to 
take the necessary steps to implement the decision of the 
Board that had been taken.  
MR PAMENSKY:   That is correct, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Which would not therefore include, 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 274 of 328 
 
suspending somebody that the Board had decided should 
not be suspended. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, Chair that sounds correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
MR PAMENSKY:   It is a good question did the Board 
thereafter authorise after when I left there was confirmed 
three people. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you see, part of the importance of 
that question is that if the Board, if you are correct in 
saying the Board had decided to exclude the financial 
10 
director from the executives to be suspended, it should 
have surprised members of the Board to learn that a sub-
committee of the Board the PMG had gone against the 
Board's decision.   
And one would have expected that the Board would 
or various members of the Board would say, hang on, how 
can this committee do this, and that they would have been 
an issue.  But if the Board had included her, when it said, 
these executives must be suspended, then they would not 
have raised any issue because her inclusion would have 
20 
been in accordance with its own decision.  
Do you understand?  
MR PAMENSKY:   I understand, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the financial director is quite 
important in an organisation and that is part of the reason 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 275 of 328 
 
why at least I think some of the members of the Board were 
saying, hang on you know if we suspend the financial 
director, the markets might react in a certain way.  So I 
understand what you are saying but I was raising these 
things, because it may well be that yours is a version 
different from the version of some of the Board members 
about the financial director and the decision of the Board 
at the meeting at the end of the meeting, after the Minister 
left.  Okay, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair, because you see the 
10 
suspension of - well the intention to suspend three is 
consistent with what Mr Tsotsi was told in Durban, the 
Durban meeting with the President and Ms Dudu Myeni on 
his version.  But if the Board suspended the four, which is 
consistent with what the Minister said that the Board 
members have said she identified four areas.   
It is in turn consistent with what Ms Suzanne 
Daniels said she was told the day before the 11 t h by Mr 
Salim Essa at Melrose Arch that is four executives would 
be suspended, and one would return, and Mr Salim Essa 
20 
introduced 
himself 
to 
her 
as 
the 
Minister ’s 
advisor, 
meaning the advisor of Minister Lynn Brown.  
So is it a coincidence that the Minister comes there 
and says four areas when Mr Tsotsi was only told about 
three? 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 276 of 328 
 
MR PAMENSKY:   It is a strange coincidence, if you asking 
me, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you see where the outside 
influence concept comes in that it seems somebody else 
from outside was in fact influencing what was happening 
within Eskom, do you see that?  Is that a yes? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Oh, as I said to you, from what I have 
seen at the Commission and other things, it does indicate 
that there was outside influence but again I cannot 
personally, independently approve…[intervene] 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Of course not. 
MR PAMENSKY:   …tell you because I was never asked to 
do anything and no one spoke to me.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, let me go back to the issue of 
misdemeanours, because the Chairperson I think was 
asking about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do pace yourself because I think we 
should finish about half past eight. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair.  Okay let me just put it to 
you because we know ultimately, that the Board members 
20 
were not suspended for misdemeanours, you know that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, he has confirmed that the allegations 
of misdemeanours were not the basis for the suspension, 
he has confirmed that. 
MR PAMENSKY:   That is correct, yes. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 277 of 328 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But the reason I am asking you that Mr 
Pamensky is because in your affidavit, you say your 
impression was that misdemeanours would be investigated 
in the inquiry. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, at that point in time Chair.  When 
we finished the meeting of the 11 t h my understanding was 
that they would still look at those misdemeanours, it is our 
duty if someone mentioned something to us as a Board, we 
need to go an investigate it if it is reasonable, but my 
understanding was that would fall part of the investigation 
10 
on the terms of reference.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   And you know, that Dentons was 
appointed not to investigate misdemeanours? 
MR PAMENSKY:   That is correct, as I understand after the 
Board meeting of the 9 t h the investigation was not to look 
for any wrongdoing of the executives and it was never the 
intention to look for any wrongdoings of the executives.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so and the one executive was 
returned on the basis that there was no findings of 
wrongdoing on his part.  
20 
MR PAMENSKY:   I cannot confirm that Chair, I understand 
he came back because he wanted to come back, I 
understood at a Board meeting of the second of July, that 
the PMG wanted to lift his suspension and we were 
consistent and what we said was we need to wait for that 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 278 of 328 
 
report.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, in order to see whether or not it 
makes findings of wrongdoing against him. 
MR PAMENSKY:   It is hard for me to comment on that 
element, Chair you know, all my side was as I understood 
was we wanted to wait for the report to see if there was 
anything that came out of the report, you know, there was 
not looking for wrongdoings, but reports do evolve into 
these type of elements.  
So if you do an investigation, you know, it is not 
10 
looking for wrongdoing, but you work in that area and you 
find something that leads into that path.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, but I think you will recall the 
minutes show quite clearly that the decision was that okay 
Ms Mariam and Ms Venete Klein, they said they have 
contacted Dentons and Denton said that but we were not 
making investigation into any misconduct against the 
executives, so we did not make any findings.  
And on the basis of that they reported back to the 
Board saying no findings of wrongdoing are made against 
20 
this executive.  You can recall that? 
MR PAMENSKY:   No I need to see that minutes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You cannot recall that? 
MR PAMENSKY:   I cannot recall that I need to check that 
minutes, sorry.  
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 279 of 328 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, it is in the minutes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Did I attend that meeting? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, you were present in that meeting.  
MR PAMENSKY:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but the point of the matter is, if 
the Board was told no, no findings of wrongdoing against 
Mr Koko and he should return, that is a position that 
applied similarly to all the three executives. 
MR PAMENSKY:   I would agree with that.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, so they could equally have been 
10 
asked to return. 
MR PAMENSKY:   But I do not know what you mean being 
asked to return? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To come back from the suspensions. 
MR PAMENSKY:   At which point in time Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I think what he means is his 
contrasting what happened to Mr Koko and what happened 
to the other three executives.  They were effectively paid 
out or they were paid money to allow to leave Eskom, he 
was not paid money to leave, maybe he was offered and 
20 
maybe rejected that, but he was allowed back to come back 
to work.  
 
And there was a suggestion, I think that - I think by 
Ms Dey that because Dentons said they had found no 
wrongdoing on his part then the Board could take him 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 280 of 328 
 
back. And I think you have said that, if that was the basis 
for allowing him back that basis should have applied to the 
other executives as well. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair, my understanding was very 
clearly that they were going to come back after this.  It was 
not that; I was not involved in the PMG in the great detail.  
What learnt was they sent us a round robin resolution and 
said that these executives have approached the company 
and wanted to exit.  
So the intention was always to bring them back in 
10 
my mind but just at that point in time, the only person who 
was there was obviously Mr Koko.  If you look at my 
evidence to do with the suspensions, if you want to go, you 
know, there is only four situations where the suspensions 
came into being, I mean, it is n my affidavit, I am happy to 
elaborate if you want. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I have read your affidavit, but just 
make it - you can say what you wish to say. 
MR PAMENSKY:   So after my direct involvement with 
suspended the three, not the financial director was given 
20 
to the PMG, and we just got the report of that, so the first 
meeting we had was on the 23 r d of April and that was the 
first time that I heard that Mr. Montana wanted to leave 
and it was clear in that meeting that we only delegated 
three people part of PMG to go and have an off the record 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 281 of 328 
 
settlement.  
And we said in those minutes, that if the other 
executives approach the company we will deal with it at 
that point in time.  That is all I thought, the next element 
that came to me was the round robin resolution was clearly 
stated that they had approached the company where they 
wanted to leave.  The next situation that came in was the 
report back on the Board on the 28 t h of May.  
And then the next was the third when I went to see 
when Mr Koko came back.  So you know I was really 
10 
unaware of these elements from that perspective.  So the 
first time I ever heard someone wanted to leave was on the 
23 r d and then when the round robin came on the 5 t h or 6 t h 
of November was the first time I was aware that all four 
wanted to leave. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you heard that one of them or 
more wanted to leave why pay them to leave, everyone in 
any employment situation they want to leave they can 
leave, so why pay the money to leave? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair, my understanding was that Mr 
20 
Tsotsi had misled us and there was a potential risk 
because the process was not followed so that could be 
potential litigation.  So my understanding of that resolution 
that came was drafted on the back of taking legal advice 
and everything it was to avoid the potential of litigation, 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 282 of 328 
 
and that is why they were offered settlement packages up 
to 12 months, and that is how I left them, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it is – I have said so when other 
Board members were here, it is very strange to me, I mean 
because these executives have not been dismissed.  
MR PAMENSKY:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They were on suspension.  They were 
paid their full salary and if they did go to court one, you 
would want to see the basis on which they were going to 
court and get your lawyers to advise you to see what 
10 
prospects there were.   
You were not far from the time when they were 
supposed 
to 
come 
back, 
around 
23 April 
you 
were 
something like six and a half weeks away from the end of 
the three months, I think because I am thinking if three 
months started soon after the 11 t h of March when they were 
suspended, then the three months would be April, May or 
no, no I may be wrong with my numbers.  
But it was not going to be more than two months, 
when they would have to come back in terms of the original 
20 
agreement and you pay them 12 months in the case of two 
of them, I think 18 months in the case of one of them, the 
financial director, to leave.  
I 
just 
have 
difficulty 
understanding 
the 
logic, 
especially when you want them back, because I think that 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 283 of 328 
 
is what you are saying, as far as you are concerned, as a 
Board member, you wanted them back. There are other 
Board members who said, as far as we were concerned, we 
had no issues with them coming back.  So my question is 
why pay people so much to leave when you want them back 
and where there is no litigation, they have not gone to 
court, they are being paid their full salary in the meantime.  
And maybe there - I do not know if there was anybody who 
had threatened litigation other than Mr Matona who had 
gone to court and I think his litigation may have been 
10 
finalised by 2013. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair, just to tell you, just to break it 
down to myself.  So first of all, yes, it was three months.  
However, what transpired was, it was much later the three 
months, we got from after they had appointed Dentons, and 
Dentons was officially appointed on the 20 t h of April.  So it 
would be May, June, July, so that was the one element.  
The second element was on the meeting of the 19 t h 
Mr Dan Marokane did write a letter from his lawyer to 
explain that, I think the process was flawed.  So when I 
20 
received this resolution Chair, because I was not involved 
from my perspective was I had the fear that there could be 
potential litigation.  I did not want anything to affect the 
independence of this inquiry.  
And 
my 
understanding 
was 
that 
they 
had 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 284 of 328 
 
approached the company and they wanted to leave, so they 
had enough. So that was my understanding, Chair you 
know it was left to people in governance and they liaised 
this, so that was my simple reason to avoid a potential risk 
of litigation based on what I said, so that is why I 
supported that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  So the – I am 
distracted by the time because we need to finish by 8 
o’clock.  Sorry, I will be quick, what is the time sorry, Chair 
10 
I do not have a watch. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is half past eight. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There is a statement you making in 
your affidavit Mr Pamensky that page 393: 
“As far as I was aware, you say the remaining 
executives had agreed to their suspensions.” 
Paragraph 58.1.  
MR PAMENSKY:   What page sir? 
CHAIRPERSON:   What suspensions? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 393. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   To what suspensions, had agreed to? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The remaining three executives had 
agreed to their suspensions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They had agreed to their suspension? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So that they agreed to them 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 285 of 328 
 
being suspended.  
MR PAMENSKY:   Sorry Mr Seleka I cannot find the page 
number one. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 393.  
MR PAMENSKY:   On the left, 393?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, oh you got to go to your very first 
affidavit paragraph 58.  If you follow the paragraph 
number, you will find it quickly. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, I…[intervene] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   58.1. 
10 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, 58 point? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   One. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Go through to the last line, the 
sentence that starts as far as I was aware.  No, you are on 
the wrong page.  Paragraph 58. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Sorry, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The last line and the sentence starts, 
as far as I was ware.  
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, sir I see sorry can you repeat your 
20 
question to me, I see where it is I am just trying to get 
some clarity.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, the remaining executive had 
agreed to their suspensions, you understood that.  
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, they were suspended I would have 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 286 of 328 
 
assumed that they agreed to their suspensions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You would have assumed? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Well they got suspended and they 
agreed to being suspended, they were on suspension.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, so you assume that they agreed 
to be suspended?  
MR PAMENSKY:   No, no sorry, they were suspended 
whether they agreed or not they were suspended. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but you see the point I am making 
with you that you understood that they had agreed to their 
10 
suspensions. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, because they got suspended sorry. 
I see your point.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  
MR PAMENSKY:   Sorry I - your point am I right the 
meaning is that because they got suspended, they agreed 
to be suspended and go on the Board. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, which is not correct they did not 
agree to be suspended. 
MR PAMENSKY:   I am unaware of that, Chair. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Matona will not go to court if he 
agreed to be suspended.  
MR PAMENSKY:   The remaining executives I say, not Mr 
Matona. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The are three executives.  
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 287 of 328 
 
MR PAMENSKY:   There is four, Mr Matona is one we know 
him now that he has gone to court and then there is three.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Marokane will not write a letter 
saying I want to come back if he agreed to be suspended. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Oh, that if you want to come back to 
Chair, of course they want to come back to work, no one 
wants 
to 
be 
suspended, 
but 
they 
managed 
to 
stay 
suspended because that was what the law was.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, but you are not addressing the 
point.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me just try, the one way, the one 
version or the one meaning you might be intending when 
you say they agreed is that they were in support that they 
be suspended.  
But maybe what you intend saying is they might 
have been opposed to it but they accepted that the Board 
had decided to suspend them and acted on the basis that 
there was such a decision by the Board but not necessarily 
that they agreed that it was the right thing for the Board to 
suspend them. 
20 
MR PAMENSKY:   Your letter is correct, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   So what I was probably meaning of the 
remaining executives were obviously on suspension they 
having left, I did not know, I mean I was not liaising with 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 288 of 328 
 
them I did not know.  So the remaining executives were 
going to stay on suspension and they were going to come 
back thereafter when Dentons report was finished. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but just to understand in terms of 
what I was putting to you, are you saying the correct one is 
that they accepted that the Board had made a decision to 
suspend them and they had gone on suspension on the 
basis 
that 
the 
Board 
had 
made 
the 
decision, 
not 
necessarily that they were in support of a decision?  
MR PAMENSKY:   That is correct, Chair.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, well, it may or may not be what 
you are thinking it means, Mr Seleka but I wanted to clarify 
in my own mind. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because I – it is difficult to think that 
they would have been in support of their own suspension. 
MR PAMENSKY:   I am going with your same. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR PAMENSKY:   They may have not supported it but at 
this point in time, they were on suspension and remaining 
20 
on suspension. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They acted on the basis that they were 
on suspension. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, well Mr Seleka I do not know if you 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 289 of 328 
 
are following up but I want to ask something relating to the 
exits. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well let me follow up before that, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, follow up, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, Mr Pamensky that explanation is 
difficult to follow but here is another one in that same 
sentence they agree to the suspensions and the position 
remained that they would return and you are writing about 
this, the position as at the 23 r d of April 2015.  
10 
MR PAMENSKY:   That is correct.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, and you say: 
“The position remained that they would return to 
work, once the investigation was completed.” 
And then you put in brackets: 
“(Provided, 
no 
misconduct 
on 
their 
part 
was 
uncovered.)”  
You close the brackets, but that too was not correct.  
MR PAMENSKY:   Why sorry Mr Seleka I am not 
understanding your question, as I said to you before, is 
20 
provide those numbers conduct uncovered because as I 
said to you investigations do involve into these areas, the 
terms of reference was not looking for any wrongdoing, 
correct but investigations do lead into areas of misconduct 
which could land up – so I was saying provided nothing 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 290 of 328 
 
was uncovered.  
 
Who knows what comes out in these reports, you do 
not know. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But that that was not the Board's 
position.  
MR PAMENSKY:   No the Board's position was very clearly 
to do the investigation, and that they would come back to 
the company, provided there is obviously nothing wrong in 
my mind. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, but that proviso was not there. 
10 
MR PAMENSKY:   But Chair, if they have done something 
wrong, and you do the investigation, and it picks up 
something like a misdemeanour or a misconduct, well, then 
we have a problem but it was not there to look for those. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is number one, number two Ms 
Mariam writes a letter to Dentons and they write back, 
saying but we were not asked to investigate misconduct.  
MR PAMENSKY:   That is correct.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   But it could lead there that is what I am 
20 
saying, sorry, Mr Chair, I am saying that the terms of 
reference 
had 
nothing 
– 
they 
were 
not 
looking 
for 
wrongdoing but in an investigations wrongdoing could come 
out.  So for argument's sake, you say to me, go investigate 
that chair, and then just go look if that chair is put right 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 291 of 328 
 
and when I go to that chair I find out oh, the arms taken 
away, so that is misconduct for the arm.  So they do evolve 
into that it just happens.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But if Dentons was not investigating 
allegations 
of 
misconduct 
involving 
them, 
or 
any 
allegations of misconduct, why would you expect that they 
would investigate allegations of misconduct?  In other 
words, 
if 
their 
terms 
of 
reference 
did 
not 
include 
investigating allegations of misconduct, why would you 
expect them to act outside of their terms of reference? 
10 
MR PAMENSKY:   Sorry Chair, I would not expect them to 
go outside the terms of reference, so you stay within the 
terms of reference.  And when you in those terms of 
reference, something could come up while they doing it.  
for argument sake they looking at loopholes and one 
person comes forward and says, well, this person did A, B, 
C, D and this is the reason and all of that.  
Well, that is when something comes up, you know, 
they were not looking for it, but that could come up Chair. 
So that is what I was meaning, they are not going to do it. 
20 
If this report came out with something that was wrong with 
them well then could not return.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But what you do not deny, I assume is 
that to the extent that you had in mind that their return to 
work was subject to such a proviso what you cannot deny 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 292 of 328 
 
is that in its decision the Board had never included such a 
proviso. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, that is correct Chair.   There was 
no that provision, this was in my mind, no there was 
nothing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, that is what I wanted Chair, and 
then 
I 
do 
not 
need 
to 
go 
any 
further 
because 
Dentons…[intervene] 
MR PAMENSKY:   Well you just had to ask my mind, sorry. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well let me deal with this before I forget 
and it relates to the exit of the three executives at page 
394, of bundle 17, Eskom bundle 17 your affidavit, Mr 
Pamensky paragraph 58.2.  You say: 
“On 5 may 2015 a round robin resolution, attached 
as RFF115 was circulated to the Board stating that.” 
And you quote: 
“The 
four 
executives 
have, 
in 
various 
ways, 
approached the company and have indicated that 
they are amenable to a settlement in May, in terms 
20 
of which they would resign from their positions and 
accept an exit.” 
When I read that resolution it suggests to me, that Eskom 
or the Board may have been the ones who said to the 
executives, would you be amenable to resigning or to a 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 293 of 328 
 
settlement in terms of which you would resign if we give 
you an acceptable exit package.  That is the impression 
that I get from the formulation of that resolution.  What 
would you say about that interpretation of it on my part? 
MR PAMENSKY:  I did not see it that way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:  And if I read the whole element was that 
they wanted to leave and I wanted to alleviate the risk of 
potential litigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR PAMENSKY:  So it was that they will come in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:  And they would settle because they wanted 
to leave. No I did not see how you just read it now sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  So you looked at it as they 
approached. 
MR PAMENSKY:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And said would you give us a package if 
we are prepared to resign?  Is that how you – you saw it – 
you understood it? 
20 
MR PAMENSKY:  Yes that they had approached and they 
would leave if they could get an exit packaging. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:  And to avoid in my mind the potential 
litigation. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 294 of 328 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but then if – if it came from them in 
that way then it means – it would mean would it not that the 
idea of them being given a package came from them on the 
basis that they were offering to resign.  Is … 
MR PAMENSKY:  That is how I interpret it, it is coming from 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:  And that they want to resign. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But do you say about this other 
interpretation that I am putting – that I am putting what do 
10 
you say about it?  You feel that it is not – it is at odds with 
your – with your understanding or you see it as potentially 
also a reasonable interpretation? 
MR PAMENSKY:  Chair I think we each read it differently 
Chair. 
ADV BLOU:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV BLOU:   Sorry Chair I did not get – I did not get your 
alternative interpretation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  My interpretation. 
20 
ADV BLOU:   I might be able to assist you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV BLOU:   If you could just tell me what it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no the interpretation was that it 
seems to me as if it was Eskom or the board which made an 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 295 of 328 
 
approach to the executives to say would you resign if we 
give you an acceptable exit package.  That is what I – that is 
the impression that I said I got. 
 
ADV BLOU:   Sorry I can just say Chair that what has been 
quoted here at 58.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV BLOU:  Is an extract from the actual Round Robin 
minute. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV BLOU:  Which appears at your 482. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV BLOU:  So it is verbatim but it does say that the four 
executives had in various ways approached the company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV BLOU:  I was not sure what the (speaking over one 
another). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that part yes. 
ADV BLOU:  As the other way around.  It is actually just to 
tell you it is verbatim quote from… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV BLOU:  From 482 and then having recorded what the 
four executives had approached them for it then says the 
board has considered the issue and delegates with acting 
Chairman to enter into negotiations with the four suspended 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 296 of 328 
 
executives.  So it seems that initiative – where that goes 
Chair I do not know but it – initially it came from them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV BLOU:  And then they delegated it to the four people. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV BLOU:  To go and resolve it by negotiation I just 
thought I would tell you that –  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no. 
ADV BLOU:  That is what the minute itself says. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine. 
10 
MR PAMENSKY:  Sorry Chair so… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:  Chair I understood they approached the 
company not that we are going to approach them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:  They approached us and it accords with 
my understanding on the 23 rd which we said is only if the 
executives approach the company will we engage.  It is in 
the minutes of the 23 rd. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see I think where my impression 
20 
comes is the word amenable to a certain settlement my 
understanding is that if I say to you I amenable to a certain 
settlement normally it would be because you have indicated 
– you have made an approach to me to say would you 
consider this kind of settlement?  Maybe I say let me go 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 297 of 328 
 
away and reflect.  I come back and say I am amenable to it.  
You know what I am talking about because you are the one 
who came to me with this offer.  That is where I am coming 
from? 
MR PAMENSKY:  Chair I see your point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PAMENSKY:  And I do concur for it but if I go back 
before which the gates that hopefully my mind is they are – 
they have in various approached the company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
10 
MR PAMENSKY:  Not that we go onto them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. But it could be that you have a 
situation where you raise – you make the offer to me I go 
away and then later on I come back to you and say 
remember that offer that you made I am amenable to it. 
MR PAMENSKY:  Chair I hear your point but at all nothing 
Chair remember my sequence of events. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no. 
MR PAMENSKY:  But I see your point or you are amenable 
because you would approach that person further. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:  But my understanding is they approached 
us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it is possible maybe that it could be 
looked at different ways but I just wanted to say that is the 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 298 of 328 
 
impression I got when I looked at (speaking over one 
another.). 
MR PAMENSKY:  Chair why I also did not read it like that 
way because no one was engaging them as I understand. 
You know no one was engaging them.  We said only if they 
come and engage will we engage at that time.  So not my 
understanding that no one was engaging them I am unaware 
of all the events that had transpired here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course Mr Matona testified that the – as 
suggestion of negotiations to settle his matter came from the 
10 
board side because he went to the labour court to have the 
suspension set aside so he could be allowed to come back 
but he said I think Dr Ngubane I think he said – I do not 
know I think he was with two others. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  He had not… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Board members said or one of them it 
might not have been Dr Ngubane but one of them said there 
is no way you are going to get a reinstatement.   We have 
spoken to the shareholders Minister so we can talk about 
money.  And in that event to if his evidence is true then 
20 
certainly the idea of him resigning and getting money came 
from the Eskom side if his evidence is true.  I just cannot 
remember what the relevant members of the board said in 
terms of their version. 
MR PAMENSKY:  Chair I know none of these things. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 299 of 328 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PAMENSKY:  The first time I hear is on the 23 rd again I 
see this and a settlement fact. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then of course you have the question 
– you have the financial director Ms Molefe.  You may have 
seen or heard that her settlement was higher than the other 
two. I think she was paid the equivalent of eighteen months 
remuneration and she said how Eskom ended up agreeing to 
give that much from – in circumstances where as I recall the 
board had put the limit of twelve months. 
10 
MR PAMENSKY:  Up to twelve months. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Up to yes – up to twelve months.  She said 
it is because I did not want to go away.  I did not want to 
leave Eskom.  So they were – they increased their offer so 
that it reached a point where I would agree to leave.  You 
see.  So when you think about that and you think about Mr 
Matona’s version and you see this resolution against my 
impression of what it means you begin to see that... 
MR PAMENSKY:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The idea of leaving Eskom in regard to at 
20 
least those two does not come from them.  If Mr Matona’s 
version is correct and if Ms Molefe’s version is correct.  But 
Ms Matona’s – Ms Molefe’s version does appear to be – to 
have some credence because otherwise why was she given 
eighteen months remuneration when others were given 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 300 of 328 
 
twelve months?  That explanation we have not been given or 
if anything has been said it is nothing that provides a 
satisfactory explanation. 
MR PAMENSKY:  Chair may I answer that for a second 
what? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PAMENSKY:  I heard that question from you.  Ms Venete 
Klein was the head of PMG she did not know about that extra 
six months.  I then asked Advocate Seleka to give me the 
transcripts of that extra six months because I do not recall 
10 
that at all given the extra money.  And in the evidence that 
has been here I think one of the witnesses said that he went 
and met with Ms – the CFO Ms Molefe’s attorneys or – and 
they agreed at that meeting.  So you know I did not know 
about it – I am unaware of it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
MR PAMENSKY:  But again Chair just to reiterate I see your 
point come in there but the facts of the matter is they us 
clearly that they approached the company in my mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR PAMENSKY:  Not that we have spoken to them.  They 
were not allowed to speak to them because not they were 
allowed but you said if they engage then we will deal with it 
at that point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But we already have two of the three 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 301 of 328 
 
executives who were not allowed to 00:10:34 whose version 
is clear I did not want to leave.  In the case of Mr Matona I 
had – I even went to court to try and get back but I was told 
that the Minister had been approached and there was no way 
I would get reinstated.  If we could talk about anything it 
would have to be money and I went away to think about this 
whole thing and after a few days or something I realised that 
I could not force Eskom to take me back and we talked about 
money. 
 
In the case Ms Molefe they had to give me much 
10 
more than the others in order to get rid of me.  I wanted to 
go back.  I am putting it in my own words. 
MR PAMENSKY:  Chair.  Yes Chair I am completely unaware 
of those (speaking over one another). 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
I 
think 
your 
counsel 
wants 
to 
say 
something. 
ADV BLOU:  Yes Chair what I am saying is that I those and 
it is not for me to dictate how the commission should run its 
business but clearly those questions or that line of questions 
should be put to the person who wrote this Round Robin 
20 
Resolution and represent it to the board that the approach 
had come from the four executives.  Mr Pamensky was 
neither at the cold front of those – of the PMG committee 
and he did not draw this Round Robin.  He acted on the 
strength of the representation so I am just mindful of time 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 302 of 328 
 
that – and whatever findings you make.  I just wanted to say 
that obviously what you have just said is inconclusive – 
counter distinction to the manner in which this has been 
portrayed in the Round Robin.  But he has also got the 
author of the Round Robin I just wanted to point that out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I understand what you are saying 
but the reason why we raise it with him is because he had 
said that the board wanted them back and he was one of the 
board members who wanted them back.  So what is being 
pointed out is but the way the board seems to have acted or 
10 
those who acted on its behalf in negotiating with them does 
not appear like they wanted them back.  So – so it is only at 
that level. 
ADV BLOU:  I do understand but Mr Pamensky was not one 
of those board members. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes ja. 
ADV BLOU:  Thank you.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Pamensky what you have given there 
is the Reference Bundle, Eskom Bundle 12.  This is the 
20 
board noting and ratifying the remuneration of eighteen 
months for Ms Tsholofelo Molefe.  On the 2n d of July 2015 
look who was present as the last member on the list. 
MR PAMENSKY:  Thank you that.  I think I was present but I 
asked you for the transcript because I really do not recall.  
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 303 of 328 
 
You know I would remember in my mind if someone is 
explaining to us why you paying someone this extra, extra 
money.  So I do not recall. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The reason… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well… 
MR PAMENSKY:  We gave up to twelve months and this says 
you gave eighteen months. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
MR PAMENSKY:  So I would want to understand the extra 
six months and I really do not recall anyone telling me that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well – well part of the problem is that 
there seems to have been nobody who said but why are we 
paying an extra six months on the evidence that I have heard 
and I would have expected that somebody would ask that 
question to say but we want these people back.  If they want 
to go why do we go as far as paying so much. 
MR PAMENSKY:  Chair I am in agreement with you that is 
why I do not recall this at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PAMENSKY:  I just sitting here I saw the head of PMG. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   I saw Ms Naidoo’s affidavit and I just do 
not recall anyone explaining to me and I think I would have 
remembered 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 304 of 328 
 
MR PAMENSKY:  If – why you giving someone extra than 
what you were authorised for her.  It would have to be a 
justification so I just do not recall. 
ADV BLOU:  Sorry Mr Seleka can you give me the page 
number to that? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is Eskom Bundle 12 
ADV BLOU:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Page 251.6 the minutes of 2 July 2015. 
ADV BLOU:  I will see if I can find any way to carry on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  Okay let us move on. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  And by this time 2 July 2015 Mr 
Pamensky Dentons has already received a request from 
Eskom I think on the 11 June 2015 to provide an interim 
report.  And they made a presentation on 20 – is it 23, 24 or 
24 45. 
MR PAMENSKY:  25, 26. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  25, 26 of June 2016.  And thereafter they 
were told we are accepting this report.  Dr Ngubane writes to 
Minister Lynne Brown and says and this is where I am 
coming about cutting short the process.  He writes a letter to 
20 
Minister Lynne Brown and say we have stopped the process 
because the investigation of Dentons does not produce 
anything unfamiliar to us so we do not see a reason why it 
should continue.   
CHAIRPERSON:  What – what date is that letter? 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 305 of 328 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Of the letter Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you able to… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Let me –  
MR PAMENSKY:  I would like to say I am completely 
unaware. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   I will get you the reference to the letter.  
It is 25 August 2015.  It is on Eskom Bundle 13 page 553. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the – the settlement in regard to the 
financial director is early July 2015? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I will have to remember the date Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are referring to 2 July I think. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja that is the board meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Where there is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was ratifying. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Where they ratify and condone the 
payment of eighteen months. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So one has to look at the dates. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it would have been a little earlier. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe not a little earlier but it would 
have been earlier than that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes we will check the date now. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 306 of 328 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But my – was the position not that already 
sometime in June the board took a decision to say that 
Dentons 00:17:44 must end. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is the date of the is it 11 or 13 
June? 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the date for that Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is 11 June Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  11 June. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  The board… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what is the date for the settlement 
10 
agreement between the financial director and Eskom? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We trying to get the date but the board 
decision in the minutes is 2 July. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  2015 but we will get the date of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You see the question that arises for 
me and it may well be that Mr Seleka was going to that 
question is it would – it may well be that when these 
settlements were reached and maybe for argument sake let 
us focus on the last one involving the financial director.  At 
20 
that stage the board knew that it was not going to be long 
before the investigation ended.  
MR PAMENSKY:  Chair to give you my recollection. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PAMENSKY:  Because again I was not involved in the… 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 307 of 328 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Negotiations. 
MR PAMENSKY:  Dentons element.  It is in my affidavit the 
first time we hear Dentons is on the 11th and they are going 
to start on the 20th.  The next interaction with us is their 
presentation to the board.  I do not recall the earlier – the 
presentation to the board on the 25 th and at that meeting 
both Dentons and Arc said there was sufficient information to 
prepare a report.  I was only at the meeting of the 25th I was 
not there on the meeting of the 26th.  So moving a bit 
forward on Chair my understanding was and it is in the 
10 
minutes of the Audit and Risk Committee meeting on the 14th 
of August as well as the debtors report that they both 
reported that there was sufficient information to issue this 
report and it had 00:19:57 objectives.  That was my 
understanding on this entire Dentons picture.  You know it is 
a real report and then in preparing – sorry for the 
commission after I had submitted my report there was a 
Dentons letter and to me it indicated that the task had 
reached its objectives and that is what the letter seemed to 
indicate to me and that was my entire understanding the 
20 
entire time Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well I see in your affidavit page 58.4 
no, no paragraph and the page is 395 of Eskom Bundle 17 
says: 
“Subsequently I have learnt that on 26 June 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 308 of 328 
 
2015 PMG had reported to the board that it 
was 
still 
dealing 
with 
the 
remaining 
suspended executives.” 
But from what you said earlier I think you – oh they would be 
two – it would have been Mr Koko and Mr… 
MR PAMENSKY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr – and the financial director. 
MR PAMENSKY:  So Chair I tried to also work it myself as I 
had to get back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR PAMENSKY:  What I understood was we had on the 5 t h 
or 6 th of May that four people wanted to leave the first time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:  The next report back was on the 28th of 
May where they said two have signed and one is about to 
sign. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:  Okay.  Now that is – that is me.  I am not 
here on the 26 th. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the… 
20 
MR PAMENSKY:  But if I look on the 26t h the minutes it says 
there is one still remaining executive left.  I did not attend 
that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Round Robin Resolution is on the 5t h 
May 2015. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 309 of 328 
 
MR PAMENSKY:  Yes Sir sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is when it is.  Okay alright Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  So the letter that Dr 
Ngubane wrote the date seems to be – sorry Chair the date 
for the settlement with the FD Mr Lofelo seems to be 30 June 
2015 but we want to get the agreement itself because she 
mentions that in her affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja 30 June.  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if – if the settlement between her and 
10 
Eskom is 30 June in circumstances where about two weeks 
earlier the board had decided that there should be no further 
investigations and Dentons should prepare its report.  Then 
the question would arise at that stage there would have been 
no threat of litigation.  Yes would you agree? 
MR PAMENSKY:  Fairly I agree with you. I do not know 
those dates you know.  Whether it is litigation or not but you 
know I do not know anyone cutting anything short or 
anything to that extent.  I told you my dates are unknown so 
I cannot really answer you on that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but basically what I am saying is 
because other board members have said what you have said 
namely they believed that there was a threat of litigation and 
they paid – agreed that these amounts should be paid 
because it was a way of settling or avoiding litigation.  So I 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 310 of 328 
 
am simply saying at least in regard to the financial director if 
the settlement with her was on the 30 June 2015 but two 
weeks earlier around the 18 th June the board had already 
decided. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  11 June. 
CHAIRPERSON:  11 June. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The board had already decided that there 
should be no further investigations Dentons should prepare 
its report then it could not say – the board could not say we 
10 
do not want to allow her back because she will interfere with 
the investigation because at this stage there was going to be 
no further investigation.  And – and there would be no 
litigation because they would say no come back. 
MR PAMENSKY:  Chair first of all who from the board on the 
11 th said that because I am totally unaware and what you do 
say does sound correct to me.  Yes it definitely sounds 
correct to me.  If you were stopping this report and there 
was no problem bring her back.  She was excellent Chair.  
So that – but I do not know those things Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:  And I do not know that the board cut – cut 
Dentons short this was in the purview  of Audit and Risk so 
they would handle it we had no involvement so I am unaware 
of that. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 311 of 328 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Have you not seen Dentons Report Mr 
Pamensky? 
MR PAMENSKY:  Sorry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Have you not seen Dentons Report? 
MR PAMENSKY:  No.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  You have not? 
MR PAMENSKY:  No I saw Dentons – what happened with 
Dentons Report just to let you know we got a copy and we 
had to return it we were not allowed to keep it so I cannot 
10 
really remember the contents. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because that statement of – with the date 
with the instruction to provide an interim report is in Dentons 
Report in the executive summary. 
MR PAMENSKY:  What date was that report Chair? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  11 … 
MR PAMENSKY:  No what date was the date that we 
received the report? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The date of the report is 2 July 2015. 
MR PAMENSKY:  I do not recall the board never cut that 
20 
down Chair so I do not recall them ever cutting that down.  It 
must have been Audit and Risk I do not recall Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
ADV BLOU:  You might look – is there – there is a date issue 
here can someone just tell me which date we are looking for 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 312 of 328 
 
because we have got some Dentons documents here and 
maybe we can get from here. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja the report – there is a report which is 
dated 2 July. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  2015. 
ADV BLOU:  Which only came before the board I think at the 
end of July. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja they – they meet and they presented a 
DPE to the Minister and they explain all that but this report 
10 
we have is dated 2 July 2015. 
MR PAMENSKY:  What date did us as a board get that 
report, do we know? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I am not sure Mr Seleka whether it 
makes any difference. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What date the report is – is given to the 
board if one is looking at the question of whether the board 
should have pursued a settlement agreement with the 
20 
financial director after it had made the decision that the 
investigation should end and Dentons should replace them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know because I think that is the 
important part. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 313 of 328 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:  I see what you are saying Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
MR PAMENSKY:  I tend to agree with you I am unaware of 
those dates but I tend to agree with you and I am not aware 
of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No that is fine.  Do you want to deal 
with the charges Mr Seleka? 
ADV BLOU:  Chair I am sorry but we just trying to get clarity 
here.  Mr Pamensky has dealt with in the affidavit we have 
10 
got a different date as – for the date on which the board 
decided that Dentons had gathered sufficient information and 
that they has find – whatever in the interim must be made 
final but they indeed got the interim draft report to the board 
of about 25 June 2016, 26 June 20 – sorry 2015, 26 June 
2015 and the interim report given to the board on 3 July 
2015 and Arc and Dentons reported that they would produce 
a final report by 21 July 2015.  So you put it to him I am just 
saying we have got no – we – the evidence that Dentons had 
been told to stop working by the board. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV BLOU:  We do not have evidence that Dentons had 
been told by the board to stop working any earlier than … 
MR PAMENSKY:  No 2 June would be 2 July would be the 
earliest time. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 314 of 328 
 
ADV BLOU:  It was 10th July. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or 10 th of July but it is well past that event 
date.   
ADV BLOU:  Then ja – okay.  So I just think the date is 
important but it is a matter of record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no the dates are important but for me 
in regard to this aspect. 
ADV BLOU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The important date is the date of the board 
saying Dentons must stop the investigations. 
10 
MR PAMENSKY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And provide their report. 
ADV BLOU:  That is the date that we finding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As well as the date of the conclusion of the 
settlement agreement with the financial director.  Now I 
understood Mr Seleka to be saying that the date when the 
board said to Dentons stop the investigation was around 18 
June or 11 June. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is 11 June Chair. 
ADV BLOU:  And I am asking you to please tell me which 
20 
document he is referring to there so we can confirm this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR PAMENSKY:  And – and was it the board or was it Audit 
and Risk Committee? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on Mr Pamensky. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 315 of 328 
 
ADV BLOU:  Wait Mr Pamensky. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on Mr Pamensky you want to tell. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pamensky’s counsel. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The document you looking at. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Sorry  Eskom Bundle 13 on page 13 
it is a page trolling within the affidavit of Dentons Mr Kapdi. 
ADV BLOU:  Yes, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Paragraph 8.3 says: 
10 
“On 11 June 2015 the firm was requested to prepare a 
detailed presentation to the board in addition to a draft 
report dealing with the state of the investigation to date.  
The firm undertook that this was due to the need to meet the 
deadlines of various other committees.  That ...[indistinct – 
word cut off] ... to the board was delivered on 25,  
26 June 2015 which was followed by our draft 
preliminary report.   
For these purposes, investigatory activities 
seized 
shortly 
after 
11 
June 
2015 
and 
20 
resources 
were 
directed 
from 
the 
normal 
course of the investigation to the development 
of a preliminary finding, declaration of the 
above-mentioned presentation and preparation 
of a draft preliminary report...” 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363

MR PAMENSKY:   But that is a document internal to 
Tegeta.  There is nothing here that says the board made 
the decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, from what you ...[intervenes]  
MR PAMENSKY:   [Indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...from what you read ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What you read, does not say the board 
made that decision on the 11 t h.  It simply says, Dentons 
were ...[intervenes]  
10 
MR PAMENSKY:   [Indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...told on the 11 t h. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But it does not say who told them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   They do not say here Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It might have been some functionary.  
But it seems from what you read that the board may have 
had the occasion to deal with the matter around 25, 26. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which may appear to be in line for what 
20 
counsel for Mr Pamensky was saying. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Pamensky is shaking his head. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Yes.  But let – before he says 
anything.  I understood you to be saying.  In terms of what 
you could find, it looked like the board may only have 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 317 of 328 
 
made that 
decision 
around 25, 
26 June. 
 Was 
my 
understanding correct? 
MR PAMENSKY:   [Silence]  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
MR PAMENSKY:   I am sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I ...[intervenes]  
MR PAMENSKY:   Are you looking at the same affidavit of 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I was just asking whether my 
understanding of what you said was correct. 
10 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And my understanding was that, you 
were saying from what you had been able to look at it, it 
appeared that the board might only have made that 
decision around 25, 26 June. 
MR PAMENSKY:   We say 21 July, is when the board 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   July? 
MR PAMENSKY:   ...got the final report.  If some else 
...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.  The decision to say to Dentons 
stop ...[intervenes]  
MR PAMENSKY:   Ja, I think someone who is in the board 
told Dentons to stop investigating in 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 318 of 328 
 
MR PAMENSKY:   That is one thing.  But the board got a 
final report on 21 July 2015 and that is when the board 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   ...as I understand it ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   ...that nothing further would be required. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no, no.  That is fine. 
MR PAMENSKY:   But it is an important question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, it is.  The board would not have 
10 
made that decision when they got the final report because 
at the end when they get the final report, I think it would 
have made such a decision earlier ...[intervenes]  
MR PAMENSKY:   And I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...it is just a question of when earlier.  
Mr Pamensky, I can see you are dying to tell us when. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, can I help you, Chair, from what I 
have seen? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR PAMENSKY:   The first presentation of Dentons to the 
20 
board was the 25 t h followed on the 26 t h of June.  And what 
I understand from some of the evidence was on the 
26 t h of June, Dentons got a phone call from someone.  I 
did not attend the meeting on the 26 t h, so I cannot 
comment on that Chair but that is when the board said, 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 319 of 328 
 
please, can you prepare a report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  But are you saying there was a 
board meeting around 25, 26 June? 
MR PAMENSKY:   There were two board meetings.  A 
presentation on the 25 t h by Dentons. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Dentons’ presentation. 
MR PAMENSKY:   And then again, they presented on the 
26 t h of June but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you say you were not present at the 
...[intervenes]  
10 
MR PAMENSKY:   At the 26 t h, I was not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   I were on the 25 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you were made to understand that at 
that meeting of the board on the 26 t h, the board may have 
issued the instruction? 
MR PAMENSKY:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are not saying that. 
MR PAMENSKY:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  But you are saying, it looks like 
20 
after that meeting, somebody issued an instruction to 
Dentons. 
MR PAMENSKY:   To prepare the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To prepare the report? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 320 of 328 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Whether or not they or whoever it was 
who gave that instruction, whether they took it from the 
board or not, you do not know? 
MR PAMENSKY:   I do not know that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.   
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do we have the minutes of those two 
meetings of the board?  Maybe that they will...  Well, we do 
not have to look at them now.  
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think that is where we should look. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, yes.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
COUNSEL:   Chair, just to finalise on this, on this topic.  I 
am sorry Mr Seleka.  If the proposition is that the 
settlement took place with the former Financial Director 
only on 30 June 2015, even assuming that someone in the 
board or not Mr Pamensky said stop investigating and just 
finalise the report four days before the 26 t h of June.   
20 
 
It does not follow automatically from that that 
there was not a thread of litigation.  Whether there was a 
thread of litigation when the settlement happened, it is a 
different question.  If Mr Pamensky, I do not think he will 
know. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 321 of 328 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.  The proposition was.  If on a 
certain date, that is prior to the said conclusion of the 
settlement agreement with – between Eskom and the 
Financial Director is prior to that date, there was a board 
meeting which said Dentons should stop the investigations 
and prepare their report...  
 
Who was negotiating with the Financial Director 
and he was a member of the board, would be expected to 
know that we were negotiating for a settlement because we 
did 
not 
want 
these 
directors 
to 
return 
while 
the 
10 
investigation was going on but now the investigation has 
been stopped.  Therefore, why should we continue to 
negotiate and pay them?  They best ...[intervenes]  
COUNSEL:   I do understand that but I think that may be in 
very close proximity.  Sorry, so that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The proximity might be something but I 
think and we can deal with this. 
COUNSEL:   Yes, with the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If somebody who was not there at the 
meeting, it might paint a different picture. 
20 
COUNSEL:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
But 
if 
the 
person 
was 
there 
...[intervenes]  
COUNSEL:   Understood. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 322 of 328 
 
COUNSEL:   Understood. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
COUNSEL:   But I am simply saying, you will probably find 
that it was somebody on the 26 t h of June. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
COUNSEL:   And then the settlement a few days later. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
COUNSEL:   So I think that is...  And then the report 
follows after that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
COUNSEL:   No, Johnny.  Sorry, Chair. 
COUNSEL:   Okay. 
MR PAMENSKY:   The settlement was signed, I have just 
heard, on the 25 t h of June.   
CHAIRPERSON:   It was signed on the 25 t h of June?  Is 
that correct? 
MR PAMENSKY:   30 t h of June?  No, 25.  25. 
CHAIRPERSON:   25.  Okay that could change the picture 
in regard to this point. 
COUNSEL:   Yes, that will. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
COUNSEL:   But I am pretty certain that the date that 
Mr Seleka read into the record was 30 June. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   30 June is from her affidavit.  That is 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 323 of 328 
 
why I said I want to check from the settlement. 
COUNSEL:   Indeed.  So there you are right.  But I do not 
want Mr Pamensky ...[intervenes]  
MR PAMENSKY:   No, I understood it was the 25 t h 
because... the 25 t h ...[intervenes]  
COUNSEL:   Sorry. 
MR PAMENSKY:   I understood it to be the 25 t h because I 
heard it was the 25 t h ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us wait for Mr Seleka. 
COUNSEL:   Mr Seleka will clarify what our position is. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
COUNSEL:   We know that there is a 26 June indication 
somewhere to Dentons – according to Dentons to stop the 
investigation and the report comes later ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  What is the settlement? 
COUNSEL:   What is the date of the settlement? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The dates of the settlement is 25 June. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, no.  Then there might be a 
20 
problem then if the board only made their made decision on 
the 26 t h. 
COUNSEL:   26 t h of June, indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
COUNSEL:   Indeed, Chair. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 324 of 328 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So but apply your mind.  We are all 
talking about it without the ...[intervenes]  
COUNSEL:   ...and everyone is actually trying to get to the 
true fact here because Mr Pamensky was not involved but I 
understand your thinking. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
COUNSEL:   But I think it may be the chronology that we 
just...  It certainly just was not weeks before.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Yes, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We are at twenty-two. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We are way out of time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Well, apart from the charges, 
what are the other topics you still need to deal with? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The other ones I wanted to put to 
Mr Pamensky.  The affidavit – particular emails attached to 
the affidavit of OUTA which is an annexure to the court 
application by Corruption Watch seeking to have them 
20 
declare delinquent directors. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is emails ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What topics does it deal with? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is again an apparent conflict on the 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 325 of 328 
 
part of Mr Pamensky when he is within the Board of Eskom 
and the emails he exchanges with Mr Atul Gupta.  Now 
these are emails that we did not have.  Ja.   
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Okay. 
 
So 
it 
is 
the 
charges 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...against Mr... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Tsotsi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Tsotsi. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then that part – that issue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what else? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, and that is – I think will cover all 
the points Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Maybe despite us trying to finish 
today, maybe we are not succeeding.  Maybe we should 
adjourn and we will arrange for another time and then it 
should not take long.  Maybe just an hour. 
COUNSEL:   It seems to be, if we try find an hour 
20 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
COUNSEL:   ...if everyone schedules. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
COUNSEL:   We will make a plan without to be there or 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 326 of 328 
 
Ms Goodman only. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
COUNSEL:   ...Mr Pamensky I am sure wanted to see but 
not personal.  Do not want to see the back of the 
Commission. 
[laughs]   
COUNSEL:   So I think we will find an hour somewhere 
sometime. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, yes. 
COUNSEL:   If you will slip us in. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
COUNSEL:   Give us just as much load as you can and one 
of us will try to be here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja-no, that is fine.  That is fine.  
Mr Pamensky, that is fine with you? 
MR PAMENSKY:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   [Indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
COUNSEL:   And just there is just also a small amount of 
re-examination ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
COUNSEL:   ...about Melrose Arch, but that will be five 
minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja-no, that is fine.  That is fine. 
COUNSEL:   Ja, Chair, I think everyone is getting tired. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Ja, that is true. 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 327 of 328 
 
COUNSEL:   I am sorry.  I am not going to the time... 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  No, that is alright. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Thank you for staying so late, both of 
you, because I know it is late. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, thank you very much to all of you 
and it is tough.   
COUNSEL:   It is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, Mr Seleka and your team.  
Mr Pamensky’s legal team.  And Mr Pamensky, thank you 
very much for all the cooperation. 
10 
MR PAMENSKY:   Thanks so much. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We will adjourn.  And then for the public 
tomorrow. 
 
I 
am 
hearing 
the 
evidence 
of 
former 
Minister Brown.  Mr Seleka, is that right? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As well as ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mister ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...Mr Mantashe and Deputy Minister 
Makwetla.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   From Eskom. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   From Eskom, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes, ja.  You only know about 
Ms Brown. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And...  unless if the Chair has changed 
18 MARCH 2021 – DAY 363 
 
Page 328 of 328 
 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And Ms Daniels. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no.  That is true.  No, it is 
Ms Brown, then Ms Daniels ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then your work stream leaves. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then for the evening session, I will have 
Mr Mantashe and Mr Makwetla.  You do not know about 
10 
that but of course it is a different work stream.  Okay 
alright.  Thank you very much.  We will adjourn for the day.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 19 MARCH 2021
