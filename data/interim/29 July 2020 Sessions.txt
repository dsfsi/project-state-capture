PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 29 JULY 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Hulley, good morning 
everybody. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I understand that it would be better 
that we deal with – I deal with an application for a 
postponement 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That is so Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In regard to a witness who was scheduled 
to testify today. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And to cross-examine somebody. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Mr McBride and General Booysen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so that when we then continue with Mr 
Nhleko there is no interruption until we – we finish within the 
two hours that I hope we will finish with him. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So okay I think let us deal with that 
application first.  So it – remembering what happened on 
Monday it does appear that this is a situation where both Mr 
20 
McBride who was to be cross-examined is applying for a 
postponement as well as Advocate… 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Pretorius. 
CHAIRPERSON:  J P Pretorius SC is also applying for a 
postponement. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 4 of 239 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us deal with that first.  Do you 
want to place your position as the commission’s legal team 
on record? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman I 
was given an indication by my learned friend Mr Matabede 
who appears on behalf of Advocate Pretorius that it was his 
instruction to bring an application for a postponement.  I – 
he indicated to me that there was certain – there were 
certain issues that he felt ought to be addressed in the 
10 
affidavit and had not been addressed in the affidavit of his 
client.  I had considered the affidavit prior to that and it was 
also my view that there much that had not been addressed in 
the – in the affidavit and if it had been addressed, I felt that 
it would have curtailed the proceedings to a significant 
extent.  In the context of his indication to me I did indicate to 
him that if I could – if certain demands of – on our side could 
be 
met 
I 
would 
not 
oppose 
the 
application 
for 
a 
postponement because I believe that it may well curtail the 
issues.  He exceeded to the demands and in that context, I 
20 
am now placing on record that he – that as the evidence 
leaders we do not oppose the application. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And obviously in the light of that you would 
adopt a similar approach to opposition to Mr McBride’s own 
application for a postponement and given what happened on 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 5 of 239 
 
Monday? 
ADV 
HULLEY 
SC:  Indeed, 
we 
have 
already placed 
ourselves on record as far as that is concerned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And he was granted a postponement in 
relation to Monday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And we hold the same view in relation to 
today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No that is fine. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:  As far as General Booysen is concerned 
he has indicated that he is on standby.  We had anticipated 
that if he is – if the evidence was led and he was going to be 
subjected to cross-examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  We would phone him once the time 
arrived or more or less once the time arrived. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine.  I think Counsel for Mr 
20 
McBride must also come and confirm that she applies for a 
postponement in regard to Mr McBride. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman. 
ADV HARDING:  Good morning Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 6 of 239 
 
ADV HARDING:  I, for the record again place myself on 
record.  My name is Katherine Harding and I appear on 
behalf of Mr McBride. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HARDING:  Mr Chair I am instructed to appear as I did 
on Monday in order to request an adjournment of the cross-
examination of Mr McBride by Advocate Pretorius’ team as 
was granted on Monday in respect of the cross-examination 
by Mr Nhleko’s legal team. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV HARDING:  I do so as I did on Monday on the basis of 
the affidavit that was filed with the commission on the 26 t h it 
appears at page 3650 of your bundle Mr Chair, Bundle Y8[H]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HARDING:  The affidavit I believe has been provided to 
Advocate Pretorius’ legal team. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HARDING:  And my instructing attorneys Adams and 
Adams 
addressed 
further 
correspondence 
to 
Advocate 
Pretorius’ attorney yesterday.  Again, attaching that affidavit 
20 
and confirming that I on behalf of Mr McBride would be 
requesting an adjournment today as was granted on Monday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HARDING:  The basis of the request as you will recall 
Mr Chair is to afford Mr McBride and his legal team sufficient 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 7 of 239 
 
opportunity to prepare for the cross-examination by Advocate 
Pretorius’ legal team. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HARDING:  And the detailed reasons for that request 
are set out in that affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HARDING:  Your – Mr Chair if you would like me to take 
you through those reasons again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No it is not necessary. 
ADV HARDING:  I am prepared to do so. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HARDING:  My basis Mr Chair I refer you to simply to 
paragraphs 20 and 21 of that affidavit in addition in which Mr 
McBride acknowledges the inevitable inconvenience and 
apologises to all parties involved and sets out how he tried 
to ameliorate that inconvenience as much as possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HARDING:  I wish to reemphasise Mr McBride’s 
commitment to the process and to appearing to be cross-
examination subject to having had sufficient opportunity to 
20 
prepare for that cross-examination.  Mr Chair I therefore 
request 
an 
adjournment 
of 
his 
cross-examination 
by 
Advocate Pretorius’ legal team. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no thank you. 
ADV HARDING:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 8 of 239 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  And then Counsel from Mr 
Pretorius. 
ADV MATABEDI F: [?]   Morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning. 
ADV MATABEDI F: [?]     Matabedi F together with Advocate 
Mahlanga and Dramamela we appear on behalf of Advocate 
Pretorius SC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MATABEDI F: [?]  Chairperson on the 27t h of this month 
a substantive application for the relief as more fully set out 
10 
in the notice of motion was launched and delivered and 
acknowledge thereof was given to us My Lord.  Chairperson 
the reason why we – we are seeking a postponement it is 
due to a number of reasons.   
We were – our client was served with a notice 
indicating that a cross-examination of Mr McBride and 
General Booysens will take place today.  However, during 
the discussions that we had it became apparent that the 
evidence of Mr Khuba and Sesoko will also you know play a 
role today.  The challenge with that is that my – Advocate 
20 
Pretorius was not given a notice – the required notice 
indicating that both Mr Sesoko and Khuba were going to 
implicate him.   
Now it is a – it is impossible in leading the evidence 
of Pretorius SC that we will not make reference to the 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 9 of 239 
 
evidence of both Mr Khuba and Sesoko.  And the quadrum 
that we find ourselves in is that once he refers to that 
evidence in his evidence in chief then the evidence leaders 
are entitled to cross-examine him on the evidence that he 
tendered.   
Now what is in best interest of Mr Pretorius SC is to 
bring a substantive application for the condonation and for 
the leave to cross-examine both Mr Khuba and Sesoko.  As 
the evidence of both Mr Khuba and Sesoko is inter-related 
with that of Mr McBride so it will serve or curtail the 
10 
proceedings if that is done in a – together.   
And the other aspect is the fact that Advocate 
Pretorius SC he was given permission to cross-examine both 
Mr McBride and General Booysens.  But on a perusal of the 
initial application it became apparent that he did not deal 
with a lot of issues that he was supposed to deal with.   
Now that being the case it is very important that we 
should supplement his affidavit and by so doing that will also 
curtail the proceedings otherwise you know on the evidence 
before the commission if one has to apply the principle 
20 
relating to how evidence has to be weighed we would 
respectfully submit that he will be save prejudice.   
And 
the 
other 
aspect 
is 
that 
there 
is 
an 
understanding between the evidence leaders and the legal 
team of Advocate Pretorius SC that we will address issues 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 10 of 239 
 
which the evidence leaders requires of Advocate Pretorius 
SC to deal with. And by so doing we submit and we are of 
the reasonable view that the proceedings with regard to the 
evidence of Advocate Pretorius, the cross-examination of Mr 
McBride, General Booysens and Mr Khuba and Sesoko will 
be you know curtailed which is in the best interest of the 
commission 
taking 
into 
account 
you 
know 
that 
the 
commission at the – this juncture you know operates under 
serious time constraints and restrictions.  Unless the 
Chairperson would like to hear me on a specific aspect that 
10 
is the case for Mr – for Advocate Pretorius SC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  No thank you.  No I do not need to 
hear you on anything else.  I understand I have been 
reluctant to grant postponements unless really it was 
necessary and there were strong reasons of late precisely 
because the commission has a very limited lifespan left and 
we need to finish the work.  But the reasons that have been 
advanced in regard to Mr Pretorius I understand and in the 
end the curtailment of proceedings is in the interest of the 
commission.   
20 
So it is quite important that when a witness comes 
and a cross-examiner comes to cross-examine the issues be 
quite clear so that the proceedings can run smoothly.  So I 
am prepared to grant the postponement and I am prepared to 
grant the postponement requested by Mr McBride as well.   
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 11 of 239 
 
I just want to say and everybody Counsel for Mr 
McBride will be hearing and you will be hearing that because 
of our determination to try and finish the work that we have 
to do in the commission within the time that we have we will 
– we may have a situation soon where we require people to 
appear in what I call our evening sessions.   
That means that you might not be required to present 
yourself at nine o’clock or ten o’clock but maybe at four 
o’clock and when the witness was giving evidence for the 
day is done, we start with somebody.  Maybe we need two 
10 
hours or three hours we do that, we are done.  So we go up 
to seven pm or something.  So as I grant postponements I 
just want people to understand that they might find that we 
are in that situation.   
Obviously, the ideal thing would be to deal with a 
witness who can finish his or her evidence that evening but if 
they cannot finish, we will have to find a way.  It is just an 
attempt for us to find more time.  Because – and starting 
early in the mornings from – we might quite often start at 
nine instead of ten now and instead of finishing at four finish 
20 
at five or even six.  Because just in five days if we add two 
hours by starting at nine and finishing at five suddenly, we 
have ten hours – extra hours a week and that can be very 
helpful.   
So I am just mentioning that so that people should 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 12 of 239 
 
not be surprised not only you but other people should not be 
surprised if we – if they soon get notices where they – which 
indicate that your evidence will start at four.  So – but 
otherwise I am happy to grant the – the applications for 
postponement.  One by Mr J P Pretorius SC and the other by 
Mr McBride to dates that are still to be determined.   
Obviously whatever needs to be done needs to be 
done urgently?  I do not know whether between yourselves 
and the evidence leaders any timeframes have been agreed 
but they need to be done urgently.   
10 
I do not think that the dates to which – that you will 
be advised of are going to within the next three weeks I think 
they will be beyond that.  But the sooner everything is 
finalised in preparation the better. 
But otherwise both applications are granted and the 
hearing of the evidence of Mr J P Pretorius SC and his 
cross-examination of Mr McBride and Major General Booysen 
is adjourned to a date to be given and Mr McBride’s 
evidence also the hearing of his evidence is also adjourned 
to a date to be fixed. 
20 
  Chairperson we are indebted to yourself and also the 
evidence leaders. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much. 
ADV MATABEDI F: [?]     Thanks Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  Are you ready Mr Hulley? 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 13 of 239 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Nhleko. 
MR NHLEKO:  Good morning Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning. 
MR NHLEKO:  Good morning Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The oath you took two days ago continues 
to apply.  Let us continue. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know whether I said this yesterday 
but if I did not say it then I am saying it now.  I am going to 
10 
be much more stricter today with regard to the proceedings 
so Mr Nhleko those long stories I will only allow them if I 
think strictly speaking, they are relevant. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you will be trying to answer questions 
as briefly as you can and then Mr Hulley, I know that from 
our discussion – from our discussion here at the hearing 
yesterday you will also be looking at going to dealing with 
the real meat. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the issues. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
ADV HULLEY SC:  Just to finish off on two topics that arose 
during the course of yesterday Mr Nhleko. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 14 of 239 
 
MR NHLEKO:  Hello Sir. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  The one related to the deletion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Hulley is that lamp working 
today Mr Nhleko? 
MR NHLEKO:  No it is actually not working Honourable Chair 
I must also declare that I brought along isiwashu to assist 
me.  So – but nevertheless no I am fine.  I think I am able to 
manage with the light. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are able to cope.  Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  Thanks. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I wonder what is wrong with that lamp 
because it is supposed to be working.  So maybe during the 
tea break they must look at it again.  But Mr Nhleko says he 
brought his – he is declaring that he brought isiwashu.  No I 
did say that he continues to throw in these Isi-Zulu words.  
Ja well I know what isiwashu is. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes let us continue. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Chair if I can 
refer to what has – what is LEA4. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I must just confess I suspect that it is just 
pure water and not isiwashu? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Pardon me I did not catch that Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I am sorry.  I am saying I suspect that 
what he is saying he is declaring as isiwashu I suspect it is 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 15 of 239 
 
just pure water. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe he is intimidating you Mr Hulley so 
that when you question him. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  He has been trying since the first day Mr 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know isiwashu is I think kind of 
blessed water that blessed by church people is it not?  Or do 
you get it from traditional healers as well? 
MR NHLEKO:  No you also do get it from the traditional 
10 
healers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Traditional healers. 
MR NHLEKO:  I think it should be understood as the 
traditional medicine concoction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes.  I think isiwashu that is probably what 
[indistinct 00:19:56]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Hulley continue. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  Mr Chair the 
document that I would like to refer to next is part of a – is 
20 
part of a bundle of documents which we have marked or 
agreed to be marked as Exhibit Y8[D] it is the affidavit of 
Matthews Sesoko.   
CHAIRPERSON:  May I confirm to Mr.. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  It would be LEA4 bundle. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 16 of 239 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Y? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So the exhibit is Exhibit Y8[D]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but the bundle? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And the bundle is LEA4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  LEA4.  Okay.  I just want to confirm Mr 
Hulley we know that Mr Nhleko did not apply for leave to 
cross-examine Mr Khuba but I take it that Mr Khuba’s 
statement and his evidence forms part of what you notified 
him. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I believe he had been notified. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  If there is any challenge to that 
understood from the address right at the beginning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  You might recall that there was an 
indication that there had not been proper notice that had 
been given. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay no I just want to make sure that 
we are on the same page as to the scope of the evidence. 
ADV MOKHARI:  Yes indeed Chair as I pointed out that he 
20 
was not given the notice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MOKHARI:  But the affidavit of Sesoko and Khuba. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MOKHARI:  Came to his attention later long after they 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 17 of 239 
 
have testified. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV MOKHARI:  But he is aware of those ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He is ready to deal with them. 
ADV MOKHARI:  And remember what I said in my opening 
statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MOKHARI:  That nothing really tells on the affidavit of 
Khuba and Sesoko. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MOKHARI:  And we said that we are not even going to 
waste our time to cross-examine them. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes.  No, no I remember. 
ADV MOKHARI:  Yes that is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  Now during the 
course of your testimony yesterday you were speaking about 
the laws that were applicable to – to the processes within 
IPID and how IPID reports have to be finalised.  Specifically  
you were making the point which is the point I wish to deal 
20 
with for present purposes that there was nothing in the – in 
any 
law 
to 
use 
your 
terminology 
which 
required 
the 
Executive Director to sign any – to sign off on any reports.  
Now we speaking specifically about IPID reports.  Do you 
recall that? 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 18 of 239 
 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes I do. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Just 
one 
second. 
 
The 
heater/air 
conditioner in the past few days when it was on do you feel 
that it warming up if I say it should be switched off.  Does 
that prejudice anybody?  I will have it kept on if it does warm 
up but if it does not I am not sure. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Speaking for myself Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It makes some difference? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  When it goes off – it does make a 
difference.  When it goes off it becomes incredibly cold.  I 
10 
know that Mr Nhleko has complained. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh is that so.  Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  But I would happy if it gets switched off.  
If it is interfering with the ability to hear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, I think if we – if both of you try to 
speak closer to the microphone. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Absolute Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That might be fine ja.  Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Just as far as the – as the different 
legislation that governs the reporting duty of IPID is 
concerned that of course is to be found in three different 
pieces or three different instruments.  The one is the IPID 
Act, the other one is the IPID Regulations and the third is 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 19 of 239 
 
the standard operating procedures.  Are you aware of that 
Sir? 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes I am aware Sir. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now I would like you to turn with me if 
you will to page – the bundle that I have referred you to a 
moment ago that is Y[D] – sorry Y8[D] – Exhibit Y8[D].  And 
you will find that in Bundle LEA4.  Then I would like you to 
turn specifically to page 1542 of that bundle.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Do you say that is in Bundle 
LEA4? 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:  4.  That is correct Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well this one that I have here is LEA1.  
That is the one that was handed up a few minutes ago. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  It should – what it did read in the past 
was Y8[D] on the spine but it ought to have been corrected 
to LEA4 in accordance with the directives that you gave us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  My one on the spine – this one is written 
Bundle LEA1. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  No that is not the correct one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is not the one? 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  It should be LEA4 Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay no I am sorry.  I think I am – no I 
think I have got it here.  The one written – well it is written 
Exhibit Y8[D]. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That is correct Mr Chair. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 20 of 239 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it should be written Bundle. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  LEA4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  LEA4. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja will your team please make sure that my 
bundles are written exactly what they should be written so 
that there is no … 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I will do that Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that there is no confusion.  Okay what 
page? 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  If we can look at 
two different pages – the first page is at page 1542.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  So if you turn with 
me Mr Nhleko to page 1547 but to place this in context Mr 
Chair page 1542 indicates this to be the Independent Police 
Investigative Directive Standard Operating Procedures and 
the effective date is the 1 April 2013.  Do you see that Mr 
Nhleko that is on page 1542? 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes I think you asked me to page to where – 
20 
1547 and I am at 1547. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  The particular document if you would turn 
with me to page 1575.  You will see there at the – close to 
the bottom of the page that it is signed by Ms K Mbeki who 
was the acting – identified as the acting Executive Director 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 21 of 239 
 
on the 1 April 2013. 
MR NHLEKO:  That is correct. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now we know that Ms Mbeki is of course 
who was the – the acting Executive Director that has been 
mentioned here previously before Mr McBride became the 
Executive Director on the 3 March of 2014, is that correct? 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now I would like you to turn with me to 
page 1547.  There is a definition there – the third definition 
that appears at – in – on that page a definition of case 
10 
worker.  Got it. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And a case worker is defined to mean 
any official who handles cases and includes a data capturer, 
a CMS clerk, an investigator, a senior investigator, principle 
investigator, an assistant director in investigation, a deputy 
director investigations and a – and director of investigations.  
Is that correct? 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes I see what it reads. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now if you would turn with me then to 
20 
page 1572.   
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  7.10 or paragraph 7.10 contains a table 
and that table identifies the procedures for the completion 
and the closing of files and dockets.  You see that? 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 22 of 239 
 
MR NHLEKO:  I see that. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now under that it sets out the procedure.  
Firstly if you look at – immediately under the heading 
“procedure” there is an indication of what is contemplated 
insofar as the completion of the files are concerned and if 
you go down in the left column you will see items 1 all the 
way up to 5 and then beneath that you will see that there is 
a separate section which deals with the closing of files and 
that is itemised as 6 to 10.  You see that? 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes I see that. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Could you read item 1 under “completion 
of files”. 
MR NHLEKO:   
“The case worker initiates completion of a file through the 
supervisor after completing a case, investigation report.” 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And could you read item 2 which deals 
with the obligations of a supervisor? 
MR NHLEKO:   
“A supervisor reviews and qualifies, assures directives and 
quality assures directives and reports and recommends 
20 
completion to DI/PH.” 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And then can we look at what the 
obligations of the DI/PH are and I will take you through the 
definitions of those in a moment.  Item 3 in other words.   
MR NHLEKO:  Ja, I see that. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 23 of 239 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:  What are the obligations of the DI/PH? 
MR NHLEKO:  It approves, disapproves completion and the 
completion register is utilised. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now to be... to take it back to page 1552, 
we will find... sorry.  Just go back slightly to 1548 for the 
definition of a DI.  If you look roughly four items from the 
bottom: 
“A director investigations means a person appointed 
as head of investigation at provincial level...” 
 
Do you see that? 
10 
MR NHLEKO:  Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And if you turn with me to page 1550, you 
will see that the definition of a PH is a program... sorry, 
provincial head which means an IPID official appointed to 
head of provincial office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Did you say that is at page 
1550? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That is correct Mr Chair.  So three items 
from the bottom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Now I see.  Okay.  Yes? 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And just to round off the definition 
section, if you would turn with me to page 1551.  It says that: 
“A supervisor means any person who supervisors a 
case worker of any level...” 
 
So a supervisor is not defined with reference to a job 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 24 of 239 
 
title but rather with reference to a person who supervises a 
case worker.  Do you see that? 
MR NHLEKO:  Ja-no, here.  I am following Chair. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So just to complete.  Getting back to 
paragraph 7.2.  It is the case worker who has to initiate the 
completion of the file and he or she would do so through the 
supervisor.  Item 1 that is.  After completed the case 
investigation report. 
MR NHLEKO:  H’m. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So, in other words, a case investigation 
10 
report has to be completed and that is the process of 
initiation for the completion of the file.  Correct? 
MR NHLEKO:  Right.   
ADV HULLEY SC:  Correct? 
MR NHLEKO:  H’m. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  In the next step after that is for the 
supervisor to review and quality assess.  Sorry, review and 
quality assure a direct ...[indistinct] and then to recommend 
completion to the DI/PH. 
MR NHLEKO:  Right. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now, you have worked in government for 
a long time and you be familiar of how one makes a 
recommendation, would you not so? 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes, I would then. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And when you wish to make a 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 25 of 239 
 
recommendation, you would complete either a report.  IN this 
case a report.  Or it might be a memorandum or it might be 
some other document in which you would have the words 
“recommended/not recommended”.   
 
And if you recommend, you will encircle the word 
“recommend” or you would delete the word “not recommend”. 
Correct? 
MR NHLEKO:  H’m.  That is correct. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And you would then append your 
signature, correct? 
10 
MR NHLEKO:  That is correct. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And then when you get ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Hulley.  I am not sure that 
that is the only way in which ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:  I am not sure that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
...to 
make 
recommendations 
in 
government. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I am not sure that it is.  I am not 
suggesting for a second that it is the only way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  But I certainly suggest ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  ...just let me... the question, I think, was 
as I understood you was that he has... he worked in 
government 
for 
a 
long 
time. 
 
He 
knows 
how 
recommendations are made in government.  That is how I 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 26 of 239 
 
understood you. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that mean... and then you went onto to 
say how they are made.  I know that he answered in a 
certain way but that suggested to me that you are saying... 
you are suggesting that if it is made differently that might not 
be how recommendations are made in government. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I was just saying that I am not sure 
that there is no other way of making recommendations within 
10 
government other than that one. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair.  Well, we know that 
the method that we have described now is a method that is 
used within government.  Are you aware of other methods 
that might be used to convey your indication as an official 
that you accept a recommendation?  Sorry, let me rephrase 
that.  That you are in fact making a recommendation? 
MR NHLEKO:  No, I am not necessarily aware of any other 
except the “submission route” as it is called. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And of course, you... the appending of 
20 
your signature in the case of... those instances that you 
were aware of ...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:  Right. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  ...the appending of your signature is a 
very important aspect to convey your acknowledgment that 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 27 of 239 
 
you have made the recommendation. 
MR NHLEKO:  Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And then it has got to go through a third 
leg ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Mr Nhleko, do raise your voice 
so that I can hear your answers. 
MR NHLEKO:  Oh, ja.  No, no, no.  I keep on agreeing with 
mister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR NHLEKO:  Ja and so. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, that is fine.  That is fine.  It is just that 
you are competing with the noise of the heat but it is okay.  
Just... 
MR NHLEKO:  Okay.  No, no, no.  I will try my best Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR NHLEKO:  Thanks very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair.  And then Item 3 
says that: 
“The DI/PH approves/disapproves completion and the 
20 
completion register is utilised and it has got some 
code...” 
 
But we really need not to worry about the code.  But 
ultimately it must be for the DI/PH to approve/disapprove 
completion and the completion register.  So, in other words, 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 28 of 239 
 
there are three levels before a report is ultimately approved.  
Would that be correct? 
MR NHLEKO:  Ja-no, I hear you. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now what we know in the case in this 
matter, we do know that and we have debated it for some 
time of the year, we do know that insofar as Mr Khuba is 
concerned, his particular report being the report of the 
22n d of January, was signed only by him.  Is that correct? 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now, picking up on another topic that we 
10 
have dealt with yesterday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you go to another topic Mr Hulley 
and you may have covered this angle but I just want to make 
sure.  I see Mr Nhleko that Werksmans in their report to you 
also quotes Regulation 5(1) of the regulations under the IPID 
Act.  
MR NHLEKO:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I do not know if they have quoted the 
whole... the sub-regulation 1 here or not because where they 
started, they do not start with a capital letter.  They start 
20 
with a small letter. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But they quote: 
“After 
collecting 
all 
evidence, 
statements 
and 
technical or expert reports, if applicable, submits a 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 29 of 239 
 
report on the investigation of the offence to the 
executive director or the relevant provincial head as 
the 
case 
may 
be, 
containing 
recommendations 
regarding 
further 
action 
which 
may 
include 
disciplinary measures to be taken against a member 
of the South African Police Service or the Municipal 
Police 
Service 
or 
criminal 
prosecution 
of 
such 
member...” 
 
I think I saw, it might be a full regulation file where the 
suggestion or what appears to be the position is that a report 
10 
must be approved by the executive director.   
 
Is that something that you recall as having been in the 
position?  I know that you have said yesterday there is no 
law that says a report must be signed by the Executive 
Director of IPID. 
 
But I seem to think that I saw something saying the 
regulations require the executive director to approve but 
here it says the report must be... 
“After 
all 
evidence 
has 
been 
collected, 
the 
statements and expert reports applicable, must be 
20 
submitted to the executive director or the provincial 
head 
as 
the 
case 
may 
be 
containing 
recommendations...” 
 
And maybe that might mean... this particular part does 
not seem to say so what is quoted here but it may be that 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 30 of 239 
 
the purpose of submitting is that he or she should approve.  I 
do not know.   
 
What is your recollection about whether there was a 
requirement that the executive director should approve, 
whether he must sign or not sign but he should approve the 
report?  Do you have any recollection of what ...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:  Just two things Chair.  I think the first one is 
that... I think when Mr Yule appears, he will probably clarify 
that issue and the reference to that particular section of the 
regulations. 
10 
 
There are two processes here that should also somehow 
...[indistinct]  And so the first one.  The applicability of your 
standard operating procedures it is more to do with internal 
controls, okay. 
 
Now and the... no, not the regulations.  The Standard 
Operating Procedure as quoted by Mr Hulley for an example, 
places an emphases on quality assurance.  Precisely.  
Because if you are the executive director you are a 
supervisor, okay. 
 
So you will essentially need to satisfy yourself that the 
20 
work that they would have done is complete, right.  Now that 
is an internal process matter within the institution. 
 
But signing off a ...[indistinct]  Remember... or let me try 
and make a practical example.  Suppose the Honourable 
Chair is an investigator and reports to, I would have satisfied 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 31 of 239 
 
myself that indeed you... this report is okay, it is fine, okay.   
 
You... whatever, you know issues of standard that I 
would have to look into that governance the manner in which 
you, you know, constituted or constructed your report and so 
on. 
 
Now essentially, I would have to then say to you it is 
fine.  You can now refer this report to the NPA or whatever 
authority, 
okay. 
 
So 
that 
is 
the 
Standard 
Operating 
Procedure.   
 
Now, the issue I was raising is that the Standard 
10 
Operating Procedure should not be equated to law that says 
it is compulsory for an executive director to sign off an 
investigation report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No, no, no.  I understand that. 
MR NHLEKO:  So that is a distinction I was looking at. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But must I take your response to be that it 
was within your understanding at the relevant time that in 
terms of internal procedures within IPID, the executive 
director would have been required to have seen the report 
for purposes of quality assurance that that would have been 
20 
your understanding? 
MR NHLEKO:  That would have been, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair.  If I can 
...[intervenes]  
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 32 of 239 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  But you are... are you saying, 
as far as the regulations are concerned, you do not or you 
do have a recollection that your understanding was that even 
the regulations required the approval of the director?  Or, 
you are saying, “I do not remember.  I do not know what... 
whether the regulations ...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:  No, it might require from me to have a read(?) 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:  ...but I really do not have a situation where 
10 
regulations... because regulations, by the way ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  ...they are not stand-alone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [Indistinct]  
MR NHLEKO:  Yes.  No, they are not stand-alone.  They fall 
off from legislation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No, it is fine. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair.  And although really 
20 
deal with this issue but just to round off the issue on page 
1572.  You will see there that 1572 deals also with the 
closing of files.   
 
And without belabouring the point, it follows the same 
process as in relation to the completion of files where the 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 33 of 239 
 
process of the closure of the file is initiated through the 
supervisor.  Sorry, is initiated by the case worker through the 
supervisor. 
 
And then it is escalated where the supervisor has to 
review and quality assure the report and then has to make a 
recommendation to the DI/PH. 
 
And 
then 
ultimately, 
the 
DI/PH 
must 
approve 
or 
disapprove the closure of the... and in the closed register is 
utilised. 
 
So it is essentially a pier tier system of initiating, either 
10 
the completion of the file or the closing of the file.  Is that 
correct? 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes, I hear you sir. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now, if we can turn to... I would like to 
turn to an additional issue but before I do so, I just want to 
make it clear that, as I understand your evidence, you are 
not suggesting that internally there is no obligation to comply 
with the Standard Operating Procedure?  That is not your 
point, is it? 
MR NHLEKO:  The... as the terms stands, Standard 
20 
Operating Procedure is precisely because you need to 
comply and adhere to certain standards of functionality.  
That is why it is called Standard Operating Procedures. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, sir. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 34 of 239 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now, insofar as the two reports... and I 
moving onto a separate topic now, but insofar as the two 
reports are concerned, you will recall that, once again, that 
there was the 22 January report which had been signed by 
Mr Khuba alone and there was the 18 March report which 
had been signed by Mr Khuba, Mr Sesoko, and of course, by 
Mr McBride. 
 
Now, 
then 
you 
approached 
mister... 
or 
when 
you 
approached IPID through your letter of the 24t h of November 
of 2014 and asked him for the case... for the case docket in 
10 
respect of the rendition matter. 
 
Mr McBride responded by sending you the letter of the 
26t h of November in which he provided you with the full case 
docket.  Is that correct? 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes, sir. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And pursuant to that... or rather, in that 
docket... in that document, he explained to you that the 
docket was... the original docket was at the National Director 
of Public Prosecutions.   
MR NHLEKO:  I am listening sir. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Well, if you have got the recollection, 
then I would have to draw your attention... sorry.  If you have 
no recollection, I will have to draw your attention to the 
document. 
MR NHLEKO:  Okay. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 35 of 239 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So if you will just bear with me.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Somebody must just make sure each time 
there is a reference to a different file that the witness is 
given the file that is referred to, unless ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  ...unless he is happy to deal with the 
question without looking at it but it is better if it is made 
available so that he can then elect whether he wants to have 
a look or not. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  If you can turn with me to Exhibit Y7 Mr 
10 
Nhleko? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Yes, Mr Hulley.  You are right. 
MR NHLEKO:  No, ...[indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Somebody should long have stood up to 
take the file and give it to the witness. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:  No, it is alright Chair.  Chairperson, I am 
remembering some few things about that administration.  So. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
20 
MR NHLEKO:  I have already located the Exhibit Y7 file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughs] 
MR NHLEKO:  And I feel so educated by being able to do so.  
[laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughs] 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 36 of 239 
 
MR NHLEKO:  Thank you very much, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  Yes, I must say that so far I 
think 
we 
are 
moving 
quite 
satisfactorily.  So let 
us 
...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:  I do not think we should jinx it Mr Chair.  
[laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughs]  Let us stick to that lane.  Yes.  
Thank you.  Just confirm again Mr Hulley for the record 
which file? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  This is Exhibit Y7. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Exhibit...? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Y7. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it Y7? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  It is one of these ...[indistinct] bundles. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  It is the supplementary affidavit of Mr 
Robert McBride. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now if you turn for me to page 144. 
CHAIRPERSON:  144? 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That is correct, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  To place this in context Mr Nhleko.  This 
is the letter that we referred to, at least yesterday and the 
day before.  It is the letter of Mr McBride dated the 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 37 of 239 
 
28t h of November 2014 which is addressed to you as the 
minister that it is responding to your earlier letter of the 
24 t h of November.  Is that correct? 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes, that is correct sir. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  If you turn with me to page 144 under the 
heading “conclusion” at the foot of that page? 
MR NHLEKO:  H’m. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Mr McBride says that the... in the second 
paragraph beneath that heading: 
“The recommendation with the entire docket and 
10 
evidentiary material was forwarded to the office of 
the National Director of Public Prosecutions on the 
14t h of April 2014.   
On the same day a disciplinary recommendation was 
forwarded 
to 
the 
office 
of 
the 
National 
Commissioner...” 
MR NHLEKO:  Alright. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Did you ever follow up with the National 
Director of Public Prosecutions to confirm whether he did 
indeed 
have 
the 
original 
case 
docket 
with 
the 
20 
recommendations? 
MR NHLEKO:  A follow up was made and I think that would 
also become much more clear as and when we get to the 
testimony that would be led by Mr Yule specifically in the 
construction of the... of what is commonly referred to as the 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 38 of 239 
 
Werksmans report.   
 
And it would also reveal the internal communication 
even within the National Prosecuting Authority in regard to 
this matter. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So would it be fair if I... just to 
paraphrase it, to try and understand your response?  Would 
it be fair to extract from that that your response is 
investigation or the follow up in relation to whether the 
docket was with the National Director of Public Prosecutions 
was in fact done by Werksmans? 
10 
MR NHLEKO:  It was through Werksmans, the investigation. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now, if you could turn ...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:  Chair, could I just ask?  It is extremely cold.  
It is extremely cold Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes.  I am sure that is a... if you are in a 
mortuary, this is how it feels, I suspect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughs]  Well, I can you that Mr Hulley 
told me on Monday which was his first day of leading 
evidence here that he complaint of extreme cold.   
20 
 
Now I have been here for a weeks now hearing evidence 
but I have had the benefit of some small heaters as well.  So 
I might not be exactly in the same position.  I think they are 
going to try and see what can be done.   
 
The question is whether that is making it colder 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 39 of 239 
 
...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:  And the nose. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...and that... and maybe if it is maybe that 
it might be less cold without it than with it.  [laughs] 
MR NHLEKO:  H’m.  Possible.  Possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The relevant person has gone out.  I think 
they will see what can be done.  Please raise your concern 
again if... after some time you do not feel any difference.   
 
There might not be much we can do other than switching 
it off and on because it is a big venue and therefore, I think 
10 
it takes time.   
 
But also I do not know how effective it is but I have had 
that sometimes people have felt it, at least some slight 
warmth.  I have not had anybody saying it feels very warm 
here.  [laughs] 
ADV HULLEY SC:  [laughs] 
MR NHLEKO:  It is the question of the advantage versus the 
disadvantaged.  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughs] 
MR NHLEKO:  [laughs] 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I think we are disadvantaged in the 
current environment Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well, I see ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:  There are degrees of disadvantage. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. [laughs] 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 40 of 239 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think when you say advantage, he looks 
at me.  [laughs] 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes.  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe because of the heaters. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think the one I have today, I also do 
not... yesterday, I had two and I think one was not effective.  
Today I have got one.  It doesn’t feel any different from 
yesterday.  Okay let us continue and hopefully something will 
be done. 
10 
 
I have been told this venue, this building is old.  Some 
of the infrastructure is not good.  So some of the things that 
one would expect are not because it is an old building with 
old infrastructure but let us see. 
 
I think probably you would have been well-advised to put 
on a jersey as well.  [laughs] 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Hulley when he felt it was extremely 
cold on Monday, he also did not have a jersey. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But yesterday he had a jersey on as well. 
MR NHLEKO:  H’m.  H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I have been wearing a jersey since we 
started here.  Okay let us continue and just do raise your 
concerns again later on if we continue to feel extremely cold.  
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 41 of 239 
 
Yes, Mr Hulley? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair.  Now, as regards 
the two reports, the... if I understood correctly from your 
testimony yesterday, you had received the first report.  That 
is the 22 January report, signed.   
 
And you know that it had been obtained through your 
internal structures but you do not know precisely by whom.  
If I understood your testimony, you said it landed on your 
desk and you do not know who might have placed it there?  
Correct? 
10 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes, I am listening sir. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And on the... and the second report 
which was dated the 18t h of March of 2014, that was 
provided to you by the... by Mr McBride through the letter or 
attached to the letter together with the docket on the 
26t h of November 2014.  Is that correct? 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes, I am following sir. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now, when you... when one look... 
considers the two reports and it is a proposition I put to you 
yesterday but we did not get around to fully ventilate it. 
20 
 
But when one considers the two reports, the second 
report... there was no suggestion that the second report had 
passed itself off as the first report.   
 
The second report was a report dated 22... sorry, dated 
18 March 2014.  It did not purport... it passed itself off as a 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 42 of 239 
 
report dated the 22n d of January of 2014.  Would that be fair 
to say? 
MR NHLEKO:  Maybe let us try some simpler English.  I do 
not know.  Are you saying ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:  Shall I start one step at a time then? 
MR NHLEKO:  H’m. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Firstly, let us look at the date. 
MR NHLEKO:  No, I hear that part but let me... let me get 
this 
point 
correctly. 
 
Are 
you 
saying 
there 
is 
a 
22n d of January report which has got nothing to do with the 
10 
18t h of March report?  Is that what ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:  [Indistinct] nothing to do.  That is part 
...[indistinct] that I am conveying to you. 
MR NHLEKO:  No, I am talking about two distinct reports? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I am saying that the 20... the 18 March 
report does not purport to be the 22 January report. 
MR NHLEKO:  It could not be.  It is dated the 18 t h of March.  
So it could not be the 22 n d January report because it is dated 
the 18t h of March.  So that is why I was saying, let us maybe 
try and, you know, separate the two. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe... let me ask this question and I 
think it might go back to an issue we have discussed 
yesterday.  Is there any reason why the report of the 
18t h of March could not be taken as a replacement of the 
report of the 22 nd of January? 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 43 of 239 
 
MR NHLEKO:  I think ...[indistinct] Chair earlier on it should 
be ...[indistinct]  I have been sitting in this freezing place.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR NHLEKO:  [laughs]  I briefly spoke to this issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes.  But ...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:  I even referred... yes, I even referred to the 
question of what the convention is, you know, even world-
wise.  If you produce another report that has got to another 
one, you state so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR NHLEKO:  You then say, “Look, this report annuls that 
one”.  So I am withdrawing that one, replacing it with this 
one, okay.  So that is what practice and a convention would 
have.   
 
It would also be interesting that with regards to exactly 
this specific issue to get the prosecutors in the NPA because 
they spoke to this issue as well.  They had a reaction to it in 
relation to a second report that they then received. 
 
So my clarification would be that if then that is the case, 
because I do not think we should be understood in saying 
20 
you cannot replace a report. 
 
But if you replace a report, state that you are replacing 
that report and it is replaced by this one, okay.  And state 
your reasons as to why you think this is correct, you know.  I 
am just making an example.  Ja, I wanted to look at that 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 44 of 239 
 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, I hear... I think what you have 
said is, it does clarify to quite a large extent what I had in 
mind.  I think probably what Mr Hulley also had in mind but I 
am looking at him, he is not nodding.  [laughs]  So he 
might... but ...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:  He hardly ever does nod. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m? 
MR NHLEKO:  He hardly ever does nod. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  [laughs] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughs] 
MR NHLEKO:  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I have not seen him shake his head 
either.  So.  But let me put... make this proposition to you.   
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That what you have said, mainly that if you 
want to replace an earlier report with a later report, you will 
make... you would write or you would make it clear that this 
later report replaces the earlier one.   
 
Now you may or may not give reasons, you know, but 
20 
obviously, if the person you are conveying this information to 
says why, you would have to say why.  Okay?  You want to 
say something before I move on?  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:  No, thanks Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 45 of 239 
 
MR NHLEKO:  But in that regard, I think when we tried to 
clarify ourselves around this issue in the manner in which 
the Chair is doing, at the back of our minds we should not 
forget these are investigation reports.  So they rely largely 
on what is contained in the docket. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  In the statements there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  So I would suppose because I am not 
speaking for the NPA or for prosecutors because I do not 
10 
know how they work.  Regardless of the allegations that I 
have now captured them.  But the point is.  Certainly, they 
would have to factor the why question when you come in with 
the second report that says, “No, I am nullifying the other 
one”.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  So it would mean it will take them back, all of 
them, this investigating officers and the prosecutors.  It will 
be have to take them back to the constituting material which 
in that case is referred to as the docket. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no, no.  I understand that.  I am 
starting from the general before going to the specific. 
MR NHLEKO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am suggesting to you that you may not 
need always to explain why you are replacing one report with 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 46 of 239 
 
another, an earlier report with a later report but obviously, if 
the person you are giving the report asks the question why, 
you would have to explain, you know.  But I am imagining if 
one of my staff was understood to – then we would resume 
at quarter past eleven. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   That is the impression I got.  I thought 
it was incredibly generous.  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I am under the impression that I said 
let us make it a tea break so the adjournment would be a 
tea break and we would resume at eleven but it is fine, let 
10 
us continue now. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  Mr Nhleko, 
before the adjournment, we were dealing with the question 
of the two reports and what it is that you would have 
expected a person to do if it was the intention to annul or 
to change a previous report.  Now you have indicated that 
one would have expected in the new report to indicate that 
you have changed the old report.  Do I understand 
correctly? 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes, sir, I think I must have said that. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now you are speaking in general 
terms.  If I understood you correctly, you are saying well, 
you do not what the processes are within IPID but if I 
understand you correctly, speaking generally that is what 
you would have expected. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 47 of 239 
 
MR NHLEKO:   Look, if you say general terms, perhaps I 
would 
want 
to 
qualify 
that 
because, 
you 
know, 
in 
government there are no general terms, there are practices 
there and conventions and regulations and laws.  Now – 
because if you say general terms, it is as if you are 
referring to any other form of a report including a 
newspaper report.  I mean, it cannot be. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But maybe because we were discussing 
this point earlier on and …[intervenes] 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   …I think we had not finalised it when the 
electricity went off.  Let me also come in.  This is the 
proposition I wanted to put to you when the electricity was 
– supply was interrupted, namely that even if – or let me 
put it this way, is the position not that even if the person 
who is supposed to give you a report on a certain matter, 
is the position that even if he does not or she does not say 
I am withdrawing the earlier report, if having given you a 
report earlier on a subject matter, he or she gives you a 
later report and the later report deals with the same 
20 
subject matter.  Unless there is something in the later 
report that suggests that the later report does not replace 
the earlier report, it would reasonable to take it that the 
later report replaces the earlier report.   
 
So, in other words, unless the later report says or 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 48 of 239 
 
unless the person tells you you have got to read both, you 
need both, if the later report deals with the same subject 
matter, it would be reasonable to take the later report as 
replacing the earlier report, even if they did not say 
anything - if you read both, you might say it cannot be 
intended that they both stand at the same time, one of 
them falls. 
MR NHLEKO:   I like the last point, one of them falls. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The falling part. 
MR NHLEKO:   The one of the falling part, I like that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR NHLEKO:   I like that, honourable Chair, but the point 
really is, is that – and I think I tried to clarify this point.  
Look, in this particular instance, for an example, Chair, a 
report does not produce the docket but it is the docket that 
produces the report.  So it works the other way around.  
Now the docket is the basis that constitutes the essential 
body of the report, right? 
CHAIRPERSON:   The report will be based on the docket. 
MR NHLEKO:   On the docket, yes, exactly. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, not the other way around. 
MR NHLEKO:   Exactly.  And I think the wonderful points 
that – or propositions that you also, you know, put to me 
yesterday which made me think in a way because, you 
know, I think it was in the process of thinking, that we 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 49 of 239 
 
needed to reflect on some of these things but you – I am 
then saying even if we are not talking of an investigation 
report because an investigation report is a very serious 
matter, it is a very serious report because it bases itself on 
statements 
collected, 
the 
analysis 
of 
evidence 
and 
whatever else and so on, are they at a prima facie level 
and so on.  But I also do think that the question that the 
Chair is posing is well actually suited for the National 
Prosecuting Authority to respond.  Right?  What was their 
understanding and is it their understanding based on law 
10 
that you could produce a second report and if you want to 
produce 
a 
third 
report, 
if 
you 
want 
to, 
and 
your 
understanding should always be that because the report is 
the latest, it replaces the first, the second and the third 
report.  I am just making an example.  I think, for me, I 
would also be very interested in that. 
 
But I am further saying, Chair, that, you know, 
convention has it.  If you produce a report you must then 
state that this report that you are now producing replaces 
the other report on the same subject matter that you must 
20 
filed at some point and you must advance your reasons.  I 
mean here because you are talking of matters that related 
to law in criminal prosecution you would have to state your 
reasons why you are now changing and, you know, failing a 
later report of any sorts and they would have to be cogent 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 50 of 239 
 
kind of reasons, I should think. 
 
Now, so – and that is why I am saying we should 
draw the distinction around this particular matter but I am 
also 
very 
interested 
to 
hear 
what 
the 
NPA 
itself 
understands 
by 
this 
because 
there 
were 
particular 
reactions the side of the prosecutors that were assigned to 
assist IPID in this particular investigation in, you know, 
their reaction in relation to the second report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I understand that part. 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But remember that, as I understood your 
evidence yesterday, the report is not just for the NPA, it is 
also for you, as Minister, at the time, as I understood it 
because you may have to make a decision with regard to 
disciplinary 
matters. 
 
So, 
is 
that 
correct, 
is 
my 
understanding correct? 
MR NHLEKO:   Look …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   If they recommend disciplinary action, I 
understood you to say you would have to make those 
decisions in regard to disciplinary matters but the NPA 
20 
would 
have 
to 
make 
decisions 
in 
regard 
to 
criminal…[intervenes] 
MR NHLEKO:   On prosecutory matters, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  My understanding is correct? 
MR NHLEKO:     Yes. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 51 of 239 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so I am saying while the NPA’s 
understanding of this question I am raising might also be 
important but it is important also in regard to you because 
you 
were 
expected 
to 
make 
decisions 
in 
regard 
to 
disciplinary matters and when this issue of whether the 
first report was final or not arises, so it arises in regard to 
both those who were supposed to make decisions on 
criminal matters and you are supposed to make a decision 
on the disciplinary matters. 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So your own understanding becomes 
important and that is why I posed the question and I invite 
your own understanding what it was. 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because the proposition I am putting is 
that even if the person giving the report does not say this 
one replaces the earlier one, as you have suggested, I am 
saying to you, what about the proposition that you may, 
when you read the two reports, see that they cannot both 
be intended to be – to operate and to be valid, only one 
20 
can and in that case I want to put the proposition that it 
would be reasonable to think you would say it is the latest 
one that must be intended as the report and therefore, in 
that case, it replaces the earlier one, they are not meant to 
be – you are not supposed to make a decision – to base 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 52 of 239 
 
your decisions on both particularly when they have material 
differences.   
So my suggestion is that – my suggestion to you, 
Mr Nhleko, is that if you give me a report today and five 
days later you give me another one dated five days later, 
on the same subject matter, and you do not make a note 
for me to say I must ignore the first one and you go away, 
if I read both and see that there are differences even 
without asking you, it is reasonable for me to think that I 
must take the later one as intended to replace the first 
10 
one.  What do you say to that proposition? 
MR NHLEKO:   Honourable Chairperson, I hear you but still 
disagree with you …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, this is the opportunity to 
disagree with the Chairperson. 
MR NHLEKO:    Yes, I still disagree with you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because I want to understand your own 
approach and understanding how you approached the 
reports.  So it is important for me to understand that. 
MR NHLEKO:   I would say to you, Chair, look at it from an 
20 
angle of a person who has an institutional responsibility, 
an institutional responsibility and, of course, in this 
definition, I am deliberately excluding the NPA because I 
think you made a general point.  So we are not talking 
about the specific in this regard, so – but let me also try 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 53 of 239 
 
and be general. 
 
So here you are, you are a manager and a 
supervisor and your subordinate has filed a particular 
report, let us say some few weeks ago and this subordinate 
says this report, this is how it is final and I finalised it, 
okay?  But then the same subordinate comes back three 
weeks later with another report on the same subject matter 
and does not refer to the first report and says to you here 
is a report, it is as if it is a new report, okay?  Firstly, that 
on its own, there is something wrong with that, within that 
10 
approach, completely wrong, but nevertheless.  Suppose I 
ignore 
that 
as 
a 
person 
who 
holds 
institutional 
responsibility being a manager of supervisor of sorts, 
supervisor of sorts, now I have got take a decision.  The 
dilemma that you then have is that you have two reports 
before you, all of them valid, valid in a sense that the first 
one filed three weeks ago has not been withdrawn, is still 
the same.  Now you have a second one which is not a 
continuation or supplementary to the first one because that 
is a different matter if it is supplementary, it means 
20 
continuation, so you now have a second one.  Now this 
second one does not talk to the first one but the subject 
matter is the same, all you have are material facts that 
have been removed from the first one to constitute this 
one. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 54 of 239 
 
 
The question is, in the execution of your duty, what 
do you do?  Now if you assume – if you make the assume, 
as the Chair, in place, I can assure you of one thing, you 
would be introducing institutional instability and turmoil 
within that very same institution because you are likely to 
then say no, I assume that a second report is the valid one 
and therefore on the basis of which I am making this 
following decisions.  So you make your decisions but your 
decisions are wrong because they could then also be 
challenged by some of the issues arising out of the first 
10 
report. 
 
So your decision-making shall always be contested 
and that is why you need to have absolute clarify around 
these particular matters and I think yourselves, as lawyers, 
I think you have a term that you use, un-ambiguity, 
something like that, I think that is big English but 
nevertheless.   
 
You know, I think it is absolutely – you must have 
absolute and absolute clarity so that then you are correctly 
empowered, as a supervisor, and a person who is holding 
20 
institutional responsibility to be able to execute your duty 
and function otherwise -  that is my personal opinion, on 
the general, of course, as per the proposition by the Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, I understand you, let me put 
this.  I think I said yesterday when I put to you the 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 55 of 239 
 
proposition 
that 
the 
– 
what 
do 
you 
say 
about 
the 
proposition that the second report may have been or was 
not and had to replace the first one, I do not necessarily 
mean that if you thought there was something wrong with 
the first report or if you thought that arising out of you 
being given two reports. 
MR NHLEKO:    Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The mere fact that the second one is 
taken as replacing the first one may not necessarily mean 
that you cannot pursue anything that you think needs to be 
10 
pursued. 
MR NHLEKO:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You know, it is simply to say in this 
context it is difficult for me to see how you could have 
thought that the authors of the report intended you to 
regard both as valid, as continuing to be their report 
because they had, for example, recommendations that were 
in conflict with each other.   
So once you know that the one report, the later 
report, has a certain recommendation that is in conflict 
20 
with a recommendation or that was made in the first report, 
it seems to me that logically you have to say they cannot 
be intending that both must be taken as valid.   
What you may still say is okay, I accept that the 
second one is your final but there is some concern I have 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 56 of 239 
 
and that is why I want to look into something.  I do not 
have a problem that you say you regard this second one as 
final but that does not remove my concern when I look at 
what has happened. 
MR NHLEKO:   Chair, let me try and illustrate this point, 
maybe 
differently. 
 And I 
will 
come 
closer 
to 
your 
profession, okay? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR NHLEKO:   So you issue a judgment today and this 
judgment is based on certain considerations and the 
10 
processing up until the point of an order.  Three weeks 
later – I do not know why I like three weeks later – three 
weeks later, the same judge writes the judgment on the 
same matter, right?  Arrives on a different order.  The 
matter is the same, the material factors are still the same, 
right?  But now what you are confronted with is that right 
at the tail end of the judgment you have an order.  The first 
order looks different from the second one.  
 
Now to a person who is the recipient of that order, 
what is he or she supposed to do?  Which order do you 
20 
then follow, right?  Now – and of course I am not trying to 
say that investigation reports are equivalent to judgments 
and orders but I am trying to illustrate this point that you 
shall always, as a recipient of either a report and/or and 
order like that, have a problem in terms of which is which 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 57 of 239 
 
then between the two.  But you are also likely to ask 
yourself one logical question flowing from that issue and 
that is, how come this order differs from the other?  What 
are the material factors that brought about this?   
 
Now – and that is why I said respectfully I probably 
disagree with the Chair because the example that you are 
making is of a general nature, it is any other report like a 
newspaper article and so on.   
 
But 
now 
we 
are 
talking 
about 
institutions 
of 
governance which have got to be – their work must be 
10 
executed explicitly, [indistinct] 20.50 and clear, you know?  
That is the thing.  So I am not sure that I am satisfied with 
the Chair ’s …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think we are very close to seeing the 
matter in the same way but I think there is just a little bit 
of – there is a point where we may not be seeing it exactly 
the same but let me make this point.  With regard to a 
judgment, judges change their judgments all the time as 
long as the judgments have not been handed down, okay?   
 
Once they have been handed down, they may 
20 
correct certain things, not substance, okay?  But before 
they are handed down you chop and change.  Sometimes 
five days before the date when you are going to hand it 
down, you are going this way and one day before handed 
down you realise no, no, no, no, no, I am completely 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 58 of 239 
 
wrong, you go this way.  So people do not know how much 
you agonised and took different twists and turns before 
ultimately you handed down.   
Now in the case of the investigation report, one, my 
understanding is that they presented the second report 
before 
you 
could 
make 
any 
decision 
on 
disciplinary 
matters, they presented the second report before the NPA 
could make any decisions, you know?  So it may be that as 
long as the powers that be have not made any decisions it 
should not be a problem but if they have already made 
10 
decisions it might be a different issue but I said earlier on, 
whether you take the report, the second report as final on 
– as the final one or not, I am not necessarily saying that if 
when you look at what is said in the final report and you 
look at what is said in the earlier report, you cannot pursue 
an issue that you think you should be pursued.   
So I am working on the basis that even if you 
accept that the second report is final, that should not 
necessarily mean that you cannot pursue and issue that is 
of concern to you arising from looking at the two reports 
20 
but still accepting that the final one is the same.  So that is 
where I am.  I think we are close, we probably – you might 
not agree and I might be wrong but I think I am not as far 
apart as we might seem. 
MR NHLEKO:   Okay, I hear you, Chair. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 59 of 239 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright.  Mr Hulley? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  Just to be clear 
about the question of the amendment of reports, etcetera, I 
had asked you whether that was a general proposition or 
whether you were talking specifically about the amendment 
of reports in relation to IPID but I want to ask you a 
slightly different question but on the same proposition.   
Is 
there 
anything 
within 
government, 
either 
a 
statute, a regulation or standard operating procedure, a 
manual that stipulates that before you amend a report or 
10 
before you produce a second report on the same topic 
covered by the first report you must refer to the first report 
and identify to what extent and why you have – identity to 
what extent you have changed the first report and why you 
have done so? 
MR NHLEKO:   No, let me refer to practice because I would 
not recall of course the applicable sort of regulations 
and/or policy regulations and or policy positions but 
practice has it in that if you produce a report as contained 
in what is commonly known as a submission for an example 
20 
and something changes, whether you want to update that, 
you will need to produce another report in relation to the 
first submission that you would have made and point, you 
know, and refer to it in very direct terms that this report 
that you are now filing is in relation to submission 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 60 of 239 
 
whatever quote of the submission there and the title of the 
submission and that you are amending it in respect of 
whatever the issues are that you would then identify in 
your new submission.   
So that is what practice is and, of course, I have 
not worked for each and every government department but 
at least in the areas that are functioned I know that that is 
the case. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   I am going to follow up on that.  Is 
there a rule or practice, statutorial regulation which 
10 
stipulates that if one does not follow this practice of which 
you speak, that gives rise to misconduct and possibly 
criminal misconduct? 
MR NHLEKO:   Chair, that really depends on what each 
matter would be contained in such a submission and the 
gravity thereof, I mean, really, so… 
ADV HULLEY SC:   I am actually putting it at the very 
general level, I am asking you is there a rule, either a rule 
that is contained in some instrument, whether it be a 
statute, a manual, a regulation which stipulates that the 
20 
mere failure to follow this practice of which you speak, the 
mere failure, does not matter what the content is, or does 
not matter what the extent is, the mere failure constitutes 
misconduct or constitutes a criminal offence. 
MR NHLEKO:   Look, Mr Hulley, the – it would really 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 61 of 239 
 
depend on the policy framework and outlook of each given 
government 
institution 
particularly 
contained 
in 
your 
standard operating procedures.   
It is possible that another department, depending 
on what that department would be, it would maybe in the 
standard operating procedure refer to a misrepresentation 
of facts or reports or reports or whatever the case is and 
therefore, if that is so, that can then be gravitated to an 
area of misconduct as an when, for instance, an employee 
would have committed such an alleged sort of offence. 
10 
 
So – and that is why I do not want to talk about, you 
know, whether rules, regulations and/or legislation in 
government because, you know, I mean, really that is very 
broad. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thanks.  But of course, the proposition 
that you advanced and on the example that you use of a 
misrepresentation, that stands on a completely different 
footing.   
 
What you mean there is that when you state one thing, 
you make it a statement about one thing, whether it has 
20 
been in the report, whether it has been a verbal statement, 
when that thing - that you know that thing to be false, that 
would then amount to a misrepresentation, whether it is a 
misrepresentation that is actionable in the sense that it is 
a disciplinary infraction would of course depend on the 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 62 of 239 
 
content of the misrepresentation and its materiality to a 
workplace.  In other words, it is on a matter of – that is on 
a matter relating to your duties. 
MR NHLEKO:   No, I hear you Mr Hulley, but I was just 
making an example. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thanks. 
MR NHLEKO:   In terms of what could also possibly be 
said in a set of standard operating procedures, and/or 
policy of a particular institution. 
ADV HULLEY:   I want to deal with a slightly, or move on 
10 
to a different topic, I mean, you were the Minister of 
Police, now one of the issues that had been raised by Mr 
McBride when he came into your office sometime in March 
of 2014 was immediately to identify, once he was told that 
Crime Intelligence had been involved in this investigation, 
he found that particularly strange.  If I understand him 
correctly, he was saying that it was strange at two levels, it 
was strange that Crime Intelligence had been involved in 
an investigation at all because Crime Intelligence doesn’t 
really, to use the language, carry a docket, they don’t 
20 
investigate 
criminal 
misconduct. 
 
Crime 
Intelligence 
gathers information, they gather and they pass it on to 
some of the other structures within the SAPS, would that 
be a fair comment? 
MR NHLEKO:   Look, I think it is, I think it’s also a matter 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 63 of 239 
 
that, in the first report of the civilian secretariat of the 
police in 2013, no 2012, if I’m not mistaken, does refer to 
the matter having been picked up by Crime Intelligence and 
so on and I think that’s when the Minister, before I came 
in, took a decision to then refer the matter to IPID but also 
at the earlier stages when Ms Koeki Mbeki was the Acting 
Executive Director then there was some involvement of a 
person from Crime Intelligence in this, for how long, I don’t 
know but by – you know at some point that person 
withdrew.  So, the issue of the involvement of Crime 
10 
Intelligence 
did 
not 
necessarily 
arise 
around 
about 
February or March of 2014, I think it was a matter that was 
there, long before the conclusion of the report by Mr Khuba 
on the 22 n d of January 2014.  So – and I think there’s 
something that I must have seen somewhere by Ms Koeki 
Mbeki talking exactly to that issue, the decision being 
taken that, then Crime Intelligence needed to be, whoever 
person was needed to stand out and away out of the 
investigative work that IPID was conducting. 
ADV HULLEY:   But before I deal with that response, I just 
20 
want to understand, would it be fair to say that Crime 
Intelligence is a body or a structure within the SAPS that 
gathers evidence or gathers information and the pass it on 
to other bodies or other structures within the SAPS, they 
don’t carry dockets? 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 64 of 239 
 
MR NHLEKO:   Ja I think you’re correct with the exception 
that you corrected yourself there correctly, they don’t 
gather evidence, they gather information. 
ADV HULLEY:   Thanks for that correction.  Now the 
person you’re speaking of is a certain Colonel Moukangwe, 
if my memory serves me correctly. 
MR NHLEKO:   Right. 
ADV HULLEY:   Now – in fact Colonel Moukangwe didn’t 
withdraw from the matter, as you suggest, he was involved 
in the matter right up until the matter was being dealt with 
10 
by Mr Khuba and he assisted Mr Khuba throughout and he 
was instructed by Ms Koeki Mbeki to have Mr Khuba or to 
have Colonel Moukangwe assisting him at all stages.  
Would that be, for you, would that be problematic? 
MR NHLEKO:   Look, I think that detail, you know, as and 
when my understanding is that you could be in the process, 
Chair, of taking a decision to invite Ms Mbeki here because 
I think she would, you know, well positioned to clarify that 
particular point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja I think that Ms Mbeki should come in, 
20 
come and testify, actually.  I was surprised that, yesterday 
Mr Hulley you were told that her affidavit is still not final.  
About a year ago I said her affidavit should be obtained but 
I think the reason why Mr Hulley raises this with you might 
be the same reason that I wanted to raise some of the 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 65 of 239 
 
issues including – the involvement of Mr Moukangwe with 
you.  I think he raises it with you because the involvement 
of 
Crime 
Intelligence 
or 
somebody 
from 
– 
or 
the 
involvement of Crime Intelligence prior to an investigation, 
because as I understand the position, Crime Intelligence 
had conducted some investigation on this rendition issue 
before the matter was handed over to IPID and then when 
it was handed over to IPID Mr Moukangwe, from Crime 
Intelligence or Mr Khuba was told that he was going to 
conduct the investigation with Mr Moukangwe and it 
10 
appears from Mr Khuba’s affidavit that the justification that 
was put forward was that, because Mr Moukangwe had 
done quite a lot of investigation so he should be captain in 
the investigation even when the investigation was being 
conducted by IPID.  So, my concern is, why would Crime 
Intelligence, 
who 
are 
not 
supposed 
to 
conduct 
investigations, one, conduct an investigation in this case, 
two, remain so interested in this investigation that one of 
their own must assist or be part of the investigation even 
when the investigation is under the auspices of IPID. So, 
20 
Mr Hulley will you say, you might have a different concern 
but that’s the concern, there are many other features and 
maybe we’ll talk about them, which makes one say, but why 
was – why were things happening the way it’s suggested, 
were happening in regard to this investigation?  Of course, 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 66 of 239 
 
I have not heard everybody, maybe when I hear witnesses 
who have not come – who have not been heard yet, like Ms 
Mbeki certain things will begin to make sense.  So, but 
until that happens there are certain features where you 
say, but why was this happening.  So, I think, for me that is 
one of the issues to say, you, having been Minister of 
Police you’d be able to say, well to me it doesn’t look 
strange 
that, 
one, 
Crime 
Intelligence 
conducted 
investigation on this issue at all or two, it doesn’t – there’s 
nothing strange that somebody from Crime Intelligence 
10 
continued to be part of the investigation even when the 
investigation 
was 
done 
by 
IPID 
because 
of 
this 
understanding that I have or you might say, it also looks 
strange to me.  So that’s my – that’s what I’d like to hear 
from you, whether you – what your own reaction is when 
you hear that this was the case. 
MR NHLEKO:   No, honourable Chairperson, I think, in a 
way you have also answered yourself that the operatives 
as and when they appear here from an operational point of 
view, they’ll be able to give you further detail, for an 
20 
example.  So, it’s possible that they will be able to say to 
you, as Chair of this Commission and say, we had this 
much amount of information collected but these were the 
dynamics and nitty gritty’s that also involved that there 
were certain areas that could only be opened, precisely 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 67 of 239 
 
because, you know, they knew us or it was us who had this 
information for us to be able to access certain, whatever 
but that’s the kind of operational detail that, in my view, as 
and when the correct people at an operational level, are 
here and – and I’m liking to the point that the Chair 
correctly said, and said look you’ve not heard everybody 
it’s – therefore, it’s likely that as and when we draw in 
most of these individuals that were involved in this 
investigation and maybe collection at some point and so 
on, that matter will be clarified. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But what I would like you to help me with 
is whether, as somebody who was Minister of Police for a 
certain period, whether you regard it as normal for Crime 
Intelligence, one, to conduct an investigation as opposed 
to gathering information, I think you made that distinction 
earlier on and two, to be part of an investigation that is 
conducted by IPID, is that something that would happen in 
their normal – in the course of their work, as far as you 
know? 
MR NHLEKO:   Look, I wouldn’t know, as far as I know but 
20 
I think this question that the honourable Chair is posing is 
a relevant question.  It’s relevant in the sense that it really 
depends on what the issues were, I suppose, you know but 
if we – you had to ask me at a general level you are 
making an enquiry for an example, I’m just making – this is 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 68 of 239 
 
now a general thing, you are making an enquiry about a 
certain matter but I happen – I, who’s outside of your 
function, I happen to be holding a particular information 
okay, I think it would make sense that I would have to go 
cooperate with you and say, I hand over this information to 
you, to assist you in your enquiry or investigation that you 
are making.  Now, it’s then the question of operational 
detail of, do I continue to be involved with you for whatever 
the reasons are because it really depends on the nature 
and the weight of that information, I suppose, and to what 
10 
extent do I continue to assist you in your investigation and 
my understanding is that if you look at the historical, sort 
of 
reports 
around 
this 
issue, 
Crime 
Intelligence 
is 
identified as assisting in the investigation, not that they 
were conducting the investigation. So, the investigation 
was conducted by IPID but for whatever the reasons were, 
maybe they were operational reasons, whether they were 
sound or not so sound, I think operatives in that regard 
would be able to shed some light. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in terms of the scope of their work, 
20 
you are not able to say, whether this would normally fall 
within their scope of work?  
MR NHLEKO:   You mean in terms of their scope of their 
work they would not be conducting investigations, they 
would 
be 
collecting 
information, 
they 
would 
not 
be 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 69 of 239 
 
investigating police misconduct, for an example 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think that’s – that answers my 
question. 
MR NHLEKO:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just mention, for what it’s worth, and 
you probably can’t say anything about it, but it just adds to 
features 
that 
make 
the 
involvement 
of 
the 
Crime 
Intelligence, features that make this investigation strange 
or their interest in the matter, strange that according to Mr 
Khuba, in his affidavit, one,  Ms Mbeki – Koeki Mbeki told 
10 
him to keep the involvement of Mr Moukangwe secret.  
Two, according to Mr Khuba…[intervenes]. 
MR NHLEKO:   I’m sorry Chair, sorry to disturb you, keep 
the involvement of Mr Moukangwe, that’s the part – there’s 
a part that I couldn’t – I heard about Moukangwe, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I’m sorry, I’m saying, according to 
Mr Khuba’s affidavit one of the strange things for me is 
that according to him Ms Koeki Mbeki told or instructed Mr 
Khuba to keep the involvement of Mr Moukangwe secret in 
the investigation. 
20 
MR NHLEKO:   Oh okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that’s one.  Two, Mr Khuba says in 
his affidavit, Mr Moukangwe asked him to use certain email 
addresses 
when 
sending 
documents 
about 
this 
investigation but what is strange is that he didn’t want Mr 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 70 of 239 
 
Khuba to send him those documents or emails to his 
official email address, he gave him a certain email 
address, I get the impression from what Khuba says in his 
affidavit that it might not have, even been his personal 
email address, he insisted they should not be sent to his 
official email address. So, there are other features that are 
strange for me but I’m saying – I’m mentioning this you 
probably can’t comment on them. 
MR NHLEKO:   I hear you Chair but there’s hardly anything 
that I can answer about that ja, no thank you very much. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, Mr Hulley. 
ADV HULLEY:   Thank you Mr Chair, it is of further 
concern…[intervenes].   
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry I think Mr Mokhari has 
something …[intervenes]. 
MR MOKHARI:   Before Mr Hulley puts a question, for 
purposes of arranging my day, I see that we are no longer 
sticking to the times that we’ve spoken about yesterday, I 
had 
to 
arrange 
my 
day 
in 
such 
a 
manner 
that 
I 
accommodated the proceedings continued today, on the 
20 
basis of what was said.  I moved my commitments to the 
afternoon two o’clock and four o’clock and – so if I may be 
told again that we are going to go on so that I can be 
again, then I mean, shift my commitments. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I’m terribly sorry Mr Mokhari actually 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 71 of 239 
 
about half past eleven I thought of raising the issue but I 
think something happened and I forgot.  I did say that we 
have got to finish within two hours and in seven minutes 
time it will be two hours, I think but it’s quite clear we are 
not done.  I also still have got quite some questions, I 
think as far is today is concerned everything has been 
going satisfactorily in terms of everybody has been dealing 
with matters the way I expected so there has been 
cooperation from all sides.  Let us talk about what should 
happen and – I know that Mr Nhleko wanted to get done 
10 
and that’s why we have moved and Mr Mokhari also wanted 
this…[intervenes]. 
MR MOKHARI:   I think all I need to know Chair, is how 
much more time so that I’m able to move my commitments 
that’s all that I need. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well let’s talk about that, do we – Mr 
Hulley what is your own sense, we have got to do justice in 
the end but we must not take too long but we must still do 
justice. 
ADV HULLEY:   Obviously when I formulate an assessment 
20 
of time, I do so with reference to the questions that I’ve 
got and the response which I think will be accurate 
according to this.  Sometimes if the response is different it 
might take me down a different pathway but speaking, 
generally, I would have thought that two and a half hours – 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 72 of 239 
 
the assessment of two and a half hours yesterday would 
have been a fair assessment.  There’s been a few 
disturbances today, not necessarily related to Mr Nhleko 
you know, but there have been a few disturbances.  The 
point I’m making, simply is, that I think I’ve still got – 
essentially about three broad issues that I still need to 
discuss.  A lot of it is already dealt with in the affidavit but 
I need to get clarity on exactly what is being said with 
reference to the affidavit.  So, to answer your question Mr 
Chair, I would have imagined that if everything goes 
10 
according to the way I’ve formulated it in my head it would 
take about an hour and a half at most. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry just repeat that?  
ADV HULLEY:   What I’m saying is that my assessment 
based on the questions that I would ask and the answers 
that I anticipated getting, I would have assessed that it’s 
round about an hour and a half but sometimes there’s an 
explanation that comes…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And sometimes the Chairperson also has 
questions. 
20 
ADV HULLEY:   I didn’t say that Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think I can see you are diplomatic. 
MR MOKHARI:   Actually, when he says an hour and a half 
then we must put thirty minutes of the Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no that’s true. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 73 of 239 
 
MR MOKHARI:   No, no Chair that’s all that I wanted just 
an indication…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well the reason why I’m taking longer to 
answer that question on your part, is that I realised that 
this is quite an important thing and it’s quite obvious from 
Mr Nhleko’s statements over the past two days that also he 
regards this as very important so it should be dealt with 
properly.  So, I’ve been – I’ve been thinking about whether 
we shouldn’t run away from the idea that we might not 
finish so that when he comes back to cross-examine Mr 
10 
McBride, we can make space for him to finish first.  So 
that’s why I couldn’t – I didn’t want to immediately answer 
you, I know that he might have something to say but Mr 
Mokhari do you have something to say, even though he 
might have something different to say? 
MR MOKHARI:   No, yes, I’m saying that my question was 
only in relation of me then arranging my affairs for today, 
not that I was saying that – so I just want to know because 
it will be unfair of me to sit here whilst I’ve arranged with 
people.  So, all that I needed was, now that you’ve given 
20 
me the indication, so during lunch time I’m able then to 
simply then rearrange my affairs.  So I’m not saying that 
we should not continue until we finish but I’ll prefer that we 
run and we finish with him so that when we come to cross-
examine we cross-examine the McBride he’s going to be 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 74 of 239 
 
cross-examined by many people then this may, again, 
disturb – and he has to come from KZN all the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, Mr Nhleko…[intervenes]. 
MR MOKHARI:  So, if you can just proceed on that basis.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Nhleko you wanted to say 
something, you raised your hand? 
MR NHLEKO:   No, no, no I do confirm this position that, in 
fact, we should finish but I would have said that perhaps to 
be on the safe side we should finish at all cost, which 
means, that even if it would mean we sit here till 12 
10 
midnight I would still prefer that we do that and then we 
finish and then we come back with a dedicated focus on 
cross-examining Mr McBride.  So that’s just my suggestion, 
of course I’m not a member of the Commission, I’m being 
subjected to it but – it’s a suggesting that I’m making yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, that’s fine, well I think, let’s continue 
and we’ll talk about how long just now, because the 
investigations continue there can never be a guarantee 
that you can’t be asked to come back if there is a reason, 
you know. 
20 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes, if there is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think the idea is, if we can let’s 
see if we can try and finish.  The – so I think, shall we 
continue, you talked about one and a half hours. 
ADV HULLEY:   I spoke of one and a half hours based on 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 75 of 239 
 
my assessment…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja but it could be…[intervenes]. 
ADV HULLEY:   In my own head 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let’s continue and shall we say, I don’t 
know if Mr Notshe is here, on the basis that we were going 
to finish before lunch, there was to be another witness but 
I think that can be sorted out during lunch time.  Let’s 
continue and at 1 o’clock let’s see whether we take the 
lunch break at 1 o’clock, maybe a shorter lunch break or 
whether we take a full hour and then maybe, if need be, we 
10 
continue until, maybe three. 
ADV HULLEY:   Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let’s see how – how would that affect 
your situation Mr Mokhari, is that fine? 
MR MOKHARI:   Chair, all I needed was an indication, I’ll 
move my things so that we can finish today. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MOKHARI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let’s – at this stage we’re going to 
try and finish as early as we can but at the same time, we 
20 
want to do justice to the issues and we are looking at not 
going beyond 3 o’clock, if possible.  
ADV HULLEY:   Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  
ADV HULLEY:   Now of course there’s an additional 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 76 of 239 
 
problem and I want to explore this with you Mr Nhleko, if I 
understood the evidence correctly, based on the docket 
there were at least the DPCI, which is the Hawks may have 
been involved in the investigation in – sorry let me 
rephrase 
that. 
 
May 
have 
been 
implicated 
in 
the 
investigation in respect of the rendition so there was some 
Hawks Officers that were part of the operation and – as 
one of the different units.  Another one was Crime 
Intelligence itself; members of Crime Intelligence were also 
part of the investigation – sorry part of the rendition in the 
10 
sense that they, too had been assisting in the arresting of 
people.  So, the proposition I’m putting to you is that it 
seems to be problematic at least three levels.  One level is 
that 
it 
seems 
that 
Crime 
Intelligence 
is, 
in 
fact, 
investigating Crime Intelligence, that’s quite apart from the 
fact that Crime Intelligence shouldn’t be involved in an 
IPID investigation. 
MR NHLEKO:   It sounds like you are making an 
observation, I mean you are, I suppose, Mr Hulley, you 
know within your right to make such an observation.  I also 
20 
still do think that at an operational level there will be, 
probably, clarity around these questions, the involvement 
of Crime Intelligence, DPCI and whatever else and so on.  
I think people who investigated and other people who 
played a role in the investigation, you know, should be in a 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 77 of 239 
 
position to verify the Commission around these particular 
matters. 
ADV HULLEY:   My question is…[intervenes]. 
MR NHLEKO:   But you are making an observation and that 
observation is an observation sir. 
ADV HULLEY:   No of course but I want to – my 
observation, of course, is meaningless if there’s 
no 
evidence to support it, I really want your comment on that.  
That’s my observation but I’d like to know whether you 
would support that observation, as the Minister of Police?  
10 
That 
if 
Crime 
Intelligence 
or 
members 
of 
Crime 
Intelligence…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You may be able to say, I think it’s a 
legitimate observation, you may say, I don’t think it’s well 
founded because of A, B, C, D or you may say I’m not able 
to comment. 
MR NHLEKO:   Look the – yes, I may not be able to 
comment, largely because, Chair, I wouldn’t know the 
original reasons why, whether they got involved and to 
what extent they got involved so that’s why I will not be 
20 
able to comment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  
MR NHLEKO:   But f you were to ask me, Mr Hulley, and 
I’m not suggesting that he should ask me that question, in 
fact he prohibited Mr Hulley to ask that question, but the 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 78 of 239 
 
point really being here, whether, as a matter of principle is 
it correct for an institution to investigate itself, then I can 
tell you that it is not correct. So – and conceptually that’s a 
different matter altogether, yes so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja well it’s the same point you made 
yesterday that – maybe not the same but it’s related, 
namely, that it wouldn’t be right for IPD …. 
Finish with the following sentence [at 1.00.00] 
CHAIRPERSON:   it wouldn’t be right for IPID to report to 
the 
National 
Commissioner 
because 
the 
National 
10 
Commissioners falls within the jurisdiction of investigation. 
MR NHLEKO:   Ja, it is a standing implicated institution.  
[laughing] 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Sir.  Well the report or rather 
the appointment of Werksmans as I understood it from the 
Terms of Reference and of course please correct me if I am 
wrong but my understanding was that Werksmans was 
supposed to conduct interviews, is that correct? 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes I am listening – I am listening Sir. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Well I am asking if it is correct.  Was it 
20 
your understanding that you wanted Werksmans to conduct 
interviews? 
MR NHLEKO:  Look again that is – that is operational 
detail.  Werksmans were given a set of Terms of Reference.  
Now operationally what it means is that as and when they 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 79 of 239 
 
conducted this work, they would then design their work.  
Okay I would not design work for them for an example. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in other words… 
MR NHLEKO:  So if the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was your position that they should 
conduct an investigation, these are the Terms of Reference, 
how they went about it was up to them? 
MR NHLEKO:  Exactly. It is – because that is operational 
levels so I suppose for an example if you were to say to me 
I must investigate a matter which whatever I would take 
10 
your Terms of Reference and translate them into a work 
plan.  And say this is how I want to go about this and what 
kind of – a definitive kind of approach you know in an 
established kind of standards for an example that I would 
want to follow as an investigator.  But I would not then 
design work for you.  You know in a sense as an entity that 
would be investigated.  Yes.  And maybe just to complete 
that point Chair – I am sorry Mr Hulley.  The Terms of 
Reference who and under which circumstances was the 
original report altered?  And – or how the second report 
20 
came about with both reports signed by the same person ie. 
Mr Khuba?  Whether any misconduct or offence has been 
committed and if so by whom?  [indistinct 01:02:47] whether 
there is a prima facie evidence of misconduct in criminal 
liability by Lieutenant General Dramat, Major General Sibiya 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 80 of 239 
 
and any other officers mentioned in the original report.  
Fourthly the circumstances under which report and the 
docket handed in the NPA and what happened to the docket 
whilst in the NPA possession?  Lastly any other matter that 
might come to your attention during the investigation which 
is relevant to a conclusions and find it.  That is how the 
Terms of Reference were framed.  But then in the report by 
Werksmans they then went into the detailing in terms of how 
they went about their investigation.  They referred to 
interviews, recordings, statements and whatever and so on 
10 
that they collected and so forth.  But that was not 
prescribed by me.  I gave the Terms of Reference.  They 
then designed their work.  Thanks Chair. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
MR NHLEKO:  And thanks Mr Hulley. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So as part of the Terms of Reference 
you say in paragraph 6 Mr Chair for your benefit the 
relevant document is in Bundle LEA2.  And it is an 
annexure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see that my bundles have still not been 
20 
written. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  My sincere apologies Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This one is Bundle LEA? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  LEA2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the one that has got Exhibit 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 81 of 239 
 
[Y8B]? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That is correct Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Has somebody given the witness 
the right bundle?   
MR NHLEKO:  Thank you I follow you.  I am saying I will 
follow you with it but I think I saw it here – it is alright – the 
bundle ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So Mr Chair to be specific it is… 
MR NHLEKO:  It is just that I no longer have sufficient space 
here. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh is that so. 
MR NHLEKO:  That is why I am going to use my ear – yes.  
So it is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can keep it away if you think you can 
follow but as and when you think you need it indicate. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes I will definitely do that ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is alright. 
MR NHLEKO:  So thanks Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright.   
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair the relevant page is 
20 
at page 638 of that bundle.   
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the page number? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  638 Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  638? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That is correct.   
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 82 of 239 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And in paragraph 6 you say to as part of 
your Terms of Reference you say to Werksmans that in your 
investigation you will interview the relevant witnesses at 
your own discretion and have access to all relevant 
documentation including the two reports, the docket and 
witness statements made so far.  So in short, they had to – 
they were required to interview relevant witnesses at their 
discretion in order to complete the task that you had placed 
before them. 
10 
MR NHLEKO:  Right. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And the task that you had placed before 
them and to which you want to then answer was in the 
second instance to determine whether any misconduct or 
offence had been committed and if so by whom.  Now when 
you talk about an offence you referring specifically to a 
criminal offence. 
MR NHLEKO:  Well of – no Mr Hulley offences they are also 
committed at the work place level.  It is an offence not to 
follow of our late policy for instance a workplace policy. So it 
20 
is not only in relation to criminal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you meant both a criminal offence and 
a disciplinary offence? 
MR NHLEKO:  No my focus was the question of… 
CHAIRPERSON:  A disciplinary. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 83 of 239 
 
MR NHLEKO:  Disciplinary worked – the act of misconduct 
what does it then do? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR NHLEKO:  To the image of the institution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And then paragraph 3 or sub-paragraph 
5.3 rather you ask whether there is a prima facie evidence of 
misconduct and criminal liability by Lieutenant General 
Dramat, 
Major 
General 
Sibiya 
and 
any 
other 
officers 
10 
mentioned in the original report.  You see that? 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes I see – I hear that Sir. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So insofar as they were given – given a 
mandate to interview relevant witnesses at their discretion 
they had to determine whether a prima facie evidence of 
misconduct certainly but also criminal liability existed and to 
that extent they were entitled to interview witnesses.  
Correct? 
MR NHLEKO:  That is correct. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now to that extent with respect Mr Chair 
20 
because they would be conducting a criminal investigation 
were they not? 
MR NHLEKO:  No.  I do not think so. I do not think so.  You 
heard the Honourable Chair Mr Hulley you had a report done 
on it that is that said these two individuals are implicated in 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 84 of 239 
 
the commission of [indistinct 01:09:31].  Then you have 
another report the 18 March which then exonerated them and 
pushed them out of this.  Now – so we are then investigating 
firstly – first and foremost why you have this disjuncture 
between the two.  But also, secondly that you also need 
properly view available sort of reports, recommendation and 
whatever else because it is possible that the second report 
may be saying, no we are not liable for criminal prosecution.  
I am just making an example as recommended.  But then 
again Chair the issue that interestingly you raised yesterday 
10 
if you look into the documents that produced the report and 
that is the docket actually there are statements and reports 
that implicate these individuals in wrongdoing.  Right.  So 
that necessarily is not understood as you know a legal firm 
that then is conducting a criminal investigation.  So that is – 
that is a distinction there Mr Hulley. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  No, no I understand you to be saying that 
there was information in the dockets.  There was statements 
that were there and they were certainly entitled to analyse 
those statements that is part of their mandate.  My earlier 
20 
question to you to which I thought I had an affirmative 
answer as far that is concerned i.e. clause 5.3 were they 
also entitled to interview witnesses?  I understood your 
response to be yes.  Did I misunderstand you? 
MR NHLEKO:  I think this point has been canvassed and 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 85 of 239 
 
subsequently sort of responded to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I did not hear that question.  
What was the question? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So the question based on the earlier 
statement clause 5.3 says amongst the issues that need to 
be investigated and to be reported upon as part of the Terms 
of Reference was whether there is a prima facie evidence of 
misconduct and criminal liability by Lieutenant General 
Dramat, 
Major 
General 
Sibiya 
and 
any 
other 
officers 
mentioned in the original report.  Part of their Terms of 
10 
Reference includes a paragraph 6 it says: 
“In 
your 
investigation 
you 
will 
interview 
the 
relevant 
witnesses at your own discretion and have access to all 
relevant documentation including the two reports, the docket 
and witness statements made so far.”   
So the question that I had asked Mr Nhleko earlier was, 
whether in doing so they would be entitled to actually 
interview witnesses in relation to clause 5.3?  I understood 
the answer to that to be yes.  In other words in respect of… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no.  Ja because he said that – he said 
20 
that how they went about the investigation was their 
business. You draw attention to paragraph 6 which said they 
will interview relevant witnesses at their own discretion 
which seems to say the same thing if I am not mistaken.  So 
it seems to me that he contemplated and he can speak for 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 86 of 239 
 
himself but my understanding is that he contemplated that if 
they want to interview witnesses, they – it was up to them. 
MR NHLEKO:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO: Just to clarify this point differently.  You know 
it was critical and important that in the exercise of this work 
that I conducted and asked Werksmans to do the element of 
fairness and being just had to be maintained.  It had to be 
there all the time.  In other words, it would be unheard of 
that you are conducting a – some enquiry of sorts but 
10 
eventually you arrive at a conclusion about somebody whom 
we have not spoken to and find and establish his or her side 
of the story for an example.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR NHLEKO:  You know that is – I do not know what they 
call those kinds of investigations really but it is biased form 
of an approach. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR NHLEKO:  And therefore, in the framing of the Terms of 
Reference it is vital the question of, yes this gentleman 
20 
seated across me here he is implicate – he is said to be 
implicated and they said this and that but let me hear him 
out and so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR NHLEKO:  By so doing you are able to come out with a 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 87 of 239 
 
balanced and an objective product which is then also is 
going to assist me as an employer at the time of course to 
be able to act and act accordingly in following the legal 
prescripts that govern our country and institutions.  So it – I 
think it should be understood in that sort of context also why 
that Term of Reference was included. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it is maybe important to understand 
what the answer you give now does to the earlier answer.  
The earlier answer having been I gave them a mandate how 
they went about their investigation was their business.  
10 
Okay.  But what you have said now seems to emphasise the 
question of interviewing witnesses on the basis that you say 
but it would have been unheard of for them to reach their 
conclusion without having interviewed persons who may be 
implicated. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I think there you are saying those two 
things now of course you might not say anything to them in 
your brief to them or mandate to them about interviewing 
witnesses when your expectation is that they know what they 
20 
are doing and they will make sure that they conduct the 
investigation in a manner that meets basic elementary rules 
of fairness. 
MR NHLEKO:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you might then say, I am not going to 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 88 of 239 
 
mention that because it is to be taken – it is to assumed that 
they will interview them but you may have a situation where 
an interview is not necessary but they send somebody who is 
implicated an invitation to say give us your side of the story 
on writing on this issue and this issue and this issue.  So in 
other words, there might be no interview but still the person 
has been given a chance to put their version. 
MR NHLEKO:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I am just mentioning because the one – 
the latest seemed to emphasise that your expectation was 
10 
that there would be interviews.   
MR NHLEKO:  No.  I am also on the one hand explaining the 
framework and the outlook character wise of the Terms of 
Reference.  You see let us take an example Honourable 
Chair.  The first Term of Reference.  It says who and under 
what circumstances was the original report altered.  Now you 
are not going to work on the basis of a hearsay to answer 
this question.  Right.  It is the same thing and I think 
yesterday I made an example about an allegation that says, 
you have stolen the gold.  The starting point is that yes you 
20 
have that allegation but you want me to know to establish 
the facts whether indeed it did happen.  So I would come to 
you and say to you, Ngobese says you stole his gold.  Do 
you know anything about that, is it true?  I am just making an 
example so that then … 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 89 of 239 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  To say what do you say about this 
allegation? 
MR NHLEKO:  Exactly you know that sort of thing.  So – and 
that approach I am other than fair there and say that 
approach satisfies the rules of fairness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:  And being just.  That is what I will say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Fine. 
MR NHLEKO:  Thanks. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  I understood from 
10 
your testimony yesterday that when Werksmans phoned you 
and said or contacted you in some way and said that they 
are receiving no cooperation.  You then telephoned Mr 
Khuba and said to him you would like him to cooperate or 
you told him to cooperate.  Now my understanding was 
perhaps I am wrong my understanding was that you were 
directing him or instructed him to cooperate.  You were not 
saying to him, out of fairness I would like to afford you the 
opportunity to cooperate. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes but Mr Hulley where do you – how do you 
20 
come to that conclusion?  Maybe just for the benefit of this 
exercise how do you come to the conclusion that your 
understanding was I was instructing him?  Maybe start there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe let us put it this way.  If you 
say I was not instructing him then you have answered the 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 90 of 239 
 
question.  If he has further issues – he has an issue with 
your answer he will follow up.  If not it falls away.   
MR NHLEKO:  Hm.  No Honourable Chair I understand the 
debate also there is cultural conflict here in a sense. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  You know that is a court approach.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  Okay but for me understanding that this in an 
inquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR NHLEKO:  You know it also becomes useful to 
understand an informing state of mind behind a particular 
question and draw a conclusion. I am just making an 
example. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I understand that. 
MR NHLEKO:  You know because I do not want to 
understand Mr Hulley as saying that this is what I said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:  You know so that is why I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe let us do it this way.  Mr Hulley put 
20 
your – the basis for your suggestion to him to say this is 
your suggestion that this was an instruction because based 
on this and then he can respond. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  When I listened to 
your testimony yesterday, I understood you had telephoned 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 91 of 239 
 
him in order to instruct him based on what you had testified 
instructed that he was to cooperate.  I might be – I might be 
wrong about that.  My recollection may be hazy.  But that 
was certainly my understanding.   
MR NHLEKO:  You are correct insofar as yes I did telephone 
him you are correct.  You are incorrect insofar as you 
understood that to mean an instruction.  I requested him to 
cooperate and that is basically it.  Thank you Chair.  And 
may I also that the level of [indistinct 01:22:16] has improved 
a little bit.  No it is a little bit better.  As to whether it is 
10 
comfortable as to the same extent as the Chair where he is 
seated and so on that is a different matter too. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I can tell you that it is only in my legs 
that I feel some warmth.  On my upper body I feel quite cold 
as well.  Yes okay alright thank you.  Yes Mr Hulley. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  May I ask this while Mr Hulley is looking 
for something.  In the Terms of Reference was there – was 
there any reason why under 5.3 you do not have to look I will 
tell you what it says why it was necessary to specify the 
20 
names of Lieutenant General Dramat and Major General 
Sibiya where you say Werksmans had to determine whether 
– or investigate whether there is prima facie evidence of 
misconduct and criminal liability by Lieutenant General 
Dramat, 
Major 
General 
Sibiya 
and 
any 
other 
officers 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 92 of 239 
 
mentioned in the original report.  As opposed to simply 
saying that to investigate whether there is prima facie 
evidence of misconduct and criminal liability by any officers 
mentioned in the report.  Was there a particular reason why 
the two were specifically mentioned by name? 
MR NHLEKO:  You know I suppose it is an explicitly in a 
sense because the bone of contention was the basis of 
contention here was the question of the two reports and 
subsequently 
the 
recommendations. 
 
One 
set 
of 
recommendations with explicitly the names of the individuals 
10 
that 
the 
Chair 
has 
referred 
to. 
 
The 
other 
set 
of 
recommendation this other end of the second – so called 
second report those things have not been taken out and so 
on.  So I suppose that is the reason why it was there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was the reason ja. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes that was the reason why two – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I do not know if Mr Hulley covered 
this but let me ask.  Bearing in mind your evidence that the 
area 
where 
you 
were 
to 
make 
decisions 
related 
to 
disciplinary matters and not to crime the NPA would decide 
20 
matters of crime. 
MR NHLEKO:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why was it not enough in 5.3 in the Terms 
of Reference to say they must investigate whether there was 
prima facie evidence of misconduct?  Because is it not 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 93 of 239 
 
anything that is a crime would fall under misconduct as well 
or would it not? 
MR NHLEKO:  No but the point Chair is there is no way you 
will be responsible for a policy portfolio and not be 
concerned with a situation where your officers are implicated 
in crime. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR NHLEKO:  There is absolutely no way.  I think you will 
be totally sort of remiss in your responsibility not to be 
concerned about that.  Much as you are not the prosecution 
10 
authority for an example but you know from just your both 
constitutional and institutional duty you should be concerned 
about this you know.  And I think as a matter of fact I think if 
– remember it is their workplace right?  They have got to 
uphold the law at all material times. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR NHLEKO:  Follow policy to the letter and so forth.  They 
have to be the face of the institution but also being – they 
have to be the face of our constitution and the ultimate 
outlook of our society.  Okay.  Now – but then you have this 
20 
allegation that this officer is involved in crime in the 
commission of crime right?   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR NHLEKO:  So indeed, that does something to the 
reputation of the institution. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 94 of 239 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR NHLEKO:  Okay and of course you will not necessarily 
prosecute this employee on the basis that you committed 
ABC which falls under criminal activity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you want to know. 
MR NHLEKO:  But you want to know and if that has 
happened it is a disrepute to the image of the institution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
10 
MR NHLEKO:  Thanks Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Hulley. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  Could I ask you to 
turn with me to Bundle LEA7.   
MR NHLEKO:  Yes go ahead Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay he has got it. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  It is  
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry what… 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I believe it is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry what did you say? 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  It is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Bundle? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  It is Bundle Y – sorry LEA7 Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it the one marked Y8[H]? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  It is.  Sorry Y8[G] pardon me Mr Chair.  It

Page 95 of 239 
 
is Y8[G].   
CHAIRPERSON:  LEA? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  LEA7 Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Bundle LEA7 okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That is correct.  And the specific exhibit 
is Y8[U].  It is at page 300 and 3342 Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  3000? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  342. 
CHAIRPERSON:  3342? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That is correct Mr Chair.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  This is an affidavit by Mr Nhleko.  Can I 
ask you Mr Nhleko if you would turn with me to page 3347 of 
that document? 
CHAIRPERSON:  LEA? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  LEA(7) Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Bundle LEA(7).  Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That is correct.  And the specific exhibit 
is Y8U.  It is at page 3342 Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Three thousand...? 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  342. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Three, three, four, two? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That is correct Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  This is an affidavit by Mr Nhleko.  Can I 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 96 of 239 
 
ask you Mr Nhleko if you can turn with to page 3347 of that 
document? 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  3347 Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay, just to place on record.  That 
is the... that is an affidavit by the witness dealing with 
allegations by Mr Khuba starting... it starts at 3342.  You say 
we must go to 3347? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That is correct Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, continue. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:  The signature on page 3347 sir, is that 
your signature? 
MR NHLEKO:  I seem to have a... I do have a 3347 but I am 
not following the page. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Right... at the top right of the corner, 
page 3347. 
MR NHLEKO:  Right. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  3347. 
MR NHLEKO:  I was ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  It is somewhere towards the right towards 
20 
the end if it is the... if you have got the right one. 
MR NHLEKO:  Ja.  No, no, no.  I am getting thirty, forty-
seven.  In fact, I think I was there and I saw something else.   
CHAIRPERSON:  My concern is that you ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:  The very last page or the very last 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 97 of 239 
 
document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  My concern is that you are at the 
beginning of the bundle whereas this page is one of the last 
ones in the bundle. 
MR NHLEKO:  Thirty, forty-seven. 
CHAIRPERSON:  3347. 
MR NHLEKO:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  3347. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  I am sorry.  Referring to his... are you 
referring to the affidavit of Friday? 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That is right. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  Yes.  So that is the Friday affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR NHLEKO:  Thirty-three, forty-seven? 
CHAIRPERSON:  3347. 
MR NHLEKO:  Where did I get the zero from?  The other day 
it was 3047. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It must be Mr Hulley’s pronunciation.  Mr 
Hulley. [laughs] 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Yes, Chair.  [laughs] 
20 
MR NHLEKO:  [Indistinct] educated Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  3347. 
MR NHLEKO:  3347. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, 3347.  Ja, okay. 
MR NHLEKO:  No thanks.  And thanks and apologies Mr 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 98 of 239 
 
Hulley to get this thing right. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Is that your signature sir? 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes, that is my signature sir. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And this is an affidavit that you have 
deposed to on the 24t h of July 2020.  Is that correct? 
MR NHLEKO:  That is very correct sir. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now I would like you to turn with me and 
if you will go to paragraph... to page 3345 paragraph 7? 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  You say: 
10 
“I confirm calling Mr Khuba.  This was after I had 
been made aware by Werksmans that he was not 
cooperating with them. 
It is clear from the above exchange between the 
Chairperson and Mr Khuba that the purpose of my 
call to him was to entrust him to cooperate with the 
Werksmans in their investigation.  Nothing more and 
nothing less...” 
MR NHLEKO:  H’m? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So you say that the purpose of the call 
20 
was to instruct him to cooperate.  Is that correct? 
MR NHLEKO:  It is clear from the above exchange between 
the chairperson...  Who is the chairperson? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  The Chairperson before you today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That paragraph comes after ...[intervenes]  
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 99 of 239 
 
MR NHLEKO:  Did that not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  That paragraphs of your affidavit comes 
after the quotation of Mr Khuba’s evidence in... from the 
transcript, I think. 
MR NHLEKO:  No, but where does it say that he instructed 
him?  Because it is a reference to an exchange between the 
Chairperson for the Commission and Mr Khuba. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Look at the.... look at the second line of 
paragraph 7 second sentence.  It says: 
“It is clear from the above exchange between the 
10 
Chairperson and Mr Khuba that the purpose of my 
call to him was to instruct him to cooperate with 
Werksmans in the investigation.  Nothing more and 
nothing less.   
So I find it rather curious that despite Mr Khuba 
stating categorically that I did not propose that I meet 
with him in Cape Town but that it was my PA that 
proposed the Chairperson continue to speculate that 
I wanted Mr Khuba to come to Cape Town to meet 
with me...” 
20 
 
Well, you have not been asked about the second and the 
last sentence.  You have been asked about the one before 
but I was reading just in case there is something there. 
MR NHLEKO:  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:  So.  [laughs]  I am not going to say 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 100 of 239 
 
anything about it.   
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:  No, I do not know if my request was 
understood as an instruction.  Maybe ...[indistinct] but the 
point is, I asked him to cooperate with the investigation. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now but let us get back to page 638. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, maybe before you go.  That is why 
Mr Hulley and ...[indistinct]  It is not... this sentence does 
not say Mr Khuba understood what you said to him as an 
10 
instruction.   
 
It is you speaking, saying the purpose... saying “it is 
clear from the above exchange that is between me and Mr 
Khuba” that the purpose of your call to him was to instruct 
him to cooperate with Werksmans. 
 
In other words, if what you have just said after we 
looked at the sentence, suggests that... you were suggesting 
that if what you said was understood as an instruction. 
 
So I am saying but you are the one speaking in this 
sentence saying “it is clear from the exchange between 
20 
myself and Khuba” that the purpose of your call was to 
instruct him. 
 
And you continue to say, “nothing more, nothing less”.  
So the sentence does not say Khuba said, “he understood 
that I was instructing him but actually he is mistaken now.  I 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 101 of 239 
 
was not instructing him”. 
 
As you are saying the exchange reveals that “the 
purpose of my call was to instruct him and nothing more and 
nothing less”. 
MR NHLEKO:  H’m?  No, that is fine.  I know ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  You know?  Okay.  Alright.   
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Hulley? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair.  If we can then go 
back to the Terms of Reference which appears in Bundle 
10 
LM2 and to page 638 of that bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page should we go to? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  638 Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Six-hundred...? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Six, three, eight. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Six, three, eight.  Yes? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair.  These are the 
Terms of Reference sir.  And I want to just pick up on the 
distinction that you have made with reference to an offence.  
You said that you acknowledge that an offence might refer to 
20 
a criminal offence but you said your focus was really on 
misconduct for purposes of disciplinary processes.  Is that 
correct? 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes, that is correct sir. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now, I just want to understand... if you 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 102 of 239 
 
can read... read that sentence to me again, paragraph 5.2 
and then reconsider your answer. 
MR NHLEKO:  Which says “whether there is a prima facie 
evidence ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:  5.2. 
MR NHLEKO:  What does it say?  How does it start?  I am 
...[indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:  “Were there any mis ...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:  Ja. 
“Were there any misconduct or offence has been 
10 
committed, and if so, by whom?...” 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So what you are suggesting is that 
sentence as you understood it or what you had intended to 
convey was “whether any misconduct or misconduct(sic) has 
been committed, and if so, by whom.”  Is that what you are 
saying? 
MR NHLEKO:  It says, “whether any misconduct or offence, 
and if so, by who?” 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So clearly you are drawing a distinction 
between misconduct, which is of a disciplinary nature as 
20 
between employer and employee, and an offence, which is of 
a criminal nature which may involve another person or it 
may... but is a matter for the Law Enforcement Agencies.  
Would that be fair to say? 
MR NHLEKO:  No, it is not fair.  Because you could also use 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 103 of 239 
 
the term offence as a matter of emphases. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Sorry, I do not follow what you are 
saying. 
MR NHLEKO:  I am saying Chair you could... or use the term 
offence as a matter of emphases, misconduct and/or offence.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well ...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:  But it is... it does not suggest that the... 
because once you... once you want to suggest that the 
usage 
of 
the 
term 
offence 
applies 
only 
to 
criminal 
investigations, I think that is incorrect. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I will tell you what I expected your answer 
to be.  Based on what you said with regard to 5.3 where you 
have a reference with misconduct and criminal liability and 
based on what you said why you would nevertheless be 
interested to know whether a member of the police service 
had committed a crime.   
 
Based on that, I would imagine that when in 5.2 you talk 
about misconduct and offence, it would fit within that 
understanding.   
 
You want to know if there is misconduct committed by 
20 
member of the police service.  Misconduct which is not a 
crime.   
 
But you are also interested to know if there is a criminal 
offence that has been committed by the police service.  In 
other words, you are not confining yourself to disciplinary 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 104 of 239 
 
misconduct only.   
 
You are also interested in knowing whether a member of 
the police service has committed a criminal offence.  So to 
me it seems that this is what I would expect you to say, 
giving the answer you gave earlier on. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes.  Look, I accept that Chair.  That is also 
one way of looking at it.  But you also earlier made a point 
and I have said every workplace is governed by a set of 
policies and rules and regulations.   
 
But also, an offence can be committed at a workplace 
10 
level.  For instance, ...[indistinct] a certain fact.  Whether it 
could be criminal or purely an issue of misconduct.   
 
So from not sort of general understanding point of view, 
I also think the usage and the application of the term offence 
should not be construed necessarily to mean criminal 
investigation, you know.   
 
As much as the Chair is correct in respect of this 
particular specific matter relating to the mere fact that there 
was a criminal investigation conducted and one report said 
this and the other report said that and so on.   
20 
 
So I accept that but I am also broadening it out as I 
believe such a type of an offence does not necessarily mean 
that if anybody says, “Ja, but it is an offence for you to do 
this”, then that would mean you have committed a crime or 
something. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 105 of 239 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not thing we should spend too much 
time ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  ...on this but I think the reason was simple 
because when you say misconduct, that would cover a 
certain category, where you say offence, it might mean 
whatever is not covered under misconduct might fall under 
offence. 
MR NHLEKO:  H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
10 
MR NHLEKO:  Okay.  No, thanks Chair. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair.  And of course, 
what you must bear in mind is that when this matter have 
been handed over to Werksmans pursuant to this term... to 
these terms of reference that you have outlined here, 
General Dramat had already been suspended some two-and-
a-half months before that.  Is that correct? 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes, I hear you. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And here we are asking him to 
investigate the very issue that he had already taken a 
20 
decision on.   
MR NHLEKO:  And what was that decision Mr Hulley? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That he should be suspended. 
MR NHLEKO:  H’m. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Because ...[intervenes]  
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 106 of 239 
 
MR NHLEKO:  Let me come into this because I think the... 
and sometimes ...[indistinct] the Honourable Chair strange 
that even lawyers, they miss the point when it comes to this 
issue of the suspension.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:  In fact, the correct term in the public service 
context is pre-cautionary suspension.  And all it does really, 
it says as so and so, there are these allegations that are 
levelled against you and we, in other words as the employer, 
would like to have an opportunity to investigate these 
10 
matters further.   
 
But in so doing, they should not be an element of 
interference and/or perceived interference, you know.  So we 
are also addressing the issue of perception.  So which 
means, there is no decision against you in relation to the 
alleged violation.   
 
It is just for the employer to establish facts around this 
and then take it on from there, whether or not and whatever.  
But for some strange reason, many people including legal 
practitioners have begun to understand suspension is a 
20 
punitive measure when it is not.   
 
In fact, suspension also deals with the question of even 
protecting the same employee.  So I will give you an 
example.  I am working for the Commission which I truly 
hope never happens.  But I am making an example Chair, 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 107 of 239 
 
that I work for this Commission but reverend... I think there 
is a Reverend Stimela. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Reverend Stimela. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes.  Is a co-worker with me.  So but the 
allegation involve our unit, whatever our unit is within the 
Commission together with Reverend Stimela.   
 
Now and the allegations, it is me who are facing them.  
If I am not removed from the workplace for a further... for 
investigation to take place, it is likely that when I come in 
one day and I have a sour face, you know, and I look at 
10 
Reverend Stimela.   
 
Reverend Stimela could easily turn around and say, 
“Hey, hey, hey”.  And then in which this gentleman looked at 
me, I can realise he is really up in arms against me because 
he is being investigated and so forth.   
 
So it is also about isolating the very same employee not 
be subjected to a what?... unnecessary negative sort of 
perceptions even at a workplace level.   
 
But similarly, you would also have to protect the 
institutional process and information as well, amongst other 
20 
things.  So there is no pollution that takes place there.   
 
So that is how it has got to be understood.  So I am 
raising this point because the manner in which Mr Hulley is 
raising this issue, embraces this negative concept or 
definition of this concept of suspension which seem to have 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 108 of 239 
 
taken a route out there in society that if you suspend any... 
somebody it is because that person is guilty of anything.  It 
is not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Hulley. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair.  If I can move on.  
The ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe you... before you move on, let me 
put this to you Mr Nhleko.  My understanding is that most if 
not all suspensions... maybe I should stay with most and not 
go to all.   
10 
 
Most suspensions, whether you are talking about the 
private 
sector 
or 
the 
public 
sector, 
suspensions 
of 
employees are not based on any finding that has already 
made that the employee is guilty.   
 
They are affected to allow some form of investigation to 
take place before... to take place before a decision is made 
whether the employee should be charge with misconduct or 
not.   
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sometimes they happen at a time when the 
20 
investigation has taken place but the hearing, disciplinary 
hearing and a decision to charge the employee has been 
taken but there are... there is going to be some time before 
the hearing actually starts and the employee is suspended. 
 
The decision whether the employee is guilty or not would 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 109 of 239 
 
be taken by the chairperson of the disciplinary inquiry in due 
course.   
 
So but nevertheless, there is a general, I think, 
understanding within the public sector and maybe the private 
sector, I am not sure, that before you affect even that 
suspension, you as the employer would need to be of the 
prima facie view that there may be something that the 
employee is guilty of.   
 
Because otherwise, if you think there is no basis for this 
allegation 
you 
would 
not 
go 
that 
far. 
 
That 
is 
my 
10 
understanding of the situation. 
MR NHLEKO:  No, but if you had to do that Chair, whilst I 
agree largely with what you have just said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:  If you were to assume guilt before the 
investigation that would be unfair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well ...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:  So that is why I am saying, in the public 
service generally, at least wherever I have worked, it is 
important to emphasise pre-cautionary suspension because 
20 
the emphases on precautionary, all it does is it then says, 
“Look, we want to have an opportunity to have... to explore 
this matter further and so on.  And we do not want you to be 
perceived negatively internally within the institution, nor do 
we want also to experience as an institution, for instance a 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 110 of 239 
 
situation where there is interference with the information that 
we require for purposes of investigation”. 
 
I am also aware, because I think the Chair has also, you 
know, broaden this... eluded to.  I am aware also that in 
other 
institutions 
there 
is 
a 
sentence 
of 
suspending 
somebody without pay for a particular duration, you know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We just separate. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes, we just separate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:  But that is after a disciplinary process would 
10 
have, you know, ensued and so on.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, and the point you make is that the 
suspension you talk about in the public sector and the 
suspension we are talking about here in regard to General 
Dramat, was a pre-cautionary. 
MR NHLEKO:  Pre-cautionary, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not a punitive one after a hearing. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes, Chair.  Thanks. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair.  Now ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, I see we are at one o’clock.  Is 
everybody amenable that we take a shorter lunch break like 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 111 of 239 
 
this? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Will that be fine Mr Nhleko?  Will that fine? 
MR NHLEKO:  Oh, no.  I am ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  You are fine? 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes ...[indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  There are two motions.  Either we would 
move now up to one and then we take the lunch break or we 
take the lunch break now and come back at half-past one.  Is 
there any particular preference? 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Perhaps we should take the lunch break 
now Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I would imagine that it would be suitable 
for Mr Mokhari because I suspect we are going to go into his 
first appointment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay let us take the lunch break now 
then and then we will resume at half-past one.  Okay we 
adjourn. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you. 
20 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS: 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
ADV HULLEY SC:   The understanding that there is at 
least prima facie case against the employee, would that be 
correct? 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 112 of 239 
 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes, precautionary suspension is on full 
pay, full benefits, with the exception that you would not be 
allowed to report for duty and you may have to surrender 
certain items belonging to the employer for – maybe those 
things will also be subjected to the same investigation and 
so on. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   The point I am making is that you must 
be satisfied at the very least that the person that there is 
prima facie case against the person, is that correct? 
MR NHLEKO:   That is correct. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So against that backdrop, what was the 
purpose – because according to your terms of reference 
you have instructed Werksmans to conduct an assessment 
or to conduct a process, they are entitled to interview 
witnesses in order to establish whether there is a prima 
facie case against General Dramat and Sibiya. 
MR 
NHLEKO: 
 
 
Look 
that 
work 
was 
also 
running 
concurrently, it is  - if, for instance, what I said was I am 
putting you on suspension but I am also instituting an 
investigation so the investigation by Werksmans, it is part 
20 
of a – it is part of this work that needed to happen.   
 
Now remember that – I think I must have also 
indicated that in the letter that I sent to General Dramat 
and others, that the precautionary suspension, I think in 
the public services defined within 60 to 90 days, something 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 113 of 239 
 
like that.   
So it was my intention that within a shorter period 
as much as possible of about 60 to 90 days you cannot 
keep the fate of a human individual hanging in the air 
because, I think, Chair, as I had alluded to earlier on that 
some of the things that concerned me, not only just with 
the police but also 
even in some of the areas in 
government wherever worked, is the question of, you know, 
somebody who stays at home for two years on suspension, 
four years on suspension, seven years on suspension and 
10 
so on, it does not make sense.   
 
So it is the swiftness that is necessary in regard to 
cases such as this and that is why it was important that 
you 
put 
somebody 
on 
suspension 
but 
start 
your 
investigation so that you establish the facts within the 
shorter period of time as possible. 
 
If there is nothing to be pursued in regard to the 
person that you have put on suspension, that person 
comes back to work but if there are matters that have got 
to 
be 
pursued 
then 
you 
subject 
that 
person 
to 
a 
20 
disciplinary process. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
MR NHLEKO:   Thank you. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now you obtained the Werksmans’ 
report sometime in late April of 2015, is that correct? 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 114 of 239 
 
MR NHLEKO:   Maybe, I have not checked the date. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   If you would turn with me to EXHIBIT – 
bundle 
LEA1, 
Mr 
Chair, 
and 
the 
specific 
exhibit 
is 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   LEA1? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   That is correct, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I have got LEA1.  Yes? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And this is EXHIBIT Y8A.  You have 
attached to that – your affidavit, you have attached the 
Werksmans’ report. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page did you say? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   The specific page number is page 187, 
Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say 187? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   187. 
CHAIRPERSON:   87? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   87, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, the last page of... 
ADV HULLEY SC:   It is the very last page of the 
Werksmans’ report. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of the Werksmans’ report.  Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   It is dated the 24 April 2015.  Now that 
is approximately when you would have received it, is that 
correct? 
MR NHLEKO:   Ja, as I said, Mr Hulley, it is – whether it 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 115 of 239 
 
was this date or soon thereafter, I would not know, but I 
would not have the specifics of it. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And then arising out of that report, you 
have now received the report, arising out of it, I would 
imagine that you would considered the report, satisfied 
yourself as to its contents, the implications, would that be 
correct? 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And you would then have taken the 
decision about what to do with the report, is that correct? 
10 
MR NHLEKO:   Correct. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now we know that a criminal 
investigation 
was 
then 
instituted 
against 
Mr 
Robert 
McBride, Mr Sesoko and Mr Khuba, is that correct? 
MR NHLEKO:   Ja, I heard about them. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And the Werksmans’ report had made a 
recommendation that a criminal prosecution should be – or 
that a criminal case should be opened against them, is that 
right?  Well, perhaps we should read the report to be of 
assistance rather than to misquote. Let us turn to page 186 
20 
of that bundle.  Look at paragraph 6.4.5. It says: 
“In the absence of any information as to which of 
the three cosignatories were responsible for the 
deletion of information from the first report, we 
recommend that Khuba, McBride and Sesoko be 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 116 of 239 
 
charged criminally for defeating the ends of justice 
or obstructing the administration of justice and that 
disciplinary charges be brought against them in 
their capacities as employees.” 
As a fact they were charged criminally, is that right? 
MR NHLEKO:   No, I heard about them being charged, yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Well, were you the impetus or were 
you the basis upon which – or let me rephrase that, did you 
open a charge against them? 
MR NHLEKO:   No, I do not run criminal investigations, sir. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Pardon me? 
MR NHLEKO:   I did not run criminal investigations, in my 
capacity then as Minister. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   No, no, fair enough, but I think 
anybody can open a criminal case.  So the question to you 
is not …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess the question is did you lay a 
complaint that led to their criminal prosecution? 
MR NHLEKO:   No, I think what must have happened is 
that 
the 
Werksmans 
– 
I 
nearly 
said 
Worksmen 
20 
Compensation.   
CHAIRPERSON:   The Werksmans Attorneys. 
MR NHLEKO:   The Workmen’s Compensation, there used 
to be something like that at some point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 117 of 239 
 
MR NHLEKO:   But the Werksmans’ investigation report, it 
made a variety of recommendations, so must have referred 
it to different sort of limits also to look at areas that were 
relevant and/or applicable to them or something, yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   In fact, if you will turn with me to 
bundle LEA7.  Are you moving on to another point or are 
you still …[intervenes] 
ADV HULLEY SC:   It is the same point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   We are just exploring something 
10 
further, Mr Chair.  If you would …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   It is at page 3211. 
CHAIRPERSON:   3211? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   That is correct, Mr Chair, it is part of a 
docket and it is EXHIBIT Y8G. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   If you can turn, Mr Nhleko, to page 
3211.  Do you have the document? 
MR NHLEKO:   No, I am following you, though.  So if you 
20 
can just read it out to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think he will be able to follow you. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair, this is a sworn 
statement by a certain Lieutenant Colonel Gwayi. 
MR NHLEKO:   Wine? 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 118 of 239 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Gwayi, I think.  I am just mentioning, 
putting it that way in case if it is pronounced in the way 
that I think it may – might be – it s just that I do not know 
whether it is isiZulu or not but if it is isiZulu it would be 
Gwayi. 
MR NHLEKO:   Oh, okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But it might not be isiZulu so... But you 
may or may not know who the person is so I thought you 
10 
might know whether you know the person. 
MR NHLEKO:   Oh, I thought Mr Hulley was just mentioning 
that there is this statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MR NHLEKO:   But I have not heard the question, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now the sworn statement particularly 
seems to be – it is marked as A1 in the docket which from 
the instructions that I have received means that it is the 
very first statement in the docket, it is the statement 
20 
usually of the complaint, that is the statement that gives 
rise to the charge sheet or rather to the docket being 
opened. 
MR NHLEKO:   No, I hear you and I am following, sir. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now he says in paragraph 3 of his 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 119 of 239 
 
statement, he says: 
“I have duly mandated to depose to…” 
Well, he actually says dispose but I imagine he intended to 
say: 
“…depose to this affidavit by the Acting National 
Head of the DPCI, General Berning Ntlemeza in my 
capacity as the office manager in the office of the 
National Head DPCI.  My duties entail, among other 
functions, dealing with the correspondence that 
needs the attention of the National Head or has 
10 
been dealt with by the National Head DPCI.  During 
the performance of my duties I have on the 8 May 
2015 received correspondence from Ministry of 
Police as signed by the honourable Minister of 
Police, Mr N P T Nhleko to the effect of submission 
of the report compiled by the Werksmans’ IPID 
investigation 
commission 
into 
Zimbabwean 
Renditions.  The report, therefore, elucidates some 
inconsistencies relating to two reports associated o 
a 
single 
IPID 
investigation 
on 
the 
issue 
of 
20 
Zimbabwean 
Nationals 
that 
were 
subjected 
to 
rendition thus giving rise to an investigation of 
perjury, corruption and defeating the ends of justice 
by either the IPID deponents that were interviewed, 
compilers of first and second IPID reports.” 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 120 of 239 
 
Now are you familiar with the background leading up to this 
docket being opened? 
MR NHLEKO:   No, I am not, there is something that you 
read out there which I find strange.  I mean, I would not 
write as Minister of Police to somebody that I do not know 
and somebody who is not the duly delegated person of the 
institution in question.  So I would not do that, so the 
person who deposed that affidavit, you said it is a Mr or Ms 
Wayi? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Gwayi. 
10 
MR NHLEKO:   I would not know that person. 
ADV 
HULLEY 
SC: 
 
 
Well, 
the 
person 
is 
saying 
…[intervenes] 
MR NHLEKO:   So the person say I wrote to him or her, is 
it not? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   He says: 
“During the performance of my duties I have on the 
8 May 2015 received correspondence from Ministry 
of Police as signed by the honourable Minister of 
Police, Mr N P T Nhleko to the effect of submission 
20 
of the report compiled by the Werksmans’ IPID 
investigation 
commission 
into 
Zimbabwean 
Renditions.” 
MR NHLEKO:   Honourable Chair, there is something 
wrong 
with 
this 
formulation 
because 
there 
is 
a 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 121 of 239 
 
presupposition that I must have written to this individual. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, certainly what …[intervenes] 
MR NHLEKO:   Unless this person says …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   What this individual suggests is that 
there is correspondence that came from you, whether it 
was directed to him or to somebody else but he refers to 
correspondence from you. 
MR NHLEKO:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I am not sure if it is clear whether 
the correspondence was directed to him or to somebody 
10 
else but he refers to some correspondence from you. 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes.  Unless it is somebody who introduces 
himself or herself, let us say as registry clerk or somebody 
who receives correspondence and says this is what I have 
received from …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, he occupies – he does not occupy, 
I think – I think he is some – is he a Lieutenant Colonel? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Mr Chair, if you would consider the last 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, his is a Lieutenant Colonel in the 
20 
South 
African 
Police 
stationed 
at 
DPCI 
investigation 
offices in Silverton Pretoria at that time. 
MR NHLEKO:   Ja.  I do not know, I think it is something 
that would have to be …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would you like to see the particular 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 122 of 239 
 
…[intervenes] 
MR NHLEKO:   No, it actually does not matter, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR NHLEKO:   It is just that I think it is something that 
requires further clarification at a later point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:   Because there is no way that I would write 
to somebody who is not the head of the institution. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   I do not think it is …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well what – it may be that you wrote to 
10 
the head of DPCI but – and that correspondence was in the 
file that was given to this person for purposes of [inaudible 
– speaking simultaneously] 
MR NHLEKO:   Supposedly by the head of DPCI, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  That is possible. I do not know 
whether 
Mr 
Hulley 
would 
[inaudible 
– 
speaking 
simultaneously] as well. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes, I can be of assistance in that 
respect.  If we could turn to page 3209, which is two pages 
before that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   3209, yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  This is the letter 
that he is referring to which is a letter dated the 8 May 
2015 which has your name at the bottom and he has 
addressed to the Acting Head of the DPCI, General 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 123 of 239 
 
Ntlemeza, and it reads: 
“As the Minister of Police, I commissioned an 
investigation into the existence of a so-called two 
IPID 
investigation 
reports 
on 
renditions 
of 
Zimbabwean Nationals.  Such an investigation was 
concluded by Werksmans Attorney on the 24 April 
2015.  This report is therefore referred to you for 
your consideration as it implicates some officials of 
the DPCI.” 
MR NHLEKO:   Okay.  
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   That is the document. 
MR NHLEKO:   Okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So that makes sense? 
MR NHLEKO:   Ja, I seem to be – no, I seem to be having 
at least some sense, an administrative sense of perhaps 
what might have happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR NHLEKO:   It is just that earlier on, Chair, it sounded 
like I must have written to this Mr Wayi or Ms Wayi.  And 
that was my confusion then, but I am clarified, thanks. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Well, what I was trying to ascertain is 
this was written to General Ntlemeza because it concerned 
the officers under his command or people within his area 
under the DPCI, correct? 
MR NHLEKO:   Correct. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 124 of 239 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:   It says that it implicates some officials 
of the DPCI.  Specifically, it seems to be referring to, 
amongst others, General Dramat, General Sibiya, correct? 
MR NHLEKO:   Ja, I will take your formulation, ja, amongst 
others. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   I think there may also be a certain 
Captain Maluleke. 
MR NHLEKO:   Right. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   But those would be the three people 
from the DPCI who had been implicated in the Werksmans’ 
10 
report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just one second, Mr Hulley, you say we 
aim to try and finish at – or I did say we will try and finish 
at three.  Mr Mokhari had indicated yesterday that his re-
examination should not be longer than 30 minutes.  May I 
just find out whether that is still the position?  He agrees.  
So it seems that you may have to aim to finish not later 
than half past two. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.   
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now what I am trying to understand is 
how the – the people who were implicated over here and 
the purpose of the report related, of course, to the DPCI, it 
was given to them for their purposes and if you are not in a 
position to assist us of course by all means say so but I am 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 125 of 239 
 
trying to understand how we went from that to a criminal 
investigation that is open against IPID officials.  If you can 
be of assistance. 
MR NHLEKO:   No, I think, Mr Hulley, I would not be able 
to assist you there.  Ja, I would not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can I take you back while Mr Hulley is 
looking at something, to the decisions that you may have 
made with regard to – or arising from the Werksmans’ 
report.  Did you make any decision of a disciplinary nature 
arising out of that report and, if so, in regard to whom?  
10 
Like deciding to suspend or that somebody must be – must 
face a disciplinary hearing, must face disciplinary charges.  
Did you make any decisions like that arising – based on 
that report? 
MR NHLEKO:   Amongst others I think it was certainly the 
suspension of Mr McBride arising …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of Mr McBride? 
MR NHLEKO:   Of Mr McBride, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR NHLEKO:   Arising out of that very same report. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:   Then, of course, I think the relevant levels 
of authority then dealt with others but at my level 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 126 of 239 
 
MR NHLEKO:   ..it was the question of Mr McBride, I think, 
out of that report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So in terms of any decision to 
suspend anybody arising out of that report, the only 
decision to suspend somebody that you took based on that 
report was to suspend Mr McBride. 
MR NHLEKO:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But he was only one in terms of the 
decision to suspend by yourself, not by somebody else. 
MR NHLEKO:   No, he was suspended by myself, yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, okay.  Mr Khuba and Mr Sesoko 
would have been suspended by somebody else. 
MR NHLEKO:   By somebody else, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja.  And in terms of whether any 
criminal investigation should be pursued, did you make any 
decision - now I accept that you are not the prosecutors, 
you are not in the NPA. 
MR NHLEKO:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But did you make any decision along the 
lines that the criminal justice system must – here is the 
20 
report, they must make whatever decision they might wish 
to make. 
MR NHLEKO:   Look, the report, Chair, referred to different  
sort of arms within the police service.  They also needed to 
read it, analyse it on the basis of their area of function. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 127 of 239 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:   And then decide what it is that would need 
to happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:   And I happy that the Chair qualifies this 
point that, you know, of course, I have got nothing to do 
with the NPA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:   But also, the NPA itself, will not on the 
basis of merely a report out there in public then decide no, 
10 
we are prosecuting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, make their own decision. 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes, yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:   So the arms of investigations such as the 
police, whichever level it would be, would then be involved 
to look into that 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:   And then look at how they work with the 
NPA. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:   In the construction of charges, if any. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Let us talk about your 
decision to suspend Mr McBride.  Mr McBride was not a 
signatory to the first report, is that right?   
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 128 of 239 
 
MR NHLEKO:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He was not a signatory to the first 
report. 
MR NHLEKO:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Indeed, the first report had been given 
to the NPA before he joined IPID. 
MR NHLEKO:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Now what was your understanding 
of what you thought he had done wrong even if that was 
not a final determination, just prima facie, that really 
10 
needed to be investigated given that he signed the second 
report only and had not been there – he had not expressed 
or associated himself in any way with any views or analysis 
that may have been part of the first report on 22 January 
because he was not part of IPID at that time.   
 
So 
up 
to 
a 
certain 
point 
I 
do 
have 
some 
understanding of concern in relation to Mr Khuba, who has 
signed the first report which said one thing and signed the 
second report which said something contradictory, but I am 
not sure that I understand in regard to Mr Sesoko and Mr 
20 
McBride who only signed one report, namely the final 
report. 
 
So you, being the person who made the decision to 
suspend Mr McBride, I am trying – I would like you to 
assist me to understand in your own mind what did you see 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 129 of 239 
 
as prima facie wrong as far as he was concerned? 
MR NHLEKO:   Honourable Chair, two things.  The first 
one is that the contention here is not about signing, okay, 
it is not about signing.  And, of course, you know, it is a 
different set of a debate in terms of regulations and 
applicable laws and whatever, whatever, that is a different 
thing.  But you know what we seem to be forgetting is that 
we are all governed by principles of accountability.   
For an example, if I were to follow the analogy by 
the Chair, it would also apply to me to then say what do I 
10 
have to do with the generation of a report by the Civilian 
Secretariat for Police which was done in 2012 because I 
was not there, I only became Minister in 2014.  So which 
would mean any other work done before I came in, it is 
what I do not inherit, you know, I do not identify with it.  In 
fact, I do not even want it.  Government cannot work like 
that so I am just saying …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:    No, no, I do not think it is the same 
thing, maybe let me take you one step further.  What do 
you say to the proposition that says as far as Mr McBride 
20 
was concerned, he had regard to whatever he had regard 
to and came to the conclusion that the report that comes to 
you, that is associated with him, must contain an analysis 
that he was happy with and recommendations that he felt 
he could justify, if the earlier report had a recommendation 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 130 of 239 
 
that he felt he could not be justified or had an analysis that 
he felt could not justify, he may have said well, this one, 
that will have my signature, must contain what I can also 
stand for, what I can justify.  Now what is wrong with that? 
MR NHLEKO:   I will tell you what’s wrong with that Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:   Firstly, it takes us back to this issue of, you 
have a report that is in there, you don’t nullify it and 
therefore you generate another one but the one that you’re 
generating looks similar to the first one but materially you 
10 
have tampered with it, that’s the issue.  Now, in fact, the 
investigation clearly shows that there was no additional 
information in the second report, in fact what happened is 
that there was certain paragraphs and content, material 
content for that matter expunged from the first report to 
construct the second report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But when you say that, when you say 
that what comes across to me is, you are disagreeing with 
Mr McBride’s approach you are disagreeing with his 
analysis, you are disagreeing with his recommendation.  
20 
You say, I don’t agree with this analysis, I don’t agree, that 
what was in the first report, those paragraphs should not 
also be in this report but he has taken a different view, I’m 
just taking a possible argument.  He has taken a different 
view, so what’s wrong with taking a different view? 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 131 of 239 
 
MR NHLEKO:   No…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you punish somebody simply because 
they have a different view. 
MR NHLEKO:   No, I’m not [laughter]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I want you to assist me where I have – I 
need clarification so in other words…[intervenes].  
MR NHLEKO:   I think it’s possible Chair, that you might be 
missing a point somewhere. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:   A report, an investigation report is not 
10 
about views, it’s not about…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
But 
surely 
when 
they 
make 
a 
recommendation those are views? 
MR NHLEKO:   Can I finish Chair, the investigation report, 
it’s not about views. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hmm hmm. 
MR NHLEKO:   What constitutes an investigation report are 
statements collected, sworn to statements collected from 
individuals, analysed, produced that report.  So, it’s not 
about views, with my view is that this and so on.  So, if you 
20 
have statements that, clearly, whether it’s one or two 
individuals, that implicate you in relation to allegations of 
the commission of crime, for an example.  So, you can’t 
then say I have a view about these sworn statements that 
actually you may not have committed that crime it doesn’t 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 132 of 239 
 
work that way.  Now – and that’s why, Chair, it’s quite 
important, and I think I tried to emphasise this point on the 
first day, that all of us, we need to respect processes 
because institutional processes, they are there to assist 
us, that’s another level for an example which must 
determine your extent of involvement and/or guiltiness for 
an example, you must establish that but on the basis of 
what is there, these are the implications and so on. So, 
much as I hear the Chair from that point of view, but we 
shouldn’t make it out as if it’s, you know, a general 
10 
analytical kind of report, necessarily.  It is borne out of 
what is contained in the docket and/or dockets. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you see I have an issue with your 
evidence that a report such as that is not about views. 
MR NHLEKO:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I expect you to agree to this proposition 
that 
says, 
when 
an 
investigator, 
including 
an 
IPID 
investigator has been given the task of investigating 
something 
and 
they 
collect 
evidence, 
they 
collect 
statements from witnesses and they’re supposed to see 
20 
whether there is – there should be prosecution or they 
should make a recommendation for prosecution or for 
misconduct, disciplinary action.  They take a view on those 
– on the contents of those statements to say, what do I 
make of this evidence.  Do I think this evidence reveals 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 133 of 239 
 
that this person committed a crime that this person acted 
in breach of the rules of the employer?  That’s the view 
they take and when they make a recommendation and the 
IPID Act says they must make recommendations, that 
recommendation is the view they take.  Somebody else 
might say, given this evidence in these statements, I 
recommend 
that 
so 
and 
so 
should 
be 
disciplined.  
Somebody else might say, given the same evidence I 
recommend that this person should not be disciplined.  So 
that’s where I’m coming from and you’ll get a chance to say 
10 
you agree or not but I expect you to agree that, I’m 
therefore saying, when it comes to Mr Sesoko and Mr 
McBride, it seems to me, and I want you to tell me if I’m 
looking at it wrongly, it seems to me that there’s room to 
say, they expressed to the extent that they were party to 
the final report they may have expressed views, some of 
those views or their approach might have differed from 
Khuba’s approach, alone, writing that other report and you 
didn’t agree with their approach in the second report you 
didn’t agree, your view was that they should not have – 
20 
they should have included certain paragraphs that they 
thought should be excluded but it’s the view they took and 
if it’s the view they took, must they be punished for the 
view they took.  So, what do you say to that proposition? 
MR NHLEKO:   Honourable Chair, I would have really loved 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 134 of 239 
 
to agree and share your proposition but I don’t and I’ll 
probably also try and provide a simplified sort of example 
to try and illustrate this point.  If you go out here in 
Johannesburg and you cross a red robot, now a traffic 
officer will stop you and will tell you if you are lucky, it will 
tell you this is a violation of crossing a red robot and in 
violation of the Ordinance Act of 1960 whatever the case is 
and so on right, that’s not a view, that’s not a view.  So, 
you can’t then say, this traffic cop expressed a view which 
is different from me as a driver or from me as an onlooker 
10 
to then say, ja he might have crossed a red robot a 
perhaps it’s possible that he did not and so on, no.  So, I’m 
saying institutions of policing, in particular, honourable 
Chair, they function against institutional regimes.  In this 
case, 
your 
Criminal 
Procedure 
Act, 
your 
whatever, 
whatever Act of course I’m not an expert when it comes to 
these things Chair, I was, merely, a political head of the 
institution but it doesn’t make me a Policeman but they will 
tell you, and there are professionals that are trained in this 
regard okay.  So, you can’t then say, those people, having 
20 
done so, again, in the background of our minds, having 
made this example about a traffic cop and say that was an 
expression of a view, no it’s not a view.  In legal and 
criminal matters – and perhaps a view, I think, at the level 
of yourself, honourable Chair, as a Judge, I mean you can 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 135 of 239 
 
– you’ve been analysing the law and so on but these are 
Law Enforcement Agencies that’s all that they do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s very interesting that you say that 
because remember, a Police Officer who sees what he may 
think, she may think is a violation, a contravention of a 
traffic regulation or law may come to you and say, why you 
doing this, why you crossing the robot and if you give him 
or her certain answer he may decide, no I understand so 
therefore I’m not going to arrest you, I’m not going to 
charge you.  You say people are chasing me, wanting to 
10 
shoot me, so that’s why I’m running away from them.  If 
you give them a different answer they might say, no that’s 
no valid reason you’ll have to face charges but I think let’s 
not take it further, I understand what you say and I think 
you understand where I’m coming from, Mr Hulley. 
ADV HULLEY:   Thank you Mr Chair.  Now, you, if I 
understand your testimony correctly, you decided to take 
disciplinary charges against Mr – arising out of the 
Werksmans 
report, 
to 
take 
disciplinary 
– 
institute 
disciplinary charges against Mr McBride but not against 
20 
anybody else, do I understand that correctly? 
MR NHLEKO:   I took disciplinary steps against Mr 
McBride. 
ADV HULLEY:   And who else? 
MR NHLEKO:   Against Mr McBride sir. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 136 of 239 
 
ADV HULLEY:   Anybody else other than Mr McBride? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think he said, nobody else, ja. 
ADV HULLEY:   Oh, sorry I thought he said -I’m sorry my 
apologies 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja others may have been suspended but 
it was not his decision, that is what he said. 
ADV HULLEY:   Sure, what about General Dramat, General 
Sibiya, Captain Maluleka, any of those? 
MR NHLEKO:   No, the others would be outside of my 
ambit really, of course, General Dramat, I had already 
10 
indicated to that but with regards to the others below him it 
had to be somebody else, not me. 
ADV HULLEY:   What I’m trying to understand, as far as 
this is concerned, you commissioned a report to investigate 
whether 
there 
were 
criminal 
and 
whether 
there 
was 
disciplinary misconduct on the part of a variety of people.  
Those people included Mr Sesoko, Mr Khuba, Captain 
Maluleke and General Sibiya all outside of your mandate or 
all outside of your scope of – as their employer outside of 
your ability, your power to discipline them, correct? 
20 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes, some of the individuals that you 
mentioned. 
ADV HULLEY:   All or some? 
MR 
NHLEKO: 
 
 
No, 
I’m 
saying 
some 
of 
the 
individuals…[intervenes]. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 137 of 239 
 
ADV HULLEY:   Which ones do you disagree with, I’ve 
named four? 
MR NHLEKO:   Just run down that list again…[intervenes]. 
COMMISSIONER:  No, I think Mr McBride was the one 
person he said he had power to suspend, General Dramat 
was another person that would have fallen within his power 
but by the time, I think he had already – he had already 
suspended him, the Werksmans report.  
ADV HULLEY:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I don’t think there was anybody else 
10 
who fell within your power to suspend, is that so, among 
the people mentioned? 
MR NHLEKO:   And I think we should also qualify this 
Chair.  General Dramat, it was more to do with being 
implicated in the commission of crime. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, not in the report. 
MR NHLEKO:   Not the question of the two reports and so 
on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:   And I think we need to be able to draw the 
20 
line between the two, Chair, thanks. 
ADV HULLEY:   In the terms of reference you were 
concerned, firstly, about the rendition matter and that 
involved General Dramat, General Sibiya, Captain Maluleke 
and perhaps other individuals but you identified two 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 138 of 239 
 
specifically.  You spoke about General Dramat and General 
Sibiya. 
MR NHLEKO:   Ja. 
ADV HULLEY:   You were also concerned about the 
circumstances which gave rise to the amendment of the 
IPID report and as far as that was concerned you were 
concerned, particularly about the fact that there were three 
people and that was Mr McBride, Mr Sibiya and Mr Khuba – 
sorry Mr Sesoko and Mr Khuba, correct? 
MR NHLEKO:   That I was concerned about what? 
10 
ADV HULLEY:   In relation to the two reports. 
MR NHLEKO:   Right. 
ADV HULLEY:   Correct? 
MR NHLEKO:   Correct. 
ADV HULLEY:   Now, what I’m trying to understand is how 
do you – on what basis you commissioned an investigation 
or an – into misconduct, let’s focus specifically on 
misconduct into misconduct of people who did not fall 
under your power or authority to discipline? 
MR NHLEKO:   Now, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with 
20 
investigating and in the investigation, people who you do 
not have a direct supervision on are implicated.  So, you 
wouldn’t say, these people are implicated but because I 
have nothing to do with direct supervision over them, so 
they should not be subjected to disciplinary hearing, that 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 139 of 239 
 
would be incorrect.  In fact, remember that, in the position 
that I was in, I was responsible in overall of the portfolio.  
So, if I felt that – not even felt because I remember the 
Chair and I, we were talking about feelings and views, so I 
must be careful in terms of what I say here. So, you have 
an investigation that then points out that in the division or 
the unit that I am supervising you have a X, Y, Z kind of 
person who is alleged to have committed the following 
whatever.  Now, you refer that matter to the supervisor 
concerned and say, here is a report that says the employee 
10 
that you are supervising is implicated in the commission of 
an offence, a certain offence or misconduct and so on and 
that person, manager and supervisor of that employee 
would then need to roll-out a process of dealing exactly 
with that issue okay.  So – but there’s nothing wrong in 
identifying that, you know, there’s certain – there’s, in the 
report, or whatever that identifies people that you are not 
even supervising who are part of – who are implicated in 
the commission of an offence and so on, there’s absolutely 
nothing wrong with that and there’s a difference, for your 
20 
benefit, Mr Hulley, there’s a difference between what I’ve 
just said and I then saying I’m now issuing disciplinary 
charges 
against 
those 
employees 
that 
have 
been 
supervised by this other employee that falls under my 
supervision, you know, there’s a difference between the 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 140 of 239 
 
two, thanks very much Chair. 
ADV HULLEY:   You see the difficulty is, the investigation 
wasn’t 
exclusively 
into 
Mr 
Robert 
McBride’s 
alleged 
misconduct or Lieutenant General Dramat’s misconduct.  
You were investigating or your terms of reference made it 
clear that you were investigating several people in the 
DPCI which included Dramat, Lieutenant General Dramat, 
General Sibiya and others within the DPCI and in relation 
to IPID you were investigating, not only, Mr McBride but 
you wanted others, within the IPID to be investigated as 
10 
well, would that be fair to say? 
MR NHLEKO:   No, no I think you’re wrong Mr Hulley, 
absolutely wrong.  We were not investigating certain 
individuals we were investigating a circumstance that said, 
how come you have this report and then you have this one, 
right.  So – because the manner in which you craft it, it’s 
as if, you know, I must have looked at you Chair, and said 
no, I want to investigate you, no it doesn’t work that way.  
There is a particular circumstance and an occurrence that 
took place and the question was, let us establish the facts 
20 
around this.  So, in the process, of course, of the 
investigation it then begins to reveal players in the 
occurrence of a particular circumstance and it’s on the 
basis of which, then, a particular institutional process has 
got to take place.  So, I wouldn’t like Mr Hulley to 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 141 of 239 
 
understand this thing as trying to individualise it and say, 
no there were certain individuals and specific people that 
were being investigated, there was an occurrence. 
ADV HULLEY:   You see the difficulty with that is, if I 
understood correctly, the investigation was specifically 
two-fold.  It was an investigation into a criminal misconduct 
and it was an investigation to disciplinary misconduct, 
correct? 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes, it covered both the angles. 
ADV HULLEY:   And it related to – you wanted to know if 
10 
there were any of the – any people from IPID who were 
implicated or any people from IPID who may have been 
guilty of the criminal or the disciplinary misconduct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Don’t forget here your answer.  I just 
want to say we are at twenty-five past two, okay alright. 
ADV HULLEY:   Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, give your answer Mr Nhleko.  
MR NHLEKO:   Can you reformulate that question, no not 
reformulate it…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Repeat it, he’s asking you to repeat the 
20 
question. 
ADV HULLEY:   Thank you Mr Chair.  Let’s consider the 
terms of reference…[intervenes]. 
MR 
NHLEKO: 
 
 
No, 
just 
ask 
the 
question, 
Mr 
Hulley…[intervenes]. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 142 of 239 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Might I mention…[intervenes]. 
MR NHLEKO:   There’s a question that you posed, that’s 
what I’m interested in. 
CHAIRPERSON:   My intervention disturbed…[intervenes]. 
ADV HULLEY:   Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HULLEY:   The purpose of the investigation insofar as 
IPID was concerned, you wanted to know, specifically, what 
were the circumstances which gave rise to a changing of 
the report, on the first report to the second report and you 
10 
were specifically concerned with whether there – who were 
the individuals that may have been involved in doing so 
and the circumstances which gave rise to the changes and 
who are the individuals, within IPID that may be guilty of 
criminal or disciplinary misconduct, is that right? 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes, that’s correct. 
ADV HULLEY:   Now, I would have been – given the 
attitude or the testimony that you’ve given here today it 
would have – and your acknowledgement that you had no 
power over anybody other than Lieutenant General Dramat 
20 
or Mr McBride, I would have expected that the investigation 
would have been into whether Mr McBride committed 
misconduct 
or 
whether 
Lieutenant 
General 
Dramat 
committed misconduct. 
MR NHLEKO:   Mr Hulley, I’ve responded to that question 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 143 of 239 
 
sir.  I’ve need to…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think you have. 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes, I made examples Chair…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think, maybe Mr Hulley wants to – 
you are suggesting and you want to know whether he has 
got any comment to your suggestion? 
ADV HULLEY:   Indeed, it’s a proposition that I would 
obviously 
– 
and 
what 
you 
must 
appreciate 
sir 
is 
that…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because his answer was, there’s a 
10 
situation that had arisen and it was necessary to establish 
what happened, how the situation came about, who, if 
anybody was – had committed misconduct or an offence 
and it so happened that in the course of that  investigation, 
obviously persons who had, had a role to play would be 
asked questions.  I think that is what he said ja, I’m putting 
it in my own way but he – Mr Hulley is suggesting that he 
would have expected you to confine the investigation to the 
persons 
who 
fell 
within 
your 
authority 
in 
terms 
of 
disciplining, namely Mr McBride and General Dramat, you 
20 
may be able to say, I didn’t see it that way or I thought it’s 
necessary to look at everybody that may have had a role to 
play, do you want to say anything? 
MR NHLEKO:   No, I disagree with his proposition. 
CHAIRPERSON:   His suggestion. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 144 of 239 
 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes, I actually do and, in fact, even earlier 
on I did allude to the mere fact around the issues of 
oversight responsibility. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  
ADV HULLEY:   Thank you Mr Chair and on what basis, I’m 
trying to understand this, on what basis, given that you 
understand, you appreciate that you have not command 
over or direct command or operational command over Mr 
Khuba, on what basis, do you phone him and tell him, 
instruct 
him, 
in 
fact 
to 
cooperate 
with 
Werksmans 
10 
investigation? 
MR NHLEKO:   No, on the basis that there was an 
investigation 
and 
he 
needed 
to 
cooperate 
with 
the 
investigation. 
ADV HULLEY:   No, I understand that in the same way that 
I can phone – one can phone up anybody else but the 
question is, on what authority did you do so? 
MR NHLEKO:   On the basis of the overall responsibility 
that I had as mandated by the constitution and the 
oversight responsibility from the department. 
20 
ADV HULLEY:   Sir your earlier testimony was, yesterday, 
your testimony was you don’t phone people that are lower 
down on the rung, you phone the person that’s at the head 
of that institution.  Now in the case of IPID that was Mr 
Kgamanyane when Mr McBride was on suspension.  So, 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 145 of 239 
 
what I’m asking you is, if you wanted an instruction to be 
given to Mr Khuba, why didn’t you phone Mr Kgamanyane? 
MR NHLEKO:   No, you’re getting it wrong at the time when 
I called Mr Khuba Mr Kgamanyane was not on the scene, if 
my recollection – if I’m correct, I mean he was not 
there…[intervenes]. 
ADV HULLEY:   Who was the head? 
MR NHLEKO:   It was Mr McBride…[intervenes]. 
ADV HULLEY:   So why didn’t you phone Mr McBride? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja I think that’s my recollection as well, 
10 
that’s my recollection as well that it was Mr McBride. 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes, it was Mr McBride who himself was 
also implicated in the very same issue of the investigation. 
ADV HULLEY:   That’s the point and the point is that you 
bypassed Mr McBride and went straight to Mr Khuba and – 
now there could only be one reason why you could have 
gone directly to Mr Khuba, to instruct him to cooperate with 
the investigation. 
MR NHLEKO:   Right.    
ADV HULLEY SC:  Because you suspected that Mr McBride 
20 
was going to have some wrongdoing?  Correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I am sorry just repeat the question. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  There is only one reason why you would 
have bypassed Mr McBride and gone straight to Mr Khuba 
was because you suspected that Mr McBride was guilty of 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 146 of 239 
 
some wrongdoing. 
MR NHLEKO:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr McBride – he suspected that Mr 
McBride had done something wrong? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That Mr McBride was the one that was 
guilty. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR NHLEKO:  But Mr Hulley you would appreciate this 
thing.  Guilt is never suspected.  Guilt is established 
through processes.  So I cannot – I cannot look at you or 
10 
any other human individual and suspect guilt.  It never 
works that way.  However you could be a person that is 
implicated in the wrongdoing and I think he – those are the 
added kind of terms that are used but they use about – the 
usage of the concept of suspected guilt defeats the whole 
notion of why you need to have institutional and or legal 
processes that must then establish whether you are guilty 
and to what extent and whether you are not guilty, that is it.  
That is my … 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I accept that. 
20 
MR NHLEKO:  Understanding of general practice basically. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I accept that.  You have obviously got to 
establish it but one could have a suspicion nothing wrong 
with having a suspicion.  Your suspicion could be based on 
nothing and of course your suspicion could be based upon 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 147 of 239 
 
something.   
MR NHLEKO:  Mr Hulley I think let us agree that we 
disagree. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay. Let us move on. 
MR NHLEKO:  I mean for me as I say I mean the – you 
cannot suspect guilt.  You know.  Wrongdoing yes you can 
suspect but not guilt. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now the second question is, if you – you 
knew that Mr Khuba had – had been – you had been told 
that Mr Khuba was not cooperating.  I would imagine that 
10 
you 
would 
also 
be 
told 
that 
Mr 
McBride 
was 
not 
cooperating. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  Chair if Mr Hulley can indicate when is 
he going to finish because you have given him time he is 
just continuing and eating into the re-examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I was also looking whether that was 
going to be the last question. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or what.  We are at twenty-five to three.  I 
am not – I am not saying stop abruptly. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the situation? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Mr Chair if you would bear with me.  Yes 
I think I am down to two – basically two propositions and 
then I want to sum it all up. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 148 of 239 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But is that five minutes or how much is 
that? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I do not think it is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ten minutes? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I think it is depending on the answers I 
would think that it is about fifteen/twenty minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but we have got to come to some 
conclusion. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Absolutely Mr Chair.  The difficulty as I 
said at the outset is that I am making an assessment in my 
10 
head but then my assessment is based upon a response 
that would be relatively short. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well we – we – we have got to – we have 
got to come to some conclusion. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not want to say abruptly stop.  Well 
can you try and see if you can wrap up in ten minutes? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  If I could ask you 
Sir to turn with me to your founding affidavit – sorry your 
affidavit which is in Bundle LEA1. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I think I can say the ten minutes is 
the last ten minutes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I just want to make sure that you know 
that.  That will be the last ten minutes. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 149 of 239 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  That is Bundle 
LEA1 Sir have you got it? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well he – ja I think you can ahead and 
ask the question he will decide if he needs it.  If he is able 
to answer without looking at it he will.  I think that is his 
approach. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  In your affidavit 
you deal with the Werksmans Report at some length and if I 
could refer you to the relevant page.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Remember that you might not need to 
10 
refer if you know what is in that page you can just put the 
question.  He might… 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He might be able to answer because you 
probably know what the question is you want to put.  So… 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Well my understanding arising out of the 
affidavit was that you had pursuant to obtaining the 
Werksmans Report you had decided to institute disciplinary 
proceedings … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what was the verb – he – it says:  He 
20 
decided to what? 
ADV 
HULLEY 
SC: 
 
Institute 
disciplinary 
proceedings 
against the implicated individuals. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Individuals okay.  Alright.  Mr Nhleko. 
MR NHLEKO:  So what is it that needs to be known about 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 150 of 239 
 
that Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  He says and I am paraphrasing.  You have 
said that after the Werksmans Report had been presented 
to you the only person that you decided to take disciplinary 
action against and here I am talking about suspension was 
Mr McBride.  But he is saying in your affidavit you said you 
decided to take disciplinary action against the implicated 
individuals plural. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Chair but the point being. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR NHLEKO:  That the investigation report by Werksmans 
makes reference to the alleged sort of areas of misconduct 
by the individuals that are concerned.  So I agreed with it 
and I agreed with it.  So this particular paragraph that he 
makes reference to it is precisely because I agree with the 
original recommendation that says, disciplinary action must 
be taken against the following individuals.  Okay.  Now and 
I think I have explained earlier on the whole question of the 
distinction between disciplinary steps as a supervisor that 
you take against an employee that reports to you.  We 
20 
against a situation where that particular employee takes 
disciplinary steps against people that report under him. That 
is it. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  And after the 
matter went to the Constitutional Court this is now Mr 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 151 of 239 
 
McBride instituted proceedings in the Constitutional Court 
to set aside his suspension after you had suspended him 
and he did so on the basis that you had no power to do so.  
Is that correct? 
MR NHLEKO:  You follow me Chair.  I do think that we are 
meant to careful as to how we talk to issues of judgments.  
We are sitting in front of the Deputy Chief Justice here who 
is also part of that very same matter and is part of that very 
same order.  So Mr Hulley you would know that the 
Constitutional Court did not set aside his suspension and as 
10 
a matter of fact there is no – in all the courts that Mr 
McBride went to there was never a [indistinct 01:10:40] on 
the issue of his suspension.  Now the Constitutional Court 
made the following order because I think we need to clarify 
this point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I do not think you need to read I think 
your point is it pronounced… 
MR NHLEKO:  6(3) and other provisions are being for lack 
of a better word are being shifted as aside and in their 
place in particular Section 6 of the IPID Act Section 17 DA 
20 
of the South African Policy Act must be read in there.  
Right?  And then said on the issue – on the issue of the 
Minister of Police taking disciplinary steps that matter 
Parliament needed to deal with it within thirty days and it 
was for Parliament to then decide whether within the 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 152 of 239 
 
prescribed thirty days by the Constitutional Court whether it 
is still both Parliament and the Minister of Police whether 
they still wanted to pursue disciplinary charges against Mr 
McBride.  So Mr Hulley in that order where is the 
suspension that is set aside?  Because the only thing that 
happened by the way I will tell you what happened.  The 
only thing that happened you are then an institution of 
state, a democratic state that did not follow this order to the 
letter and that is Parliament.  It elected not to do anything.  
I mean it is either you take a position that says, yes you 
10 
agree or disagree but you cannot just be mum when it 
comes to matters of an order such as this.  Now – and I 
think that is where fundamentally also my problem was and 
even for that matter conceptually, I seriously have a 
problem with a situation such as that.  But it happened 
okay.  Now the consequence of which was that because the 
prescribed thirty day period by the Constitutional Court 
lapsed.  There was nothing in law or in any other matter you 
can think of that then prevented Mr McBride reporting for 
duty and going back to work.  Right.  So there was no 
20 
setting aside of suspension in law and reinstatement as it 
has been somewhat alleged [indistinct 01:13:31] [talking 
over one another] 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Mr Chair if I can just be fair because 
that was not the question I asked. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 153 of 239 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And I have a ten minute response to a 
question and my question was whether Mr McBride had 
instituted proceedings to set – to review and set aside his 
suspension. 
MR NHLEKO:  No. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I got told about the Constitutional Court 
and whatever. 
MR NHLEKO:  Honourable Chair I disagree with this 
because he in the formulation Mr Hulley pointed directly to 
10 
the question of the Constitutional Court having set aside his 
suspension. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay I… 
MR NHLEKO:  And that is the point I was clarifying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I cannot say I remember whether it was 
that or it was simply saying Mr McBride got an application. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Which I said and that ultimately went to 
the Constitutional Court. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I do not know if it – I do not know how 
much it matters in terms of what you have in mind Mr 
20 
Hulley.  If it is important … 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can use it to wrap up. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  The point is as you have already pointed 
out what the Constitutional Court had ultimately declared 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 154 of 239 
 
was 
that 
National Assembly 
was 
the 
body 
that 
was 
responsible to determine whether Mr McBride could not be 
suspended. 
MR NHLEKO:  Hm. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now it is not your fault of course 
because at the time that the – that this – at the time it 
indicated the IPID Act indicated that you did have the power 
to suspend him.   
MR NHLEKO:  No the IPID Act did not indicate.  It said the 
Minister of Police as the following whatever.  So it was very 
10 
pointed it is not an indication Mr Hulley. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The powers. 
MR NHLEKO:  The powers yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:  Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  But then that was done away with by the 
Constitutional Court? 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  The Constitutional Court said that those 
provisions were unconstitutional? 
20 
MR NHLEKO:  Right. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Which meant that you know that 
whatever powers you might have had or believed you had 
you no long had and yet you continued to pursue the matter.  
Not only did you approach the National Assembly having 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 155 of 239 
 
been told by the Constitutional Court that you actually did 
not have those powers.  Not only did you approach the 
National Assembly to try and advance your case but when – 
when the thirty day period lapsed and Mr McBride returned 
you suspended him again.  You said to – you wrote a letter 
saying that the National Assembly must decide where Mr 
McBride must go to, Correct? 
MR NHLEKO:  I do not believe this.  Now… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That will be the last question Mr Hulley. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes.  Just two things about what Mr Hulley 
10 
has just said.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I think in effect he is saying is it not true 
that after Mr McBride had returned to work you suspended 
him again? 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes but Chair he started somewhere. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no he started somewhere. 
MR NHLEKO:  He then says that he finds almost something 
wrong with the fact that I approached Parliament.  I was 
approaching 
Parliament 
in 
compliance 
with 
the 
Constitutional Court order.  And all I was saying to 
20 
Parliament, Parliament comply with the Constitutional Court 
this is an order.  If an order is issued we all follow the 
order, simple.  So you cannot subject for an example an 
order to any other set of emotions whether they are political 
or something or otherwise, it is an order so we had to 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 156 of 239 
 
comply with that. Because it said Parliament and Minister of 
Police must then decide whether they still wanted to pursue 
this.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:  So in his formulation Mr Hulley that is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  He – he insinuates that there was something 
wrong with me doing that by approaching Parliament which 
is incorrect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I understand your point. 
10 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do want to bring this to an end so Mr 
Mokhari can re-examine.  I did indicate to Mr Hulley that 
that was to be the last question.  And then I think I gave 
him more than the ten minutes that I said I was going to be 
the last ten minutes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Yes Mr Chair.  I am quite happy of 
course on your instruction Mr Chair to conclude it at this 
point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Of course, I did want to afford the 
witness an opportunity to deal with that.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And of course the opportunity because it 
is in the affidavit that he has dealt with and it is part of the 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 157 of 239 
 
– 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that – that… 
ADV HULLEY SC:  It is part of the statements that he has 
dealt with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No, no that is fine.  We have got to 
end here. What is the last point you want to say Mr Nhleko? 
MR NHLEKO:  The last point is in relation to Mr Hulley’s 
assertion that not only did I approach Parliament and so 
that even after he returned I suspended him.  That is 
factually incorrect. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR NHLEKO:  Absolutely incorrect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:  Indeed, I did then write to the speaker of 
Parliament.  And said look in the light of all these issues 
and the happenings in the manner in which they have 
happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR NHLEKO:  They must then as the institution of 
Parliament decide as to how they wanted to deal that issue. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR NHLEKO:  Okay.  I had done almost… 
CHAIRPERSON:  The issue of suspension? 
MR NHLEKO:  No – yes the issue of suspension. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 158 of 239 
 
MR NHLEKO:  Now I had done almost everything in my 
power to approach them and said to them this is what the 
Constitutional Court says.  Let us comply with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR NHLEKO:  Now – and by so saying Chair I was not 
saying 
they 
should. 
Does 
Parliament 
agree 
with 
my 
position? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR NHLEKO:  I was saying they have got to pronounce – 
pronounce whether you want to do this thing or not do it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:  You know between the two and I think even 
the court itself would have then been satisfied that the 
order was complied with.  But you cannot just leave it 
hanging out there and so on.  And that is my problem you 
know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Mr Chair just to be fair to the witness 
and of course Mr Mokhari can deal with it.  The relevant 
passage and I am referring to is a press statement issued 
20 
by the witness.  It appears in Bundle LEA8 and it is at 
pages 3639 to 3641. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 159 of 239 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:  It is dealt with over there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Mokhari re-examination. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  Thank you very much Chairperson for 
the opportunity.  I just want to ask Mr Nhleko just a few 
questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  Purely for clarification. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  It is not necessarily a re-examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  Mr Nhleko when McBride brought an 
application in the High Court to declare Section 6(6) read 
with Section 6(3) of the IPID Act unconstitutional and those 
were the sections which give you the power to suspend him 
and also to institute disciplinary proceedings against the 
Executive Director of the IPID you opposed that application 
am I correct? 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes that is correct Sir. 
20 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  And you filed an answering affidavit? 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes that is absolutely correct. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  And in that application McBride did 
make allegations of ulterior motive and as well as that you 
were suspending him for – or you are malicious or all those 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 160 of 239 
 
type of things.  And you filed an answering affidavit and 
responding to those allegations in detail, do you remember 
that? 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes I do remember Sir. 
ADV 
MOKHARI 
SC: 
 
And 
what 
happened 
to 
those 
allegations in court? 
MR NHLEKO:  He withdrew them. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  I did not hear the answer just speak 
up. 
MR NHLEKO:  I am saying he withdrew those allegations of 
10 
ulterior motives and I think it was ulterior motives and 
something else I cannot remember but… 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  Yes that is fine I just wanted to know 
then what happened to them that is all. 
MR NHLEKO:  No he withdrew those – yes. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  Yes that is right, okay, alright.  And 
then the High Court delivered a very lengthy judgment.  In 
essence it declared Section 6(6) read with Section 6(3) of 
the IPID Act unconstitutional and on the basis of that it then 
found that you had no power to suspend McBride and 
20 
similarly you will have no power to institute disciplinary 
proceedings against him because those provisions of the 
law were not consistent with the independence of IPID 
which ought to be insulated in terms of the constitution. 
MR NHLEKO:  Right. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 161 of 239 
 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  Did the court make any finding against 
you of ulterior motive? 
MR NHLEKO:  No there was no such a finding. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  Now in respect of the suspension I 
know that you are not a lawyer but we have a judgment here 
and the Chairperson would be able to read it.  The High 
Court did set aside the suspension of McBride but I want 
you to comment on what did the court say about his 
suspension?  Did it say that McBride now is free to go back 
to his position as Executive Director or did it say something 
10 
else? 
MR NHLEKO:  I think it – it – the matter yes was 
pronounced 
upon 
by 
the 
High 
Court 
but 
pending 
a 
constitutional challenge.  The effect of which was that the 
suspension itself was not set aside but I think I am subject 
to correction in case I am missing something here but that 
is my recollection. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  Yes of course and I understand that 
you do not have the judgment with you and I do not want us 
to waste time on that. 
20 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  Chairperson the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  The paragraph of the judgment will be 
paragraph 77(6) of the judgment.  Paragraph 77(6) of the 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 162 of 239 
 
High Court Judgment.  So all what the High Court said was 
that although it has set aside McBride’s suspension that 
McBride must remain on suspension until such time that 
Parliament has looked into the matter.  If indeed the 
suspension was such of magnitude that McBride ought to 
return to work what is it that the court considered that 
although McBride succeeded in his challenge he must still 
remain on suspension.   
MR NHLEKO:  No I am – I did not hear you Mr Mokhari. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The question is… 
10 
MR NHLEKO:  [Mumbling] 
CHAIRPERSON:  The question is since the court that is the 
High Court now said that Mr McBride must not return to 
work until Parliament had dealt with the matter. 
MR NHLEKO:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What are the considerations that led the 
court to saying that?  That was the question. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  Yes why will a court – the [indistinct 
01:27:10] of the court do such a thing that is the question? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course the answer would be in the 
20 
judgment I would imagine and I think Mr Mokhari you can 
feel… 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  Yes I mean issues of like the 
allegations I mean what was the nature of the allegations – 
all those type of things? That is… 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 163 of 239 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I want to say Mr Mokhari I want to 
say anything that is in the judgment you are free to just 
draw my attention to what the court said even if he does not 
deal with it.  If that is what you want to know. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  In fact I will… 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Taking 
into 
account 
you 
mention 
[indistinct 01:27:49]. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  Yes, yes.  Chairperson from the High 
Court judgment paragraph 60, paragraph 67, 68 and 77 in 
particular 77.6.  So 60, 67 will then deal with considerations 
10 
that the court took into account but essentially then the 
court was alive to the fact that the Minister pointed out to 
the nature of the allegations against him, the seriousness 
and that McBride himself said that I am prepared to face the 
disciplinary proceedings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  So the issues of the charges that there 
was no issue of the charges being frivolous or baseless 
then that is what I was trying to put to you Mr Nhleko. 
MR NHLEKO:  Okay. 
20 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  It is because the court had also recognised 
that the allegations were of a serious nature. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  Now, so in terms of our legal system 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 164 of 239 
 
when the High Court set aside or declare a provision of 
statute and constitutional it does not become effective 
immediately. The Constitutional Court must have a final say 
and this matter of McBride was then taken to the High Court 
– to the Constitutional Court for confirmation.  Again, I am 
not going to deal with the Constitutional – with the 
Constitutional Court judgment because it is there and then 
the Chairperson will be able to read it. But then what was 
before the Constitutional Court would be the material that 
was before the High Court.  The paragraph that I would like 
10 
to take you to but again because of time I will read it for 
you.  It is paragraph 12 and this was a judgment delivered 
by – it was written by the late Honourable Bosielo AJ.  In 
paragraph 12 it says: 
“Faced with the glaring discrepancies in the two 
reports the Minister suspected serious tampering.  
As a result the commission – Sorry – as a result he 
commissioned Werksmans Attorneys to investigate 
the two reports relying on the January Report and 
the investigation by Werksmans the Minister invoked 
20 
his powers in terms of Section 6(6) of the IPID Act, 
the Public Service Act and Chapter 7 of the SMS 
Handbook and placed Mr McBride on precautionary 
suspension on 24 March 2015 acting on the strength 
of Section 6(6)A of the IPID Act read with the 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 165 of 239 
 
provisions governing disciplinary proceedings under 
the Public Service Act and the IPID Regulations the 
Minister served Mr McBride with a notice to attend 
the disciplinary enquiry.” 
The order in paragraph 4 is suspended for 30-days in order 
for the National Assemble and the Minister of Police, if they 
so choose, to exercise their powers in terms of the 
provisions referred to in paragraph 3.1 above. 
 
Now remember, the proposition that was put to you by 
Mr Hulley because he was saying to you: 
10 
“Despite that the commercial court has set aside the 
suspension, you still forced ahead and went to 
parliament...” 
 
And your answer was that you are acting in terms of the 
constitutional court order but you could not refer to a 
specific paragraph of it. 
MR NHLEKO:  Alright. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  And so this is the paragraph that 
actually then would have prompted you to go to parliament 
because you have said that the concourt did what... as a 
20 
last, we call it a read-in. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  Concession 6.3 are no longer there.  
They cannot be used but you can leave a vacuum, that is 
what the concourt says.  And then he says: 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 166 of 239 
 
“What can we do in the meantime was, for giving the 
parliament an opportunity to rectify the legislation”.  
He says that: 
“We will now read in Section 17(d)(a).  Am I correct? 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes, that is very correct. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  And so, then you say that you acted in 
terms of that section and again the Chairperson will be able 
to read Section 17(d)(a) and see for himself that Section 
17(d)(c) of the Police Service Act, it actually requires a joint 
action.   
10 
 
That is now the minister and parliament, must together 
act then to trigger either a suspension or additional 
processes.  It cannot be you alone.  So that is what really 
then it is saying but then... I mean, am I correct? 
MR NHLEKO:  That is very correct sir. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  So you are basically in your response 
to Mr Hulley, you are basically saying to him:  “I have done 
my part.  I have gone to parliament because I wanted to be 
complying with the concourt order” 
 
Paragraph 5 which says that:   
20 
“Minister of Parliament, you have 30-days.  Make a 
decision.  Are you going to charge this man or not?” 
 
And you say you have done your part.  What did 
parliament do?  Did parliament do its own part? 
MR NHLEKO:  No, certainly it did not in this ...[indistinct]  
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 167 of 239 
 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  Now the question is.  Can you tell the 
Chairperson 
what 
would 
have 
happened 
to 
McBride’s 
suspension had parliament did... had parliament done its 
part? 
MR NHLEKO:  Look, that suspension... of course, if we 
acted in accordance with the constitutional court order.  The 
constitutional court order, you know, gave us a period of 
about 30-days to, you know, the parliament and the Minister 
of Police, you know, myself at the time when I occupied the 
position. 
10 
 
That suspension would have stayed on but the decision 
perhaps where parliament would intervene, the question of 
processing the issues of discipline, okay. 
 
Now, suppose the decision by parliament would have 
been:  “Yes, let us go ahead and, you know, these are the 
charges and so on and let us deal with them”. 
 
So suspension would have gone on beyond that 30-day 
period 
as 
per 
the 
constitutional 
court. 
 
In 
fact, 
the 
constitutional court order, the 30-day period was not about 
suspension.  
20 
 
It was about rectifying and deal with the procedural 
issues within the 30-day period and see whether you want to 
proceed or not proceed with the disciplinary action against 
Mr McBride. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  Now thank you very much.  Now, let us 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 168 of 239 
 
move to Dramat because it was also something which came 
up during your testimony.  And Mr Hulley did ask you about 
your suspension of Lieutenant General Dramat. 
 
We know that the ...[indistinct] foundation challenged 
that suspension of McBride by yourself in the high court and 
there was a judgment by Prinsloo J.  He also opposed that 
application.  Am I correct? 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes, that is correct sir. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  And Prinsloo J came with a judgment.  
So the only thing that I want to ask you in respect of that 
10 
judgment, you know, that opportunity to also ...[indistinct] at 
some stage.  Did Prinsloo make any finding that you have 
acted with ulterior motive or malice when you suspended Mr 
McBride?  I mean, sorry.  Lieutenant General Dramat. 
MR NHLEKO: No, there was not such a finding. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  Again, it was a simple question of 
interpretation.  Your interpretation of the provisions of the 
South African Police Service as far as the powers of the 
minister, that is to suspend the head of the HAWKS? 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes.  And may I also just state that your 
20 
Honourable Chair?  Because this assertion has been made 
over and over again that I acted unlawfully which is a very 
strong statement by anybody to say.  I was acting lawfully 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  In suspending General Dramat? 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 169 of 239 
 
MR NHLEKO:  Ja, but also Mr McBride. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:  Ja.  Now because acting unlawfully would 
actually mean you were acted either against the provisions 
of the law or outside of the law.  I think that is what it would 
mean. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Well, 
acting 
unlawfully 
may 
mean, 
depending on the circumstances, it means your actions were 
in breach of the law. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But there are circumstances where you 
may act unlawfully but genuinely, believing that you are 
entitled to act in a certain way even sometimes with the 
benefit of senior counsel’s advice.  [laughs] 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  [laughs] 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You go to senior counsel and he says... 
you say, “If I do this, am I within the law?” 
MR NHLEKO:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It gives you an opinion and says you will 
20 
be within your right, you will be within the law if you do this 
and he charges you an arm and a leg.  You feel confident.  
You go and do it.  And then you are challenged.  The court 
says, “No, you have acted unlawfully”. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes, yes. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 170 of 239 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So sometimes you are genuine.  It does 
not mean that you are malicious but it is unlawful.  But 
sometimes it might be a situation where you were malicious 
or you... and so on. 
MR NHLEKO:  No, thank you very much Chair for the 
education. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  [laughs] 
MR NHLEKO:  [laughs] 
MR NHLEKO:  The point ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Unfortunately, if he was giving the advice 
10 
you can argue .and not charge you anything ...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:  [laughs]  Yes, so.  But the point I wanted to 
make, nevertheless.  I am sorry Mr Mokhari, if I... I must 
have ...[intervenes]  
ADV MOKHARI SC:  That is fine.  You can proceed. 
MR NHLEKO:  ...intervened.  But the point I wanted to make 
is that in all these courts and the related sort of cases and 
processes, there is no court that said I acted unlawfully.  
ADV MOKHARI SC:  No, not unlawfully.  You acted 
unlawfully when you used the provision of the law which the 
20 
court says is not consistent with the constitution.  What the 
Chair is putting to you is that unlawfully is something... to 
ask his lawyers that is not something that is offensive. 
MR NHLEKO:  Okay. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  But the problem is, if you have acted 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 171 of 239 
 
with ulterior motives, malice, bad-faith, then that is where 
the problem comes.  So ...[indistinct] that the court never 
said you acted with ulterior motives or malice.  But 
unlawfully, the court has already spoken on that. 
MR NHLEKO:  H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see, the president and the ministers, 
cabinet ministers, very often they are involved in litigation 
and the court says they acted unlawfully but as long as the 
court has not said you were... the minister of the president 
was acting maliciously or in bad-faith or dishonestly, they 
10 
accept that it is part of their job.  Well, some of the things 
they do, meaning well, would be found to have been done 
unlawfully. 
 
So it does not necessarily... you should not necessarily 
feel embarrassed if a court says you acted unlawfully, unless 
it is a situation where it says you were malicious, you acted 
in bad-faith or you had ulterior motives.  Then that is 
different. 
MR NHLEKO:  Okay.  No, thank you very much Chair. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  Yes, Chair.  Then I just want to move to 
20 
the two reports because there was a lengthy engagement 
between you and the Chair which was quite enlightening. 
 
But I just wanted to clarify so that you know we are clear 
about... what it is you are thinking around the issue of the 
two reports.   
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 172 of 239 
 
 
If you remember the engagement between you and the 
chairperson yesterday.  The Chairperson was putting a 
proposition to you and say:  “Look, we have this IPID 
institution which has two reports.  And it follows that they 
should not be really an issue but because logically you 
should simple say that the last report is the final report.  And 
so what is the fuss there?” 
 
So can we get your clear understanding there in the 
context of your understanding of what are IPID reports there 
for? 
10 
MR NHLEKO:  H’m.  My understanding Honourable Chair is 
that our earlier discussion... I am sorry.  I will refer to it as a 
discussion with the Chair because the various critical points 
that were thrown in the air as part of that engagement. 
 
Is that for me, I think your interpretation there is based 
on the general side of things and I think I must have pointed 
that one out.   
 
But with regards to the reports of this nature which i.e. 
the criminal law matters relating to police misconduct and so 
on, they will essentially be based on factual material. 
20 
 
Now the factual material being the material that you will 
find in the docket and what you will find in the docket are 
statements from individuals that states certain things and 
perhaps implicating me, certain people. 
 
So that is the strength.  And I think I eluded also Mr 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 173 of 239 
 
Mokhari to this point that in case there is a material shift, in 
other words, somebody made a statement implicating X and 
then turns around and says, “No, actually I was wrong.  The 
X was not there and maybe I lied”.  And whatever the case 
is.  So that materially registers a different sort of conclusion, 
you know, in a particular way. 
 
But it is also to be expected that when you find, whether 
it is a follow up or a second report, you would have to refer 
to the first one, whether you are withdrawing it or annulling it 
or amending it.  I think that is what practices and so on is. 
10 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  So I was trying Mr Mokhari earlier on to draw 
the distinction between constructing, what I would call a 
general report base don... well, not so much of material and 
so on, as opposed to an investigative report and so on. 
 
So I think my engagement earlier on about that.  Yes, 
yes. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  Yes, but I think what... but then what 
you 
could 
appreciate 
from 
the 
engagement 
with 
the 
Chairperson is that in this type of things a debate can go on 
20 
and you can have different views. 
MR NHLEKO:  Right. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  But then the questions that I am going 
to... and that is now is then... I mean, the conclusion, are the 
following questions which I would like you to assist the 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 174 of 239 
 
Chairperson with.   
 
Suppose when you got the two reports, you then looked 
at what your mind is set: “I cannot have this constitutional 
institution producing two contradictory reports.  What will 
this send?  What message will this send to the public?” 
 
And you become angry as the minister or you become 
furious to say that: “I cannot have this type of situation.  I 
want to get to the bottom of this”. 
MR NHLEKO:  Correct. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  But somebody may say that:  “No, but 
10 
you are overreacting. There is nothing wrong with what they 
were doing”. 
 
But ...[indistinct] that time you believed that this can be 
done.    
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  Is that now then... but my question is.  
If you are found later that in fact you were wrong, you should 
not have done anything but you have done something, you 
would have done something?  In what way will that become a 
state capture?  So that is what I wanted to.   
20 
 
Because remember, we are not here in a court of law.  
We are not here running a trial.  We are here in a 
commission of inquiry which is focussing on a particular 
issue of a state capture.  So can you assist the Chairperson 
in that context? 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 175 of 239 
 
MR NHLEKO:  Honourable Chair, the... I have also viewed 
this matte, specifically this matter, not the state capture 
issue.  The matter around Mr McBride and others and so on, 
as purely as nothing else, employer and employee relations. 
 
Now it is natural in industrial relations practice you... it 
is a natural thing that there will be disputes that also arise in 
the employment... employee/employer relationship and so 
on. 
 
So this matter to me still remains that.  The most 
unfortunate thing is the manner in which it was handled.  I 
10 
do not know, you know, the happenings outside this 
particular Commission and so on which I would not want the 
bore this Commission about what happened and who said 
what where and so on and so it goes. 
 
But 
the 
most 
unfortunate 
part 
was 
that. 
 
The 
consequence of which was that that what was due to the 
public to be known as the actual truth out of this matter, the 
public was deprived because the mishandling of the whole 
affair ...[indistinct] you could not...  
 
The processes that were supposed to establish when the 
20 
whole question of what happened to the two reports and so 
on and who is to be held accountable for the discrepancies 
and so forth, never actually occurred, right. 
 
So that is why I am saying the public, members of the 
public were then deprived of the actual truth about this.  But 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 176 of 239 
 
the allegations are very serious and they still remain 
extremely serious. 
 
Now, but the suggestions are that... in fact, I also 
wanted to address the Chair about this question of the 
suggestion of the state capture. 
 
Now, the allegations against myself are extremely 
serious because Mr McBride came here and they said they 
have captured the criminal justice cluster. 
 
Now the Criminal Justice Cluster, just for your benefit 
your Honourable Chair, it is the National Defence Force, it is 
10 
Home Affairs, it is Correctional Services, it is State Security 
Agency, it is the South African Police Service, it is the 
National Prosecuting Authority. 
 
Now, ...[indistinct] at the time when I was there 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  And Justice?  Is Justice not part? 
MR NHLEKO:  O, ja.  Justice.  No, sorry.  I am...  [laughs]  
And I know why Chair you ...[indistinct] you are quick to pick 
up the Justice is not mentioned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughs] 
20 
MR NHLEKO:  I understand that.  So.  Yes, and the 
Department of Justice.  So that combination, at the time I 
was there, I am not sure now, but at this time when I was in 
government, that was your Criminal Justice Cluster. 
 
Now, if you say I have captured the Criminal Justice 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 177 of 239 
 
Cluster, you are then saying, I as the Minister of Police then, 
I had the power to decide on the issues of prosecution which 
is not true.  It is not even allowable by law, okay.   
 
So 
even 
constitutionally 
...[indistinct] 
that 
did 
not 
happen.  It just does not.  Now, ...[indistinct] given a... no, at 
some point was, when I was trying to follow in what way did, 
I capture the Criminal Justice System. 
 
My ...[indistinct] was largely was that that point was not 
conversed any further here in the Commission.  To then say 
but you are making these allegations that, you know, this 
10 
person captured these institutions because that means all of 
them are in my pocket in a sense. 
 
But explain to us as the Commission as to how this 
individual, myself... I mean, meaning myself would have 
gone about capturing this particular institutions.   
 
So that was the one ...[indistinct] I had to really, to be 
quite honest on my side, to then say but why is this point not 
further taken up or so on. 
 
But I am not blaming the Commission.  I am just making 
an observation about that as well. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, I must say I do not even remember it 
being made.  I am not saying it was not made.  I am saying I 
do not remember it being made.  And probably because it is 
something that affects you directly, you... no, but you do not 
need to refer me to it because your counsel will be cross-
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 178 of 239 
 
examining Mr McBride and he will take that point up. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:  Just on that point Honourable Chair and I am 
sorry 
about 
this. 
 
In 
the 
communication, 
the 
initial 
communication when I was notified by the Commission, in 
the letter they need... the commission made the following:   
“You improperly or unlawfully sought to and duly 
interfere in the investigative independents of the 
National 
Prosecuting 
Authority, 
the 
Independent 
10 
Police Directorate and the Directorate for Priority 
Crime 
Investigations, 
commonly 
known 
as 
the 
HAWKS.   
Secondly, you improperly and/or unlawfully sought to 
unduly 
delay 
and/or 
decline 
recommended 
prosecutions. 
You improperly (that is the fourth point) or unlawfully 
sought to participate in the undue persecution of 
officials in the NPA, IPID and the DPCI. 
 
The last point in the Commissions correspondence: 
20 
“You 
improperly 
and/or 
unlawfully 
sought 
to 
destabilise the NPA, IPID and/or DPCI...” 
 
Now and therefore my point earlier on ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  You are reading from correspondence from 
the Commission? 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 179 of 239 
 
MR NHLEKO:  That is the correspondence from the 
Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From the Commission? 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I just want to say [laughs].  I do not 
see all the correspondence that goes out and actually, it is 
right that way that I should not see. [laughs]  Because 
otherwise, I would not be able to do anything else.  
But...[intervenes]  
ADV MOKHARI SC:  I think ...[indistinct] referring to the 
10 
Rule 3.3. 
MR NHLEKO:  Rule 3.3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but I think ...[intervenes]  
ADV MOKHARI SC:  And actually, those rules are written... 
they are written as a standard.  Just a standard thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but I am simple saying.  I am 
expecting that insofar as it was a 3.3. Notice, it was suppose 
to reflect what is in somebody’s affidavit is... has implicate 
you. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes.  H’m.  H’m. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes, that was my misgiving. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR NHLEKO:  Only to then say but if these are the 
allegations that are made against me, why these issues 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 180 of 239 
 
could not then in arising out of testimonies of people that 
were here, why were these issues not explored to establish 
the veracity of these particulars matters and so on? 
 
So that was the only thing but I am... ja, I just wanted to 
clarify that point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, okay. 
MR NHLEKO:  Thank you very much Chair. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  Yes, but the question now after you 
have read that, the question would be, did you do any of 
those things that are alleged in that notice? 
10 
MR NHLEKO:  No, I did not Honourable Chair.  I have 
demonstrated even in the testimony that I led before this 
Commission as to why I did certain things.   
 
What 
informed 
me 
and 
what 
were 
the 
enabling 
instruments for me to take certain positions and/or action in 
relation to certain individuals that got affected and so on. 
 
So at all material times, I acted in the interest of both 
the law and the interest of the public. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  Thank you, Chair.  I have no further 
questions. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much, Mr Mokhari.   
ADV MOKHARI SC:  I am really indebted Chair to the 
Commission and also for giving us the extra two days so that 
we can finish and Mr Nhleko does not have to do the to-and-
fro. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 181 of 239 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  Thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, thank you very much.  I think also the 
Commission is appreciative of the cooperation that both Mr 
Nhleko and yourself, his legal team have given to the 
Commission.   
 
Everything went smoothly.  There were no unnecessary 
interruptions as we were going along and I think that was 
good cooperation.  So thank you very much. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  I appreciate that Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  I think have one or two 
questions that I want to ask Mr Nhleko and maybe one of 
them is of clarification. 
 
You remember yesterday, I think at some stage I have 
asked you about a situation where a report has been given 
but some investigative work must still be done. 
 
If there are two reports, one was provided while there 
was some investigative work still to be done and another one 
was given later when there was no further investigative work 
to be done. 
20 
 
Would you take the first one as a final report or the 
second one as the final report? 
MR NHLEKO:  [laughs]  I ...[indistinct] Chair because I think 
we ...[indistinct] quite a number of times. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughs] Just for the last time. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 182 of 239 
 
MR NHLEKO:  Ja.  No, no, no.  That is for the last time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:  I appreciate that.  It... again, we would have 
to go back to the whole question of your second report, what 
does it intended to do?  Is it nullifying the first report or is 
withdrawing the first report, is it amending the first report? 
 
And it is on the basis of that that as a responsible 
authority you would then take what you think is the 
necessary sort of position in action for that matter. 
 
So that is my understanding Chair.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, thank you very much.   
ADV MOKHARI SC:  Maybe the question should be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja? 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  Sorry, Chairperson.  Maybe the 
question should be, what is your understanding of the legal 
status of the legal status of the IPID reports?  What weight 
do they ordinarily... even have any legal standing or is it one 
of those reports that, as you say, enough experience in 
20 
government which you will ask officials, you know, your 
managers and so on to prepare a report.   
 
If you do not like it, you can say go back and draft 
another one.  Do they have any legal standing in the scheme 
of things? 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 183 of 239 
 
MR NHLEKO:  The IPID investigations reports are very 
serious reports.  Whichever way you want to look at it but 
they are very serious reports.  And indeed, you know, I... 
that is why I also understand this closer connection between 
IPID and the National Prosecuting Authorities because of the 
weight, I mean, the investigative reports that they produced 
from that end. 
 
And I think, whether it was yesterday or the day before 
yesterday, the Chair was also trying to delve into this 
question of what is the actual weight of these reports.  And I 
10 
do maintain, they are very weighty.  They are very important 
and so forth.   
 
Now 
I 
know 
that 
the 
issue 
has 
been... 
is 
the 
22n d of January, the final report or not the final report and so 
forth.  And I maintain that it is a final report.   
 
In fact, that standpoint is also going to be collaborated 
by further evidence that is going to be led eventually before 
this very same Commission about the status of that very 
same report visa vie the report of the 18t h of March.  Thank 
you very much Chair.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.  Thank you very 
much Mr Nhleko for coming to give evidence.  As I said, I 
think earlier this morning or yesterday, the investigations 
continue.   
 
There is no guarantee that we cannot ask you to come 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 184 of 239 
 
back but I think we were able to cover quite some ground 
over the past... ja, over the three days but thank you very 
much for coming forward.  You are excused. 
MR NHLEKO:  No, thank you very much Chair.  I remain 
committed ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  ... to my earlier standpoint of assisting the 
Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, okay. 
MR NHLEKO:  At any given point, if there are matters that 
10 
you think I can clarify this Commission about in relation to 
this particular matter, I am available and committed to do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much. 
MR NHLEKO:  Thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  I am going to... Mr Hulley, I 
am going to take a short adjournment because I have 
another witness to listen to. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Yes.  Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you want to say something? 
ADV HULLEY SC: Well, I was just going to ask that we could 
20 
be excused. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  But once we stand down, we will excuse 
ourselves. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I think if you are able to collect 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 185 of 239 
 
whatever you need to collect while... during the adjournment, 
feel free.  You are excused as well.   
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And then I will remain with Mr Notshe and 
a few people here. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Unfortunately, the lucky ones will leave 
and the unlucky ones will remain.  [laughs]  We will take an 
adjournment up to ten to four.  We will resume at ten to four.  
We adjourn. 
10 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS: 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good afternoon, Mr Notshe, good 
afternoon everybody.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Good afternoon, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you can feel free to take your mask 
off.  I am sorry that you and the witness have had to wait 
for such a long time, it has been a difficult day but I 
appreciate that you are here and I do not think we are 
going to take long so the Commission really apologises for 
20 
any inconvenience, Mr Blake. 
MR BLAKE:  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair, the witness we are calling, the 
genesis of his evidence is the evidence of Mr Agrizzi. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 186 of 239 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  The Chair will remember Mr Agrizzi 
referred to the fact that there were certain bookings that 
were made for persons outside BOSASA employ and he 
gave evidence to the effect that …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I think you should start by saying 
that Mr Blake by establishing – indicating the relationship 
between Blake, Mr Blake and Blake’s Travel and then, of 
course, then what Blake’s Travel was to BOSASA and what 
Agrizzi said and then that connects with how come Mr 
10 
Blake is here. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  Chair, I am just getting there, that 
Mr Agrizzi referred to some travel arrangements and made 
by a company called Blake Travel and that these were the 
travel 
arrangements 
and 
expenses 
of 
BOSASA, 
the 
company, and also travel arrangements that were made for 
people outside BOSASA and, as a result of that, the 
statements was made and obtained from Mr Brian Blake 
who is before the Commission today to testify.  Mr Blake is 
the managing director of the Blake Travel and he has given 
20 
a statement and he will confirm the statement and, most 
importantly, he will also confirm the Commission how he 
came about to also contact the Commission and his 
statement and the invoices relating to the evidence are 
contained in bundle D.  I understand the bundle is before 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 187 of 239 
 
you and the statement is EXHIBIT T18. 
 
Chair, you will notice inside the – once you open 
bundle D you will notice that then the index, there is an 
index and then outside the index there are – there is the 
pagination, the pages start with T15.  That, Chair, refers to 
the – this exhibit was initially T15 but because of the 
changes in the previous hearings it has been moved to T18 
and we have kept it at T15, the pages, just to avoid 
expense of printing other pages, but the page numbers 
remain the same.  So when we refer to witnesses, we will 
10 
refer to BB and then the number. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you remember that when you refer 
to the pages, we do not even mention the letters, we just – 
and there is zero, we just say page 1, page 2, page 3. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  The number itself, yes, ja.  I am just 
mentioning the – correct the issue of T so that it does not 
throw anyone off. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair, Mr Blake is ready to take the 
oath and then we will …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but basically Mr Blake’s evidence 
follows up on Mr Agrizzi’s evidence part of which was that 
BOSASA and other companies under BOSASA used Blake’s 
Travel 
Agency 
for 
making 
travel 
arrangements 
and 
accommodation 
– 
I 
do 
not 
know 
whether 
also 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 188 of 239 
 
accommodation …[intervenes] 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  There accommodation expenses as 
well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Accommodation and that some of the 
persons for whom travelling arrangement were made by 
Blake’s Travel were persons who were in government, 
government officials, and that some of them – and all the 
travelling expenses that were incurred were paid for by 
BOSASA and BOSASA then kept an account with Blake’s 
Travel and the persons that BOSASA asked Blake’s Travel 
10 
to make arrangements for would not pay Blake’s Travel 
themselves but BOSASA would pay for their travelling.  
That is my recollection of that evidence, ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes, that is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and …[intervenes] 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And Chair, BOSASA kept an account 
with Blake Travel.  In addition to the BOSASA account Mr 
Agrizzi also had an account which later changed to a 
Venter account which, as Mr Agrizzi has testified, it was 
the name of his father-in-law. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then later his mother-in-law. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then the invoices would be issued 
for those people. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 189 of 239 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  But the payment would be made by 
BOSASA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Either in cheque or in cash. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, that is fine and Mr Blake will 
correct any of the things that we have said if they are not 
correct. 
MR BLAKE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
You 
can 
administer 
the 
oath 
or 
10 
affirmation? 
MR BLAKE:  Sorry, honourable Chair, I am actually 
Alderman Blake, that makes a difference.  I am Alderman 
Blake, I have a title Alderman, I am sure in the legal – 
Alderman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alderman?   
MR BLAKE:  Correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair, he is the member of the 
municipal council, of a district council. 
CHAIRPERSON:   A what council? 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  A district council? 
CHAIRPERSON:   A district council? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes and they are called Alderman 
and… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alderman? 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 190 of 239 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, how do you spell it, I just want to 
make sure.  You know the noise of the air con competes 
with you. 
MR BLAKE:  Sorry, Chair, it is A-l-d-e-r-m-a-n. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, but that is a title? 
MR BLAKE:  It is a title, like a Councillor. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alderman Blake? 
MR BLAKE:  Ja, it used to be Councillors but after a 
certain number of years you achiever Alderman. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine.  Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Alderman Blake – Chair, can Alderman 
Blake move to – use that microphone? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is fine.  I do not know if the 
other one is working, just – not it is not working. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Then move to this chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think move to the other chair.  You 
want to sanitise?  I think they want to sanitise the chair 
first before you do so.  Please administer the oath or 
affirmation? 
20 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MR BLAKE:    Alderman Brian Douglas Blake. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed affirmation? 
MR BLAKE:  No. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 191 of 239 
 
REGISTRAR:  Do you solemnly affirm that the evidence 
you will give shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing 
else but the truth?  If so, please raise your right hand and 
say I truly affirm. 
MR BLAKE:  I truly affirm. 
REGISTRAR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, you may be seated.  Yes, 
continue, Mr Notshe. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Alderman Blake, can you tell the 
Commission what your relationship between you and Blake 
10 
Travel Agencies? 
MR BLAKE:  My grandmother started Blake’s Travel 
Agency in 1948 after she was Mayoress.  It was a coal and 
wood agency which used to sell coal and wood but after a 
while the railways came and said do you not wish to sell 
rail tickets and sea journeys or voyages back to the UK?  
My grandfather took over, my father took over and I took 
over when my father passed away in 1994.  We are part of 
the Sher Group, my father was very instrumental in getting 
Southern African travel agents together to help get better 
20 
deals on hotels, cars, flights and assistance with having a 
network of 50 plus travel agents. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now, Mr Blake, you know you know 
today your evidence is in relation to the relationship 
between BOSASA and Blake Travel.  When did that start, 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 192 of 239 
 
that relationship start? 
MR BLAKE:  In 1999, 1998.  Home Affairs asked us for 
repatriations, sending immigrants or illegal passengers 
back to their countries and those years Dyambu would 
bring passports and Home Affairs would collect – we had to 
hand write tickets those years, collect the tickets and the 
passports and we would invoice Home Affairs still by 
typewriter.  I remember typing out invoices.  These 
passengers were taken to the airport, put on an aeroplane 
and sent back to their home country.  There were a few 
10 
instances of irregularities.  I remember one Egyptian 
Airline passenger running off the aeroplane endangering 
traffic and being caught and put in the Kempton Park police 
station.  It was quite easy for Home Affairs those years to 
take the people from the Lindela sort of captive camp and 
transport them to the airport to send them back home. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  When you refer to Dyambu, mean 
Dyambu, D-y-a-m-b-u. 
MR BLAKE:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR BLAKE:  Your pronunciation is more – we called it 
Dyambu 
but 
I 
suppose 
the 
African 
word 
would 
be 
…[intervenes] 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  “Jambu” 
MR BLAKE:  “Jambu” yes. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 193 of 239 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And that was the previous name of 
BOSASA, am I correct? 
MR BLAKE:  Correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  Now you made a statement to the 
investigators of the Commission, am I right? 
MR BLAKE:  Yes, I made a statement. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Before you made that statement 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You may keep your mic on, it will not 
disturb anything. 
10 
MR BLAKE:  Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Before you made that statement, what 
had happened maybe between – insofar as the relationship 
between you and BOSASA? 
MR BLAKE:   Well, from 2000 when Dyambu became 
BOSASA between 2000, 2002, 2004 or somewhere there, 
we did not make any statements until 2014 when the 
investigation actually started and my final – well, my 
signed statement was in 2016. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Who took the statement from you? 
20 
MR BLAKE:  Sorry? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Who took the statement? 
MR BLAKE:  Colonel Smit, Christoffel Smit. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Colonel Smit of the South African 
Police? 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 194 of 239 
 
MR BLAKE:  Of the Hawks, yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes, okay.  
MR BLAKE:   Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And now who it did it come for you to 
make a statement to the investigators?   What prompted 
you to come out? 
MR BLAKE:  Well, in 2014 Colonel Smit came to me with a 
certain request and obviously with confidential information, 
this man walked into my office and asked me for all details 
on three specific clients, passengers and I said well, you 
10 
know, I cannot give you that, please – you know, you will 
have to subpoena that or bring me something from the 
police.  I was duly subpoenaed and I took the documents to 
my lawyer and we agreed to cooperate fully with the 
Hawks. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And you also state in your statement 
that – and you know that Mr Agrizzi gave evidence before 
this Commission. 
MR BLAKE:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  About relationship between you, your 
20 
company and BOSASA.  Can you take the Commission 
through that, that relationship, the accounts that were 
opened? 
MR BLAKE:  Well, Mr Agrizzi would - you know, a travel 
agency is quite hard to run, it is not simple.  People can 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 195 of 239 
 
phone you at all hours and BOSASA did, you know, 
especially when vehicles broke down and guards needed 
accommodation and – I think it started off slowly but 
BOSASA began to rely on us because of our, you know, 
superior travel ability of being able to accurately get good 
prices, book people and, you know, when people had to get 
on a flight we found seats, different airlines, and it was 
simple, pick up the phone and book it.  We would get an 
order number for the official BOSASA stuff or Mr Agrizzi or 
Mrs Agrizzi would phone me for the confidential stuff. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Did BOSASA have an account with 
Blake Travel? 
MR BLAKE:  Yes, we had a running account. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Was it one account or many accounts? 
MR BLAKE:  We had the BOSASA accounts and we had 
BOSASA VIP account originally. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  BOSASA? 
MR BLAKE:  VIP. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  What was that for? 
MR BLAKE:  That was basically, I think, at the beginning 
20 
that Mr Agrizzi kept that account for very important 
persons, you know …[intervenes] 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Payments for the bookings made 
through the account, who made those payments? 
MR BLAKE:  First of all, it was BOSASA paying us with two 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 196 of 239 
 
cheques in those years, in the beginning years. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
MR BLAKE:  And then Mr Agrizzi paid with his American 
Express card. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I see. 
MR BLAKE:  And then it changed to the cash bookings. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now you have said to the Commission 
that initially it was BOSASA VIP account.  Did the account 
change? 
MR BLAKE:  Yes. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  To what did it change? 
MR BLAKE:  It was BOSASA VIP to Angelo Agrizzi to C 
Venter, to J J Venter. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now can you turn to the bundle before 
you, bundle B, page 2. 
MR BLAKE:  Alright. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now paragraph 6 to 9 and in paragraph 
9 you were telling the Commission that after Agrizzi’s state 
testimony you contacted the Commission and you told it 
that 
there 
are 
certain 
invoices 
you 
have 
in 
your 
20 
possession, is that correct? 
MR BLAKE:  Correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then you say you handed over the 
invoices to the Commission, is that correct? 
MR 
BLAKE: 
 
I 
handed 
over 
relevant 
invoices 
and 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 197 of 239 
 
documents.  There still may be further documents that the 
Commission may need. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, there are still other documents that 
may show different people who travelled? 
MR BLAKE:  It is very difficult, Judge, because we do not 
know who works for the state and who does not work for 
the state or who… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR BLAKE:  We have quite a bit of data. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR 
BLAKE: 
 
But 
we 
have 
not 
really 
had 
a 
good 
investigation, a thorough investigation into it. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes, 
okay. 
 
So 
but 
you 
have 
documentation, invoices and so on somewhere which, if 
looked into, could well reveal …[intervenes] 
MR BLAKE:  Further …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   People that have not been mentioned. 
MR BLAKE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR BLAKE:  It could be possible, ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Can you tell the Chair …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think that must be explored, if 
possible, to see whether we cannot unearth some more 
people.  So that can be explored – should be explored in 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 198 of 239 
 
due course. 
MR BLAKE:  Fully. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR BLAKE:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now also, Mr Blake, can you also tell 
the Chairperson about what you did to maintain that record 
accurate and safe? 
MR BLAKE:  Yes, Judge, after the – it is quite a difficult 
story because we had an investigation with Colonel Smit 
from 2014 until 2016 till I actually signed the affidavit and I 
10 
was ready to appear with Adv de Kock in court in February 
2016 and the case just disappeared.  Colonel Smit came to 
me and said I will probably testify in 10 years time but he 
has been told the case is now flat.  His direction was for 
three passengers, the three mentioned in the report but 
there is a lot of other people.  We do not know, we do not 
know if those people are involved or not. 
 
What happened thereafter, once Mr Agrizzi began 
testifying, I tried to get hold of the Hawks and I was told 
that the original cloning of my server was stolen, it 
20 
disappeared.  There was guy called Bertus and eventually I 
could not get hold of Colonel Smit and I eventually got hold 
of one of the Hawks in Pretoria who came out and recloned 
my computer in February this year. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  February 2020? 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 199 of 239 
 
MR BLAKE:  Yes, this year. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Mr Blake, this is important for the 
Commission.  Just to explain this, you are saying that when 
initially you were contacted by Colonel Smith they took and 
cloned your hard drive so that they could see all the 
invoices that were made and the two that away. 
MR BLAKE:  Yes, both in 2014 and in 2020. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then you say that when you made 
enquiries after Mr Agrizzi testified you found that that 
evidence had been destroyed, had gotten lost with the 
10 
Hawks? 
MR BLAKE:  I do not know, I spoke to Colonel Smit again 
and he said no, that evidence could not – it is impossible 
for that to happen.  I have contacted him, you know, 
subsequently, and he said that is locked away with the 
Supreme Court, that evidence is locked up. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  But you – and then also you say that 
you – insofar as that evidence of Colonel Smith, you were 
contacted and you were supposed to testify as a witness in 
that case but in the end you never testified? 
20 
MR BLAKE:  Correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I see.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So the documentation that you gave to 
Colonel Smith, would it relate to travelling arrangements 
made under the account of BOSASA or does it involve 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 200 of 239 
 
other people’s accounts with Blakes Travel? 
MR BLAKE:   Chair it was specifically for Mr Mti, Ms Njana 
and Mr Gilliam, Lt Col Smit’s focus was on those three 
passengers and their families. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MR BLAKE:  Obviously there were other people but his 
focus was totally ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That fall under the BOSASA accounts? 
MR BLAKE:   BOSASA or BOSASA associates. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is what I am talking about so I 
10 
think we should try and do whatever we can to be able to 
see if we can get those invoices so that we can see 
whether they are people from government that have not, 
whose names have not been mentioned here, who also 
travelled and got paid for by BOSASA.  So we should 
pursue that.  So you don’t have that documentation with 
you because it was taken by the Hawks? 
MR BLAKE:   No, we still have that – we have still got it.  
Chair also I had a – on the 7 t h, sorry on the 14 t h of 
September I appeared at a tax inquiry which also asked me 
20 
for documentation which I gave through lots of invoices. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR BLAKE:   For them to follow up.  There’s you know 
R40million of travel over six years is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That is involved there. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 201 of 239 
 
MR BLAKE:   It is a lot of work ja, it is a lot of. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Mr Blake just to also maybe just clear, 
when you talk about the evidence that the police took 
away, it is just the cloning of your hard drive, your hard 
drive you still have the original hard drive? 
MR BLAKE:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, then the investigators should just do 
something to check how far we can go in trying to get other 
names of government people or politicians who may have 
10 
travelled under the BOSASA accounts at Blake’s Travel. 
MR BLAKE:   Yes, and also Chair when I spoke to Colonel 
Smit there were other travel agencies involved. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh is that so? 
MR BLAKE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which were paid for by BOSASA, where 
BOSASA had accounts? 
MR BLAKE:   BOSASA or Dr Smit or – I remember a 
receipt made out with no name on it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I think that is important if the 
20 
Commission investigators you can share that information 
with them when they talk to you, they should take it further. 
MR BLAKE:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now Mr – Alderman Blake then whilst 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 202 of 239 
 
we are on page 2 can you just read it for the record, 
paragraph 11, where it deals with your operations with 
BOSASA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well he doesn’t have to read it Mr 
Notshe, you can ask him the question, he knows these 
things, he knows it, it is his business, he has been doing it 
for a long time, he will just tell you. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   From this paragraph it is clear that the 
first thing, the main account opened was for BOSASA 
operations Pty, is that correct? 
10 
MR BLAKE:   Correct it is BOSASA Pty Limited, ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And from my understanding of your 
evidence that was for the operations of BOSASA. 
MR BLAKE:   The general operations of meetings, of 
people, of detainees, of guards, of accommodation, ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then you say that then there was a 
second account which was opened in the name of BOSASA 
Operations VIP, the one you talked about, the VIP account. 
MR BLAKE:   Correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then you say over the years then 
20 
this changed from the BOSASA VIP to the personal account 
of Mr Agrizzi? 
MR BLAKE:   Correct, Mr Agrizzi asked me to change it to 
his name, and ...[intervenes]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then in 2009 it changed to the 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 203 of 239 
 
name of C Venter? 
MR BLAKE:   Correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then 2012 C Venter was closed 
and then a new account of J J Venter. 
MR BLAKE:   Correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   So the invoices you issued were 
issued by Blake Travel will be to these – for VIP travels it 
will be to – the invoice will be VIP and when it changed to 
Agrizzi to Agrizzi, Venter, C Venter and J J Venter. 
MR BLAKE:   Correct. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now if you can turn back to the 
beginning of, Chair the beginning of Exhibit 18, there is an 
index Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At the beginning? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   At the beginning there is an index, it 
says index Exhibit 18. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  There on item 3 to item 22 of that index 
what is indicated in those items, from 3 to 22? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why don’t we go to the page where they 
20 
are? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   They start from page ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it 56? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Let me, before I even go there, Mr 
Blake you confirm that – you have just confirmed that you 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 204 of 239 
 
did issue invoices for a number of people? 
MR BLAKE:   Well you always issue an invoice Chair, it 
was standard procedure, it was VAT or non-VAT related it 
was always to either one of the companies of BOSASA or 
to C Venter or J J Venter.  The record is quite nice in that 
sense that it is quite accurate because on the invoices also 
the reference number to the hotel or the car, or air ticket 
number. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   If we just take one invoice, Annexure 
BB4, starting from page 56 to 57. 
10 
MR BLAKE:   I’ve got big fingers, I’m sorry.  There we go, 
okay.   We have an invoice number BT22804. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes on page 57, and this is the invoice 
is to Mr J J Venter? 
MR BLAKE:   Correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And that is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us start by saying it is on the 
letterhead of Blake’s Travel Agents Pty Limited, is that 
right, Alderman? 
MR BLAKE:   Correct yes Chair and it has got the VAT 
20 
number. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and it is made out to Mr J J Venter? 
MR BLAKE:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you can continue Mr Notshe. 
ADV 
NOTSHE 
SC: 
 
 And 
what 
is 
this 
invoice 
for 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 205 of 239 
 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ... for the date and so on and the 
amounts. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And he date of the invoice? 
MR BLAKE:   That is the invoice the cheque is dated the 
27 t h of January 2016. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And what is the invoice for? 
MR BLAKE:   The invoice is for accommodation at Sun 
City, Sun International Hotel, the Palace. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then who ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, so does this invoice reflect 
that Blake’s Travel had made the booking for somebody to 
stay at Sun International Hotel, the Palace, is that right? 
MR BLAKE:   Chair not always, this one is a little different, 
I remember it that I think it was Mr Dlamini who made this 
reservation and we took it over.  Often somebody will say 
please just hold the room for us, and then we would phone 
in and say right we’re taking over, we need your bank 
details, we will pay by credit card or we will pay you by 
EFT. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   If it was Mr Dlamini was that supposed 
to be your client? 
MR BLAKE:  Mr Sivion Dlamini worked for ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, for BOSASA, Sivion Dlamini for 
BOSASA? 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 206 of 239 
 
MR BLAKE:   Ja, correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So he had made, initially he made, he 
asked your travel agency to make a booking. 
MR BLAKE:  Take over the booking. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And was that in respect of himself or in 
respect of somebody else? 
MR BLAKE:   I think it was first in the name of Mr Bipape 
and then it was changed to his secretary, Jade Aaron. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR BLAKE:   I presume that was how it – it was a sort of 
10 
emergency case where Sun International doesn’t just hold 
rooms, you have to pay them, you’re quite – very tough on 
– and we paid them and we invoiced J J Venter who paid 
us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Mr Notshe? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes and then the amount of the invoice 
at the bottom it is R16 178,89, correct? 
MR BLAKE:   Correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then you paid Sun International 
and then how were you paid? 
20 
MR BLAKE:   I was paid cash by Mr Agrizzi from J J 
Venter.  All J J Venter invoices were reconciled and cash 
was collected for this. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then the next invoice is on page 
58, actually the invoice itself starts on page 59.  Is it 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 207 of 239 
 
correct the invoice is in the letterheads of Blake Travels, in 
the tax invoice by Blake Travel? 
MR BLAKE:   Correct, it is our invoice. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes and to whom is it invoiced? 
MR BLAKE:   To Mr K Mokonyane. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And what is this invoice for? 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Well 
the 
invoice 
is 
to 
BOSASA 
Operations Pty Limited isn’t it, it is directed to them? 
MR BLAKE:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but in respect of? 
10 
MR BLAKE:  Budget Car Hire, a car rental. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, for whose benefit? 
MR BLAKE:   It says for a Mr K Mokonyane, but sometimes 
the people get it wrong when the invoice ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Could that be a Miss? 
MR BLAKE:   It could be.  Judge what happens is we would 
give a voucher through so there is a whole lot of 
documentation that goes with this, there is a car voucher, 
it would then be rented out, the bill would come back to us 
and then we will do the invoice after we’d received the bill. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR BLAKE:   So it could be that the car hire company 
made the error and we just did the invoice after that but 
the person renting the car would have had to give their ID 
and their driver ’s license. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 208 of 239 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now on the following page, on page 
16, is again an invoice by Blake’s Travel Agency and to Mr 
J J Venter, and this is for Budget Car, and the description 
is Ms K Mokonyane with the amount of 517. 
MR BLAKE:   This Chair relates to a traffic fine. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And who paid for this? 
MR BLAKE:   It was Mr J J Venter, well Mr Agrizzi through 
cash to J J Venter ’s account. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see.  And then the following one at 
page 61 is again an invoice to Mr J J Venter, the driver is 
10 
Ms K Mokonyane and the amount is R287. 
MR BLAKE:   Again a traffic fine, also paid by Mr Agrizzi 
cash through his J J Venter account. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then the next one is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You may, I think for the sake of 
completeness we can cover the charge as well, to say it 
was on that date addressed to so and so in respect of so 
and so and this was the charge, so it makes it easier to 
know what was spent on a particular individual if there is a 
repeat. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair will it also make it easier if 
instead of going through the invoices if the Chair were to 
look at – starting from page 32, page 32 has a spreadsheet 
of the amounts paid and the triple paid and it then in one 
place covers the expenses that were paid by Blake Travel 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 209 of 239 
 
and then compensated by BOSASA.  Now Chair this 
spreadsheet is then backed up by the invoices that I was 
taking the witnesses through. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  So it can be safe if one goes through 
this spreadsheet knowing that this is covered by the 
invoices. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No that is fine then. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Mr Blake just to put it on record let’s 
go to page 32. 
10 
MR BLAKE:   Alright. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Just hold, put your hand on page 32 
and then this goes up to page 55. 
MR BLAKE:   Right. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And now am I correct to say that this 
spreadsheet is sort of a summary of the invoices that were 
issued by Blake Travel and it sets out the service provider, 
the invoice number, the date of the invoice, the addressee, 
the 
person 
to 
whom 
the 
invoice 
was 
addressed, 
a 
description of the invoice and the amount and then at the 
20 
bottom, at the right hand it tells the Commission where the 
invoice is in the bundle, am I correct? 
MR BLAKE:   It is a very good summary Chair of the 
clients that we have identified but there may be further 
people on that J J Venter account that they have fallen 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 210 of 239 
 
through the cracks. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I see, but for now what is on page 32 to 
page 55 is covered by the invoices that are in this file?   
MR BLAKE:   Correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now in order to save time but still 
maintain the evidence I will just refer you – I would like 
you just to read you know that there is – item number one 
we have dealt with it, it is to demonstrate also for the 
Chairperson 
item 
number 
one, 
the 
supplier 
is 
Sun 
International, it is the invoice we had looked at, then 
10 
there’s the invoice number, the date of the invoice and the 
invoice, your invoice addressed to J J Venter and the 
description is Sun International Hotel, the Palace and then 
the number and then the dates and then if the guest was J 
D Orin, and then the amount is R60 178,47. 
MR BLAKE:   49 cents yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   49 cents, is that correct? 
MR BLAKE:   Correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And the invoice is the one we went 
through. 
20 
MR BLAKE:   BT22804.    
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes, and then the next person is 
Katleho Mokonyane and there the supplier is in all the 
items it’s Budget Car and you have under the invoices 
invoice numbers and then the dates of the invoices and 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 211 of 239 
 
then the invoice is addressed to BOSASA Pty on J J Venter 
and there are a number of items and the total amount is 
R69 497,25, is that correct? 
MR BLAKE:   25 cents yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now Mr Blake on the – where the 
invoice is addressed to BOSASA Operations who paid for 
those invoices after you  paid them 
MR BLAKE:   BOSASA would collect all the invoices under 
BOSASA and pay us monthly by EFT. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   You were paid by BOSASA directly? 
10 
MR BLAKE:   Correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then ones for J J Venter? 
MR BLAKE:   J J Venter was also lumped together in 
months or two months or three months and paid cash. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see. And then below that you have 
the invoices for Mohamed Morad.  Before that Chair can 
you go back to – do you know who is Katleho Mokonyane 
for whom the BOSASA and J J Venter booked for? 
MR BLAKE:   I remember the – my, one of the girls in front 
was saying that they desperately needed a type of a car for 
20 
the Minister ’s daughter, so she managed to get a car 
through Budget Car Hire because none of the car hire 
companies actually had that car that they were looking for, 
so I guess they sort of knew it was important to get a car 
for this person because BOSASA was really wanting us to 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 212 of 239 
 
find the right vehicle, ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then we saw when we were 
looking at the invoices themselves that there were the 
amounts of R517 and the amount of R287 were fines. 
MR BLAKE:   Correct, they’re traffic fines, they would 
come through Budget Car Hire or the car hire company and 
obviously the Traffic Department fine the car hire company 
and then pass the bill onto us. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then – but for those you say Mr 
Agrizzi paid cash for those. 
10 
MR BLAKE:   He paid cash for those ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And they were not paid by the person 
to whom ...[intervenes]  
MR BLAKE:   No, the cash, the cash would have been, if 
there was an invoice for it it would have been tallied and 
paid by Mr Agrizzi or Ms Agrizzi, cash. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now then the next person is Mohamed 
Morad, do you know who this person is? 
MR BLAKE:   Not a clue, sorry.   I reckon if I know or if 
I’ve met 30% of my passengers from various companies 
20 
throughout the world that’s doing well, but often companies 
will ask us to book for individuals, we get a copy of their 
passports quite often and we would make reservations for 
them but we would never meet them.    
You know it is – we were – in the electronic age now 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 213 of 239 
 
we are not in the old travel agency.  You know walk in, have 
a cup of tea and discuss a cruise.  It is, get me on an 
aeroplane, get me this hotel, get me that car you know it is. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  But in a situation like this where the 
booking is made under the name of JJ Venter. 
MR BLAKE:  Right. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Who would then give you the name of 
the passenger or the person from whom the – for whom the 
booking is made? 
MR BLAKE:  It would generally come from Mr Agrizzi or Ms 
10 
Agrizzi and it would either be sms or phone through but we 
would have checked the spelling very carefully. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then there is the two bookings and 
the amount is R3 351.44 cents. 
MR BLAKE:  Correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And the next item is for Dudu Myeni and 
co travellers. 
MR BLAKE:  Right. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And these invoices – all the invoices 
seem to have been made by Mr JJ Venter.  Were made – the 
20 
invoices were made to JJ Venter. 
MR BLAKE:  Correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And the invoices on this spreadsheet 
starts from page 32 up to 33 with the total amount of 
R101 071 – R101 718,03. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 214 of 239 
 
MR BLAKE:  Correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then when we look at – on page 32 
when you look at the description it says Dudu Myeni and co 
travellers.  And then there is a description of Sheraton 
Hotel PTA and then guests Dudu Myeni, Katherine Dawson 
and then on the same column is Dudu Myeni, Dudu 
Zelewene, Katherine Dawson, Sheraton Hotel.  And you say 
these name would come from Mr Agrizzi – Mr or Ms Agrizzi? 
MR BLAKE:  Correct.  The PTA stands for Pretoria so that 
is the Sheraton Hotel Pretoria. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  The PTA? 
MR BLAKE:  Is Pretoria. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Oh I see.  And then over the page we 
see again there is Sheraton Hotel Pretoria Dudu Myeni, 
Katherine Dawson and in the following one which may 
explain other items it has got TIC like a ticket number – 
there is a number.  Is that a ticket number?  On Item 3. 
MR BLAKE:  Yes that is a ticket number. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then passenger Katherine Dawson 
and then route T&B MQP Nelspruit.  Is that the route 
20 
Johannesburg to Nelspruit? 
MR BLAKE:  Correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then there are a whole host of other 
items up to item 22.   
MR BLAKE:  Correct. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 215 of 239 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair I will not waste your time to refer 
to it but they are referred there by the witness.  And then 
over the … 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not remember that you asked me to 
admit his affidavit. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair I would – well I was hoping at the 
end of – after he has testified to confirm the correctness of 
the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us do it now.  The affidavit of Mr Brian 
Douglas Blake deposed to on – on the 28 November 2019 
10 
will be marked – admitted and marked as Exhibit T18? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Is Bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it still T18? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  It is in Bundle D. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no the Exhibit is different from the 
bundle. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  T18. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja T18.  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Together with the annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja together with its annexures.  Okay.  It is 
20 
important to also mark on its face at the top Exhibit T18.  Ja 
so that it is known that that is Exhibit T18. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  At the top of? 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the top of the page – of the first page of 
the affidavit. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 216 of 239 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Oh I see. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Exhibit T18.  I think when – when it is done 
Ms Olivier can mark the one that is with the witness later on.  
Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now Mr Blake we were on page 33. 
MR BLAKE:  Right. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then there is then the heading of 
Trevor Fourie at the last – last entry on page 33. 
MR BLAKE:  Page 34. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No page 33.  It starts on page 33 – at 
10 
the bottom. 
MR BLAKE:  Trevor Fourie the heading yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Trevor Fourie and then the invoices in 
relating to Trevor Fourie they are on page 34 am I correct? 
MR BLAKE:  Correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then there is again it is booked by 
JJ Venter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I – I am at page 33 but where? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  At the bottom – at the foot of page 33 
Chair will notice there is… 
20 
MR BLAKE:  In blue Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  An entry in blue on page 33. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Well I think I will write here 
because the rest relating to him  
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Is on page 34. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 217 of 239 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is on the next page.  Trevor Fourie.  Yes 
okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Mr Blake if one goes through all these – 
the spreadsheet up to page 55 one will follow it is on the 
blue it is the name of the person who was the – who the 
booking was made for and then the details of the booking 
follow that.  And then at the end of that column will be then 
the amount, the value of the entire booking. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is correct ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And as you had said previously and then 
10 
that is backed by the – by the invoices that are attached to 
your affidavit? 
MR BLAKE:  Correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now on page 55. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry do you say 55? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can we go back to 35 before you go to 55?  
Alderman Blake if you look at page 35 you will see that there 
in the middle you have got the name C Frolick, can you see 
that? 
20 
MR BLAKE:  Page 5? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 35. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  85. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  35. 
MR BLAKE:  35.   
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 218 of 239 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  On the – let me – look on page 35 look 
on the blue on the [indistinct 00:54:8]. 
MR BLAKE:  Page 75.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:  35 
MR BLAKE:  35 apology.  35 right. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  35 right. 
MR BLAKE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes can you see the name Frolick – SC 
Frolick there? 
MR BLAKE:  Correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know – would you know what the 
full name is or would you just know C Frolick in terms of your 
company with somebody – with a guest? 
MR BLAKE:  No Mr Cheeky Watson told me his name was Mr 
Cedric Frolick. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Cedric Frolick. 
MR BLAKE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what you were told when they were 
booking? 
MR BLAKE:  When they were booking ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR BLAKE:  It should appear on the hotel invoice as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR BLAKE:  And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not remember any other Frolick that 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 219 of 239 
 
you might have – it is just this? 
MR BLAKE:  No he was quite… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it only this one? 
MR BLAKE:  He was quite tied up with the Eastern Province 
Rugby ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR BLAKE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now I see that when you see – look under 
his name there there was a booking for him at the City Lodge 
O R Tambo Online Club for the period for accommodation for 
10 
the period 10 June 2010 to 12 June 2010.  And then the next 
booking was on – was at City Lodge O R Tambo and guest to 
Mr C Frolick then that – the accommodation then was for 21 
August 2010 to 22 August 2010.  And then – all these 
booking appear to have been connected with rugby.  The 
third one is for Frolick C on 10 December 2010 to 12 
December 2010.  And then the next one is – oh why does it 
look like that?  Three which have the same date.  There is 
the third one is 10 December 2010 to 12 December 2010. 
The next one is for the same accommodation.  The third one 
20 
is for the same accommodation. Does that mean he stayed 
consecutively on those days – for those days and if – or 
there was an extension or why – why do you have it that way 
there? 
MR BLAKE:  I am not sure Chair.  We would have to check 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 220 of 239 
 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but you see what I am talking about? 
MR BLAKE:  I see that yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair would it help if we turn to page 
114? 
CHAIRPERSON:  114? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  114. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  These are the starting from 114 these 
are the invoices of Mr Frolick and am I correct?  Alderman. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Starting from 114. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the dates are the same.  And I do not 
know if the… 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Look at what the Chair is referring you to 
is? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The place is the same as well. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  On page – it starts on page 116 and 117.  
And what the Chair is referring to is there is – the date is 23 
December 2010 and the Town Lodge Mr C Frolick and at the 
20 
bottom – if you look at the description the date is the same. 
MR BLAKE:  It could be Chair.  There could have been more 
than one room booked in his name.  That is why we must go 
back and check the invoice from the Town Lodge in George 
to see why we invoiced. Because we would invoice against 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 221 of 239 
 
an invoice from the Town Lodge.  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it could be that he booked two rooms. 
MR BLAKE:  Two or three rooms. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or three rooms okay.  Okay alright.  I think 
it would be good if that clarification can be obtained.  Okay 
alright.  Okay that is what I wanted to check at – at.  But that 
– ja that total, the total for him there at page 35 is 
R13 990.44.  Okay I think we can continue. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair the evidence I have led so far was 
either to demonstrate how one can never get through the 
spreadsheet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  With your leave can I take the witness to 
page 55? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is fine. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Alderman can you go to page 55. 
MR BLAKE:  Page 55. Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Page 55 and at the bottom the last entry 
20 
there is the total amount that was booked for – by JJ Venter 
of BOSASA and that amount if I say it amounts to 
R1 234 481.11 is that correct? 
MR BLAKE:  That is correct.  But Chair must also remember 
that the JJ Venter account – ja the Chair the JJ Venter 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 222 of 239 
 
account Agrizzi actually thought that that was his account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR BLAKE:  So a lot of his private stuff. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR BLAKE:  So over the period it was closer to R4 million 
than R1.2 million.  But a lot of it was you know family and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BLAKE:  Not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BLAKE:  But there could be stuff that we missed here. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:  The R1.2 is in relation to people who are 
not Mr Agrizzi’s family? 
MR BLAKE:  Correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And these people – the people who are 
appearing on the description of the invoice did not pay for 
this but Mr Agrizzi of BOSASA paid for it? 
MR BLAKE:  Correct.  Okay ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now there is also an item that I would 
like you to tell the commission about it.  Mr Agrizzi in his 
20 
statement he gave evidence to the effect that when there 
were problems he came to your company and then – you 
deal with it on page 21 of your statement.   
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Page 21 Chair. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 223 of 239 
 
MR BLAKE:  Page 21. 
CHAIRPERSON:  21 okay.  Ja continue. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And you say there that you heard in the 
news that Mr Agrizzi says that he came to your company and 
took five computers of Blakes Travel and buried them 
somewhere. 
MR BLAKE:  Yes Chair that had me worried because I could 
not figure out how he could do that.  First of all we have 
proven that it is none of the evidence.   
a. We still have the evidence on our computers.   
10 
b. If you did take a travel agents computer you have to 
reprogram it with certain items and you have to have a 
certain IP address and you have to have an email 
address and it just – it is just nonsense. 
There is no way that that could have happened.  I just 
cannot – even my IT expert made a statement to say that 
that is impossible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it possible that certain computers were 
taken and were buried somewhere, destroyed and buried 
somewhere but that did not necessarily mean all that 
20 
information that was in the computers was lost.  You still 
could get the information technologically? 
MR BLAKE:  Chair I think Mr Agrizzi must – that was not his 
only statement.  I heard he also buried computers in Port 
Elizabeth and a couple of other sort of things too so I think 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 224 of 239 
 
he forgot.  I think he did not tick the box because he – he 
might have buried the BOSASA computers there because I 
know 
they 
were 
changing 
invoices 
from 
what 
I 
hear 
afterwards.  But no.  You are welcome to have a look at my 
computers.  They can go back.  They can check them.  I – 
none of my staff remember ever getting new computers.  I 
mean surely, they would know if they got a new computer.  It 
is just highly, highly unlikely.  And welcome to come and 
check and prove it.  And then why have I got all my invoices?  
He could have taken my server if he wanted to destroy 
10 
evidence.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that should be taken further with Mr 
Agrizzi?  That should be pursued with Mr Agrizzi to tell me 
what … 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  His evidence is refuted by… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and hear what he has to say.  Ja. 
MR BLAKE:  Oh thanks Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR BLAKE:  I think he just forgot to tick the box. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
MR BLAKE:  You know.  He was this and that and destroy 
this and do this and do this but you know when – they raided 
BOSASA in 2006 they did not come to me.  But they took all 
of BOSASA information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 225 of 239 
 
MR BLAKE:  They did not come to me.  Only in 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BLAKE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now on page 15 of your – of the record 
and of your statement you sort of deal with the issue that 
was raised by the Chair… 
CHAIRPERSON:  On what page? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Page 15. 
CHAIRPERSON:  15 okay.  Well before we proceed, I think I 
10 
have got to ask this.  Alderman Blake, I know from page 44 
to page 50 there are... the name L Mti appears very 
frequently.  I mean, Mr L Mti from... ja, Mr L... or Mr R Mti, 
he must be appearing, I am taking a guess, more than twenty 
times. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Perhaps ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  What does... what must I make of that?  
That he was travelling a lot under the BOSASA account? 
MR BLAKE:  From what I understand Chair, Mr Mti as Mr 
Richard Mti which as Mr Agrizzi referred to him, is actually 
20 
Mr Desmond Linda Mti which was referred to me. 
 
Plus his history was given to me by the lieutenant 
colonel and it is quite interesting.  But yes, very much Mr 
Agrizzi would find me with the family in the Port Elizabeth, 
the flights to Port Elizabeth, the car hire. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 226 of 239 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  It say twenty times.  That might be 
...[intervenes]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:  [Indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:  ...an underestimation.  It might even be 
fifty times.  I am not sure it is ...[intervenes]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair, it goes to a 138 times. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  138 times. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It appears 138 times? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  [Indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:  The total amount.  Am I correct, the total 
amount is R 786 867,32. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that what...? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  On page 51. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, what you paid in regard to Mr Mti? 
MR BLAKE:  It is probably more. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is probably more? 
MR BLAKE:  Because these are... these are only from 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, 
20 
MR BLAKE:  I am not sure if there is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, there may be a lot or more before 
that. 
MR BLAKE:  Ja, but at least that amount, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I think he left Correctional Services if I 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 227 of 239 
 
recall the evidence of Mr Agrizzi correctly.  He left 
Correctional Services around 2007/2008 or 2006 or there 
about.  But of course, I think the... it may well be that the 
relationship between BOSASA and him continued. 
MR BLAKE:  I think Mr Watson’s ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, by mister... ja. 
MR BLAKE:  ...relationship is quite well determined by 
Lieutenant Colonel Smit ...[indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  Mr Notshe. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  So whilst you are on that Chair, it is... on 
10 
page 44 ...[indistinct], you will see there it is... the heading 
is Mr Linda Mti and Ms T Njana. 
MR BLAKE:  Correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Is that right? 
MR BLAKE:  Correct, ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then if you turn to page... or the 
reason... is that... is the reason why you mention those 
together, were they travelling together now? 
MR BLAKE:  No, Ms Njana is actually his wife but under 
custom.  Mr Njana was advised to me to be a SITA officer, as 
20 
well as, working for government.  I think the name was still 
in the passport as Njana.  That is why we ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, you used it. 
MR BLAKE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 228 of 239 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then on page 51, you then see again 
Ms Njana standing alone.  And then those bookings, there 
are about 36 of them, they amount to R 172 962,52 on page 
53. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is that total?  Page 63? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No, five three Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Five three? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Five three. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  It is R 172 962,52.  Am I correct? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But...[intervenes]  
MR BLAKE:  Yes, well, Ms T Njana. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Ms T Njana, yes. 
MR BLAKE:  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then again, you see the name of Mr 
Linda Mti just below that.  Mti and Ms T Njana ...[indistinct]  
Then their expense goes over the page to page 54 and the 
amount there is R 171 992,06.  Do you confirm that? 
MR BLAKE:  Ja, R 171 992,06.  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But as you say it could be more? 
20 
MR BLAKE:  It could be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR BLAKE:  It could be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now if we go back Chair to the... on 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 229 of 239 
 
page 15, one five.  I just need you to clarify.  There is an 
issue.  It was raised by the Chairperson regarding the 
travelling of Mr Frolick.  
MR BLAKE:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  You say there in your statement that the 
first two invoices were paid by Eastern Cape Rugby but you 
say, you are not aware of the internal arrangements between 
them and Mr Frolick. 
MR BLAKE:  There is an email further one which I think sort 
of says that Mr Watson did not want Eastern Province Rugby 
10 
to pay for it but for Mr Agrizzi to pay for it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat that?  Who paid for Mr Frolick? 
MR BLAKE:  Originally it was Eastern Province Rugby. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BLAKE:  I think the invoice was made out to them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR BLAKE:  But further down the line, there is an email 
from Mr Watson asking Mr Agrizzi to pay for it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is the email in this bundle. 
MR BLAKE:  I think it is. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Can you look at page 14? 
CHAIRPERSON:  One four? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  One four. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does it start somewhere? 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 230 of 239 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes, the email on paragraph 28.6. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Is that what you are talking about now? 
MR BLAKE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where does it start?  Let us go where it 
starts first, the document.  The document at page 13.  It 
looks like it is a continuation of a document, does it not? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  It is on page 14 Chair, he is discussing 
Invoice 27255. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but what I want is, where does this 
10 
document begin? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  The document we are looking at? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  This is his affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, this is part of his affidavit.  Oh, okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  It is on page.... ja, it starts on page 1, 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and what paragraph? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now, it is on paragraph, page 14, 
paragraph... He, here, he is discussing Invoice 27255 and 
20 
then he explains on page... no, on paragraph 28.6.  Then he 
says: 
“In respect of Invoice 27255, I have provided the 
Commission with the email correspondence which is 
attached as BB111.  Seven extracts from the email 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 231 of 239 
 
are as follows.” 
 
From here again, Smit sent 14 December 2010, 05:11 
p.m. to Angelo Agrizzi subject:   
“Forward invoice from Shop Blake’s Travel (Pty) Ltd.  
Attachments to be emailed pdf...”   
 
Then in “inverted commas”:   
“Angelo, he told me that this invoice must also be paid 
by BOSASA.  Please advise ...[indistinct]  
 
Is that the invoice... the email that you are talking 
about? 
10 
MR BLAKE:  Ja, that was the email where Cheeky was 
asking those invoices to be paid by BOSASA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know who is being referred to there 
as Cheeky or would you not know? 
MR BLAKE:  Cheeky Watson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Cheeky Watson? 
MR BLAKE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, he was... he is Mr Gavin Watson’s 
brother. 
MR BLAKE:  Correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR BLAKE:  From the Eastern Cape Rugby. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so this email was from Mr Smit who 
was part of BOSASA addressed to Mr Agrizzi and saying 
that... telling Mr Agrizzi that Mr Cheeky Watson had told him 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 232 of 239 
 
that the invoice should be paid for by BOSASA.  That is what 
it says, right? 
MR BLAKE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then did BOSASA pay the invoice?  
You will not... 
MR BLAKE:  I am not sure.  You know, we are talking 2010.  
I would presume that we would have to re-invoice it and 
change the invoice.  So it is... or it could have been that 
cash was given for that invoice and just square it off 
10 
...[indistinct]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And now... and then ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  You may not be able to say anything about 
this.  I understood, I think from either Mr Frolick’s affidavit or 
from someone else’s affidavit in this Commission that some 
of the trips that were being said to have been paid for by 
BOSASA in respect of Mr Frolick in Gauteng were for him 
when he came to Gauteng to attend rugby.  So but I see that 
here... it looks in 2010.  It looks like it was for the Soccer 
World Cup.

MR BLAKE:  It was for the World Cup.  
CHAIRPERSON:  That was for the Soccer World Cup? 
MR BLAKE:  Ja, correct.  In fact, there is more documents 
that Mr Nixon asked me for which is investigating. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, is that so?  So could we have that. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 233 of 239 
 
MR BLAKE:  I have sent it to him already. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, is that one of the investigators Mr 
Notshe? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Mr Nixon is one of the one investigators, 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, he is looking into that? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  This is Chair on... when there was a 
follow up on the statement of Mr Frolick about the travelling 
10 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  ...to Port Elizabeth. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  It is the follow up.  That evidence will be 
presented before Mr Frolick testifies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no, no.  That is fine.  Can we 
also check whether there might be any chance that your 
records could still have whatever bookings may have been 
made for Mr Agrizzi.   
20 
 
I do not know whether that was in 2010 when he said he 
travelled to Port Elizabeth to meet with one of Mr Gavin 
Watson’s brothers and Mr Frolick.  If it is 2010, your records 
could still have that. 
MR BLAKE:  Yes, we would have had invoices to it.  I did 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 234 of 239 
 
note 
that 
in 
2010 
because 
it 
was 
the 
World 
Cup 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, you would still have them. 
MR BLAKE:  There are invoices but it might not be very 
much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m? 
MR BLAKE:  There was not a lot of activity in 2010 with 
BOSASA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR BLAKE:  But a lot of it was done with FIFA and I will 
10 
have records. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You might have? 
MR BLAKE:  I just have to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  You will have records. 
MR BLAKE:  ...check and see if they were done with us or 
FIFA paid for them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
MR BLAKE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think and the investigators... Mr Notshe, 
maybe you are working on this.  That the trip that maybe 
20 
disputed that Mr Agrizzi talked about when he said he went 
to ...[intervenes]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Port Elizabeth. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...Port Elizabeth and met with... I do not 
know whether Mr Cheeky Watson or ...[intervenes]  
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 235 of 239 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  It is Mr Willem Swarts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, Willem Swart and ...[intervenes]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Willem Swarts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...Mr Frolick.  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  Alright.  Thank you. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  [Indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  You may continue. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  And on page 16 of your statement, 
you deal with the booking of Mr Syvion Dlamini.  On page 16. 
10 
MR BLAKE:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Do you know who Mr Dlamini is. 
MR BLAKE:  Yes, I have met him? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Who is he? 
MR BLAKE:  He stays in Lock Crescent ...[indistinct] I think, 
number 8 or close by there.  He was a regular from BOSASA. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I see.  And I see there is a booking here 
but also, the invoice was sent to JJ Venter. 
MR BLAKE:  Correct.  So one of the bookings that were sort 
of kept hush-hush were JJ Venter bookings.  They were 
20 
always bookings that were not on the BOSASA account. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I see.  And paid for by... 
MR BLAKE:  By Mr Agrizzi. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Mr Agrizzi.  Now on page 17 of your 
statement, then you have got a whole list of people and you 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 236 of 239 
 
say this is some of the individuals under them, other than 
the ones you have testified about and other than Mr 
Gillingham and Mr Mti and then a whole list of them about 15 
of those. 
MR BLAKE:  Correct.  There is 16 people that appear on the 
JJ Venter account. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So just to go back to Mr Frolick.  I see 
from your affidavit that some payments... payment for some 
of his travel arrangements made through Blake’s Travel were 
10 
paid for by the Eastern Cape Rugby Union. 
 
And I see that on some stage, he apparently deposed or 
...[indistinct] check himself for somebody that I think he may 
have been with.  [laughs] 
MR BLAKE:  The notion or one of the lady rugby players of 
the Eastern Province, you know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.   
MR BLAKE:  He paid for her ticket, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So some payments were originally made by 
the Eastern Cape Rugby Onion ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR BLAKE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then but later on, BOSASA paid for 
some? 
MR BLAKE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  From the top of your head, 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 237 of 239 
 
are you able to say whether there many that were paid for by 
BOSASA or you are not able to say it? 
MR BLAKE:  I think, Mr Daniel Watson and Cheeky Watson, 
he would get his way with the payments although Mr Agrizzi 
was not very happy about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BLAKE:  Or it would come from his accounts.  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughs]  Okay. 
MR BLAKE:  But Agrizzi would probably be able to verify it 
more than... 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR BLAKE:  I would have to go back and triple check my 
books on that, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No, that is fine.  Mr Notshe. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then the rest of the affidavit, it then 
deals 
with 
your 
interaction 
with 
the 
bookings 
of 
Mr 
Gillingham and Mr Mti and those are also covered by the 
invoices that are attached and they are also on the spread 
sheet.  Am I correct? 
MR BLAKE:  Correct. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Insofar as Mr Gillingham, it is on page 
19, you deal with the table that deals with Mr Gillingham 
there.  Is that correct? 
MR BLAKE:  Page 19, Mr Gillingham.  Correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Page 19. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 238 of 239 
 
MR BLAKE:  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Is that the table that deals with travelling 
bookings of Mr Gillingham? 
MR BLAKE:  Correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And now who booked for Mr Gillingham? 
MR BLAKE:  Mr Agrizzi would have booked for them.  I do 
see one payment was paid by Mr Mansell or not... two 
payments were paid by Mr Mansell and others were paid by 
Mr Agrizzi.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Did he receive any payment from... 
10 
directly from Mr Gillingham? 
MR BLAKE:  No.  Okay, wait.  Let me check. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair, except for the investigations that 
Chair has indicated, that is the evidence of the witness. 
MR BLAKE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you have covered the important 
parts. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  Chair, and also just for the record.  
The people that I mentioned that are affected by the 
evidence, they were given the what we term the Rule 3.3. 
20 
Notices in respect of the witness of this witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  Thank you very much A Blake 
for 
coming 
to 
give 
evidence 
and 
for 
assist 
us, 
the 
Commission. 
MR BLAKE:  Yes. 
29 JULY 2020 – DAY 240 
 
Page 239 of 239 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  We appreciate it very much.  We may ask 
you to come back if there is a need but we will not bother 
you if we have got everything.   
 
But from what the queries are raised, I think probably 
the Commission’s investigators will still be in touch with you.  
But thank you very much for coming to give evidence.  
Otherwise, you are excused.   
 
And once again, thank you for being prepared to wait for 
the whole day but thank you very much. 
MR BLAKE:  Thanks.  Chair, we have been waiting for six 
10 
years to get this thing sorted out. [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughs]  No, thank you very much. 
MR BLAKE:  But that is how we could ...[indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, that is fine.  I think we will 
adjourn then for the day.  Tomorrow I have two or so 
witnesses at ten o’clock.  So but for the day we are 
adjourned.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 30 JULY 2020
