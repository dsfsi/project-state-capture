PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 19 FEBRUARY 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Hofmeyr, good morning everybody. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Good morning Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes are we ready? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We are indeed.  Chair this morning there is first 
a matter of an application for the first witness to give his evidence in-
camera.  I use that term loosely again as I did previously this week 
because there are only specific respects in which the witness seeks not 
to have his identity disclosed.   
 
He is however legally represented and I would like to offer an 
10 
opportunity for my learned friend to introduce himself and move that 
application if I may? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   Morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:    My name is Advocate David Mtsweni I 
practice with the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just raise your voice 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   My name is Advocate David Mtsweni I practice 
with the Pretoria Society of Advocates. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   On brief by the office of the State Attorney on 
behalf of a witness to be known as Mr Y for the record purposes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   Chair – Chairperson in a nutshell the reasons 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 3 of 190 
 
for why the – Mr Y’s evidence ought to be… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before that I have got an – I have got – is this a 
duplication or what?  Oh ja I have got two files that appear to be the 
same on the outside.  Let me see. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   Chair I am told that the other one has got the 
– is redacted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   The other one is un-redacted – the un-
redacted version. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
10 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   And it should have almost… 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is just that I have got what I thought would have 
been a reference being the same SEQ02.2020 for both of them.  But the 
one you are moving is I think this other one the identity of – oh well the 
person has deposed to the founding affidavit there has got a name. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then there is this one which has got an affidavit with 
the name and certain particulars blocked out. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   Yes that is the un – that is the redacted 
version. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now – so the application is being brought by the 
State Security Agency? 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   Yes on… 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 4 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that correct? 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   That is correct Chairperson.  The reasons 
Chairperson… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you see – it is tricky because the application is 
being brought by the State Security Agency and not by the person 
himself or herself.  But the founding affidavit is by the person himself.  
In the founding affidavit it does not say that the Applicant is the State 
Security Agency.  It is just that in the heading it says:  The State 
Security Agency of the Republic of South Africa Applicant. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   We – Chairperson we used the agency by 
10 
virtue of the agency being his employer but the best person to – can 
explain to you Chairperson the reasons why he evidence ought to be – 
should be in-camera would be the deponent himself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I am not there yet.  I am not on the merits of the 
application.  I am on the Applicant.  I am saying that I need to know 
who the Applicant is first.  Now the – the one that I dealt with two days 
ago – two days ago the Applicant was Mr X.  So Mr X brought the 
application.  Now here the heading suggests that the applicant is the 
State Security Agency.  Now you cannot just decide that because you 
are employed by the State Security Agency you are going to bring 
20 
proceedings in the name of the State Security Agency.  You know.  
There has got to be more than that.  Are you authorised to bring the 
application on behalf of the State Security Agency? 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   He tells you that Chairperson at paragraph 1.3 
of the affidavit. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 5 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well what he says there in 1.3 is also – reads very 
strangely.  I have the necessary locus standi and authority to depose to 
this affidavit and to launch the present application.  Now it does not do 
what is normally done.  I bring this application on behalf of the State 
Security Agency and I am duly authorised by reason of bla, bla, bla, 
bla, bla.  So when you read part of 1.3 it is like he is bringing it himself 
because otherwise if the application is being brought by the State 
Security Agency his – he does not have to talk about his locus standi.  
No he talks about his locus standi if he is bringing it himself.   
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   We do – we do appreciate that Chairperson 
10 
but we dealt with it – I think one of the things was the time constraints 
within which we had to bring the application.  But at the time when we 
decided to bring the application in the agency’s name was because we 
thought that it would be best because the agency – it is his employer 
and he is requested to appear before you Chairperson by virtue of him 
being employed by the agency not him, himself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes unfortunately I cannot talk about – we cannot talk 
about what his position is in the agency because that would reveal … 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   His identity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  His identity.  So that also makes it tricky because 
20 
without knowing that it could be some administrative officer or 
somebody not so high up in the agency who then decides I am bringing 
the application or rather I am – the – my employer is going to be the 
applicant.  Whereas it is the employer who must decide whether they 
are going to be the – the applicant in these proceedings and he says he 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 6 of 190 
 
has the authority.  I do not think he says he attaches anything. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   No we do not do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know very often people say I am authorised.  
Sometimes you suspect they do not even know what that means.  So I 
am not suggesting he does not know but I am just saying his is one of 
those averments that people just put in so easily in affidavits.  I am 
authorised to do this and that and that, you know.  So I am – I am just 
raising these as concerns at this stage.  I am not saying that they are 
necessarily standing in the way but I am concerned about them, you 
know.  I do not know whether the plan is for him to give evidence 
10 
immediately after we have dealt with the application or he could come 
later.  Because it may be that you might need to just rectify some 
things in the application.  Is the – is the plan that he would be the next 
witness? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair that was the original plan. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That his evidence would be received first.  I 
will just need to confer with Mr Mbikiwa about whether there is anything 
lost in a reversal of the order. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Some of the planning of today envisaged his 
evidence first. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then the move to the second witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 7 of 190 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Having said that though there is a further 
supplementary affidavit that I know my learned friend was going to 
hand up to you today.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Dealing with at least the identification of Mr Y. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I do not know – he will make submissions on it.  
It is not clear to me that it resolves the crisp issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   That you have raised. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But maybe he must address that and we see 
where we go. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If I could just take a moment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To just consider whether there could be a 
reversion of the order. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I have chatted to my learned friend.  We – we 
are of the view that we could reverse the order. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 8 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That it is not essential that we have Mr X 
before Ms Dlamini – Mr Y – my goodness that is – I am so glad my 
learned friend is doing Mr Y’s evidence because it is less likely that he 
will make this error. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So we could certainly reverse the order. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay no that is fine.  Thank you.  Well you see 
you might have to choose whether you stick to bringing the application 
– you stick to the State Security Agency being the applicant or whether 
10 
you decide to change and make the witness the applicant. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   Chair… 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you – if you decide to change then you could have 
Mr Y as the applicant in the heading. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Y. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then he brings the application as Mr Y. 
 ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he indicates – might – indicates that Y is not his 
20 
real name but it is for purposes of these proceedings.  It is important 
that his identity be not disclosed. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he asks for leave that he be referred to in these 
proceedings as Mr Y. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 9 of 190 
 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   Yes.  Now Chairperson I have discussed this 
with my instructing attorney.  We have no objection – we have no 
problem in substituting Mr Y as the applicant and given now the change 
in sequence of the witnesses may that – may we then stand down for 
that purpose so that we can rectify the error in the meantime while Ms 
Dlamini gives her evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja no that is fine.  We will stand the application 
down so that you can attend to that and then at a later stage then I can 
deal with the application. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   Thank you Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So this application will stand down.  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We do not need to do any – to adjourn ne? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair I do not think so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We do not – ja.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The witness is present with us in the room. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And provided I just get the right files in front of 
me we will be ready to go. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair if I may call Ms Dlamini to take up her 
20 
position in the witness area? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you.  You can administer the oath or 
affirmation.  
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
MS DLAMINI:  Nokunqoba Gloria Dlamini. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 10 of 190 
 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the prescribed oath? 
MS DLAMINI:  No I do not have any objections. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
conscience? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes I do. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the 
truth; the whole truth and nothing but the truth, if so please raise your 
right hand and say, so help me God. 
MS DLAMINI:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  You may be seated.  Yes Ms Hofmeyr. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Dlamini you have in front 
of you a soft file and you will see that it is paginated in the top right 
hand corner with red pagination numbers.  Those will be the numbers I 
will be referring to today in the course of your evidence.  Chair for 
record purposes if we could enter as Exhibit DD24 Ms Dlamini’s 
affidavit and accompanying annexures? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Nokunqoba Gloria Dlamini’s affidavit and 
annexures to that affidavit will be admitted as Exhibit DD24 and will be 
marked accordingly. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And Chair just for the transcription purposes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Dlamini’s name is spelt as follows:  Her first 
name Nokunqoba is N-o-k-u-n-q-o-b-a.  Second name Gloria, G-l-o-r-i-
a.  And surname Dlamini, D-l-a-m-i-n-i. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 11 of 190 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Dlamini I would like to begin on page 1 of 
your affidavit if we may.  Because you indicate in the first line where 
you are employed.  Where is that? 
MS DLAMINI:  I am employed by State Security Agency based in 
Pretoria Head Office. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Ms Dlamini can I just suggest that 
you bring the microphone even just a bit closer.  It is important that we 
– we get your testimony as clear as possible for the purposes of the 
transcription. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I think your voice is quite soft so… 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So do make an effort to raise it. 
MS DLAMINI:  Raise it okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS DLAMINI:  I will do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And in what position are you employed there? 
MS DLAMINI:  I am an analyst and evaluator. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what does that mean in the context of the 
20 
agency? 
MS DLAMINI:  It means I interpret and analyse report from the 
information obtained from the vetting field work. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So are you responsibilities particularly directed 
to vetting exercises conducted by the agency? 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 12 of 190 
 
MS DLAMINI:  Very much thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And do you – do you have any other role 
outside of vetting? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes I have been assigned a role of a Project Manager 
when the vetting of executives of SAA was undertaken. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what does that role require of you, the 
Project Manager role? 
MS DLAMINI:  You mean in terms of the skills? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS DLAMINI:  Or the [indistinct]. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well what – what role you play as Project 
Manager? 
MS DLAMINI:  Okay.  As the Project Manager I was responsible to 
outline the project overview, define the objectives of that project, make 
sure that we are within the scope and then outline the budget for the 
project.  The milestones, make sure the responsibilities of personnel 
within the project – the project team are clearly defined and also to 
ensure the communication lines between us and the client are clear and 
then also make sure there is resources and facilities for the team. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Have you played that role of Project Manager 
20 
for vetting previously – prior to the SAA vetting or subsequently? 
MS DLAMINI:  I have been amongst the team who were on projects 
within the organisation prior to my appointment. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that is the appointment as Project Manager 
of the specific vetting operation at SAA, is that correct? 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 13 of 190 
 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And since then have you been the Project 
Manager of any other vetting operations? 
MS DLAMINI:  This was my first appointment. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And subsequent to that have you been in that 
position since then? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes, yes.  I was responsible to manage the project of 
Government Printing Works as well. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And in terms of your qualifications 
what qualifications do you hold? 
10 
MS DLAMINI:  I have got a Master’s Degree in Public Administration 
from the University of Pretoria, Senior Management Program from 
University of Pretoria.  I also hold a Project Management – Practical 
Project Management course from UNISA Business School.  New 
Managers Program from WITS and Security Advising Course. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And when did you join the State 
Security Agency? 
MS DLAMINI:  I have been with the agency for the past 16 years. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And have you always been involved in the 
vetting operation side? 
20 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes, yes very much. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Ms Dlamini you indicate at the 
outset in the first few pages of your affidavit the request that was 
received from the commission and you detail the information that you 
were required to provide.  That is in – by way of background and then 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 14 of 190 
 
you actually commence at page 6 of your affidavit to provide that 
information.  So I would like to move us there if we may?  Page 6 of 
Exhibit DD24.   
MS DLAMINI:  On the affidavit? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.   
MS DLAMINI:  Page 6, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you will see at the bottom there you have a 
heading called The Vetting of SAA Executives and Support Staff.  Ms 
Dlamini just before we move into that just to orientate ourselves in the 
evidence. Chair you will recall that when we had the previous aviation 
10 
session there was some evidence received about security vetting that 
had been conducted within SAA.  You heard evidence in two respects in 
relation to that.  There was evidence of Ms Nhantsi who towards the 
end of her testimony indicated that there had been a particular 
interaction that she had had with Ms Myeni after some of the results of 
this vetting exercise had been made known to Ms Myeni.  I will come to 
that in the course of Ms Dlamini’s evidence.  But the other respect in 
which the commission has already heard about this vetting was in the 
evidence of Ms Thuli Mpshe.  Because she gave evidence about the 
concerns that had been expressed by management of SAA at the time 
20 
that this vetting operation took place.  And so the investigations of the 
commission subsequent to that evidence has been to engage the State 
Security Agency and obtain more information about how that vetting 
operation came about and was conducted.  And so it is my intention to 
deal with that aspect today with Ms Dlamini.  Ms Dlamini you start at 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 15 of 190 
 
the bottom of page 6 and you explain first of all how it came about that 
this vetting operation was conducted at SAA.  Can you please tell us 
about that? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes there were engagements between the two Ministers, 
former Minister of Finance, Honourable Nene and our former Minister, 
Honourable Mahlobo.  I was not privy of those conversations or 
meetings but they are attached correspondence to that as they engage 
on the need and the decision that the executives of SAA must be 
vetted. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I would like to go to that correspondence 
10 
because as you indicate you have attached it to your affidavit and you 
will find the first letter at page 17, 17 of DD24.   
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  17 Chair, 17. 
CHAIRPERSON:  17 okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you have that page?  17. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what is this document? 
MS DLAMINI:  I think this is the letter from the Minister of State 
Security then Honourable Mahlobo to Mr – to Minister Nene at a time. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And just for the transcribers 
Mahlobo is spelt M-a-h-l-o-b-o.  That is Mr David Mahlobo who was 
then the Minister of State Security, is that correct? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Now this letter did you see it at the time that it 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 16 of 190 
 
was prepared? 
MS DLAMINI:  No, no, no. I did not see it at the time. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you see it before you commenced the 
vetting operation? 
MS DLAMINI:  No I saw the letter that was attached to the list of 
officials and executives that were to undergo the vetting. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay we will come to that letter in a moment.  
Let us just deal with the letter at 18.  What is the date of the letter 
according to the second page? 
MS DLAMINI:  Where are you now? 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I am on page 18 of Exhibit DD24. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Which is the second page of the letter we are 
looking at.  And I was asking what date is indicated on that page? 
MS DLAMINI:  13 October 2015. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you indicated that it was a letter written by 
Minister Mahlobo – former Minister Mahlobo to former Minister Nene, is 
that correct? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And I understand you to say you did not see 
20 
this at any stage before you conducted the vetting operation, is that 
right? 
MS DLAMINI:  I got to see the letter that was attached to the list. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes so let us just be clear.  This letter did you 
see it at the time? 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 17 of 190 
 
MS DLAMINI:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No. 
MS DLAMINI:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  When did you first see this letter? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes I got aware of the letter but I cannot have the exact 
date. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But was it at some point during the vetting 
operation? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you read the letter when you came to be 
10 
aware of it? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes, yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Please could you indicate what is stated in the 
letter at paragraph 2? 
MS DLAMINI:   
“It has come to the attention of the State Security 
Agency that there is an urgent need for vetting and 
re-vetting of state owned enterprises giving sensitive 
information received on an ongoing basis.” 
And I think that is the part that was also indicated on the letter where 
20 
the list of executives and support staff that I received. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We will go to that letter in a moment.  And – so 
that is paragraph 2 of Minister Mahlobo’s letter to Minister Nene.  What 
does Minister Mahlobo record in paragraph 3? 
MS DLAMINI:  He is indicating the need to vet the officials at SOE 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 18 of 190 
 
because of the huge impact that the – okay let me start again.  He is – 
“SOE’s as government entities have a huge impact 
on the economy of the country and therefore 
extremely important for state security to conduct 
vetting as per the mandate of SSA.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay let us read what he precisely says that 
mandate is.  If you could read from the third line.  As I have it it starts 
“as per” will you read from “as per section 1”? 
MS DLAMINI:   
“As 
per 
Section 
1 
of 
the 
National 
Strategic 
10 
Intelligence Act 39 of 1994 as amended by Act 67 of 
2002 states that the National Intelligence Agency has 
the mandate to vet all other National, Provincial and 
Local Government Departments, Parastatals and 
their service providers.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you know the Provisions of the National 
Strategic Intelligence Act that deal with vetting? 
MS DLAMINI:  I am – come again? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you know the Provisions of the National 
Strategic Intelligence Act that deal with vetting? 
20 
MS DLAMINI:  I am aware that in terms of the strategic objectives of 
counter intelligence it is the main objective is to ensure that corruption 
in state owned entities is reduced. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Are you familiar with the Provisions of this 
Act? 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 19 of 190 
 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  Yes.  I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are?  Okay. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  It states that vetting should be conducted to 
persons who are employed by the State or who are to render services 
to the State and have access to classified information or the National 
Key Points. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Does the - does Section 1 of the Act - as 
Minister Mahlobo records here - say what is in quotations in paragraph 
10 
3? 
MS DLAMINI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat the question. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  You will see Ms Dlamini at 
paragraph 3 Minister Mahlobo indicates that Section 1 … 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of the National Strategic Intelligence Act states 
that:  and then there is a quotation.  On the face of the paragraph it 
appears to be a quotation from Section 1 of the National Strategic 
Intelligence Act.  Do you understand the paragraph in the same way as 
20 
I do? 
MS DLAMINI:  (No audible reply). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Please say yes.  The nod is not recorded. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and I am asking you is that what 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 20 of 190 
 
Section 1 of that Act says? 
MS DLAMINI:  It - it - on this paragraph … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS DLAMINI:  It is not clearly stated that these employees are 
employed by the State - by - by SOEs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Dlamini.  Just listen to the question carefully … 
MS DLAMINI:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And answer just the question.  The question is does 
10 
Section 1 of this Act say what Mr Mahlobo quoted here.  Do you know?  
I know that … 
MS DLAMINI:  I think … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Section 1 used to be the definition section … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of an Act. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It still is unfortunately. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - but some of the definitions now are at the end of 
the Act.  So do - do - are you able to say whether he has got it right? 
20 
MS DLAMINI:  No.  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He did not get it right? 
MS DLAMINI:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did anyone pick that up?  That he was quoting 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 21 of 190 
 
a Section 1 of the Act that does not read like that. 
MS DLAMINI:  I did not pick it up. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS DLAMINI:  I have to be honest. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And anyone else pick it up? 
MS DLAMINI:  I am not aware.  I am not aware. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And can …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it would be interesting to know whether there is 
any section in the Act that says that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There is not. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is not? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No.  Alas.  It is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  That would be very interesting. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  It is interesting.  It is part of what I intend 
to probe with Ms Dlamini today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So what is quoted you confirm is not what 
Section 1 says of the Act and let me ask you.  Are you aware of any 
section of the Act that reads with the words in the quotations referred 
to in paragraph 3? 
20 
MS DLAMINI:  No.  I am not aware.  I am aware that it is Section 2A. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed it is.  Yes. 
MS DLAMINI:  It is Section 2A that covers … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS DLAMINI:  The mandate … 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 22 of 190 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS DLAMINI:  To vet the employees of the State Owned Entities. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it does not say what he has quoted here? 
MS DLAMINI:  No.  It does not say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS DLAMINI:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You see because what is quoted here I want to 
suggest to you is far broader than what Section 2A of the Act actually 
says.  What is quoted here is that a section of the National Strategic 
Intelligence Act states that quote: 
10 
“The National Intelligence Agency (“NIA”) - has the 
mandate to vet all other National/Provincial and 
Local Government Departments, parastatals or their 
service providers.” 
Do you see that? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  I do.  Yes.  I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you know what Section 2A provides.  Do 
you not? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  It is - it is quite specific … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
20 
MS DLAMINI:  To say it is - it is the individuals who are employed by 
the State or those that are to render service to the State and have 
access to National Key Points or classified information. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let us go to the section to which you refer.  
Chair, for that purpose you will need the legislation bundle.  I trust 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 23 of 190 
 
Ms Dlamini has a copy of the legislation bundle.  If not could I just 
request that one be made available to her? 
MS DLAMINI:  I do have a part on the legislation. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is fine, but I would like us to be on - on 
the same page in the bundle that I will be referring to.  So we will just 
make available to you the legislation bundle and you will turn up page 
3-6-1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well somebody must just go and check … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether it is among the files. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It may be next to you there Ms Dlamini. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Tell her what is … 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What - what is written on the spine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  On the side it should say “legislation”.  Can 
you just check the spine? 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the spine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  On the spine.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On - on the spine outside.  On the spine.  Does it say 
legislation on - on the … 
20 
MS DLAMINI:  No.  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the opposite side? 
MS DLAMINI:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no.  At the back.  Ja. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  Yes. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 24 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay. 
MS DLAMINI:  Aviation Legislation Reference Bundle. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is precisely what we need to be working 
with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you so much and if you will turn up page 
3-6-1. 
MS DLAMINI:  3-6-1. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you have that? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  Yes.  I am - I am there. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that is the first page of the National 
Strategic Intelligence Act 39 of 1994.  That is the one we have been 
talking about.  Is that correct Ms Dlamini?  You will need to say yes. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  Yes.  That is the one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Do not nod.  You … 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  That is the one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You must give the answer … 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that it can be captured. 
MS DLAMINI:  Captured. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS DLAMINI:  Okay.  Yes.  That is the one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I - I see Ms Hofmeyr that Section 1 is the 
definition section. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is.  Yes.  So one is the definition.  So that 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 25 of 190 
 
could not have been a correct reference in paragraph 3, but now we are 
moving to as Ms Dlamini has pointed out.  There is a section of the Act 
dealing with vetting.  It is not Section 1.  It is Section 2A and what we 
are looking at now is that Section 2A does not say what is quoted in 
Minister Mahlobo’s paragraph 3. 
So let us go to 2A.  You will find that at page 3-6-5.  Do you 
see Section 2A there Ms Dlamini? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  I see Section 2A - capital A Advocate Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and could you read for us what 
subsection one of that section provides? 
10 
MS DLAMINI:  “When performing any function referred to …” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No.  I think we are at the wrong.  You need to 
go a bit further down the page …. 
MS DLAMINI:  Oh.  Yes.  Yes.  Sorry. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To in bold 2A and then the heading is “Vetting 
Investigations”. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Could you read the rest of that subsection? 
MS DLAMINI:  You mean just the A - just the A? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  1A. 
20 
MS DLAMINI:  Okay. 
“The relevant member of the National Intelligence 
Structure may conduct a vetting investigation in the 
prescribed 
manner 
to 
determine 
the 
security 
competence of a person if such a person is 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 26 of 190 
 
employed by or is an applicant to an organ of State 
or is rendering a service or has given notice of 
intention to render a service to an organ of State 
which service may give him or her access to 
classified 
information 
and 
intelligence 
in 
possession of the organ of State or give him or her 
access to areas designated National Key Points in 
terms of the National Key Point Act 1990 Act 102 of 
1980.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Do you agree that that Section 2A 
10 
is 
different 
to 
the 
words 
that 
appear 
in 
paragraph 
3 
of 
Minister Mahlobo’s letter? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We will look at the details of what Section 2A 
envisages in a moment, but I would like to just finish with the letter of 
Minister Mahlobo - if we may.  So if you will go back to DD24 and that 
is the exhibit containing your affidavit and turn to page 18, because 
that is the second page of Minister Mahlobo’s letter?  Can we go to 
paragraph 4 there?  Could you read into the record what paragraph 4 
says? 
20 
MS DLAMINI: 
 
“This 
should 
be 
understood 
from 
the 
background of challenges affecting most of the 
State Owned Entities.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I think it says companies.  Is that correct? 
MS DLAMINI:  Companies.  Yes. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 27 of 190 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and paragraph 6. 
MS DLAMINI:  “The Chairperson (SAA) will be required to 
provide a list of all Executive Management and 
support staff.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR: 
 
Right. 
 
Ms Dlamini, 
can 
I 
get 
your 
understanding 
of 
what 
this 
letter 
was 
seeking 
to 
convey 
to 
Minister Nene, because as I understand your evidence it is because of 
this correspondence between the two Ministers.  That you were charged 
with undertaking the vetting operation.  Is that right? 
MS DLAMINI:  As I have indicated before I did not see this letter prior 
10 
to my responsibilities. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I thought you had not seen it prior to it starting 
… 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you saw it in the course of the 
responsibilities. 
MS DLAMINI:  In the course of the responsibilities. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that right? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But your affidavit before this Commission says 
20 
the reason why there was going to be vetting undertaking at SAA at all 
is because Minister Mahlobo engaged with Minister Nene about it.  Is 
that correct? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And as evidence of that you have attached this 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 28 of 190 
 
letter to your evidence.  Correct? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  Yes and the letter that I saw first. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We will deal with that in a moment … 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because this comes first in the chronology.  So 
what was your understanding based on this letter at the time or in 
terms of briefings that you were given as to why vetting needed to be 
undertaken at SAA? 
MS DLAMINI:  My understanding is that the Executives of SAA are 
employed by a State Owned Entity and in terms of our mandate they 
10 
have to be vetted. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And who - who conveyed that to you or was that 
your understanding? 
MS DLAMINI:  I - we - I engaged with my Executive Boss at the time … 
(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And who was that? 
MS DLAMINI:  General Dlodlo.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And can I just be clear.  What you understood 
was because these management persons and their support staff were 
employed at a State Owned Company. 
20 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  They were required to be security vetted.  Is 
that correct? 
MS DLAMINI:  That is correct, because they were working for a State 
Owned Entity in terms of the law … 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 29 of 190 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS DLAMINI:  And in terms of our mandate … (intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that the only requirement that they just 
needed to be employed there and then they needed to be subjected to 
security vetting? 
MS DLAMINI:  In terms of Section 2A that is one of the requirements 
and if they have - access to classified information or they have access 
to a National Key Point … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS DLAMINI:  But I would go with the first one where it says:  
10 
employed by a State Owned Entity. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So is - is the fact that they are employed 
enough to trigger the need for security vetting? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  Very much so.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So it is not necessary that they in addition to 
being employed have access to classified information? 
MS DLAMINI:  It - it could be, but … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But it is not required? 
MS DLAMINI:  It - it is required, but being employed by a state 
institution on its own it is enough. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  When Minister Mahlobo motivates for this 
vetting operation in his letter to Minister Nene.  You will see that at 
paragraph 2 he seems to place some emphasis on the information that 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 30 of 190 
 
these people who are going to be vetted have access to, because you 
will see in paragraph 2 he says: 
“It has come to the attention of the State Security 
Agency that there is an urgent need for vetting and 
revetting of state owned enterprises given sensitive 
information received on an ongoing basis.” 
Do you see that? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  I do see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you differ from him insofar as you regard it 
only being necessary that the person vetted is employed by the State 
10 
Owned Entity? 
MS DLAMINI:  I do not regard it as the only requirement, but I am 
saying by virtue of being employed you have to be vetted by a - 
employed in a State Owned Entity.  Also if you have got access to 
classified information.  So I do agree with him to a certain extent. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But not - so if he were to say, no.  You have to 
have access to classified information to be vetted.  I understand you to 
say you would disagree, because the mere fact of employment is 
sufficient.  Is that right? 
MS DLAMINI:  No.  That is not right. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What is your evidence? 
MS DLAMINI:  I am saying you have to be employed as per Section 2A 
as it states that if you are employed by a - an organ of State you have 
to be vetted. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  You - you … 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 31 of 190 
 
MS DLAMINI:  That is the first part. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes and then the second part states that if you have got 
access to classified information or access to a National Key Point you 
have to be vetted. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  It is quite important that we just get this 
clear, because I understood you earlier to say the - on its own the fact 
that you are employed by an organ of State such as a State Owned 
Company is enough to require you to be security vetted.  Is that 
correct? 
10 
MS DLAMINI:  It - it could be a combination of the two.  You can be 
employed and not have access to classified information. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you would still need to be vetted? 
MS DLAMINI:  And you still need to be vetted. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me see if I can assist.  Ms Dlamini … 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is a difference between something that must be 
done.  You say that thing is compulsory and a situation where 
20 
something does not have to be done, but maybe done.  You 
understand? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is compulsory that when you come to the 
Commission you be dressed … 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 32 of 190 
 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it is not compulsory that you put on your best 
dress.  Okay, but if you like you can put on your best dress.  Okay.  So 
now was your understanding that if somebody is employed by a - an 
organ of State security vetting is compulsory … 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or was your understanding that if you are employed 
by an organ of State.  It may be necessary under certain circumstances 
that you be subjected to security vetting, but it is not compulsory.  
Which of the two are you saying was … 
10 
MS DLAMINI:  I am … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your understanding? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  Chairperson, I am saying if you are employed by 
an organ of State you should be vetted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is compulsory? 
MS DLAMINI:  It is compulsory. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And does that mean all the millions that are employed 
by Government must all be vetted and they would all have been vetted? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Irrespective of your position?  The cleaning staff in 
20 
various 
Government 
Departments. 
 
They 
also 
have 
on 
your 
understanding they must be subjected to security vetting. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 33 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That has always been your understanding? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  I am indebted.  I have 
highlighted that Minister Mahlobo - and I accept Ms Dlamini it is 
Minister Mahlobo’s letter.  It is not your letter … 
MS DLAMINI:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But Minister Mahlobo seems in the letter to pay 
some emphasis on the fact that these persons who are going to be 
vetted have access to sensitive information.  Do you see that? 
10 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Now I would just like to probe that a little bit 
with you.  What is the agency’s understanding of that link between the 
employees and sensitive information?  Must it be the case that the 
employees have access to such information to be vetted? 
MS DLAMINI:  Can you come again please? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is it a requirement that an employee who is 
going to be vetted must have access to sensitive information or is that 
not a requirement? 
MS DLAMINI:  If we look at the law it - it states that if you are 
20 
employed by the State you have to be vetted and at least - or if you are 
rendering a service to a State Organisation and you - you have access 
to classified information.  You have to be vetted. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 34 of 190 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you add the requirement of access to 
classified information for those who are rending services.  Is that right? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I understand that distinction.  Is your 
understanding that you describe now commonly the understanding 
amongst the people in the Vetting Division of the State Security 
Agency? 
MS DLAMINI:  Let me not talk for the rest … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay. 
MS DLAMINI:  Of the people.  Ja. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No.  That is fine. 
MS DLAMINI:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do - do you have briefings about this?  Do you 
…? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  Yes.  We do.  Yes.  We do. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And I - I fully appreciate that many of you may 
not be lawyers, but at some point has this understanding that you 
describe today being discussed amongst colleagues and understood? 
MS DLAMINI:  Very much.  Very much.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I would then like to back - if we 
20 
may - to your affidavit at page 6 and you can actually turn over the 
page to page 7, because we are now going to deal with what your 
affidavit says about the exchanges between Minister Mahlobo and 
Minister Nene and what followed. 
At paragraph 3.2 you deal with what happened after the 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 35 of 190 
 
exchange of correspondence.  Can you tell us what that was? 
MS DLAMINI:  3.2? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
MS DLAMINI:  After the exchanges then the list was forwarded to our 
Ministry at the time - Honourable Mahlobo - and then it had to be 
directed to the relevant structure … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS DLAMINI:  From his office.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let us just be clear.  What was the list a list 
of? 
10 
MS DLAMINI:  It was the list - it was as we received it.  It said 
Executive and support staff. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And who compiled that list? 
MS DLAMINI:  I was not there when the list was compiled, but when the 
- we received the list it was written Executive and support staff. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And who sent the list through? 
MS DLAMINI:  I received it from my Executive and then it was from our 
Ministry. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  Let us go to those letters - if we may.  
You will find the first one at page 19 of EXHIBIT DD24. 
20 
MS DLAMINI:  Page? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  19 - 1-9. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So what is this letter? 
MS DLAMINI:  This is the letter that former Minister Nene wrote to our 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 36 of 190 
 
former Honourable Mahlobo. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what date is indicated at the bottom of the 
letter? 
MS DLAMINI:  I think it is 26 November 2015.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And it appears to be - as you describe - a 
response to the letter we were just looking at. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Dated 13 October 2015. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that correct? 
10 
MS DLAMINI:  That is correct.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you see in the second paragraph that 
Minister Nene quotes the same Section of the Act that Minister Mahlobo 
quoted? 
MS DLAMINI:  The National Strategic Intelligence Act 39 of 1994? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  He quotes it in the same terms that 
Minister Mahlobo quoted it.  Did he not? 
MS DLAMINI:  He quotes it in the terms of saying these Executives 
20 
have access to sensitive information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I wanted to say Ms Hofmeyr maybe they purport to … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Quote it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is far more accurate Chair.  Far more 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 37 of 190 
 
accurate.  Let me use that exact description.  In the second sentence 
of the second paragraph Ms Dlamini.  What Minister Nene appears to 
do there is to purport to quote the Section 1 of the National Strategic 
Intelligence Act and he purports to quote it in the very same language 
that Minister Mahlobo quoted it.  Does he not? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that we have already resolved is not what 
the Act says.  Does it? 
MS DLAMINI:  That we have resolved.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes and it goes on at paragraph 3 to talk about 
10 
two separate letters dated the 2 n d and 5 November 2015 from the SAA 
Board Chairperson Ms D Myeni which lists all Executive Management 
and support staff as per your request.  Do you see that? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So is this the letter that you were talking about 
to which the lists were attached? 
MS DLAMINI:  This is the letter that I was talking about where the list 
was attached.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So let us go to that list, because it is preceded 
by a letter on the next page which is at page 20 … 
20 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what is that document? 
MS DLAMINI:  This is the list now of the Executives that were to 
undergo a vetting assessment. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right and this is the list - a letter dated 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 38 of 190 
 
2 November 2015. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that correct? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Now you see in that letter there is a list of 
Executive Management Members that are going to be vetted.  Is that 
correct? 
MS DLAMINI:  It is the list of Executive Members that are going to be 
vetted.  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And how many names are indicated there? 
10 
MS DLAMINI:  On the front top part it is 13 names … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
MS DLAMINI:  And then you would proceed with the whole list of 
names. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What - why do you say the whole list of names 
proceed this? 
MS DLAMINI:  I am saying because it - it starts from this page … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS DLAMINI:  And then there is the list that continues when you look 
at 22, 23, 24, 25 m… 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   see. 
MS DLAMINI:  26, 27, 28, yes.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So just so we understand the document on the 
same terms.  What I understand Ms Myeni to be saying at page 20 - 
and correct me if your understanding at the time was different.  Was 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 39 of 190 
 
that this letter would include - I am now at paragraph 1.  She writes 
there: 
“I refer to the letter from the Minister dated 
2 November 2015 requesting for a list of all SAA 
Executive Management and support staff.  The list 
of support staff will be forwarded to the Minister on 
Wednesday 4 November 2015.” 
She goes on. 
“The list of Executive Management Members is 
given below.” 
10 
And then we have a list of 13 names.  Is that correct? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then if we go over the page there is a 
further letter.  Who writes that letter? 
MS DLAMINI:  It is the letter that was written to former Minister Nene 
from the former Chairperson of SAA - Ms Myeni. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that is dated 5 November 2015.  Is that 
correct? 
MS DLAMINI:  That is the - yes.  It is - it is 5 November 2015.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And in the second line of that letter she 
20 
indicates - well first of all she refers to the previous letter on the 2 n d 
and then she says: 
“Please find attached a list with details of all 
Executive Managers and support staff.” 
And then if we go over the page is this the list that you were referring 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 40 of 190 
 
to? 
MS DLAMINI:  This is the list that I was referring to. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you take note of whether the 13 names that 
had been included on the first list of - as Executive Managers who 
would be vetted ended up being increased in this more lengthy list? 
MS DLAMINI:  Increased in what sense? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  More than 13 Managers were now going to be 
vetted pursuant to the list commencing at page 22. 
MS DLAMINI:  When I received this it was the entire document.  So I 
would not separate the 13 names to the rest of the names.  So I - I did 
10 
not separate it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So was your understanding that this list that 
commences at paginated page 22 to paginated page 28 comprised all 
the people that you needed to conduct … 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Security vetting on? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And did you go through any process of working 
out who on this list was in Executive Management position and who was 
in support staff position? 
20 
MS DLAMINI:  No.  Not at the time, but as soon they were submitting 
the forms that they had filled.  We - I was able to - to - to make that 
distinction. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And at that point did you work out whether the 
Executive Managers were confined to the original list of 13 or not? 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 41 of 190 
 
MS DLAMINI:  What do you mean? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The - the original list that Ms Myeni provides 
on 2 November … 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Had a list of only 13 Managers … 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But the list that commences at page 22 ends up 
with - I think - it is 118 people … 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Who are going to be vetted. 
10 
MS DLAMINI:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you establish once you had worked out 
their positions whether the original list of 13 Managers had increased 
to include other Managers as well? 
MS DLAMINI:  When I looked at the list I looked at it in total. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So I think the answer is no.  You did not … 
MS DLAMINI:  No.  No.  Ja.  I looked … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Take steps … 
MS DLAMINI:  At it in total. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
20 
MS DLAMINI:  So the first 13 and the rest of the names to me it was 
just a list of the people - the officials that had to be vetted at the time. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And - and whose decision was it to vet 
Executive Management and support staff? 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 42 of 190 
 
MS DLAMINI:   I was not given reasons and I wasn’t there when the two 
ministers were engaging on that, so I wouldn’t know whose decision it 
was. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Alright, did you consider at all the question 
whether the Board members of SAA should not also be subject to 
security vetting? 
MS DLAMINI:   Not at the time no. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No. 
MS DLAMINI:   No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    If I ask you now whether you think if the 
10 
Executive Management and support staff of SAA are being security 
vetted the Board members should also be security vetted, what would 
your answer be? 
MS DLAMINI:   My answer would yes, the Board would have to be 
vetted, but remember Advocate Hofmeyr the Board is vetted in terms of 
their contracts, do their contracts cater for that or if it is a request from 
the President. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Sorry, just explain that to me. 
MS DLAMINI:   According to the MISS ...[intervenes]  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   What is MISS? 
20 
MS DLAMINI:   It is Minimum Information Security Standard, Chapter 5 
we vet the Board if there is a request to vet them. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   But I thought your understanding of the Act 
was that anyone employed by an Organ of State should be vetted. 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 43 of 190 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So why aren’t ...[intervenes]  
MS DLAMINI:   Or rendering a service. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Or rendering a service, but let’s look at the – 
those who are ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Rendering a service if they are going to have access 
to classified information. 
MS DLAMINI:   To classified information yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it seems that if Executives are going to have 
access to executive – to classified information definitely Board 
Members would also have access. 
10 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So even if you don’t say Board Members are 
employees but they are people who are rendering a service and will 
have access to classified information if the Executive Managers also 
have access. 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes.  So they should be vetted on that note. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So irrespective of what the other instrument is that 
you referred to on the basis of your understanding of the Act, Section 
20 
2A. 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They should have been vetted if their responsibilities 
required them to have access to classified information. 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes and considering the Section 2A. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 44 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Has that helped? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed Chair, I am indebted.  Did anyone raise 
this with the respective ministers at the time that you were rolling out 
your vetting operation in SAA? 
MS DLAMINI:   No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Do you think that ought to have been raised? 
MS DLAMINI:   I didn’t think about it at the time. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And as you sit here now today? 
MS DLAMINI:   I will have to think about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no I am sorry, what would you have to think as 
10 
you sit there today? 
MS DLAMINI:   No she is asking me if the Ministers were engaged in 
terms of the Board having to be vetted, I am saying no one engaged 
with those ministers at that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no I thought she asked you the question 
whether as you sit there now you would think the Board members 
should also have been vetted, and I thought you had given an answer 
which was yes. 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As you sit here, but at that time you didn’t think 
20 
about it. 
MS DLAMINI:   No at that time I didn’t think about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay but the answer you gave her was not the same, 
Ms Hofmeyr did I misunderstand something? 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 45 of 190 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No not at all.  So we have clarified now as I 
understand it, just to be clear on your evidence Ms Dlamini is as you sit 
here today you think the members of the SAA Board should also have 
been security vetted? 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes, yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  I would like to return to your 
affidavit at page 7, and at page 7 you pick up at paragraph 3.3 the fact 
that you were appointed Project Manager ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe just for the sake of completeness and I think 
we have both touched on this, would you know or would you not know 
10 
whether Executive Managers of SAA would have access to classified 
information?   Is that something you would know or is that something 
you would not know? 
MS DLAMINI:   No, I would not know, I would not Chairperson, I 
wouldn’t. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but are you able to say well if executive 
managers of SAA were going to have access to classified information 
then the Board would also have access to classified information, is that 
something you are able to say in terms of your ...[intervenes]  
MS DLAMINI:   Yes, yes, it would ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, it’s logical. 
MS DLAMINI:   It would make sense yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair.  I do actually have a follow 
up question from that before we go to MISS. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 46 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   In the course of your vetting operation did you 
at any point assess whether the Executive Managers and Support staff 
that you were vetting had access to classified information? 
MS DLAMINI:   No, no, we did not. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Let’s go to – you mentioned MISS, that’s the 
Minimum Information Security Standards document.  It has been 
included in the legislation bundle that we were just looking at, and you 
referenced Chapter 5 of that document, you will find that at page 465 of 
the legislation bundle.  Do you have it in front of you? 
10 
MS DLAMINI:   465? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes, yes I do. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I think you were referring to Clause 1.5 on that 
page, is that correct? 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes, yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So let us see what that clause says.   It says: 
“Political appointees, Directors, Generals, Ambassadors, 
etcetera, will not be vetted unless the President so requests 
or the relevant contract so provides.” 
20 
It then goes on and says: 
“From the lowest level up to Deputy Director General all staff 
members and any other individuals who should have access 
to classified information must be subjected to security 
vetting.” 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 47 of 190 
 
Do you see that? 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So following on from the Chair’s questions 
earlier do you accept that if it was established that the members of the 
Board of SAA had access to classified information they would be 
required to be subjected to security vetting? 
MS DLAMINI:   Absolutely, absolutely. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   But they are not among the political 
appointees who won’t be vetted unless required by the President or 
their contract provides, are they? 
10 
MS DLAMINI:   They are not full members who are employed by SAA. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No what I am asking is are they political 
appointees? 
MS DLAMINI:   No they are not. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No, so that first sentence couldn’t apply to 
them, what does apply to them is the second sentence. 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Which is irrespective of your level if you have 
access to classified information you must be vetted. 
MS DLAMINI:   You must be vetted. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Is that correct? 
MS DLAMINI:   That’s correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So the conduct of this vetting operation was 
not compliant with MISS when it was conducted at SAA was it? 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 48 of 190 
 
MS DLAMINI:   It was because the Executives who were vetted are 
employees of SAA. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No what I am interested in is this paragraph of 
MISS to which you drew our attention says that irrespective of the level 
you are at if you are a person who has access to classified information 
you must be subject to security vetting, do you see that? 
MS DLAMINI:   I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   We have already confirmed that the Board 
members of SAA would have had that access, if anyone had it. 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, and what I say following on from that is 
they weren’t vetted in your security vetting operation at SAA were they? 
MS DLAMINI:   No they were not. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So that vetting operation did not comply with 
this paragraph of MISS did it? 
MS DLAMINI:   No, no it was not on this, it was on Section 2A. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Ms Dlamini- oh Chair we are at 
quarter past, I am going to move to a new topic, so it may be 
convenient to take the break. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no that is fine, we will adjourn for tea and 
20 
resume at half past.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 49 of 190 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair.  Miss Dlamini we were before 
the break at page 7 of your affidavit and I had indicate that at paragraph 
3.3 you record there that you were appointed as the project manager of 
the betting process, you have already given evidence this morning to that 
effect, is that correct? 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes, that is correct Advocate Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And you say at paragraph 3.4 that you designed 
a project plan, is that right?   
MS DLAMINI:   Yes that is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I would like to go to that project plan because 
10 
you attach it as an Annexure to your affidavit.  Let us just go to the first 
page to start with, that is at page 30, three zero of Exhibit DD(24). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say page 20? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   30 Chair, three zero. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Can you confirm Miss Dlamini that the document 
that appears at page 30 and runs to page 42 of Exhibit DD(24) is the 
project plan that you compiled. 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes Advocate Hofmeyr, it is the project plan that I 
designed. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I would like to pick it up then at page 34, three 
four. 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   At page 34 you have a heading there against 
paragraph number 1.3, which reads project goals and objectives, do you 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 50 of 190 
 
see that? 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Could you please read into the record what you 
recorded in this project plan, were the project goals and objectives? 
MS DLAMINI:    
“The main goal of the project is for SSA to support 
the government of RSA in securing its sovereignty 
and protecting its integrity, through conducting 
vetting to all executive management and support staff 
at SAA, in a prescribed manner as mandated by the 
10 
National Intelligence Act as amended by Section 3 of 
the General Intelligence Amendment Act 11.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And the next sentence? 
MS DLAMINI:    
“The objective is to ensure that all classified and 
sensitive documents within SSA are assessed by 
personnel with valid security clearances.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Well can I ask first of all, it seems to me that 
that is an error in that sentence to refer to SSA, should that not be a 
reference to SAA? 
20 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes – yes that is an error. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, it is an error we have made numerous times 
in our investigations because we confuse the A and the S, but is it correct 
that what you meant to record here is the objective is all classified and 
sensitive documents within SAA are accessed by personnel with valid 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 51 of 190 
 
security clearances, is that correct? 
MS DLAMINI:   That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And how were you going to do that if you had not 
established at all in this vetting operation whether anyone at SAA had 
actually had access to classified information? 
MS DLAMINI:   I think in an ideal situation will be conducted prior to 
employment so that when you have access to classified information you – 
you have already gone through the background screening. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Now I understand that is an ideal, what I am 
asking is how could it have been an objective of this vetting exercise that 
10 
was going to be conducted in respect of existing employees to ensure 
that they only had access to classified and sensitive documents if they 
had valid security clearances in a situation where no-one had at in any 
point in this vetting operation actually found out whether anyone at SAA 
did have access to classified information? 
MS DLAMINI:   Our role was to identify the risk posed by the executives 
who are already employed at that entity and then advise the client, the 
entity accordingly  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well what Miss Hofmeyr is putting to you or is asking 
you Miss Dlamini is actually fundamental to this project that you were 
20 
vetting.  This sentence says the objective of this project, of this vetting is 
to ensure that classified and sensitive documents within SAA are 
accessed by personnel with valid security clearances.  Now she is saying 
to you the starting point, should the starting point not have been the 
people that you are required to vet, do they have access to classified and 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 52 of 190 
 
sensitive information or documents in terms of their jobs because if you 
do not ask that question first before doing the project, you may be 
wasting everybody’s time and money, vetting people who will not have 
access to classified information and sensitive documents.  You 
understand the question? 
MS DLAMINI:   I get the question Chairperson but remember we started 
by saying officials who are employed by an organ of state need to 
undergo vetting, as per section 2(A) of the Law. Right?  Now those 
persons if they have access to classified information as part (B) now of 
Section 2(A), they have to be vetted so if you are employed by an organ 
10 
of state you have to be vetted.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But that is not the question.  The question relates to 
the objective of this project.  The objective of this project was not to 
make sure everybody employed at SAA was security vetted, that was, that 
is not the objective that is stated here.  What is stated here is that the 
reason why you were having this project was to make sure that people 
who had access to sensitive information would be people who have valid 
security clearances, and the question is how do you undertake a project 
which has such an objective if you do not know that the people that you 
are going to spend time on vetting, are people who do have access to 
20 
such information. 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes we did not access the job descriptions of the 
executives that I can say prior to vetting but the approach was to say at a 
strategic level as executives they have to be vetted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You want to take it from there Miss Hofmeyr? 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 53 of 190 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Miss Dlamini your evidence has been clear at the 
level of fact at no stage in this vetting operation did you or your team 
establish whether these executives or their support staff had access, is 
that right? 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes, that is correct, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Miss Dlamini I am going to show you in due 
course that that is a legal requirement for any lawful vetting to be 
conducted at any State-Owned Enterprise.  I am going to tell you that now 
and I will take you there later, but I am not concerned with that for the 
moment.  What I am concerned with for the moment is your own project 
10 
plan and your own project plan says the reason why we are doing this is 
because we want to establish and find people through a security vetting 
process who have the requisite clearance to access a type of information 
that we did not take any steps to establish whether they were accessing 
at any point. 
MS DLAMINI:   Okay let me come in there, in that, the reason that I have 
given to say the person, the officials who are employed by a State Owned 
Entity needs to undergo a vetting assessment.  In this case we are talking 
about executives that are already employed so we need to minimize the 
risk now to say this person, these people, this officials are already 
20 
employed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   But you may not need to vet them, that is the 
other option available to you is it not? 
MS DLAMINI:   Why? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Because if you do not establish whether they 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 54 of 190 
 
have access to the very information that you say they need security 
clearance for maybe then you should not vet them at all? 
MS DLAMINI:   We would vet them because they are employed by a State 
Entity. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   We will come to that in due course. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you see Miss Dlamini, if the objective of the 
project was to vet everybody at SAA who was employed there, then it 
would be open to you to say well we did not have to check whether 
people, the people we were vetting had access to classified information 
because we were simply vetting everybody who was employed there, 
10 
okay?  But that is not what the objective says as I understand it.  It 
seems to say we vetting people so that when they have access to 
classified information, sensitive information they would be having valid 
security clearances and the whole question that Miss Hofmeyr was asking 
and I was coming in on, is one would have expected that if that is the, 
that was the objective one would expect that you would seek first to 
establish who has in the course of their responsibilities, in the course of 
their duties, who has access to classified information and sensitive 
information, sensitive documents, give us those people, those are the 
ones we are going to - to deal with. 
20 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes Chairperson if I may elaborate to say flowing from the 
Section 2(a) of the law, considering that these officials were already 
employed by a State Owned Entity, that would be a big consideration for 
them to be vetted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no no, Miss Dlamini I do not want us to waste time 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 55 of 190 
 
on this.  We have dealt with that and you have agreed that is not the 
basis on which the, this project was done.  The basis on which this 
project was done is stated in the objective [intervenes]. 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that does not talk about everybody that is 
employed it talks about somebody who may have access to classified and 
sensitive documents.  You might be able to answer, you might not be able 
to answer but one would have expected that if that was the objective you 
would say to SAA or whoever we do not want to waste time vetting people 
who’s jobs do not require them them to have access to sensitive 
10 
information.  We do not want to waste time vetting people who really have 
nothing to do, who do not come close to sensitive or classified 
information.  Give us the ones ‘whose responsibilities put them in a 
position where they could have access. 
MS DLAMINI:   Chairperson if we were to refer to the letters between the 
two Ministers it states that these officials have access to sensitive 
information.  Maybe the question would be, did the two Ministers who 
engaged or communicated prior to the project being implemented, what 
was there, what exactly did they do to ensure that these people have 
access to sensitive information? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where does it say that in the letter?  Or which letter is 
it?  The first one that was by Minister Mahlobo? 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes, yes, the first one. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I think it is page 17 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 56 of 190 
 
MS DLAMINI:   It is page 17.  It says, let me just refer, okay if you can go 
to 19 [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well let us start with 17.  On paragraph 2 I just see 
where it says given sensitive information received on an ongoing basis.  
Now I do not know whether you know, I do not know who is supposed to 
receive that sensitive information that he is talking about, whether he is 
talking about the State Security Agency receiving sensitive information 
about SAA?  Or whether he is talking about anybody else?   
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you know?  I do not know. 
10 
MS DLAMINI:   I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is there anything else in that letter that you think 
supports your not checking whether they had access to? 
MS DLAMINI:   I am just driving Chairperson the point that in the two 
Ministers who engaged prior to the project being implemented, it is stated 
on these letters to say these executives have access to sensitive 
information on an ongoing basis [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us start on the letter dated or on, appearing on 
20 
page 17, is there anything that you rely on there to say these Ministers 
said these executives have access to sensitive information? 
MS DLAMINI:   Let me read paragraph 2.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ya. 
MS DLAMINI:   It has come to the attention of the State Security Agency 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 57 of 190 
 
that there is an urgent need for vetting and re-vetting of the State Owned 
Enterprises given sensitive information received on an ongoing basis.  
Now the question that Advocate Hofmeyr is posing in terms of access to 
sensitive information, I am saying I was not privy of what the two 
Ministers communicated on and if there was any reason or information 
shared relating to that access of sensitive information.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you see it is not going to help if we are going to 
look at these letters if you do not know if the letters help you answer the 
question.  If you – if you know that they contain something that helps you 
answer the question then it is fine but if you do not know then there is no 
10 
point in looking at them 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you know whether if they provide an answer for 
you? 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes to an extent that the two Ministers might have 
engaged with SAA to obtain, to have the reasons as to do these 
executives have access to classified information. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ya, but that is speculation, is that right, you are 
speculating? 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes, so it is known from that context, that is what I am 
20 
trying to explain. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But – but other than speculation you are not able to 
point to anything to say it shows that it supports the decision to vet 
people without checking whether they have access, they had access to 
sensitive information, is that right? 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 58 of 190 
 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes Chairperson but I would go with paragraph 2 to 
support. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but remember paragraph 2 you agreed with me 
earlier on that where it refers to sensitive information we do not know 
who they are talking about, the Ministers is talking about, whether he is 
talking about sensitive information received by State Security Agency 
about SAA? 
MS DLAMINI:   About SAA 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or whether it is, we do not know who received the 
information that he is talking about, okay?  
10 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright. If you feel that you have not, if you want to 
check something before we leave this point you may have a look. 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But otherwise if there is nothing else Miss Hofmeyr can 
move on. 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes I quickly want to check something.  Oh yes I think the 
later dated 2015, November 26 [intervenes]. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Chair it is page 19. 
MS DLAMINI:   Page 19 – page 19. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MS DLAMINI:   From former Mr Nene, I think the issue of sensitive 
information on an ongoing basis comes up again. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MS DLAMINI:   The issue of sensitive information received on an ongoing 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 59 of 190 
 
basis is coming up again. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But he, all he is doing is just referring to what Minister 
Mahlobo said in his letter. 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He is not saying anything of his own. 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. Yes. Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Miss Hofmeyr? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair, I would like to then go back to 
your project plan.  We were looking at first of all the objectives that you 
identified, that was at page 34 I would like to go to page 35 if we may?  
10 
That is of Exhibit DD (24).   
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Now you will see there is a heading there against 
the, number 1.5, do you see that?  Reading “Critical Success Factors.” 
MS DLAMINI:   Where are you now? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   We are at page 35. 
MS DLAMINI:   Oh 35. Yes? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And this is still in the project plan that you 
devised and I was drawing your attention to the heading against item 1.5 
which reads “Critical Success Factors,” do you see that? 
20 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And you have recorded there:  
“The following are critical factors limted to this 
project”  
And then the first bullet is: 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 60 of 190 
 
“Management Buy In and Support,” 
Do you see that? 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Did you have a sense at the time that you were 
conducting this vetting exercise, what the level of Management Buy-In 
and Support was? 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Were you satisfied with it? 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes – yes –yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   You did not have a need at some point to go and 
10 
meet Miss Myeni down in Cape Town to say you were not receiving 
adequate support? 
MS DLAMINI:   You mean, can you just elaborate a bit? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I asked you whether you were satisfied with the 
levels of Management Buy-In Support for the vetting exercise and you, I 
understood your answer to be yes, you were satisfied? 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And then I said, I, well I am relying on what you 
said in your affidavit, I thought you said there was a point that you had to 
go meet Miss Myeni down in Cape Town because you were concerned 
20 
about the level of support and buy-in you were receiving? 
MS DLAMINI:   Okay let me explain on that, in terms of the buy- in and 
the support, remember we had briefed the board when we rolled out the 
project but that did not mean that any issues arising from the time that we 
briefed them, I cannot raise them, and that did not mean that I do not 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 61 of 190 
 
have the buy-in. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So were you satisfied you did get their buy-in in 
the course of the vetting operation? 
MS DLAMINI:   In a sense because they were briefed, everybody was 
briefed and there were no, I did not get any indication to say they do not 
support what we have to do. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So when the seven executive managers resigned 
because of the vetting process was that not an indication that you did not 
have their support? 
MS DLAMINI:   No, it was not. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   What did that indicate? 
MS DLAMINI:   Remember the executives who resigned would write their 
letters to their employer not to me.  It could be of different reasons but I 
had to engage on that to say could it be anything relating to the work that 
we are doing there.  So in terms of the support the board, the acting CEO 
at the time, there was never any indication to say they are not onboard. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No, I fully understand the board being onboard 
because they were not being vetted, what I am concerned about is the 
118 managers and support staff whom you vetted in a situation where 
seven of those executive managers resigned during the course of this 
20 
vetting operation and we have heard evidence before this Commission 
previously, that there was great unhappiness amongst the executive 
managers about the fact that they were being subjected to security 
vetting in jobs that they had never been forewarned would have this 
requirement and in circumstances where they had to give deeply personal 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 62 of 190 
 
information over to the State Security Agency, where those not matters 
that came to your attention? 
MS DLAMINI:   Miss, Advocate Hofmeyr, you will recall that I would 
arrange the meeting so that we engage on any of the issues arising at 
that particular time and at no stage did any of the board members, any of 
the executive indicated to me or to the organization I represent to say 
they are unhappy or they are not going, there are any issues that need to 
be discussed.  I will be the one to engage them to say these are the, this 
is the situation where we are and provide status reporting in that regard, 
so in that sense I would say I was of the idea that I still have the buy-in 
10 
from them. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Can I just clarify who was at those meetings that 
you are talking about?  You mention the board, you mentioned some 
members of the executive, previously you had indicated the Acting CEO, 
is that correct? 
MS DLAMINI:   That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Was the interim, I think her position at the time 
was also Acting CFO in those meetings, Miss Nhantsi?  Was she also in 
these meetings where you were receiving feedback? 
MS DLAMINI:   No. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No, so are we just talking about the board and 
the Acting CEO? 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes, and I have to indicate that I was stationed at Airways 
Park the whole time so I would engage the CEO at any given point, so 
Advocate Hofmeyr at no stage did the former Acting CEO indicated to me 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 63 of 190 
 
or to the organization to say there are issues or disturbing issues 
pertaining to the vetting of executives. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I understand that, but you were reliant on him for 
the information about what the other executives were feeling, is that 
correct? 
MS DLAMINI:   I was prepared to brief them at any given stage. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No, I am asking about who you were relying on to 
tell you whether there were other managers who were uncomfortable, 
unhappy or dissatisfied about this vetting operation.  What I understand 
you to say is your point of contact was the Acting CEO and it was with 
10 
him, and that was Mr Zwane at the time.  Is that correct? 
MS DLAMINI:   That was Mr Zwane at the time.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Who you were engaging so you relied on him to 
give you this information correct? 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes, yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you, I would then like to go to page 38 of 
your project plan and pick it up there at item 2.3 on the page which is 
dealing with major project milestones, do you see that? 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes I do. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Now the fourth line within that table after the 
20 
heading indicates that you gave a briefing to the Chairperson of the SAA 
board and presented the project plan and the date for that is the 13 
January 2016, do you see that? 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And then the next line item is that there was a 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 64 of 190 
 
briefing to the SAA board and presenting the project plan on the 14 
January 2016, do you see that? 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes, yes, I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Why was there a need to brief the Chairperson 
on the day before the briefing of the board? 
MS DLAMINI:   I had requested the meeting to meet the Chairperson of 
the board and from my side it was simply to observe protocol.  If she was 
present at the board meeting the next day I would have briefed her 
together with the board at the same time.  The very same project plan 
that was presented to her on the 13 t h was the very same project plan that 
10 
was presented to the board in Midrand Protea Hotel on the 14 t h.  So from 
my side it was simply to observe protocol. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Just help me with that.  Where did the meeting 
on the 13  January 2016 take place with Miss Myeni? 
MS DLAMINI:   In Durban. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   In Durban? 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So you travelled to Durban to meet with Miss 
Myeni to give her the same briefing that would be given the following day 
to the board, is that correct? 
20 
MS DLAMINI:   Let me indicate that the board sitting on the 14 t h, I was 
not aware that the board is sitting on the 14 t h.  We got that information 
from the Chairperson herself to say look the board is sitting tomorrow in 
Midrand it would be easier for you to meet them there because she is in a 
position to know in terms of the schedule for the board. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 65 of 190 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Sorry, then we were cross-purposes because 
when you designed the project plan you included that meeting, remember 
we were at page 38? 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  How could you have included this in the project 
plan if you did not know about the meeting before? 
MS DLAMINI:  I think the dates- I just added the dates after it had 
occurred. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So, this was not a plan prepared in advance of 
the project. 
10 
MS DLAMINI:  It was but I think that the date- those two dates I just put 
them as we went along. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh, so it was revised after its initial. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  So, let me get that right.  You arrange a 
meeting with Ms Myeni down in Durban. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because she is the chairperson of the board, 
right. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Now if we go back to your affidavit at page 8 ... 
(intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you do that Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Dlamini it looks like that date on page 38 the first 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 66 of 190 
 
date 8 December 2016 is wrong.  Should it not be 2015? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS DLAMINI:  No, it is correct, it is 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mm? 
MS DLAMINI:  It is 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But then you are talking about- how can you start with 8 
December 2016 and come to 11 January 2016? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It must be a 2015. 
MS DLAMINI:  Oh, you mean the second date. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, the first- well, either the first date are wrong or the 
10 
other dates are wrong. 
MS DLAMINI:  I think the second date is wrong. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Dlamini can I assist? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I do not think the second date can be the wrong 
one.  That is because you closed the project ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  On the 30 t h of July 2016. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So, you could not have had your stakeholder 
engagement after you have closed the project. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is it not the error that it should be 8 December 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 67 of 190 
 
2015? 
MS DLAMINI:  Oh 2015, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS DLAMINI:  You are correct, it is 2015. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And so, despite the fact that you presented this 
project plan just following on from the Chair’s question, on the 11 t h of 
January 2016, your evidence has been this actual document was revised 
subsequently and that is how we get the insertion of the 14 t h of January.  
Is that right? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  So, let me just get it right.  You were 
planning then only to meet with Ms Myeni on the 13 t h of January.  Is that 
right? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you met with her in Durban and when you met 
in Durban, she then indicated; oh, there is a board meeting tomorrow in 
Midrand.   
MS DLAMINI:  That is right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So maybe you should attend that.  Is that how it 
unfolded? 
20 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes, that is how it unfolded. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  So, then I would like to go back to what 
you said in your affidavit was discussed at that meeting with Ms Myeni.  
You will find that at page 8 of Exhibit DD24. 
MS DLAMINI:  Page 8.  Yes. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 68 of 190 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So, at page 8 paragraph 3.5 you indicate that you 
had this meeting on the 13 t h of January and you indicate halfway down 
that paragraph what the purpose of the meeting was. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just tell us what the purpose was. 
MS DLAMINI:  The purpose of the meeting was to present the project plan 
and to- and how it is going to be rolled out and also to request her to 
make available the necessary resources.  Such as parking, access card, 
polygraph suit, nodal point offices and then operational centre.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that not something that you would have to get 
10 
the board or at least the executive members of the board to assist with?  
How could Ms Myeni facilitate all of this on her own? 
MS DLAMINI:  I was of the idea that whatever we have discussed with her 
and the board together they will be able to attend to it and get to us. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No indeed.   
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If you discuss it with them together. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But I understand your evidence to be you had 
intended only to meet with Ms Myeni on the 13 t h. 
20 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It was only in the course of that meeting that you 
were told about the board meeting the next day. 
MS DLAMINI:  The board sitting. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So, you went to her on the 13 t h to discuss 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 69 of 190 
 
aspects with her that she could not herself have executed.  Is that right? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  So, there would of course have been 
a need notwithstanding that meeting to meet with the board, correct? 
MS DLAMINI:  Of course, but I was not aware when is the board meeting. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I understand that. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let us then go to the stages of the vetting 
10 
process and you pick that up at page 9 of your affidavit.  Sorry, just 
before I go there.  I did want to clarify one thing.  Was Ms Myeni at the 
meeting on the 14 t h? 
MS DLAMINI:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Not. 
MS DLAMINI:  She was not. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay. 
MS DLAMINI:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So, you saw her on the 13 t h and the board 
excluding her you saw on the 14 t h.  Is that right? 
20 
MS DLAMINI:  We met the board, the board was down in Midrand on the 
14 t h, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  Okay.  So, you describe from paragraph 
3.8 that there are various stages of a vetting project or operation.  Can 
you please take us through those three stages? 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 70 of 190 
 
MS DLAMINI:  Okay the ... (intervenes) 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Four, apologies four.  There are four stages? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes, there are four stages that we follow in terms of the 
vetting exercise.  That is the administration stage, the vetting fieldwork 
stage, polygraph examination and the analysis stage which is the last part 
where the information is interpreted, analysed and a recommendation is 
done.   
 
Okay, let me start with the administration stage.  The 
administration stage it is where an official will fill in a vetting form Z204 
form, attach the required documentation and we will load that in our 
10 
system and verify it, right.  Basically, that is it in terms of the 
administration. 
 
And then the vetting fieldwork stage now the file from the 
administration unit will move to the vetting unit.  That is where now the 
vetting officer who has been assigned that particular case would make the 
necessary arrangement to conduct interviews with the references that 
have been identified from the form and additional ones that she would go 
on to recruit, if I may use that word.  And then at this stage the vetting 
officer would after making those arrangements would go on the field to 
conduct the interviews and then he or she will combine a report.  And that 
20 
report will be moved to the polygraph examiner. 
 
Now at that stage it is polygraph examination and let me also 
indicate that there are standard- there are guiding questions that the 
vetting officer uses or follows when they conduct those interviews.  But 
he or she can add any questions being guided by the person that he or 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 71 of 190 
 
she is vetting because each individuals vetting is different from another.  
So, the information would be different.  So, the vetting officer would be- 
must probe further.  So those questions can be changed or there can be 
additional questions by the vetting officer. 
 
Now the polygraph stage which is the third stage.  Now that is 
where the polygraph examination will take place.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mm-hmm. 
MS DLAMINI:  Are you following me? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I am. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  It is conducted to ... (intervenes) 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can I just say it is most important that the Chair 
follows, not me so.  If I can just ... (intervenes) 
MS DLAMINI:  Okay.  Now at this stage now the polygraph is to determine 
the reliability of information.  So, he or she conducts vetting of that 
particular official, compile a report.  He or she can refer the file back to 
the vetting officer or the file can move to the next stage, the analysis. 
 
And then the last stage is the analysis part where the 
information is consolidated, interpreted, analysed from the administration 
stage to the vetting stage to the polygraph stage.  So, this is the analyst 
now who is consolidating and interpreting all that information to make the 
20 
final conclusions. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I would like to pick up on a few aspects of each 
of the stages. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 72 of 190 
 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Now in the first stage there is a form that has to 
be completed by the person being vetted and there is certain 
documentary information that has to be provided.  Is that correct? 
MS DLAMINI:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That information that has to be provided is quite 
extensive is it not? 
MS DLAMINI:  Quite extensive, yes, it is. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  We have an affidavit in your file from Ms 
Olitzki.  Ms Olitzki was Chair the person who Ms Nhantsi testified she had 
10 
had a conversation with Ms Myeni about.  The evidence previously was 
that when Ms Myeni received feedback on Ms Olitzki’s security vetting, it 
was drawn to her attention that she had dual citizenship.  And Ms Myeni 
engaged Ms Nhantsi to take steps to have Ms Olitzki removed and wanted 
to use according to Ms Nhantsi’s evidence the fact of her dual citizenship 
as a basis for removal.    
So, we have obtained an affidavit from Ms Olitzki who despite all of this 
still is employed by SAA.  And she has given us some indications of how 
much information needs to be provided in order to complete these forms 
and you will find that at page 70 of Exhibit DD24. 
20 
MS DLAMINI:  70? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes 70.  Just for the record, the affidavit 
commences at page 68 of Exhibit DD24.  It is an affidavit by Lindsey 
Sharon Olitzki.  I will spell Olitzki O-L-I-T-Z-K-I.  And where I want to pick 
it up is at page 70 because there at paragraph 12 Ms Olitzki indicates the 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 73 of 190 
 
type of information, she had to supply in order to complete the form.  At 
paragraph 12 she says there; 
12. 
The form required a significant amount of information re 
personal particulars, education, health, including questions re psychiatric 
treatment, alcohol and drug abuse and previous marriage or cohabiting 
arrangements.   
13. 
In addition, details of family members, relatives was required 
including details relating to the country of birth and nationality.  Names 
and contact details of person who had known you for 5 to 20 years was 
also requested.  Plus, a full employment history as well as all visits 
10 
outside the country, SAA member plus spouse for the past 5 years.  Also 
copy of passport pages. 
14. 
Additional information required was a 3 month history of bank 
accounts, credit card accounts, vehicle and home loans plus a monthly 
income and expenditure budget and details of property owned and other 
sources of income. 
Ms Dlamini, I did have your evidence earlier to be you accept 
this is a substantial amount of information that needs to be handed over.  
Is that correct? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And it includes personal and private information 
of persons, correct? 
MS DLAMINI:  Financials yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Personal and private. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 74 of 190 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Correct. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So that is the first stage.  They have to hand over 
all of this information.  And then they get to an interview, is that correct, 
that is the next stage? 
MS DLAMINI:  That is the next stage, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  And you have indicated to us that there 
are some guideline questions that must be covered in that interview.  Is 
that correct? 
MS DLAMINI:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you provided us as an Annexure to your 
affidavit with some of those questions. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I understand your evidence to be that they are 
guidelines.  They can be departed from.  Is that right? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Or is it fair to say that they provide the base from 
which questions are asked? 
MS DLAMINI:  They provide the base from which the questions are asked. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  And then depending on answers you might 
20 
want to probe further ... (intervenes) 
MS DLAMINI:  To probe further obviously. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Or ask additional questions.  Is that right? 
MS DLAMINI:  Exactly. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I would like to go to type of questions that are 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 75 of 190 
 
asked of people subjected to security vetting.  And you will find that from 
page 43 of your Exhibit DD24.  Page 43, do you have that? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  I am on page 43, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So, Ms Dlamini, I am just going to highlight some 
of the questions.  This is a fairly detailed document comprising I think 
seven pages.  But what I want to highlight in the course of this and have 
you comment on afterwards is that not only is all that documentary 
information required to be provided to the State Security Agency.  But 
when you arrive for your interview you are going to be asked a series of 
questions that engage deeply private and personal matters.  And I would 
10 
like to highlight the questions for you that I say are of that quality.   
Okay.  So, on page 43 you get asked a whole lot about your family 
background and upbringing and amongst the questions midway down that 
page is whether all the children in the family were treated fairly while 
growing up.  Do you see that? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is sort of in the middle of the page.  Were all 
the children treated fairly while growing up? 
MS DLAMINI:  Oh yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you see that? 
20 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes, I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you accept that that is quite a personal 
question? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes, I do. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And further down about two thirds of that way 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 76 of 190 
 
down you also get asked; were any of your parents or brothers or sisters 
abusing alcohol, drugs or substances?  And if the answer is yes, you have 
to tell the vetting officer what that was.  Do you agree that that is quite 
personal? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes, because the interview is quite personal. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mm? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes, it is quite personal.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is. 
MS DLAMINI:  So, I would say the entire questioning it is quite personal. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
10 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let us look at some of the other items.  You get 
asked the question after that; did any of your immediate family receive 
counselling or psychotherapy?  And if they did, you have to tell this 
member of the State Security Agency about the psychological treatment 
that one of the members of your family received.  Is that right? 
MS DLAMINI:  From the questions that you have the questions is like, 
yes, it is asking that, yes ... (intervenes) 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You then get asked at the bottom of that page to 
describe your spouse’s personality.  Do you see that? 
20 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that also is a personal matter.  Is it not? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then over the page at page 44. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 77 of 190 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You get asked as the fourth question on this 
page; if you had your live over again would you marry your spouse? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  You accept that is a fundamentally personal 
question?  A question the answer to which you probably would not have 
ever communicated to your spouse. 
MS DLAMINI:  As I have said I think the entire ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Depending on what the answer is. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  Correct.  I am anticipating when you do 
not want to answer the question.  So true.  Deeply personal. 
10 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS DLAMINI:  Advocate Hofmeyr as I have said I think the entire ... 
(intervenes) 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS DLAMINI:  Interview is personal. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of course, but this ... (intervenes) 
MS DLAMINI:  I know you want to pick up certain questions ... 
(intervenes) 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed, because this was an operation that was 
20 
conducted at SAA. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In which a 118 people were asked these 
questions.  Right.  But further of the way down.  What kind of relationship 
was there between your parents?  Again, that is personal, is it not? 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 78 of 190 
 
MS DLAMINI:  All the questions are personal.  I still ... (intervenes) 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In the middle of the page.  What kind of influence 
do relationships have on the marriage?  They are talking there about how 
you relate to your parents in law.  Do you see that? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes, I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then you are asked.  Do you believe in 
having more than one partner at a time?  And you are asked to explain 
your answer, correct? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Again, deeply personal.  And you are even asked; 
10 
if you have lost your spouse, at the bottom of the page, how your children 
coped with the death of your spouse?  Do you see that? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Are these people given any counselling before or 
after they answer these questions in a vetting operation? 
MS DLAMINI:  No, they are not. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No.  But they know it is going to be followed by a 
polygraph test, do they not? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So, they dare not answer any of these questions 
20 
falsely dare they? 
MS DLAMINI:  I would not say that exactly but you would get the answers 
the responses depending on what the person have said. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well if they want to succeed and get their 
security clearance, they better give truthful answers to these questions.  
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 79 of 190 
 
Is that not correct? 
MS DLAMINI:  I believe so. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  Let us go to page 45.  You are asked all 
about your employment behaviour and then two thirds of the way down 
you are asked about you deal with stress and pressure.  Do you see that? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes, I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is also personal, is that right? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes, advocate Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
MS DLAMINI:  That entire interview is personal. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  Let me read the final questions because I 
think your answer is going to be the same.  And then I will just record 
them for the record and you will tell me if you accept that they are all 
personal.  At page 46 you are asked about whether you are social and 
whether you go to bars and clubs.  You are asked when you attend parties 
or socials what you talk about.  You are asked whether you hang out with 
men or with women.  You are asked what you see as luxuries.  You are 
asked whether you are the type of person to make impulsive decisions 
with regard to buying things.   
 
At page 47, you are asked about whether you borrow money on a 
20 
regular basis from your friends or family and whether you pay it back on a 
regular basis.  You are asked what stores you have accounts with and 
whether you are involved in any form of gambling.  And if so, you must 
explain how often you do so.  You are asked about whether you belong to 
a church.  Whether it guides you in your life.  What principles you live by.  
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 80 of 190 
 
You are asked about whether you belong to a religion.  You are asked 
about whether you are a member of a political organisation and whether 
the organisation is what you believe in.  You are asked about whether you 
think it is wrong to change your believes on a regular basis and to give 
the reasons for that.   
 
At page 48, you are asked about what you feel about the 
government of the day and whether you are happy with the current 
situation our land.  You are asked what role in political originations- what 
your role is in political organisations and how you attend to that role.  
You are asked how you feel about the existence of radical organisations.  
10 
And the you are asked about your personality.  You are asked about 
whether you are predictable.  What you do when you are angry.  How you 
deal with it.  And what you do after an argument. 
 
And on the last page, page 49, you are asked that if you were a- 
if the person questioning you were you friend.  They say, could they trust 
you with their secrets.  You are asked what you think about manipulation.  
You are asked whether you are bribable.  And you are asked what you will 
do if you are ever bribed or blackmailed.   
 
Ms Dlamini, I have not read all the questions.  I have read the 
ones which when I went through this, I thought highlighted the extremely 
20 
invasive nature of these questions.  And the extend of your personal life 
that you have to disclose when you are subjected to security vetting.  Do 
you accept that all of these questions are of that nature? 
MS DLAMINI:  Just like I have said Advocate Hofmeyr, the entire 
interview, it is a personal interview. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 81 of 190 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.   
CHAIRPERSON:  The answer is yes? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes, the answer is yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  Let us then return if we may to the 
polygraph stage because as I understand it, we are now at stage three.  
You have been asked all of those questions in the interview stage and 
now you are going to proceed to the polygraph stage.  And that is at page 
10 of your affidavit in Exhibit DD24.   
10 
 
Now Ms Dlamini what you say here at paragraph 3.8.3 is that 
and I am just going to read if I may the first two sentences. 
During this stage the official will be subjected to a polygraph in order to 
determine the reliability of the information gathered during the 
investigation.  It is mainly conducted in respective Top-Secret clearances, 
however in certain instances it may be used in other levels of clearances 
where the investigations require the determination of the reliability of the 
information gathered.  After the interview the officer writes a report. 
 
Okay.  What I am interested in is how did the decision- how was 
the decision taken in respect of the SAA officials whether to subject them 
20 
to polygraph test? 
MS DLAMINI:  Because they were vetted at a Top-Secret level. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So how did you decide to vet them at a Top-
Secret level? 
MS DLAMINI:  It is standard practice for senior management to be vetted 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 82 of 190 
 
at a Top-Secret Level.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But do you not have to know whether they are 
ever going to be in receipt of Top-Secret information? 
MS DLAMINI:  Because the request stated that they are executives so 
they are vetted at a Top-Secret level. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So, let me just understand that.  Just because the 
people you were vetting were executives of a state-owned company, is 
there an automatic application then that they must receive Top-Secret 
clearance? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  And at no point prior to this does anyone 
ever find out whether they actually ever going to get Top-Secret 
information.  Is that correct? 
MS DLAMINI:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And they’re support staff, why did they get 
polygraphed? 
MS DLAMINI:  I noted that from the forms or the submissions that we got 
it was mainly the executives that submitted. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No, I think the question is different.  I understand 
that this operation at SAA involved interviews and then polygraphs of all 
20 
the people interviewed.  Is that correct? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  Amongst the people interviewed were 
numerous support staff.  Why were they polygraphed? 
MS DLAMINI:  As I am saying Advocate Hofmeyr from the submissions 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 83 of 190 
 
that we received it was the executives that submitted back the forms and 
the supporting documents. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair I am not sure ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, the question is, did you not subject staff who were 
not executive managers to a polygraph test? 
MS DLAMINI:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not? 
MS DLAMINI:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you sub- was it only the executive managers that 
you subjected to a polygraph test? 
10 
MS DLAMINI:  It was only the executive managers, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The Commission engaged with the State Security 
Agency before this evidence about the reports that had been generated. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And those reports were not provided.  But part of 
what was requested was that in your affidavit you would have had a look 
at those reports and you would give us an indication in so far as the 
polygraph questions were concerned what the standard polygraph 
questions were that emerged from those reports.  Do you remember that 
20 
request? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes, I remember that request. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I did not find that in your affidavit.  Can you help 
us today with the answer to that question? 
MS DLAMINI:  What would be the question? 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 84 of 190 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What- when you looked at the reports of the 
polygraphs, right. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  As you were requested to do.  The Commission 
was interested to know what types of questions over and above those 
standard questions were being asked of those persons subjected to 
polygraphs? 
MS DLAMINI:  Oh yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Are you able to assist us with that? 
MS DLAMINI:  You are quite correct.  I remember in the meeting that we 
10 
had you did indicate.  I was hoping I would have the copy of the 
questions just like you have gone through the vetting questioning.  We 
were hoping to provide you with those questions and then indicate what 
were the additional questions.  So, I think that can be provided. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  My understanding was it was going to be covered 
in the affidavit.  Is it the case that you were not able to do so at the time 
of providing the affidavit? 
MS DLAMINI:  I think it was just a slip of the mind at the time. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I understand. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And as you sit here today you have not done that 
exercise? 
MS DLAMINI:  No, I have not. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 85 of 190 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So, you will need to go back. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes, I can do that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I understand.  Thank you.  So, I had 
misunderstood that and I am grateful for the clarification.  So, it was only 
executive managers, not they’re support staff who were polygraphed.  Is 
that correct? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes, that is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And I understand your evidence to be the reason 
for that is because as soon as you are an executive management in a 
state-owned company you must be cleared for Top-Secret.  Is that 
10 
correct? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that is the default position irrespective of 
whether any particular executive manager is ever actually going to see 
Top-Secret information.  Is that right? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And does that strike you as odd Ms Dlamini? 
MS DLAMINI:  Not at all. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh, explain why? 
MS DLAMINI:  Because I know when it comes to the issue of the levels of 
20 
clearances.  The security managers will indicate in terms of the request 
to state that these particular persons should be vetted at this level, right.  
But in this case from the request that we received from the entity it was 
not specified.  So, we just took the standard approach to say they will be 
vetted at a Top-Secret level. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 86 of 190 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You see it is the Top-Secret level that requires 
the polygraph, right? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is Top-Secret the highest level? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why would you apply the highest level and not 
the lowest level if you do not know what information they actually are 
accessing? 
MS DLAMINI:  Let me come back to that.  Let me come back to that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I do not –  
10 
MS DLAMINI:  You saying to me – ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you understand the question? 
MS DLAMINI:  I do not understand the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you do.  Okay she will repeat it. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes can you repeat the question? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What I asked is, if you do not know what types 
of information. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The executives have access to why do you 
decide to clear them for the top security clearance and not the lowest 
20 
security clearance? 
MS DLAMINI:  Oh now I get the question and I have said Advocate 
Hofmeyr at SMS level we vet at the top secret clearance. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What is SMS level? 
MS DLAMINI:  Senior Management.  Yes. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 87 of 190 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because there is some rule somewhere? 
MS DLAMINI:  There is no rule somewhere.  At SMS level when we get 
the request it is indicated that this person must be vetted at this level.  
But at this particular time the request that came did not indicate what 
level should they be vetted at.  But because it was stated that they 
have access to sensitive information we vetted them at the top secret 
clearance. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well we have already traversed that Ms Dlamini 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is not clear that it was ever stated. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja nobody ever said that.   
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought we – you said you considered that.   
MS DLAMINI:  I am stating from the letters from the two Ministers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes we dealt with that. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were not able to point out anything that says 
that. 
MS DLAMINI:  Sensitive information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Remember I gave you time to say where does it say 
20 
there that the executives would receive sensitive information. 
MS DLAMINI:  On the letter Chairperson it says; “Giving the sensitive 
information they receive on an ongoing basis.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.   
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 88 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Dlamini you can accept that it does not say that 
and we looked at it, both – I gave you chance to look and we – I asked 
you and you conceded.  Let us move on. 
MS DLAMINI:  That is easy. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can I just ask when the managers were briefed 
were you involved in that briefing that happened in I think it was 
January 2016? 
MS DLAMINI:  No I was not present. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Who conducted that briefing? 
MS DLAMINI:  We have got a structure dedicated to doing that. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Were – do you know whether the executives 
were told that they could refuse the polygraph? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes you know that they were told that they 
could refuse it? 
MS DLAMINI:  No I was not present when the – the presentations were 
conducted. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you find out afterwards what was 
communicated to managers about whether they could refuse the 
polygraph? 
20 
MS DLAMINI:  No I did not find out. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And did you come to have any sense of whether 
the managers who were subjected to the polygraph were told that they 
had to take the polygraph? 
MS DLAMINI:  No. No [mumbling]. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 89 of 190 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you accept that they ought to have been 
told that they are entitled to refuse it? 
MS DLAMINI:  The – I think the awareness presentations that were 
presented we will have to establish in terms of the details. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is a question about whether it happened? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What I am interested in is do you accept that in 
accordance with the application of the proper vetting procedures they 
10 
should have been told that they are entitled to refuse the polygraph? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes of course. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes of course. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Olitzki’s affidavit says that they were told 
that they needed to do the polygraph.  Do you have any basis to 
dispute what she says they were told? 
MS DLAMINI:  I would not tell. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So I think the answer is no? 
MS DLAMINI:  I would not tell. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I would then like to go to the 
valuation stage that is – you deal with at page 11. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You say: 
“During this stage” 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 90 of 190 
 
This is at paragraph 3.8.4. 
“All information contained including the reports by 
the vetting and polygraph officers are studied and 
interpreted in order to determine risks.” 
And then moving on a bit: 
“Thereafter the evaluator will make recommendations 
whether or not clearance ought to be granted or 
declined.” 
Do you see that? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes I see that. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Are you aware that the vetting regulations say 
that an applicant must be notified in writing of the outcome of a vetting 
operation? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you take steps to ensure all of the people 
who were vetted at SAA received that feedback in writing? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes, yes I did. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what did you establish about that? 
MS DLAMINI:  The fee – you mean the outcome? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
20 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  The outcome yes it was received by the acting 
CEO at the time, Mr Zwane, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So – sorry – so what did he say?  Did he say to 
you that the outcomes had been communicated to the rest of the 
executive management and staff? 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 91 of 190 
 
MS DLAMINI:  I did not get that feedback from him.  But from our side 
it was received by them. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Sorry I just need … 
CHAIRPERSON:  By the acting CEO? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or by – you gave it to the acting CEO? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes Chairperson that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not send the information to the individual 
executive managers? 
MS DLAMINI:  No. No. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so whether or not he passed it on you do not 
know? 
MS DLAMINI:  Whether or not he passed it on I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh would he – would he be meant to pass it on? 
MS DLAMINI:  He would be meant to pass it on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And do you know whether the correspondence that 
was addressed to him with that – with the outcome asked him to convey 
the outcome to the managers or not? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It did ask him? 
20 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Could you provide that correspondence to us 
after today? 
MS DLAMINI:  No it was not in writing. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 92 of 190 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So this was a verbal communication? 
MS DLAMINI:  This was a verbal communication. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because the regulations require the agency to 
ensure that this information is given to the person who has been 
vetted, is that not correct? 
MS DLAMINI:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So am I to understand you that in performance 
of that duty you tasked the acting CEO, Mr Zwane with the 
responsibility for communicating it? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Would you be surprised to learn that at least 
two of the current SAA managers who were subjected to that vetting 
were not ever told that outcome? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes I would be surprised. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And would you be concerned as well as 
surprised? 
MS DLAMINI:  I would be surprised because there was never indication 
from our side to say or to approach us in terms of those outcomes.  So 
I was of the idea that the applicants did receive the feedback. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were you the one who – who asked Mr Zwane 
20 
verbally to inform the other executive managers of the outcome? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  Yes I am the one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he undertake to do so? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 93 of 190 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And then I would like to go to page 
12 of your affidavit if we may?  At that paragraph, this is actually the 
point I was referring to earlier Ms Dlamini about your meeting with Ms 
Myeni.  Because you say at page 12 paragraph 3.10: 
“During the process we experienced challenges 
ranging from resignations by some executives, 
various enquiries by the officials from Mango Airlines 
on whether the scope of vetting had been extended 
to the executives of Mange and the executives not 
being co-operative.  All these challenges had the 
10 
potential of tainting the integrity and prolonging the 
process.” 
So it was there that I had picked up that I had at least thought that 
during this vetting operation it had been communicated to you that 
there were executives who were not happy about complying with the 
requirement of vetting.  Did I misunderstand what you had said here? 
MS DLAMINI:  Remember we had received the list so I was able to 
track in terms of who has submitted and who has not submitted.  So 
judging from that I would tell how many numbers are still outstanding. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And did you take steps to find out the reasons 
20 
why in respect of those who were outstanding they had not been 
submitted? 
MS DLAMINI:  No.  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But then you arrange an urgent meeting with 
Ms Myeni, is that correct? 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 94 of 190 
 
MS DLAMINI:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And why did you schedule that meeting? 
MS DLAMINI:  To address the challenges that I have highlighted in 
3.10.  Because as stated they had a potential of tainting the integrity 
and prolonging the process. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And just tell me how would they taint the 
integrity of the process if they did not want to subject themselves to 
security vetting? 
MS DLAMINI:  Because then it will mean the officials that were on the 
list if they are not complying it means we were not going to be able to 
10 
reach our targets and we are not going to complete the work that we 
were supposed to do. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what were those targets? 
MS DLAMINI:  To ensure that the executives as they refer to them, the 
top 100 are vetted. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The top 100 included support staff, is that 
right? 
MS DLAMINI:  They call themselves the top 100. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes, yes. 
MS DLAMINI:  So I used that term. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But they would necessarily have to include 
support staff. I do not understand there to be 100 managers at SAA or 
am I wrong? 
MS DLAMINI:  You – I am just referring to the term that they would use, 
yes. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 95 of 190 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you – you understand that term to include support 
staff, did you not? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes I did.  Yes I did. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what was Ms Myeni’s response when you 
raised these challenges with her? 
MS DLAMINI:  On the issue of – let me just go back.  Remember 
amongst the challenges – yes her indication would be they would try to 
assist any way – in any way possible. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And do you know what steps were taken to 
10 
assist? 
MS DLAMINI:  No.  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you do say later in your affidavit there was 
a great improvement after that point? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes judging from the – the submissions.  Yes but in 
terms of the actual steps, no I was not. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You do not know? 
MS DLAMINI:  No I do not know. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I understand that.  There was just the point 
about the questions that were asked Ms Dlamini at the polygraph.  I 
20 
understand you say you have not done the exercise to consider. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Those reports.  But as you sit here today would 
you have any basis for disputing what Ms Olitzki has indicated were the 
type of questions she was asked? 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 96 of 190 
 
MS DLAMINI:  I would prefer not to engage on that particular case 
because I have not had time to look at it.  I do not know what happened 
on that particular date.  So… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But at the time you compiled your presentation 
at the end of this vetting exercise. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Had you at that stage looked and seen the 
evaluation of the various reports that had been received from your 
vetting officers? 
MS DLAMINI:  Look it is – we are talking of more than 100 names that 
10 
had to be vetted.  So I think Advocate Hofmeyr to ask me on a 
particular case now… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No I am actually not interested in a particular 
case.  What I am interested in is we only had access to Ms Olitzki and 
a Mr Moonsamy whose affidavit will be referred to later today.  And they 
told us the type of questions they were asked and Ms Olitzki said she 
checked with two other of the managers who had been subjected to 
security vetting.  It would have been much better for us of course if we 
had got it from the agency.  But what I am saying to you is her evidence 
and that of her colleagues was that they were only asked four or five 
20 
questions in the polygraph test.  Is that customary to ask such a few 
number of questions? 
MS DLAMINI:  Let me just say – can – maybe I pay attention to that 
because I am not a professional polygrapher so I think one would have 
to look what happened there.  I think that is what I can say for now. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 97 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe let us put the question like this.  Do you 
conduct polygraph tests as part of your duties or have you done that in 
the past? 
MS DLAMINI:  No.  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not? 
MS DLAMINI:  No I do not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know whether there is – there are standard 
questions that are asked at – at a polygraph test? 
MS DLAMINI:  Of course yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MS DLAMINI:  There are standard questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS DLAMINI:  That are asked at a polygraph examination.  Yes there 
are. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do – do you have an idea how many the standard 
questions are more or less?  10, 20, 50, 200? 
MS DLAMINI:  Let us look at about 7/8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
MS DLAMINI:  Let us look at about 7/8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About 7/8? 
20 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  7 or 8? 
MS DLAMINI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Those would be the standard questions. 
MS DLAMINI:  Those would be the standard – yes. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 98 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the person conducting the test could ask 
additional questions? 
MS DLAMINI:  Exactly yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would you know whether in terms of asking additional 
questions those conducting the tests normally ask not more than a 
certain number of additional questions or is that something you would 
not know? 
MS DLAMINI:  No I would not know.  I would not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would not know. 
MS DLAMINI:  But all I can say is each case is treated on merit. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  On its own? 
MS DLAMINI:  On its own yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but the standard questions about 7 or 8? 
MS DLAMINI:  The standards questions are there Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS DLAMINI:  As guiding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS DLAMINI:  As the questions from vetting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS DLAMINI:  So the polygraph examiner concerned would treat that 
20 
case on merit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair I am indebted.  Ms Dlamini 
after today it would be useful for the commission also to be provided 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 99 of 190 
 
with those standard polygraph questions. 
MS DLAMINI:  Questions yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because as I understand it the ones you have 
given us are the guideline questions for the initial interview, correct? 
MS DLAMINI:  I think those are the questions that we gave to you.  
Those are the questions I am referring to. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh because those are about more than 100 
questions.  So – and I understand your evidence to be at the polygraph 
stage there are only 7 or 8, is that right? 
MS DLAMINI:  Standard ones. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja standard ones. 
MS DLAMINI:  Standard ones. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ja. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the person conducting the test is allowed… 
MS DLAMINI:  Can go further. 
MS DLAMINI:  To ask more? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – but you do not know whether there is a limit as 
to how many? 
MS DLAMINI:  No I – there is no limit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MS DLAMINI:  There is no limit. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 100 of 190 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I did not find in those guideline questions any 
question related to whether the person had leaked confidential 
information – SAA information to other parties.  Are you aware of that 
being a standard question? 
MS DLAMINI:  I am not aware. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I should have asked the question differently.  Is 
that a standard question? 
MS DLAMINI:  I do not know. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You do not know? 
MS DLAMINI:  I do not know. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I want to suggest to you it could not be 
because it is specific to SAA confidential information.  So it could not 
be a standard question for polygraphs, could it? 
MS DLAMINI:  Look I am trying to – to recall the questions now as you 
asking me.  So I do not want to say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No that is… 
MS DLAMINI:  That is standard that is not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well… 
20 
MS DLAMINI:  Because then you going to say, I said it is standard. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No, no, no. 
MS DLAMINI:  And it does not come up you see. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Dlamini might I make the suggestion.  We 
very close to the lunch break. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 101 of 190 
 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Maybe I could ask if you would during the lunch 
break just go over those guideline questions again. 
MS DLAMINI:  Do we have them here? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You do indeed.  They are the ones that we – I 
understand you said were those that were attached from page 43, is 
that correct? 
MS DLAMINI:  Page 43.  Are you talking about the vetting questions? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS DLAMINI:  Oh not the polygraph questions? 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No I thought that is what we just resolved.  I 
understood these not to be the polygraph questions, is that right? 
MS DLAMINI:  No these are not polygraph questions. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes so that is why I said could you please 
provide those to us after today. 
MS DLAMINI:  Oh yes I thought you said the polygraph questions are 
here because I was going to go through it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No we were at cross purposes.  Thank you so 
much. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  Ja. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No but then just over the lunch break if you can 
reflect on it and whether the question of leaking SAA confidential 
information is a standard polygraph question.  We would be indebted if 
you could assist us after the lunch break with that. 
MS DLAMINI:  How?  Could you give me more time? 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 102 of 190 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No I understand if you cannot do it. 
MS DLAMINI:  Alright ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it … 
MS DLAMINI:  No I cannot do it now. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If you cannot do it I thought I would ask. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja if you say you would not be able to … 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Get the answer within an hour – within the lunch 
break that is fine. 
MS DLAMINI:  No Advocate Hofmeyr I will… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  She does not know what – what you have access to 
and what you do not have access to. 
MS DLAMINI:  Advocate Hofmeyr I would – I am not in the position. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Understood. 
MS DLAMINI:  To obtain that information now. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But you can provide it later? 
MS DLAMINI:  I can provide it later. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just to explain my urgency in relation to this.  
It was the matter that we asked be traversed in the affidavit today and 
20 
we do not have a great deal of time in this commission.  And I 
understand your evidence to be it was overlooked and I fully 
understand that.  But if after today you could provide us with that 
information we would be grateful.   
MS DLAMINI:  Okay. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 103 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it the kind of information you might be able to 
provide tomorrow? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In one way or another? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair I indicated – we almost at the lunch 
break. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But we have a lot of logistics for the next 
10 
witness.  Can I say in respect of Ms Dlamini we would need to return a 
bit after lunch but not for very long I am really in the concluding 
sections of the questioning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And we fairly confident that we would complete 
the second witness still today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But there is the application for the second 
witness’ evidence to be given in-camera.  My proposal was that we deal 
with it before the lunch adjournment so that logistics related to him 
20 
could be dealt with over lunch.  I am just slightly concerned from a 
message I have given that we may not have the affidavit at this point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja if they are ready I can deal with it now? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh we seem to have a version that has not yet 
been redacted.  It is quite a process to redact.  But for the purposes 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 104 of 190 
 
now – do we have a copy that – Chair we have an un-redacted copy 
which if all we do is hand it up to you and it is moved un-redacted may 
not be a problem in order to facilitate it now.  But if we do require the 
redacted copies I – I just understand logistically that has not happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well was there not going to be one that would refer to 
him as Mr Y? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I – I am going to have to hand over to my 
learned friend. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because it is their application. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja let me … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hear what he has to say.  Ms Dlamini you may leave 
the witness stand for now.  You will come back after lunch. 
MS DLAMINI:  For now? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes for now.  Okay. 
MS DLAMINI:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   Chair  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   What we had done was to prepare the 
application in Mr Y’s name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   His real name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 105 of 190 
 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   But what we had sought in the Notice of 
Motion was that he be referred to as Y. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   So the application is in Mr X’s full name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Y’s. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   Mr Y’s full name as Chairperson indicated 
earlier that it should be brought in his name.  But the court – the order 
that we proposed to hand up refers to him as Mr Y. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh no what I meant was I did not want an application 
without any name but I did not mean that you have got to put in the 
10 
application his real name.  I – when I said Mr Y I meant that in the 
heading it could say Mr Y – Applicant.  And then in the affidavit what I 
was saying he could say, I, the undersigned Mr Y bla, bla, bla and then 
immediately explain that Mr Y is not my true name. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But for purposes of these proceedings I ask for leave 
that I be referred to as Mr Y bla, bla, bla.  That is the kind of thing I 
was talking about. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   Can I propose given the logistical issues? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
20 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   We have of course in the Notion of Motion 
sought that he be referred to as Mr Y. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   And I believe that Chairperson’s concerns can 
be dealt with by way of the redacted version as it was the intention 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 106 of 190 
 
much earlier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   But the affidavit in the sense is in his full 
name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   That is the application – that is the affidavit 
that will not be made available to the public. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   But for the purposes of the – of the order 
dealing with his application – with his – with how his evidence would be 
10 
deal with we have referred to him as Mr Y the Applicant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   So the concern where you – Chairperson says 
it should refer as Mr Y we can simply just deal with that by way of the 
redacted version. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well what – what I can do – but the information in the 
affidavit that you have just handed up is it the same as the information 
in the affidavit that you handed up in the morning? 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   Yes.  Yes but what we had done because we 
had prepared a supplementary affidavit dealing amongst others the fact 
20 
that Mr Y understands that although his identity and details will be 
protected that protection does not cover the version that is explained in 
his statement on which he will be led.  We just simply dealt with that 
and we also added a request that he should just be referred to as Mr Y 
for record purposes although Mr Y is not his full name. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 107 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now you would know that I dealt with an application 
which might be along the same lines two days ago.  The order that you 
had put up in the morning seemed to be wider than the order that I 
granted two days ago.  But I understand that you have been given a 
copy of the order that I made two days ago. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And has the draft order that you have put up now .. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   That is that… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it – is it exactly the same as the other one or not? 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   No is as we received it from the evidence 
leaders which is in line with Mr X’s – with the one that Chairperson 
made in relation to Mr X. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   We have no objection to that being made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So you – you essentially seek the same kind of 
order? 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   Yes Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   That would facilitate the resolution of this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   It covers all our concerns Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Just to be – maybe I think – I think maybe I – 
if the affidavit that you have put up is essentially the same as the one 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 108 of 190 
 
that you had given me in the morning – if they are the same I am quite 
happy not to use the one that has got his name and use the one that 
does not have his name on the basis that it will be amended 
appropriately after I have – I have dealt with the application. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   That can be done Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That can be done? 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   We will just simply just … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   Correct it later on and take out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Take this back then to – to him.  So basically you will 
10 
ensure that the application – the applicant is Mr Y is reflected as Mr Y. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   We will do so Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But certainly now the application can be taken to be 
brought by Mr Y. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   And we would – if you are so inclined would – 
we would move for the order as has been proposed by the evidence 
leaders. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
20 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   It does cover all the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me see – what the basis simply that – was the 
basis for this kind of order arising from Mr Y’s employment? 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   Yes Chairperson and given is nature or the 
nature of his – of his work within the agency. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 109 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADV DAVID MTSWENI: I think that is covered at paragraph 3 
Chairperson of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   We have just handed up to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no I remember.  I think that the – the issue 
of Notice is it dealt with in the affidavit notice to implicated persons?  
How is it dealt with? 
10 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   Chair we had left that to the evidence leaders 
seeing that they would be the one to notify as the rules require that 
they would notify anyone implicated.  We do not address the issue of 
implicated persons but we believe that should there be a need for the 
implicated persons to – would like to cross-examine Mr Y they would 
follow the procedure outlined in the rules and that logistical issues can 
be dealt with between them and the evidence leaders but for the 
purposes of that I think that could also be addressed by the – by the Y 
application. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Hm. 
20 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Let me just check who will address the 
issue of notice with me? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Certainly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 110 of 190 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And may I just before I do that raise one point 
because my learned friend does not know the precise terms. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of the order we gave in respect of Mr X. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The one addition if I could just be – pass a 
copy.  Chair if you just look at the draft order that has been handed to 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Handed up.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The – the paragraph 2 on Mr X’s order only 
10 
requested that his name not be disclosed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right but the request of this witness is that his 
name and other identifying features also not be disclosed.  So I just 
wanted to draw to your attention. 
CHAIRPERSON:  My – the two I have on this draft order reads: 
“The witness name shall not be disclosed or 
published in any manner.” 
That is the one. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is number 2. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You and I have the wrong version then Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the one that was just handed up now. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 111 of 190 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let me – let me just clarify. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is written Mr Y. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As applicant. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I think the numerous versions today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Suggests you and I have got the wrong one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Could I just read into the record we will make 
sure that there are copies sufficient. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Is there not another copy from the… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There is another copy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But it refers to the State Security Agency as 
the applicant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But we have resolved that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  As I understand it.  If I can simply hand you up 
the correct wording for paragraph 2?  But we will after this Chair 
ensure that it correctly reflects the applicant as Mr Y. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair this was the draft order that was handed 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 112 of 190 
 
to my learned friend this morning from the evidence leaders. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Prior to your engagement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  About Mr Y needing to be the applicant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And so all I would like to draw your attention to 
is that paragraph 2 is broader than it was for Mr X. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You will see there it is – the witness’ name, his 
10 
position within the agency and the nature of his duties should not be 
disclosed in his evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So I needed to draw your attention to – just to 
that discrepancy so that there was no misunderstanding as to its being 
a replica of Mr X’s order.  But then on the question of notice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair the – the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So other than that part… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is the same. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  They are the same. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Then on the question of Notice to implicated 
persons.  The steps that were taken by the legal team on receipt of Mr 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 113 of 190 
 
Y’s main affidavit plus this application was to send Rule 3.3 Notices to 
all persons implicated in the main affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And all that we did in the Notice was we 
continued to maintain the confidentiality about the witness’ identity.  
And so rather than referring to him by name we indicated in the Notice 
that a witness who will make application to have his identity not 
disclosed will implicate you in the following respects.   So that process 
has taken its course and it was done timeously. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And I can tell you that we have received no 
responses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay no that is fine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then unless counsel for Mr Y has anything else I am 
quite happy to make an – make the order here? 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   Chairperson we would happy as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  In respect of the application brought by Mr Y I 
20 
grant the following order. 
1. The witness is to be referred to during his evidence to the 
commission and after his evidence insofar as the commission is 
concerned as Mr Y. 
2. The witness’ name, his position within the State Security Agency 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 114 of 190 
 
and the nature of his duties shall not be disclosed or published in 
any manner. 
3. No person may take or publish any photograph, image or 
appearance of the witness nor have his photograph or image or 
appearance published in any way nor broadcast any video of the 
witness. 
4. The witness need not present – need not be present at the 
commission’s hearing venue when giving evidence – his evidence 
and may give his evidence from a secret location. 
5. No person other than the Chairperson, members of the 
10 
commission’s legal team, the commission’s safety and security 
advisor, those necessary to assist the witness when he gives 
evidence or another person specifically designated by the 
Chairperson will be permitted to enter the secret location without 
the prior written permission of the Chairperson. 
6. An audio link from the secret location will be provided so that the 
witness’ evidence can be heard in the hearing room when he 
gives it. 
7. This order may be amended or supplemented by the Chairperson 
at any time if in his opinion that is necessary to ensure the non-
20 
disclosure of the witness’ name and appearance or to ensure 
fairness to any implicated person. 
That is the order. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So you will make the necessary amendments 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 115 of 190 
 
on page 1 in terms of the – of who the applicant is? 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   Will do so Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  We are going to adjourn.  I am tempted to 
say maybe we should resume at quarter past two. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I think that will be helpful Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because of… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Logistics. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Logistics. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  We will adjourn now and we are going to resume 
at quarter past two. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We are indeed, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Ms Dlamini, before we broke for 
the lunch adjournment we were on page 13 of your affidavit - EXHIBIT 
DD24.  Do you have that in front of you? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  Yes.  I do. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 116 of 190 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what we had been dealing with was your 
follow up with Ms Myeni when you were concerned about impacts on the 
integrity and progress of the process and then you indicated that there 
had been quite an improvement after that.  Is that correct? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you indicate on page 13 - towards the 
bottom at paragraph 3.15.  That final a report was prepared.  I assume 
that is in relation to the vetting.  Is that correct? 
MS DLAMINI:  That is correct Advocate Meyr - Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And it was - and it was presented to 
10 
Minister Mahlobo in January 2017.  Is that right? 
MS DLAMINI:  That is right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Now that was attached to your affidavit.  So I 
would like to just take you to that presentation and it commences at 
page 50 - 5-0. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is this a presentation you prepared? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  This is the presentation I prepared. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And it says on the first page - page 50 there 
that: 
20 
“It was presented by Project Leader …” 
And I take that to be a reference to yourself.  Is that correct? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  “…on 17 January 2017.” 
Is that correct? 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 117 of 190 
 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you present this presentation? 
MS DLAMINI:  I - it was forwarded to the office of our Ministry by 
myself.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So did you - did you ever actually present it at 
any meeting at SAA or otherwise? 
MS DLAMINI:  At S - at … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  SAA. 
MS DLAMINI:  SAA?  No.  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No.  So what was this prepared for? 
10 
MS DLAMINI:  The Board. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The Board? 
MS DLAMINI:  The Board. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And despite it saying “presented by” … 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You did not actually present it.  Is that correct? 
MS DLAMINI:  No.  I did not actually present it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you know whether it was presented? 
MS DLAMINI:  No.  I do not know. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay, but this was your final … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Would it be correct to say presented by 
was meant to be prepared by? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 118 of 190 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is helpful.  Thank you Chair. 
MS DLAMINI:  That is helpful.  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So it was prepared by you … 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And this is at the conclusion of the vetting 
exercise.  Is that correct? 
MS DLAMINI:  Absolutely.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So I would like to just take you to a few items 
within this.  Ms Dlamini, we have already traversed the respect in which 
your project plan had identified the objective of the vetting exercise.  I 
10 
do not suggest that we go over that again. 
MS DLAMINI:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You have had a lot of questions, but I do just 
want to note for the purposes of the record that the same objective is 
recorded when you came to finalise this report on the vetting exercise 
and you will find that at page 53.  Do you see there the second 
paragraph reads in the same terms that your project plan read?  Sorry.  
You might - page 53 - 5-3. 
MS DLAMINI:  5-3, oh.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you have that? 
20 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  I have that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So the second paragraph there read - I think in 
exactly the same words. 
“The objective is to ensure that all classified and 
sensitive documents within … 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 119 of 190 
 
“I think it is again supposed to be … 
“…SAA are accessed by personal with valid security 
clearances.” 
Do you see that? 
MS DLAMINI:  I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So both at the inception and at the conclusion 
of the vetting process you describe its objective in these terms.  Is that 
correct? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then I would like to go to page 60 - 6-0. 
10 
MS DLAMINI:  I am with you.  I am with you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So at the top of that page you talk about the 
project’s success and you record there: 
“The project’s success contributes immensely to the 
agency meeting its objectives.  In essence 70 
percent of Executive Management and support staff 
have been vetted.  Currently there are 85 cases of 
which clearance have been concluded.  The cases 
20 
that are not concluded are still under further 
investigations.  There were no strikes or serious 
disturbances reported since the project started.” 
Do you see that? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  I see that. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 120 of 190 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Are strikes and serious disturbances things that 
sometimes do occur when vetting operations are carried out? 
MS DLAMINI:  It has never occurred Advocate Hofmeyr, but I was quite 
cautions, because with the SAA anything could have happened.  There 
are unions involved.  There might have been a - Executives that would 
approach the unions to state whatever reasons.  So that is why I had to 
indicate it there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Were - were you alerted to the fact that there 
was dissatisfaction or concern amongst the Executives that might have 
led them to raise these issues with the unions? 
10 
MS DLAMINI:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No? 
MS DLAMINI:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you still thought it necessary to record 
that? 
MS DLAMINI:  Of course, because in terms of the work that we were 
doing there it would be important not to put the entity under any undue 
stress. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm.  Hm. 
MS DLAMINI:  So it - it comes from that thinking … 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS DLAMINI:  Chairperson. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And in the penultimate bullet on that page … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before you move away from that issue 
Ms Hofmeyr.  I - I do not understand Ms Dlamini what the relevance is 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 121 of 190 
 
of that sentence in the context of your report.  There were no strikes or 
serious disturbances reported.  You say since the project started.  So 
you are looking at during the time - during the life of the 
project.MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are now at the end. You are preparing your 
report. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please help me understand why strikes and 
disturbances would be relevant to put in … 
MS DLAMINI:  Hm. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  This kind of report? 
MS DLAMINI:  We invited the Member of Parliament in 2015 and we 
experienced the - the union who cited that they were not happy with 
certain issues.  So that did have an impact in delaying the work.  So it 
was important for me to state that in this instance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see if your - if you had said something along the 
lines that you are not aware of anybody who was unhappy about the 
project.  That - that I would understand.  Your - your reference to what 
happened in Parliament I would understand it, but in Parliament you are 
not saying there were strikes and disturbances or at least you are not 
20 
saying there were strikes.  It seems that some unhappiness was there 
… 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But strikes. 
MS DLAMINI:  Anything possible might have happened. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 122 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay. 
MS DLAMINI:  That - that is the thinking that I had … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS DLAMINI:  Because if employees - any other person employed in a 
State organ who is not happy.  The first contact would be the unions 
and what happens after that the complaints, the - the strikes … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS DLAMINI:  That is … (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Well I do not know about strikes. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think let us move on. 
MS DLAMINI:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Dlamini, the second last 
bullet on that page. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You record that: 
“SAA reported an improvement on their revenue 
(about two billion turnover) as a result of the 
vetting project.” 
Where did you obtain that information from? 
20 
MS DLAMINI:  As I indicated before I had continuous engagement with 
the Acting CEO at the time and I did ask him to say since the inception 
of the project what has been the developments.  Are there any 
improvement or any other issue that must be - that we must take note 
of.  So it comes from - from that. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 123 of 190 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you make that request to him verbally? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And did he communicate this information to you 
verbally? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And he specifically said that there was a R2 
billion turnover that SAA had achieved as a result of this vetting 
project? 
MS DLAMINI:  He did not say “as a result”, but he said they have seen 
some shift - a positive shift in terms of the revenue … (intervenes). 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So did - were you the one who then when you 
described it here related it to the vetting project? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Dlamini, on what possible basis could a 
movement in the turnover of SAA be causally linked back to the vetting 
project? 
MS DLAMINI:  I must say that I did not have access to the financials at 
that time … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS DLAMINI:  But I know that it is individuals that manipulates the 
20 
system.  It is individuals that are engaged in mismanagement of funds.  
So any positive shift during that period I would say … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No Ms Dlamini please.  No.  No.  Please.  Please.  
Are you going to persist in saying that because of this vetting process 
suddenly SAA got it a R2 billion … 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 124 of 190 
 
MS DLAMINI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Turnover? 
MS DLAMINI:  Chairperson, can I explain please? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS DLAMINI:  Can I explain? 
CHAIRPERSON:  But is that what you are going to say? 
MS DLAMINI:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That as a result of … 
MS DLAMINI:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This project? 
10 
MS DLAMINI:  No.  I am just saying there was a positive shift.  Maybe 
it should have been stated that way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What positive shift? 
MS DLAMINI:  To say there was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  What happened as a result of this project? 
MS DLAMINI:  There was some revenue generation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Revenue generation? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is your thinking? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Over the page you list some of the other 
impacts of the project.  The first of those at page 61 is the resignation 
of seven Executives Managers.  Do you see that? 
MS DLAMINI:  Page? 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 125 of 190 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  61. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So seven Executive Managers resigned.  Is that 
correct? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then on the third bullet on that page you 
record: 
“The great success of the SAA Vetting Project has 
resulted in the project being extended to other 
entities within SAA.” 
10 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you see that? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Which were those other entities? 
MS DLAMINI:  We never got to vet any other Executives within the N - 
NDT, but my thinking was that remember there was an indication from 
the former Chairperson that we must vet the pilots.  So my thinking was 
in terms of the work that we did there it was of high standard to an 
extent that there - there was a need for us to also vet the other group. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well let us unpack that a bit. 
20 
MS DLAMINI:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You say the great success of the SAA Vetting 
Project.  What - what was the great success about it? 
MS DLAMINI:  The fact that we were able to advice in terms of the 
risks. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 126 of 190 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What were you able to advice? 
MS DLAMINI:  On - in terms of the risks. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What risks?  What advice were you able to 
give? 
MS DLAMINI:  I think it is tabled on this report in terms of our findings 
and recommendations. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  Take me to those if you will. 
MS DLAMINI:  It is on page - just give me a second.  Just - just give 
me a second. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Sure. 
10 
MS DLAMINI:  Because I swear that is where their findings and 
recommendations.  That is where I am trying to get to. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Findings of the project? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know where it is Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I - I must say I do not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So that is actually why … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I have asked for Ms Dlamini’s assistance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there an index? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No. 
MS DLAMINI:  Ja.  I think - ja.  I think maybe there is a … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There is a - there is a … 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 127 of 190 
 
MS DLAMINI:  There is slide.  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Sort of contents page, but it does not give a 
reference point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To - to - yes. 
MS DLAMINI:  Ja.  Ja.  I think there - there is a list inside. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if - if the content page does not have findings as 
an item.  I do not think you will find findings - any heading saying 
“Findings” in the report, because findings would have been quite 
important … 
MS DLAMINI:  Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they would have been included in the content I 
would imagine. 
S DLAMINI:  Hm.  Hm.  No.  I think I must acknowledge the mistake 
from my part … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS DLAMINI:  Because they - they should have been there.  Yes 
Chairperson … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS DLAMINI:  Because that is what I was referring to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  I think it is the mistake from the attachments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS DLAMINI:  That was supposed to be in.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So just help me again.  What then was the 
great success of the project? 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 128 of 190 
 
MS DLAMINI:  There were - there - there is a slide where we advise the 
client in terms of the risks identified. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh.  Sorry.  No.  That I do know where that is.  
That is at page 62. 
MS DLAMINI:  Is it page 62? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Sorry.  I had also thought we were looking for 
findings, but this is - I - is this page where their risks identified? 
MS DLAMINI:  No.  No.  It is not … (intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But the heading says “Risks Identified”. 
MS DLAMINI:  No.  During the - the course of the project. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  These were the risks … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh. 
MS DLAMINI:  But the final … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No.  I have not seen that. 
MS DLAMINI:  Ja.  It is not here. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  So … 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There was supposed to be in this presentation 
some recordal of the risks that you had … 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Identified. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 129 of 190 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is correct? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  Tell us now what were those risks? 
MS DLAMINI:  Let me think now.  They were indications of Executives 
who had - let me think.  Can I provide those please?  Can - can I get a 
chance to provide those?  I am thinking out of my head.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It - it would have been helpful for them to be 
provided today … 
10 
MS DLAMINI:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But let us just get the evidence as at today. 
MS DLAMINI:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You cannot recall what the great success was 
… 
MS DLAMINI:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of the SAA Vetting Exercise? 
MS DLAMINI:  I want to be more accurate … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS DLAMINI:  In terms of what I had … 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS DLAMINI:  Tabled down. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS DLAMINI:  Rather than talking from my head. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  Yes. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 130 of 190 
 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  I think it is - it is better that way. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay and you say at that same bullet: 
“The great success of the SAA Vetting Project has 
resulted to the project being extended to other 
entities within SAA.” 
That when I read it suggests to me it - it is something that 
has happened.  It has resulted in that extension.  Do you understand 
that in the same way as me? 
MS DLAMINI:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh. 
10 
MS DLAMINI:  I understand it in a sense that I received a - an 
indication to say we are going to request that you vet the other - for 
instance the pilots. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  So it comes from that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I see. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So it was anticipating a request that would then 
be acted upon. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that right? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you thought that that would be a positive 
result out of this process. 
MS DLAMINI:  Very much. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 131 of 190 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that correct? 
MS DLAMINI:  Very much. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
MS DLAMINI:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why would that be?  Why would you want to vet 
pilots? 
MS DLAMINI:  Not specifically pilots … (intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That was the request.  Was it not? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  That was the request, but I am saying my thinking 
is because the team was above board in terms of our processes.  In 
10 
terms of the work that we supposed to do there.  Judging by the fact 
that there were no issues that were raised with the organisation or 
myself during the period that we were there and then if now we get an 
indication to say can we extend … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm.  Hm. 
MS DLAMINI:  To vet this.  So from my part it would say:  job well 
done. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm.  Hm. 
MS DLAMINI:  That was my thinking. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Who was that request from to vet the pilots? 
20 
MS DLAMINI:  It came from the former Chairperson of SAA. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Myeni? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you intend at any point to determine 
whether you could lawfully vet the pilots or would her request have 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 132 of 190 
 
been enough? 
MS DLAMINI:  No.  We never got to deliberate on that … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS DLAMINI:  Particular issue, because my focus was mainly on - on 
the work at hand. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then if we go to page 65. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just going back to the - to page 61. 
“The great success of the SAA Vetting Project has 
10 
resulted to the project being extended to other 
entities within SAA.” 
Are you saying that you are not able to tell us what the great success 
was of the project?  You want to go and have a look at it - at some 
document? 
MS DLAMINI:  I am saying Chairperson in terms of the findings and 
recommendation they were supposed to be attached to this report.  
They are not here today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No.  Leave out the findings … 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And recommendations.  Here you say the great 
success of the SAA Vetting Project has resulted blah, blah, blah.  So 
the question that Ms Hofmeyr asked earlier on was what is that success 
that you are talking about here and I understood you to say you want to 
have a look at some document.  So I am wondering whether you were 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 133 of 190 
 
the leader of this project … 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot tell us this was the - the great success … 
MS DLAMINI:  There … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the project. 
MS DLAMINI:  I am saying as I know them, but it would be better to 
read from the - the document that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS DLAMINI:  Contains that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Tell me the great success as you know it even if it is 
10 
not going to be exactly as documented somewhere. 
MS DLAMINI:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This was a - this was a big project … 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And an important project.  Is it not? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  Of course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  You cannot remember what it is great success 
was if it had a great success. 
MS DLAMINI:  For example Chairperson we would advise SAA to revisit 
their recruitment strategy, because you would find that the Executives 
20 
that are already in the system there was no clause in the contract to 
say they - they will have to undergo vetting.  Secondly, in terms of the 
measures such as taking an oath, declaration of - of secrecy such as - 
let me think.  Those were not undertaken when the people entered the 
system. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 134 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that is the … 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Great success? 
MS DLAMINI:  That is the great success. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS DLAMINI:  It means - by that I mean we have been able to influence 
policy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR: 
 
Could 
you 
not 
have 
given 
those 
two 
recommendations without conducting the vetting? 
MS DLAMINI:  No.  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well let us take each of them.  I want to 
suggest to you that all you needed to do was go to SAA.  Have a 
meeting with the Board and Management.  Ask them whether in the 
terms of the contracts of employment of the existing Executives they 
had a clause that required them to be subjected to vetting and if the 
answer in that meeting was, no.  There are not.  Then you could have 
given that advice on that day.  Correct? 
20 
MS DLAMINI:  I believe Advocate Hofmeyr you are taking an approach 
that would be sort of ad hoc. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS DLAMINI:  In this case there was a project in place … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 135 of 190 
 
MS DLAMINI:  And we had to do an investigative systematic approach 
to the individuals that are already at the strategic level.  So in that 
sense you are saying there was no need … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS DLAMINI:  To the vet the officials. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS DLAMINI:  I would have walked in there.  Check one, two, three … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS DLAMINI:  And make findings which - I - I do not think … 
(intervenes). 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No.  What I am probing Ms Dlamini. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is whether you have to subject 118 Managers 
and support staff at SAA to invasive security vetting procedures if you 
tell us that the two great success of this project were things you could 
have done without vetting a single person and let me just be clear 
about it. 
The first one you gave us was that you were able to advise 
SAA about revisiting their recruitment. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So that they could include in their contracts … 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  With employees that they must subject 
themselves to vetting. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 136 of 190 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I want to put it to you.  You could have given 
that advice after one engagement with Management and the Board of 
SAA.  Establish that it is not in the contracts and advise them to put it 
in.  What is your response to that? 
MS DLAMINI:  I do not agree with you, because now we are talking 
about the project that had to be undertaken.  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No Ms Dlamini.  What Ms Hofmeyr has put to you is 
she is questioning the need for this project of vetting to have happened 
and particularly maybe at the size at which it happened.  So she is 
drawing your attention to say here is another way in which you could 
10 
have achieved what you call a great success without this vetting project 
that subjected people to a very invasive process. 
That is what she is saying.  She is questioning the need for 
the vetting project to have been embarked upon … 
MS DLAMINI:  Let me just indicate … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And she is inviting you to say whether you agree that 
you did not need to do the vetting exercise in order to establish 
whether the contracts … 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of employment of the Executives had a clause saying 
20 
they should undertake that.  You obviously did not need the - the 
vetting process to establish what is in the contract. 
MS DLAMINI:  Chairperson that is why I said it would have been better 
to refer to the findings and recommendations here and … (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  Why refer to that?  We are not talking about that. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 137 of 190 
 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Cast your mind back to before the project started.  If 
you want to - if one of the things you wanted to check is whether the 
Executives contracts of employment had a certain clause.  You did not 
need the betting process for that - to establish that.  You needed to 
check with management or say let me see the contracts. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you - do you agree? 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  I agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you would - if you were given the contracts 
10 
you would know whether they have got … 
MS DLAMINI:  That … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The clauses that you are looking for. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS DLAMINI:  You are correct, but that is the - not the only focus or 
the outcome … (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  No.  That is fine. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She is taking the three points which you - you gave 
20 
us great success one by one. 
MS DLAMINI:  I see. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what she is doing. 
MS DLAMINI:  And let me also highlight that in terms of the strategic 
goals of vetting.  It is to ensure that corruption is reduced in a State 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 138 of 190 
 
Owned Entity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  We will actually come to the point 
about corruption … 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you gave a second great success and that 
was the recommendations you made regarding the requirement that 
there be a declaration of secrecy undertaken by Executives.  Did I have 
that correct? 
10 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS DLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So again I want to suggest to you that that was 
a recommendation that could have been made without the need to 
conduct any part of the vetting exercise. 
MS DLAMINI:  I think Advocate Hofmeyr what is happening now you are 
saying you are going through what I am saying and you are trying to 
say there was no need for vetting. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is precisely what I am … (intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  She - she has told you that is what she - she is 
challenging. 
MS DLAMINI:  And I do not agree with her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but she is giving you a chance to - to say why … 
MS DLAMINI:  Okay. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 139 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not agree. 
MS DLAMINI:  I was explaining that in terms of the goal we had to 
make sure that corruption is reduced there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm.  Hm. 
MS DLAMINI:  In order for us to reach that goal we would highlight any 
other issue.  It can be small or big.  It can be small or big, but the main 
goal is to ensure that corruption is reduced there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just specifically on … 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I guess Ms Dlamini going back to the discussion 
we had earlier on that all the millions of State employees we have in 
10 
South Africa are supposed to be security vetted, if they have all been 
vetted and despite that we have the high levels of corruption that we 
are having then this security vetting doesn’t help reduce corruption. 
MS DLAMINI:   We have not vetted all of them Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mmm? 
MS DLAMINI:   We have not vetted all of them Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why not? 
MS DLAMINI:   The magnitude of the work is too much. 
CHAIRPERSON:   (laughing)  Ms Hofmeyr”? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Ms Dlamini you do refer to corruption 
20 
combating at page 65 of your reports. 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Could you go there? 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   In the penultimate bullet on page 65 you 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 140 of 190 
 
record SAA has expressed satisfaction regarding the significant role 
the Agency continues to play in combating corruption, do you see that? 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   How did your vetting operation assist in 
combating corruption at SAA? 
MS DLAMINI:   Personal security vetting is the first point of ensuring 
that the people, the Executives that are there are men and women of 
integrity. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Ms Dlamini I am going to come back to 
whether that is the first step, but I want to for the present set of 
10 
questions accept what you’ve said that the first step towards combating 
corruption is to do security vetting and ensure that the people who are 
employed in these State owned companies are persons of integrity, 
have I captured that correctly? 
MS DLAMINI:   You have captured that correctly. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Okay when people who were vetted didn’t get 
security clearance why were they allowed to retain their jobs? 
MS DLAMINI:   Because legally we are not covered in terms of that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   What does that mean? 
MS DLAMINI:   It means it is unclear as to say do you dismiss the 
20 
person, do you still keep the person in the entity. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   But Ms Dlamini that means your security 
vetting exercise can have no impact on curbing corruption.   Let me 
explain to you why.   If security vetting is a necessary step towards 
securing against corruption in an entity then it has to be effective, you 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 141 of 190 
 
have to be able to do your security vetting, determine that somebody 
shouldn’t be given clearance and then be able to get rid of them.  If 
your evidence today is you can’t take that step then the entire exercise 
has no purpose. 
MS DLAMINI:   I don’t think that is correct Advocate Hofmeyr, because 
as I have indicated before any risk that can be reduced at that 
particular time and in terms of advising on the measures that needs to 
be addressed by that particular institution it does make a difference.   
Yes you cannot fire a person on the spot to say they must leave that 
particular organisation, but you would – we would have advised the 
10 
entity to say one, two, three needs to be taken caution of. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would your advice have included whether they 
should dismiss people who didn’t receive security clearance? 
MS DLAMINI:   At this point because the law does not cover that part 
we have not indicated that there should be a dismissal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the short answer is you would not advise an 
entity to dismiss people who fail to get a security clearance? 
MS DLAMINI:   Especially Chairperson because there are Labour 
Relations issues relating to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And somebody thinks that it would not be a good 
20 
ground to dismiss somebody who is not able to get security clearance 
in an entity that emphasizes on fighting corruption? 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So if you did security vetting in an entity and you did 
subject 100 people to the security vetting and 50 of them did not get 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 142 of 190 
 
clearance you would still not be able to advise the entity to get rid of 
the 50? 
MS DLAMINI:   No we wouldn’t say they must dismiss them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so they would stay with the problem that half of 
its staff have failed to get security clearance? 
MS DLAMINI:   For instance we would advise on programs that need to 
be undertaken to deal with the issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But did I misunderstand your evidence when I 
thought it was to the effect that you need to have your staff security 
cleared in order to reduce corruption or potential for corruption, did I 
10 
understand your evidence correctly? 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes, yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but you agree that in the example I am giving 
then the entity would remain with quite a serious risk as far as State 
Security Agency is concerned? 
MS DLAMINI:   It would mean for instance you would have to give 
access to that particular individual to information that is not of high 
sensitivity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair.  Ms Dlamini I promised 
20 
earlier in the evidence I would take you to the law, because I suggested 
that the understanding that you describe of when security vetting can 
take place in State Owned Enterprises is not correct.   I want to be 
clear about why I am doing this, I am not suggesting that you are 
lawyer, what I am – what is relevant for this proceeding is what your 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 143 of 190 
 
understanding of the law is, and what the understanding of your 
colleagues are who conduct vetting exercises.    
 
You have made it clear in your evidence today that your 
understanding, and I have your evidence to be it is an understanding 
shared in the vetting department of the State Security Agency, is that 
you can vet all employees of State Owned Companies, is that correct? 
MS DLAMINI:   Employed yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, yes. 
MS DLAMINI:   According to Section 2 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Not you can Ms Hofmeyr, you must. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Oh you must, apologies, it’s a must.   
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And you have also confirmed that you don’t 
need to check before you do that whether they have access to 
classified information or not, correct? 
MS DLAMINI:   I am moving in terms of Section 2A. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, no but the answer, I have ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   She is asking whether she understood your evidence 
earlier correctly? 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes, yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Okay, let’s go to Section 2A if we may, it is in 
the legislation bundle at page 365. 
MS DLAMINI:   Which one? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   The legislation bundle, yes, it is the big one in 
front of you and it is page 365. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 144 of 190 
 
MS D DLAMINI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So I just would like to read for the record and 
for your benefit what sub-section 1 of Section 2A says.   It says: 
“The relevant members of the National Intelligence Structures 
may conduct a vetting investigation in the prescribed manner 
to determine the security competence of a person if such 
person is employed by or is an applicant to an Organ of 
State.” 
Do you see that? 
MS D DLAMINI:   Yes.  
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Now as I understand it, it is that section on 
which you rely for the evidence today that is your understanding that 
you can – you must vet everyone who is employed at an Organ of State, 
is that correct? 
MS D DLAMINI:    Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Ms Dlamini I would agree with that 
understanding ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well Ms Hofmeyr I don’t know whether I’m hearing 
things that you are not saying, but I think it is the second time I hear 
you as if you say Ms Myeni. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Oh my goodness, it is entirely possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did anybody hear something like that.   No? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Chair it happens at around three o’clock in the 
afternoon. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 145 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no a lot of people say – a lot of people say 
you didn’t say that, so maybe it is just me.  Ms Dlamini you didn’t hear 
anything like that? 
MS D DLAMINI:   No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   That I called you Ms Myeni? 
MS D DLAMINI:   I think, I think, I think ...[intervenes]  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Oh goodness, maybe I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You think? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   You see this side of the room are my 
supporters, I don’t think they are necessarily ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I can tell you this side too you have supporters.   
Okay, alright, maybe I just ...[intervenes]  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No and can I just say for the transcript 
purposes if I did make that error please it is Ms Dlamini who is giving 
evidence today. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, it is just the past two days we heard a lot of Ms 
Myeni and Mr Myeni. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, and Mr Myeni and there was that 
confusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Ms Dlamini we were looking at Section 2A. 
MS D DLAMINI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And you were explaining that that’s where 
your understanding is derived from.   Now what I am about to say if that 
section read as follows and said the relevant members of the National 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 146 of 190 
 
Intelligence Structures may conduct a vetting investigation ... and then 
it left out the words that follow ... and continued ... if such a person is 
employed by or an applicant to an Organ of State, then I could see it 
having the meaning that you attribute to it.   Do you see that?    
MS D DLAMINI:   Thank you very much for that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, but the problem Ms Dlamini is that those 
words do appear there, the words “in the prescribed manner to 
determine the security competence of a person” is there, and what that 
means is we have to go in the Act to the definition of security 
competence, to know when it is that vetting investigations can be 
10 
conducted by members of the National Intelligence Structures, and you 
will find the definition of security competence at page 363. 
MS D DLAMINI:   363.  Yes I am with you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.   So you will see a definition of 
security competence there, just below halfway down the page, the 
definition reads as follows: 
“Security competence means a person’s ability to act in such 
a manner that he or she does not cause classified information 
or material to fall into unauthorised hands thereby harming or 
endangering the security or interests of the State.” 
20 
And then it goes on to describe how you measure that.   You measure it 
against three things; the person’s susceptibility to extortion or 
blackmail, the person’s amenability to bribes and susceptibility to being 
compromised due to his or her behaviour and the person’s loyalty to the 
State and the relevant institution.   
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 147 of 190 
 
 
Ms Dlamini the important part of that definition is that it is 
concerned with a person’s ability to cause classified information or 
material to fall into unauthorised hands.  Do you agree that that’s an 
important part of that definition? 
MS D DLAMINI:   Yes I agree that security competency is mainly to 
ensure that information does not land into unauthorised hands. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, so when you read Section 2A with that 
definition I want to tell you the meaning I give it and then I would like 
you to tell me whether you have a different understanding of it.   You 
see 2A is an empowering provision, it says members of the National 
10 
Intelligence Structures may conduct an investigation in the prescribed 
manner to determine the security competence of a person, and in order 
to know what may lawfully be included in a security vetting operation 
you have to know what security competence is, and security 
competence is a person’s ability to divulge confidential information.  Do 
you accept that that’s the meaning of security competence? 
MS D DLAMINI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I want to put it to you, and you can tell me if 
your understanding is different, that what is required for lawful vetting 
of investigations to be conducted at Organs of State is that you have to 
20 
determine first whether there is a person who has an ability to cause 
confidential information or material to fall into unauthorised hands, and 
once you have identified that there are persons who have that ability 
then you can conduct vetting investigations. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 148 of 190 
 
MS D DLAMINI:   No Advocate Hofmeyr, I am not of the same thinking 
as you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   But you accept your understanding requires 
certain words in Section 2A to be deleted? 
MS D DLAMINI:   I would want to stick to Section ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well that might require to be a lawyer. 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   On a pure understanding of the language I 
think we accepted that those words could be removed in order for your 
meaning to apply, is that correct? 
10 
MS D DLAMINI:   Let me just stick to my meaning. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS D DLAMINI:   I think it is safe for me to say. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let me ask you this question, if you accept that 
the purpose of conducting a vetting investigation in terms of Section 2A 
is to determine the security competence of a person, if you accept that 
that’s the purpose. 
MS D DLAMINI:   I’m with you yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you accept that the security competence of a 
20 
person relates to the ability of that person to cause confidential 
information to land in unauthorised hands.   If you accept that isn’t the 
position therefore this, that there are a lot of people that can be 
excluded from the need for a vetting investigation because by virtue of 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 149 of 190 
 
the type of job they do, they are far away from being able to access 
confidential information. 
MS DLAMINI:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because if they can’t access it they can’t cause it to 
land in unauthorised hands, do you accept that? 
MS DLAMINI:   Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS DLAMINI:   Absolutely, absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Chair I am indebted.  Ms Dlamini there is one 
10 
point and I made the error and I got a furious note from my colleagues 
when I made it, when we look at the definition of security competence I 
don’t want us to not use the language that is recorded there, it is not 
actually – it does not actually say access to confidential information, it 
talks about access to classified information, which has a very particular 
meaning in a security setting.  
MS D DLAMINI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So what I would like to emphasize is that on 
the description that the Chair has just given you, it is not simply – the 
relevant question is not simply whether a person has access to 
20 
confidential information. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Because there might be reams of confidential 
information. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It’s classified. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 150 of 190 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   It is actually classified information, do you 
accept that?  That that’s what security competence is concerned with? 
MS D DLAMINI:      Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Right, and then if I tell you that no manager at 
SAA has ever accessed classified information, would you have any 
basis on which to dispute that? 
MS D DLAMINI:    I’m sure you would provide me with a – the 
information that informs what you say. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed, but you never checked whether they 
did have access to classified information or not? 
10 
MS D DLAMINI:   No, no, no. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Because Miss Olitski[?] in her affidavit makes 
it clear she has been at SAA at the time of deposing to her affidavit for 
eight years, so that means she started in 2012 and in those eight years 
she has never, she is the head – let me just get this right, because I 
got this wrong the other day when I referred to someone as the Head, 
but she is at page 68 the Head of Department for Financial Accounting 
at South African Airways.    
 
In her affidavit she says the following about classified 
information; you don’t necessarily have to go there, you can just ask 
20 
me to give you the reference for where I make this claim.  It is at page 
72 in EXHIBIT DD24, feel free to go there if you wish, but I will read it 
in.  Ms Olitski says: 
“I did not think it was a requirement for a finance manager in 
an airline to have such clearance anyway.  In the years I had 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 151 of 190 
 
worked at SAA I had never seen a document that could be 
deemed 
classified, 
as 
secret 
or 
top 
secret. 
 
The 
Commission’s investigators have indicated 
to 
me 
that 
classified information would usually be identified by way a 
classified secret or top secret stamp or marking.” 
And she confirms that that is not something she ever came across in 
her eight years. 
 
If that was so and given what you have accepted about the 
purpose and the structure of this Act would you accept that it was not 
lawful for the State Security Agency to conduct this vetting without 
10 
establishing whether the people that was vetting ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...[Indistinct]  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Do you accept or let me ask differently 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe another way of asking it would be this without 
requiring you to have legal knowledge. 
MS D DLAMINI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If we accept, and I understand you to accept, that 
the purpose of security vetting is to determine the security competence 
would you not agree that therefore security vetting where the person or 
20 
persons who are being vetted don’t have access to classified 
information doesn’t serve the purpose that is – that security vetting is 
supposed to achieve? 
MS D DLAMINI:   With all due respect Chair I don’t agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, why do you not agree? 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 152 of 190 
 
MS D DLAMINI:   On a note that as per the Section 2A if you are 
employed you have to be vetted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no you must listen to my question carefully. 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let’s go back and you must tell me if I 
misunderstood you.   
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Earlier on I thought you agreed with me that if you 
look at Section 2A the purpose of conducting a vetting investigation is 
to determine the security competence of a person.  I understood you 
10 
correctly, you agree with that part? 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes, fully, fully. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay.  Then Ms Hofmeyr took you to the 
definition of security competence, you remember? 
MS D DLAMINI:   Competence yes sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I think we are all agreed that what it – what the 
Act says it is, is that it refers to the ability of a person or access to 
classified information by a person and the ability to allow classified 
information to land on unauthorised hands, are we agreed or we are not 
agreed?   Let’s go to 8, what was the Section Ms Hofmeyr? 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Security Competence is at page 363. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let’s go to 363, I just want to, if you say you 
don’t agree I want to make sure I understand why you don’t agree, 
okay? 
MS D DLAMINI:   Yes. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 153 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Security competence means a person’s ability to act 
in such a manner that he or she does not cause classified information 
or material to fall into unauthorised hands, thereby harming or 
endangering the security of interest of the State.  Okay, it is the ability 
of a person to act in a manner that he or she does not cause classified 
information or material to fall into unauthorised hands.   
 
So that person, as I read this, must be somebody who has 
access to classified information or who can have access to classified 
information by virtue of the duties or responsibilities or work that he or 
she is doing, are we agreed on that or are we not? 
10 
MS DLAMINI:   We agree on that Chairperson but I want to push you 
further to say ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well let me first put this, so we agree on that. 
MS D DLAMINI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now as I understand the position, and you should 
know better, classified information is not information you are going to 
get all over, classified information is stored and kept somewhere, am I 
right?    
MS D DLAMINI:   Not all the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not all the time? 
20 
MS D DLAMINI:   Not all the time yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But when it is not where it is supposed to be is it not 
because somebody has done something, has allowed it to land in 
unauthorised hands? 
MS D DLAMINI:   It could be. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 154 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But most of the time would it not, in an organisation 
isn’t the position that only very few people would have access to 
classified information? 
MS D DLAMINI:   I think then the debate will go on to say Chairperson 
if you say it is information that must be stored somewhere, because 
that is the sense I am having ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am simply saying, and I don’t know, I am saying 
you might know better, I am under the impression that when information 
is classified, when a document is classified where it is kept is 
something quite important, you don’t want it lie around.  That is my 
10 
understanding, and only a few people in an organisation would have 
access to classified information. 
 
I may be wrong but that’s the picture that I have, because you 
don’t want, you want only a few people to know about that information, 
authorised people.  Isn’t it? 
MS D DLAMINI:   I think Chairperson it means one would have to have 
a discussion or deliberate to say is this classified, is this not, because 
that on its own if one would say this document is classified the 
question is what informs you to say it is classified? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I thought that to have a document classified 
20 
means somebody makes a decision ...[intervenes]  
MS D DLAMINI:   To make it classified. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That it is classified. 
MS D DLAMINI:   Yes. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 155 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   It doesn’t generally speaking become classified on 
its own.  Somebody needs to have – to know what it contains and 
should take a view that this is something that should be classified, so if 
that is correct I would imagine that in any organisation there must be 
very few people who have access to classified information, because 
that’s information you don’t want everyone to know. 
MS D DLAMINI:   But then Chairperson in order to ensure that one 
might argue to say we lock it away but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MS D DLAMINI:   Yes, but what happens is what happens if you are 
10 
working on classified information and somebody walks in. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja, but you are there, so you know this is classified 
and you don’t want the person to see it. 
MS D DLAMINI:   Yes but it will depend on the behaviour ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And you are not going to leave classified information 
unattended, if there are people who can come in. 
MS D DLAMINI:   But does it happen like that?  That’s another question 
to say do people do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I would think that those people who are 
responsible for classified information takes steps and measures to 
20 
make sure only people who have the relevant clearance or who are 
authorised can see the information on the documents, not anybody can 
see it, but are you saying you are not sure whether it is like that? 
MS D DLAMINI:   I am saying Chairperson if I were to state to you that 
it is not always the case. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 156 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But is it supposed to be the case? 
MS D DLAMINI:   Yes, yes, it is supposed to be the case. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you see that’s important because if that is how it 
is supposed to be but maybe there are breaches of security. 
MS D DLAMINI:   Mmm. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is now another issue because that might be 
because of other things, but if you accept that the information once 
classified is supposed to be kept somewhere and only a few people 
have access to it in an organisation that has got more than 1 000 
employees I wouldn’t see why you would need to vet 500 employees 
10 
who have no chance of having access to this information, do you 
understand what I mean. 
MS D DLAMINI:   Yes Chairperson but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But those who may be close because of their 
positions then I would understand. 
MS D DLAMINI:   Ja, but it is not always the case that the people that 
works with that classified information safeguard it and make sure that it 
is where it is supposed to be. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair.   Ms ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Ms Hofmeyr, I needed to take a break at 
three, I know I would have liked us to finish with Ms Dlamini before we 
– I take the break but I think I must take it because we are at quarter 
past. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Certainly.    
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 157 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let’s take a ten minutes break, I just have some 
urgent document that I must sign. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Of course. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We are going to take a ten minutes break.  We 
adjourn. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair just before we continue I have 
been asked to get some indication of the planning for the reminder of the 
afternoon, just because it does have an impact on arrangements that are 
being made for the second witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not think we can go beyond 17H00 but we can go 
beyond 16H00, maybe to 16H30 maybe up to 16H45, or even 17H00.  How 
is the situation for tomorrow looking? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Tomorrow we have a new scheduled witness to 
commence but I have been discussing the situation with Mr Mbikiwa who 
will be presenting the evidence of the second witness today, our sense is 
20 
that even if we do go to 16H30 or 17H00 we will not quite complete his 
evidence so we would need the second witness of today to continue 
tomorrow and there will be a bit of a knock on effect for tomorrows 
witness and possibly the witness on Friday but we may be able to work 
that in, yes. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 158 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, oh okay, okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So can I take it that we will likely sit beyond 
16H00 to a point.  Our great intention is for us to complete Miss Dlamini 
and at least start the second witness which will be helpful. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Miss Dlamini just in in conclusion on 
this point about security competence and what role it plays in vetting 
investigations, I would like to ask you the following question, If no one at 
SAA at any point had access to classified information do you accept that 
the security vetting that you conducted was then not designed to assess 
10 
their security competence? If you will just turn on your microphone.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ya. 
MS DLAMINI:   Can you repeat please? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   If the facts are that no-one at SAA had access to 
classified information, then the vetting exercise that you and your team 
conducted, could not have assessed their security competence? 
MS DLAMINI:   Advocate Hofmeyr if I may say that, as per our mandate 
we vet an applicant, we vet a person who is to enter the system.  Now, on 
your point, you saying, you stating that it means that person who is an 
applicant to be an official in a State Owned Entity, should not be vetted.  
20 
I think that is the sense I am getting to you unless they have classified 
[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no do not worry about this sense you are 
getting.  Do not worry about the sense you are getting, just answer the 
question.  Let me, I believe you have answered the question previously 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 159 of 190 
 
but I am going to put again and see whether you are deviating from that 
answer.  Okay.  The purpose of conducting a vetting investigation in 
terms of Section 2(A) is to determine the security competence of a 
person, you agree? 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Now, when you go to, or let me put it this way, if 
you conduct a vetting investigation, a security vetting process, which 
does not determine the security competence of that person, then you are 
not conducting a vetting process that can achieve the purposes stated in 
the Act, is that correct? 
10 
MS DLAMINI:   My response Chairperson, Advocate Hofmeyr, would be, I 
would be vetting a person that is an applicant according to Section 2(A) 
who has not had a access to classified information as yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DLAMINI:   You agree with me Chairperson? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I do not have to agree with you now, but you are 
answering a question that you want to answer, you are not answering the 
question that I am putting to you. 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us go again.   
20 
MS DLAMINI:   Let us go again. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The purpose of a vetting, security vetting exercise in 
terms of Section 2(A) is to determine the security competence of a 
person. 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 160 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, do you agree with me that if you conduct a 
vetting, security vetting process which cannot or is not going to determine 
the security competence of that person, then you are conducting a 
security vetting process that will not achieve the purpose stated in the 
law? 
MS DLAMINI:   My response Chairperson would be, conducting vetting on 
itself is to determine the security competence, so my answer is, you 
rather not conduct vetting at all because once you embark on conducting 
vetting you want to determine security competence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, well you are right.  If you are not going to 
10 
determine, if you are not using a vetting process for the purpose stated in 
the law, then you should not conduct it at all.  You agree?  
MS DLAMINI:   Exactly. I agree Chairperson, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Miss Hofmeyr do you want to take it from here? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No I am not touching that topic again, let me 
move on if I may.  Miss Dlamini I would like to put certain conclusions 
that I draw from the evidence today and I would like to give you an 
opportunity to comment on them.  I am going to look at both, what 
happened in the course of the vetting operation as well as its results 
afterwards.  
20 
MS DLAMINI:   Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Okay.  Miss Dlamini do you accept that the 
security vetting of SAA executives and support staff took place in a 
situation at which no point did anyone from SSA investigate whether the 
persons they were vetting in fact had access to classified information? 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 161 of 190 
 
MS DLAMINI:   I would not state that myself because I was not privy to 
what occurred or transpired between the two Ministers. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   As far as your conduct of the operation was 
concerned, you at no point established whether the people who were 
being vetted had access to classified information.  Correct? 
MS DLAMINI:   We never obtained their job description, their daily duties, 
yes, I never obtained that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you, and you had no basis to dispute the 
evidence of Miss Olitski which was to the effect that they were not told 
that they had an option to not take the polygraph test, do I have your 
10 
testimony correct? 
MS DLAMINI:   I said I am not in a position to respond to that particular 
case because I do not know what happened there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed. 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And Miss Dlamini as a result of the vetting that 
was conducted, seven executive managers resigned, is that correct? 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes, during the vetting? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, and as a consequence SAA lost those skills 
of those seven executive managers, correct? 
20 
MS DLAMINI:   Look, any executive would resign, particularly from SAA 
South African Airways. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MS DLAMINI:   They never forwarded their resignation letters to State 
Security, so I am not in a position to say what was stated on those 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 162 of 190 
 
letters, so one would have to have a look at those letters and see what 
was their reasons to resign. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Do you accept that if there were people in 
positions before the vetting operation and those peoples resigned during 
it, SAA lost the skills that those people brought to their positions. 
MS DLAMINI:   I would not say that Advocate Hofmeyr because I do not 
have the reasons why they resigned.  A person can resign today whether I 
am there or not, so yes it happened during the time that we were 
conducting vetting at an entity but them resigning, I never go to 
understand or see their resignation letters. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No, I fully understand that.  You do not, you were 
not privy to their reasons. 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I am asking a different question.  I am saying 
when people resign from State Owned Enterprises, do you accept that 
those State-Owned Enterprises lose the skills of those people? 
MS DLAMINI:   It depends in terms of the areas where they are employed, 
what skills do they possess?  Were they an asset to that particular 
organisation?  So it could be a number of things so I cannot really say.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   In the course of the vetting operation, personal 
20 
and private information of about a 118 employees of SAA were divulged to 
the Intelligence Services of South-Africa, do you accept that? 
MS DLAMINI:   During the course of the vetting assessment exercise as 
per [intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess the short answer is yes, can only be yes. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 163 of 190 
 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And whether or not a person passed or failed the 
vetting exercise, in fact had no impact at all on their jobs, did it? 
MS DLAMINI:   We never got to discuss what would be the way forward in 
terms of that? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So it did not? 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Miss Dlamini I would like to put it to you as a 
consequence of that answer that there was no legitimate purpose that 
was then served by the security vetting, because if it had been legitimate 
10 
and if it had sought to achieve the objective you identified, then any 
person who did not receive clearance ought not to have been permitted to 
remain in their jobs. 
MS DLAMINI:   Advocate Hofmeyr let me start by congratulating you for 
complying with the vetting process.  I think you are the evidence leader 
today because you have complied with the process and thank you very 
much for that. In terms if what you just said now [intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well you just need to answer the question Miss Dlamini 
we do not need any other thing. 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes, we were, I was always available and the organisation 
20 
is always open to engage with the leadership of SAA in terms of the work 
that has been done there, what needs to be done moving forward and at 
this stage we have never received any indication from their side to say 
this is the work that has been done there, can we meet and deliberate on 
that?  So I think it will be very much unethical to say an organisation that 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 164 of 190 
 
is mandated to execute those responsibilities and state security had 
invested a lot of resources on this particular project because we had to 
execute it according to our mandate, I think it will be really unfair to state 
that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And should projects achieve the purposes that 
they are designed to achieve? 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Do you accept that this project did not? 
MS DLAMINI:   I do not accept it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Let us talk about what did happen after the 
10 
vetting, because you said State Security would have been available to 
engage with management and the Board on further processes and I want 
to know whether you are aware of this, these facts and if not I will ask 
you certain follow up questions. 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   We heard in evidence in this Commission that 
Miss Myeni the former Chairperson of the Board of SAA wanted to use the 
fact that Miss Olitski could not get clearance because she had dual 
citizenship to remove her from the finance role she occupied because she 
was not doing what Miss Myeni wanted her to do. Were you aware of 
20 
those facts? 
MS DLAMINI:   I am not aware of those facts. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And if you are now aware of them would it cause 
you concern that the outcome of the vetting exercise was being used for 
an improper purpose? 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 165 of 190 
 
MS DLAMINI:   I think I am hearing it for the first time Advocate Hofmeyr 
and one would have to really think about that, ya. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Let us look at what happened to Miss Thuli 
Mshe, you see, Miss Mshe indicated that she was not willing to provide 
the required information to the State Security Agencies, and on the, 
Agency, and on the 19 t h January she received a suspension letter and one 
of the charges she faced was her refusal to provide the required 
information to SSA.  Would you be concerned that that was an improper 
use of the vetting exercise conducted at SAA? 
MS DLAMINI:   I am not aware of any of the instances that you outlining 
10 
today, so I am not in a position really to comment on that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Let me just give you the facts now.  Somebody 
who was in the Acting CEO position at SAA at a point in time, refused to 
provide the information required by the State Security Agency and the 
consequence of that is that one of the charges she faced when she was 
sought to be disciplined, was that she had not provided that information 
to the State Security Agency.  As you sit here today do you think that is 
an improper use of this vetting exercise? 
MS DLAMINI:   Advocate Hofmeyr look, now you are drawing me to the 
issues of SAA between the Chairperson of SAA and the other executives 
20 
which I think really is not fair to me because I am hearing what you are 
saying for the first time.  My job and my duties was to ensure that we 
execute the mandate of the organisation and I have done that to the best 
of my ability to represent state security.  What I can say, we were above 
board in terms of our processes, in terms of the work, in terms of the 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 166 of 190 
 
team that was deployed at SAA at that time.  We had highly skilled 
individuals on the project.  The polygraph examiners, we had three 
polygraph examiners. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no Miss Dlamini, Miss Hofmeyr has not asked 
you about any of those things.  It is a simple question and I thought you – 
you had previously given an answer maybe indirectly, you said earlier on, 
you will not advise an entity to dismiss people who failed security vetting, 
did I understand you correctly? 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and you said, you know, I think you said 
10 
something along the lines that you know there are labour laws. 
MS DLAMINI:   In terms of that yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which gave me the impression that you were saying as 
far as you are concerned somebody should not be dismissed because 
they have failed security vetting, is my understanding of your evidence 
correct? 
MS DLAMINI:   You are correct, but what I am trying to explain is to say 
[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ya, no, hang on. 
MS DLAMINI:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   What Miss Hofmeyr is now saying to you, is against 
that background, the background of that evidence that you gave, here is 
somebody who refused to take part or disclose information for vetting 
purposes and she was being charged with misconduct for – for that.  Do 
you regard the charging of somebody because they refuse to give 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 167 of 190 
 
information to the Security Agency for vetting purposes as acceptable or 
as improper?  That is what she is asking, and I think she is asking 
against the background that you had previously given advice that, you 
know, there are labour laws and you will not advice that somebody should 
be dismissed.  Are you able to say whether you would regard it as proper 
or improper, acceptable or unacceptable for somebody to be charged with 
misconduct for refusing to give information to State Security Agency for 
vetting purposes? 
MS DLAMINI:   Thank you very much Chairperson for clarifying that, I 
think I understand what you saying now.  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS DLAMINI:   I think, my apologies because I thought at first 
[intervenes]. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Not at all. 
MS DLAMINI:   I think it would be very improper to do that, ya. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you, and do you Miss Dlamini accept that 
the people who conducted this vetting operation at SAA, had not been 
properly informed about the requirements of the legislation, in so far as 
security competence is a requirement for the purpose of vetting to be 
achieved? 
20 
MS DLAMINI:   No I do not accept that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Chair, I just have one or two concluding aspects 
but really to address to you about a summary at the end of the evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ya, that is fine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   May I proceed to that and then Miss Dlamini I am 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 168 of 190 
 
sure will be happy to be excused. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Chair, we will make submissions in due course to 
this Commission that the type of security vetting that was conducted at 
SAA and contrary to the views, it appears of both former Ministers, and 
indeed possibly those who executed the vetting operation, that that type 
of security vetting may not lawfully be undertaken unless it is first 
established that those who are to be vetted have access to classified 
information in a manner in which they may be able to divulge it to 
unauthorized persons.  Chair we will also likely in our submissions 
10 
recommend that this clarification of the legal position find its way 
somewhere into any report prepared by this Commission because it has 
grave implications in all State Owned Enterprises if what is being 
conducted by the State Security Agency is vetting which does not comply 
in terms of the law.  Chair in closure I would just like to emphasize why in 
our submission the evidence today is in fact relevant to the mandate of 
the Commission, and we make two points in that regard.  Chair the 
Commission is tasked not only with establishing whether State Capture, 
Corruption and Fraud occurred within the Public Service Sector.  It is also 
required to explore how, if it did happen, it happened and what 
20 
recommendations to make in due course in order to prevent its 
recurrence.  Chair it will be our submission that using the Intelligence 
Services of this country to conduct unlawful vetting operations at State 
Owned Enterprises and where that vetting operation is then employed for 
ulterior purposes, may well be shown to be one of the ways in which State 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 169 of 190 
 
Capture, Corruption and Fraud is allowed to take place in entities such as 
SAA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ya, no I think that particularly the question of why was 
it used, will be very important. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because the, it has been said that certain institutions, 
state institutions, may have been used or were used to advance State 
Capture and to advance corruption.  So – so it becomes important, I mean 
the loss of seven executives, it will be important also to see whether it is 
connected with the vetting, the objection to the vetting, but also whether 
10 
the vetting process may have been used in order to push certain people 
out of SAA, so all of those things will need to be explored. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed Chair.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Miss Dlamini thank you very much for coming to give 
evidence we appreciate it.  If we need you we will ask you to come back 
again. 
MS DLAMINI:   I hope not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You hope not? Thank you very much Miss Dlamini and 
you are excused. 
MS DLAMINI:   Thank you very much Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
MS DLAMINI:   Thank you Advocate Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you Miss Dlamini.  If I may hand over to 
my learned friend Mr Mbikiwa.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 170 of 190 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Good afternoon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good afternoon.  Do feel free to rise and leave Miss 
Dlamini. 
MS DLAMINI:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  Yes Mr Mbikiwa.  At long last. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   At long last. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Chair can I begin by asking that the file 
containing Mr Y's [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well we are now going to deal, hear the evidence of 
10 
Mr Y. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  You would like that his affidavit and annexures 
that to be admitted and they be marked Exhibit DD(23)? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   That is correct Chair, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is so ordered. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Thank you Chair.  Can we just start with a 
sound check Chair?  Mr Y are you able to hear me? 
MR Y:   Yes I am. 
CHAIRPERSON:   For the record I just want to state, Mr Y has taken the 
20 
prescribed oath as he has been sworn in, do you confirm that Mr Y? 
MR Y:   I confirm that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Mr Y in front of you there should be a file 
marked DD(23), do you have that? 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 171 of 190 
 
MR Y:   I do have it. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Can I ask you to open that file and go to page 
1?  If you look at the red numbers in the top right-hand corner those are 
the page numbers that I will refer you to during the course of your 
evidence. 
MR Y:   Yes I am there. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Do you recognise that document? 
MR Y:   I do, it is a affidavit deposed to by myself. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   And that affidavit runs to page 22, sorry it 
runs to page 14. 
10 
MR Y:   Correct. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Can you confirm that the contents of the 
affidavit are true and correct? 
MR Y:   I do confirm. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Thank you.  Mr Y can you tell us where you 
are employed? 
MR Y:   I am employed at the State Security Agency. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   And I am, I am, I am cautious not to ask you 
questions that will require you to reveal your identity but you will testify 
today about a range of facts that relate to a Special Operations Unit. 
20 
MR Y:   That is correct. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Can you tell us how you know about that unit? 
MR Y:   Well within the State Security Agency the knowledge about the 
Special Operations Unit [intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:   One - one second. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 172 of 190 
 
MR Y:   Okay Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I know Mr Y that of all of us, that you would be the one 
person who would be very careful not to say anything that might indirectly 
reveal your identity. 
MR Y:   Correct Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But I do just want to mention that if you mention your 
responsibilities, your duties, it may well be, that that could reveal your 
identity, so as you give evidence just keep an eye on that. 
MR Y:   Thank you Chair I will. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright. 
10 
MR Y:   The knowledge about the specific unit I am speaking about, would 
be knowledge that the Board membership would be aware of. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR Y:   In a high-level review-panel report, mention is also made about 
the necessity of such a unit.  So that information would also be publicly 
available in the redacted version. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR Y:   And generally a unit like that would deal with strategic projects 
which are normally very sensitive and would involve the utilization of 
undercover members of the State Security Agency.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR Y:   That was the position until 2012 when the mandate of the 
structure was changed and it became more of an account intelligence, 
combination of VIP protection and support to the former President.  I do 
not know if I should go further and indicate who was appointed in charge 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 173 of 190 
 
at that stage? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Mbikiwa will ask you questions but you have just 
made a reference to the former President.  We have quite a few former 
Presidents in the country who are still alive, which one are you talking 
about? 
MR Y:  Former President Zuma. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Mr Mbikiwa. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you Mr Y.  Before we get there, I would 
just like to understand before this change of mandate that you have 
described, tell us about what Special Operations was prior to that 
10 
diversion.  And the kind of things that it did? 
MR Y:  Right, as I alluded to you the High-Level Review Panel Report a 
structure like that will deal with very sensitive operations in which the 
links between the State Security Agency or government would need to be 
hidden and plausible deniability be provided.  So classically you would 
look at counter terrorism operations or transnational organised crime.   
If I had to quantify the focus given within the intelligence community, we 
speak about between 80% to 90% of information being available through 
open source.  That would leave between 10% and 20% which would need 
convert means and of that 10% to 20% an even smaller portion would 
20 
relate to a structure like Special Operations.  Using undercover members 
as it is expensive depending where you are operating you have to make 
sure you comply with all the rules and regulations relating to business 
entities and so on.  That was the situation up until 2012. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second.  Thank you.  Yes. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 174 of 190 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Y, you have referred on a 
few occasions to the High-Level Report.  I just want to flag that that is 
something we are going to come to in due course. 
MR Y:  Alright. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  But can you tell us who the members of a unit 
like this would have been?  And I do not mean the identity of the 
members.  I just mean the level of specialisation and training that 
members of a unit like this would receive. 
MR Y:  Well, they would be full members of the State Security Agency 
however they’re identities would be protected.  So, they would not declare 
10 
to people- to the public that they are members of the State Security 
Agency.  However, they would share the same benefits in terms of salary, 
medical aid, pension benefits.   
Maybe I must just draw distinction between what we refer to as 
undercover members and the difference within a crime intelligence 
environment.  We refer to agents that are not members of the State 
Security Agency and are normally recruited to provide us with information.  
Whereas within the crime intelligence and Police undercover operations, 
a gent there refers to a member.  So, with regards to State Security 
Agency you would have full member being part of such a unit and in the 
20 
course of their work they would interact with agents who are not 
members. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  If we can pick it up at your 
affidavit at page 9.  That is in DD23. 
MR Y:  Okay. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 175 of 190 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And particularly from paragraph 3.4 you begin 
to talk about the diversion in the mandate of the Special Operations unit. 
MR Y:  Correct. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can you tell us how this- the unit’s mandate 
was changed? 
MR Y:  Well the immediate impact would have been that the undercover 
members who were part of that structure would have now been exposed to 
the protection detail of the former President Mr Zuma.  They would start 
doing parallel duties with structures like the Presidential Protection unit 
who are responsible for the protection of the President.  So already the 
10 
fact that they are now being exposed to other members of the security 
cluster means that they can no longer go function in an undercover 
capacity.   
The second approach would have been that they would no longer be 
working on medium to long-term operations.  But would be dealing with 
immediate tactical situations where they would deploy to work around the 
security of the President.  So, you looking at timeframes of between a 
month to three months versus investing in people that need to be in 
position for anything between three to 15 years for argument sake. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And how practically was this change in the 
20 
mandate of a Special Operations unit carried out? 
MR Y:  It happened with the appointment of Mr Thulani Dlomo as 
mentioned in paragraph 4.1 of my affidavit and all the members of the 
structure were informed that they were no longer going to be working on 
identified focus areas for instance transnational organised crime or 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 176 of 190 
 
counter terrorism.  But they would now be doing more risk assessment 
and security directly related to the President, Mr Zuma at the time. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And what position did Mr Dlomo hold? 
MR Y:  He was appointed the General Manager of the new Special 
Operations unit in 2012. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And who would he have reported to in that 
position? 
MR Y:  Part of the change was the shifting of the Special Ops unit from 
one Deputy Director General responsible for domestic operations to a 
Deputy Director General responsible for counter intelligence operations.   
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And can you give us a sense of the size of this 
unit? 
MR Y:  It would be difficult because part of the challenge we faced with at 
the moment is that obviously although the structure was not undercover, 
they still- their operations were on a need-to-know basis.  So, the 
knowledge I have has also been required through certain investigations.  
The structure ended up with approximately 30 members but altogether 
they would have deployed in excess of a 100.  So, you would have had 30 
members and then the rest would have been agents deployed to do the 
same work. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And how would these members and agents 
have been recruited? 
MR Y:  They were recruited directly by the Special Operations structure.  
Not the normal HR process that anyone else applying to State Security 
Agency.  They were identified and then the names were given through and 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 177 of 190 
 
indications were that, please appoint these members within the structure. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And were they formerly members of the State 
Security Agency? 
MR Y:  No, there was a handful of members- I would not like to give a 
specific number but it would be anything between five and 10 that were 
formerly members of the previous structure who were resurfaces and then 
were utilised to continue with their new activities.  And then the rest were 
new recruits that was sourced by Mr Dlomo himself. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And if you go to paragraph- sorry, to page 10 
of your affidavit you deal with some of the functions that this unit 
10 
performed.   
MR Y:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can you talk us through those functions? 
MR Y:  Alright.  You will see that in paragraph 4.4 I use the word parallel.  
I think it is a trend that you will see because the structure actually 
duplicated functions that were either part of other units within State 
Security Agency or other stakeholder departments that we would work 
together with.   
So, for instance you would have the TSCM which is Technical 
Surveillance Counter Measures which were brought together under the 
20 
command of Mr Dlomo although the function actually resorted under 
another SSA structure.  They were dedicated to doing this function 
directly for the President. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Mr Y, I am sorry to do this but can I interrupt 
you there.  Chair I am informed that there is a technical issue with the 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 178 of 190 
 
sound feed and to ask if we could adjourn for 5 minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let us adjourn then for 5 minutes.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  I take it the problem has been solved. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  It seems to have been solved.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Technical problem.   
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Mr Y, are you still there? 
10 
MR Y:  I am here Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Let us proceed. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Mr Y we left off with you explaining to us the 
functions that the Special Operations unit performed after the diversion 
of its mandate.  And you were telling us what parallel technical 
surveillance counter measures were, I believe. 
MR Y:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  If I could ask you to start at the beginning of 
where you were just in case it was not recorded? 
MR Y:  Alright.  So, the TSCM function which is the Technical 
20 
Surveillance Counter Measure function was duplicated.  So, what you 
would have is we have a structure responsible for that which would 
provide services to government departments to make sure that meeting 
venues are clean in terms of interceptions.  But you then had the 
capacity created within Special Operations that only serviced the 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 179 of 190 
 
President wherever he would travel.   
If you look further into the affidavit the unit took over functions related 
to other government departments.  One would be the South African 
Military Health Services who are responsible for toxicology.  The Police 
Service who are the only department with a mandate to do the physical 
protection but the special operation members were trained as VIP 
protectors.  If you look at the Defence Force and specifically the Air 
Force, Special Operations members were designated to guard the 
former President’s aeroplane.  So, all of these are functions that were 
either duplicated from within SSA or on behalf of other departments.   
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And the- what you described earlier as VIP 
protection services, are those services that the State Security Agency 
would ordinarily perform? 
MR Y:  No, the mandate for that lies with the South African Police 
Services.  However, maybe just a caveat we would utilise VIP 
protectors to protect people within the State Security Agency, visitors 
from foreign intelligence services.  We would also allocate them one of 
our protectors.  But that would be on an agreement basis with the 
South African Police Service.  No members of Parliament, Ministers, all 
of their protection falls under specific units within the Police Service. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  I would like to then turn to your 
evidence in respect of the provision of protection services to Ms Myeni.  
And we pick that up- sorry Chair, I see you reaching for the 
microphone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I- before we had the break, I thought I would ask 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 180 of 190 
 
Mr Y.  Mr Y, at some stage you were giving evidence about the numbers 
of the people in this unit.  And you were mentioning a much lower 
number than the number that I see at 4.3.  Is there any significance to 
the discrepancy? 
MR Y:  Chairperson ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  In 4.3 you say ... (intervenes) 
MR Y:  Yes 200. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you say you understand that it was about 200 
agents. 
MR Y:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think earlier you talked about 20 or something 
like that. 
MR Y:  The lower number the 20 to 30 would be full members of the 
SSA.  The 200 I am referring to here are not members of the State 
Security Agency. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, so it is two different categories. 
MR Y:  Yes.  In Police terms these would be classified as informers for 
lack of a better word. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, for the 200? 
MR Y:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Has he covered that part?  Or you plan to 
deal with it later 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair he did deal with the issue of 
recruitment and with the issue of the members from within SSA.  I 
asked him whether there were members within SSA. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 181 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  I am grateful to you for the clarification of 
the 200. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And the question of where they seem to have 
been recruited mainly from as well, he dealt with that? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  He did not give the place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  You indicate in your affidavit where the 
agents were recruited from Mr Y.  Could you explain that? 
MR Y:  Yes.  Most of the recruits were recruited from KwaZulu Natal. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR Y:  I cannot give you factual reason for that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR Y:  Other than to make certain assumptions and deductions given 
the support base of the people involved. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they were given- were they given any training? 
MR Y:  Yes, Chairperson they were actually provided training which is 
normally only reserved for members of the State Security Agency.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR Y:  So, they were provided training in foreign countries and those 
20 
countries would not know that these people are not full members of the 
State Security Agency.  And obviously there is sensitivity in terms of 
that aspect.  So, what you had was people who were not members of 
the Agency but however were highly trained as counter intelligence 
officers both in VIP protection, the gathering of intelligence and 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 182 of 190 
 
aspects like that.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Y, if we can then turn 
to page 11 of your affidavit. 
MR Y:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Where you deal with the provision of 
security protection services to Ms Myeni. 
MR Y:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can you tell us how it came about that this 
unit provided such services to Ms Myeni? 
10 
MR Y:  Well Chair, I must honest we have found no paperwork that 
would indicate either a request or an instruction from within the Agency.  
And the first indications that we got that this occurred was from the 
High-Level Review Panel Report where it mentions not only Ms Myeni 
but certain other political leaders.   
Obviously as we have been involved in the investigations, we are aware 
that these agents, the group of the 200, were allocated to specific 
people who could be seen as being supporters of the- of former 
President Zuma who may have been facing certain difficulties.  And 
would not be eligible for official protection from the SAPS. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  You have referred again to the 
High-Level Review Panel and I think it is appropriate now that we go to 
that.  If I can ask you to turn to page 168 of your bundle. 
MR Y:  Okay Chair, I am there. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  You are there quicker than I am.  You will 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 183 of 190 
 
see there that on the cover page it says High-Level Review Panel 
Report on the State Security Agency December 2018.  And if you look 
in the footer it says, Report of the High-Level Review Panel on the 
SSA. 
MR Y:  Correct. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And that document you will see runs to page 
273 in the bundle. 
MR Y:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  If you turn to page 173.  I just want to read 
these two paragraphs into the record Chair to give some context to 
10 
what this Panel was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  It says; 
The High-Level Review Panel into the State Security Agency SSA or 
Agency was established by President Cyril Ramaphosa in June 2018 
began its work in July 2018 and was given 6 months to submit its 
report.   
The key objective for the establishment of the Panel was to enable the 
reconstruction of a Professional National Intelligence Capability for 
South Africa that will respect and uphold the Constitution and the 
20 
relevant legislative prescripts. 
The Panel was chaired by Dr Sydney Mufamadi and included 9 other 
members with a wide range of senior level experience and expertise in 
law, security study, civil society, academia, the intelligence and 
security community and other arms of government. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 184 of 190 
 
The Panel was supported by a secretariat provided by the Agency. 
 
Mr Y, can I then ask you to turn to page 236 because that is 
the portion of this report that deals with Special Operations? 
MR Y:  Alright. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And you will see there at 9- paragraph 9.3.5 
the heading is Special Operations. 
MR Y:  Correct. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  It says; 
According to information provided to the Panel a SO unit (Special 
Operations Unit) was first setup in the then NIA in or around 1997.  
10 
Was subsequently shutdown date not known and reopened again in or 
around 2002 and apparently carried over into the SSA. 
 
Does that accord with your understanding of the origins of this 
Special Operations Unit? 
MR Y:  Yes correct.  This paragraph would refer to the, if I can say the 
legitimate mandate of the structure.  And it is true what is mentioned 
here. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed.  This is- in your evidence earlier 
what you described as the position prior to 2012. 
MR Y:  Correct. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  In the second paragraph it says; 
The notion of the Special Operations unit in Intelligence, Military and 
Police services is not at all unusual.  Normally it entails units who 
works under deeper cover of the service and who work on particularly 
sensitive operations against particularly serious targets or issues and 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 185 of 190 
 
usually at a National level.  Members of such units are supposed to be 
highly trained and particularly competent.   
In the case of NIA and SSA such a unit would be based at Head Office 
and work on National projects of particular seriousness that cannot be 
assigned to a provincial or other structure. 
MR Y:  Correct. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Again, is that part of what you have 
described as the legitimate mandate of a Special Operations Unit. 
MR Y:  Yes, correct Chair. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can I then ask you to read the third 
10 
paragraph? 
MR Y:  Right. 
The Panel probed relatively deeply and widely into the issue of SO.  
Towards the end of its liberations it received a briefing from the Office 
of the Inspector General of Intelligence on an investigation it is 
currently conducting into SO that it hopes to conclude by the end of the 
current financial year.   
The Panel will make recommendations regarding this below.  For the 
purposes of this chapter of our report we highlight key elements of what 
was presented to the Panel on SO particularly in relation to the naked 
20 
politicisation of intelligence in recent years. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  Are you able to shed any light 
on that investigation referred to by the Office of the Inspector General 
of Intelligence? 
MR Y:  I am Chair, it was based on certain complaints that came from 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215 
 
Page 186 of 190 
 
some of the agents that- their complaint was their salaries was 
stopped.  What they called salaries and they opened up complaints with 
the Office of the Inspector General.  In the course of interviewing those 
agents obviously the Inspector General’s office then became aware of 
the certain operations that were running that would have been unlawful.  
As far as I know the report has not been finalised yet and it is running 
parallel with an investigation that is taking place into the same issues 
but from within SSA itself. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And if you turn over the page to page 237.  
It says;  
10 
The Panel was able to identify the key player in the politicisation of SO 
and the SSA in general.  The member is currently serving government 
in a senior capacity.  According to reports he was deployed to SSA by 
the then President via the Minister at the time to head up the Special 
Operations Chief Directorate. 
 
Are you able to shed any light on who is being referred to 
there? 
MR Y:  That is Mr Thulani Dlomo. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Right.  Your- in terms of your evidence 
earlier was responsible for the diversion of the mandate of the unit. 
20 
MR Y:  Correct. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  I would like then to go to the paragraph 
starting with, it is clear. 
MR Y:  Right, yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  It is clear to the Panel that the SSA SO unit

Page 187 of 190 
 
especially under the watch of the member mentioned above was a law 
onto itself and directly served the political interest of the Executive.  It 
also 
undertook 
intelligence 
operations 
which 
were 
clearly 
unconstitutional and illegal.   
Information made available to the Panel indicated that these operations 
included inter alia the training of undercover agents in VIP protection 
and assigning some of these to provide protection to the then President 
as well as to others who were not entitled to such protection such as 
the former chairperson of the South African Airways Board. 
 
Does that accord with your understanding of the- what you 
10 
described as the diversion of the mandate of the Special Operations 
Unit? 
MR Y:  Correct.  I would just want to clarify the training of undercover 
agents.  The undercover there should not be seen as implying that 
these agents were members of the State Security Agency. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed.  Can I then ask you to turn over to 
page 238 and just the last paragraph above Executive involvement in 
operations? 
MR Y:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  It says there; 
20 
It is clear from the above information and other information available to 
the Panel that Special Operations had largely become a parallel 
intelligence structure serving a faction of the ruling party and in 
particular the personal political interest of the sitting President of the 
party and country. 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215

I will pause there.  Do you have any comment on that? 
MR Y:  I would agree with that. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  It then says; 
This is in direct breach of the Constitution, the white paper, the 
relevant legislation and plain good government intelligence functioning.   
 
I will not ask for your opinion as to whether it breaches the law 
but would you agree that it is in breach of plain good government 
intelligence functioning? 
MR Y:  Definitely. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  I then Mr Y would like to address with you 
10 
the question of the protection services that were provided to Ms Myeni.  
And for that purpose, I would like to go back to your affidavit and pick 
it up at page 12. 
MR Y:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Sorry, in fact page 11 at paragraph 5.2. 
MR Y:  Alright. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can you tell us if Ms Myeni wanted security 
protection?  What would have been the proper process to have 
followed? 
MR Y:  The normal process would have been we have a function within 
20 
the Agency called Security Advising.  You would have a security advisor 
allocated to a government department or state-owned entity and any 
request highlighting for instance that Ms Myeni thought her life was in 
danger could have been channelled via the advisor and the South 
African Police Services.   
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215

The SSAs mandate is in the area of counter intelligence so obviously 
one would have internally done an assessment to say for argument 
sake if there were certain criminal syndicates that were being targeted 
for neutralisation by the chairperson and they were unhappy with us.  
And we picked up information like that we would compile and 
assessment provide it to the South African Police Service who would 
combine it with their mandate to determine is the threat of such a 
nature that she would need to have VIP protection.   
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And as far as you are aware was any such 
process undertaken? 
10 
MR Y:  No, it was not. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair, I intend to move on to a slightly 
different topic and to deal with the affidavit of Mr Muntsami who was 
involved in security at South African Airways itself.  It might be an 
appropriate time to adjourn for the day and pick that up in the morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, that is fine.  Are there- is there any request 
that we start earlier or we should be fine, we are starting normal time? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair, I think we should be fine starting 
normal time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Normal time. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  I do not anticipate that Mr Y’s evidence will 
too much longer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No, that is fine.  This is the last week of the 
aviation weeks?  That looked very far at some stage. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We are waiting for it with great anticipation 
19 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 215

Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  We are going to adjourn for the day and 
tomorrow we will start normal time.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.
