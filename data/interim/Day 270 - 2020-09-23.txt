PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 23 SEPTEMBER 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Pretorius, good 
morning everybody. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we ready? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes we are Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us continue.  Mr Mokoena you 
are still under the oath you took yesterday okay.  Alright. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Mr Mokoena. 
MR MOKOENA:  Morning Advocate. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You have your statement before you 
that is FS2; Bundle FS12 and we were at page 349. 
MR MOKOENA:  Sorry.  I am sorry I have got it now. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  You will recall yesterday Mr 
Mokoena you gave evidence that at a stage and on the 
instructions of the National Minister the payments by way 
of advance payments to suppliers stopped. 
MR MOKOENA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Do you what the MEC Mr Zwane’s 
attitude was to that direction of the Minister; the National 
20 
Minister? 
MR MOKOENA:  Well in the meeting he was in agreement 
with that statement and I think he was saying that we are 
going to implement our undertaking that we were going 
stop. 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 4 of 130 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well would you look at paragraph 
29 please of your affidavit. 
MR MOKOENA:  But when we got home… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright sorry I interrupted.  Yes 
when you got home? 
MR MOKOENA:  But when we got home he came back to 
me and said no we are continuing we are not going to stop 
and that we will continue with our project up until the end 
of the financial year. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Because overnight the 
10 
legal team looked at the Open Waters Report. 
MR MOKOENA:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Do you know that Open Waters was 
an entity that was briefed to investigate by way of forensic 
audit the prepayments issue? 
MR MOKOENA:  I heard about that Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Their report says that payments did 
in fact continue by way of the cession payments.  Did you 
know anything about that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did or did not? 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR MOKOENA:  No I do not know about that because 
according to me and my recollection is that when we said 
we are coming home to stop we stopped that month end of 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 5 of 130 
 
February because the meeting with the Minister was in 
February.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright we will look at – I will look 
at the detail of that and see what evidence there is in that 
report and we will put it before the Chair.  But you say you 
know nothing about that. 
MR MOKOENA:  I know nothing about that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If you would go please to paragraph 
34. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before that how long after that meeting 
involving the National Minister was it when Mr Zwane came 
back to you and said the advance payments should 
continue? 
MR MOKOENA:  It was about fourteen days after. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
MR MOKOENA:  About fourteen days after. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About two weeks after. 
MR MOKOENA:  About two weeks after we came from the 
meeting with the Minister. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOKOENA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did – did he explain to you why he was 
changing his mind now about this issue? 
MR 
MOKOENA:  I asked 
him that as 
we took an 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 6 of 130 
 
undertaking why now are you changing.  He said that we 
still need to ensure that we spend within that time up until 
the end of the financial year.  Okay well we can spend let 
us spend.  So he was focussing more on spending and not 
on the commitment that we have made to the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  
MR MOKOENA:  Therefore, I thought that that was 
incorrect to undermine what you have agreed on and then 
you come back without even informing the parties that you 
are with that you are changing your stand now. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOKOENA:  Because changing a stand for me would 
not have been in good principle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  But that same issue that he was 
raising that there was a need to spend money that was 
something that he – he knew and I am – I am almost sure 
he had initially expressed at the meeting with the National 
Minister.  Namely that he thought there was a need to – or 
for the – for the payments to continue.  He had raised that 
issue with the National Minister at the meeting but 
20 
ultimately the National Minister wanted to hear nothing of 
it. 
MR MOKOENA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And your meeting with him when he – he 
said that the payments should continue how did it end? 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 7 of 130 
 
MR MOKOENA:  It ended on a sour note because… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOKOENA:  I told him that I will not sign anything 
beyond that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOKOENA:  Which must advance money to material 
suppliers anymore after the end of February 2011. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Did he indicate what he was going 
to do next now that you were not prepared to sign further 
payments? 
10 
MR MOKOENA:  Not that I can recall Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  At that stage were you no longer 
scared that he would say you must submit your resignation 
letter? 
MR MOKOENA:  At that stage he was not talking about the 
resignation letter anymore. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was not talking about it? 
MR MOKOENA:  Yes since after the meeting with the 
National Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MOKOENA:  He never spoke about that resignation 
letter anymore. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But he was unhappy that you were 
not prepared to authorise further payments? 
MR MOKOENA:  Correct Chair. 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 8 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  In paragraph 29 
if we could just go back you put on record some of your 
suspicions but as with former evidence that you gave 
yesterday I understand you have no facts really to back up 
your suspicions in paragraph 29? 
MR MOKOENA:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright let us go to paragraph 34.  
When you left as Head of Department you were replaced it 
is common cause by Mr Mokhesi. 
10 
MR MOKOENA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And were you involved then in the 
preparation for the disciplinary hearings that we have been 
told about? 
MR MOKOENA:  No I was not Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Did you testify at those disciplinary 
hearings? 
MR MOKOENA:  Yes I did. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Do you know why certain 
people were selected for discipline and other were not?  
20 
First of all who did the selection? 
MR MOKOENA:  I cannot answer confidently because I was 
not working at the department at that stage therefore, I do 
not know who is the person who selected the persons that 
were proposed to go to the hearing or disciplinary hearing. 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 9 of 130 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But who was ultimately disciplined 
and dismissed? 
MR MOKOENA:  I think there were six former colleagues.  
It was Me Manike Mogele and Dada Kaizer Maxatshwa and 
Dada Kabelo Koloi, Dada Loyiso Ndenze, Dada Twale and 
MinaguNgufa Magaute who is now deceased. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  At the time of the disciplinary 
hearings where were you employed? 
MR MOKOENA:  At that time I was employed at Mangaung 
Metropolitan Municipality as the Head of Department for 
10 
Human Settlements. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Do you know a person 
Rochelle Ells? 
MR MOKOENA:  Yes I do Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Did she construct houses? 
MR MOKOENA:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And did she get contracts from the 
Department Free State? 
MR MOKOENA:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Did the MEC Mr Zwane ever tell you 
20 
anything 
about 
that 
particular 
contractor 
and 
her 
relationship with the Premier? 
MR MOKOENA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What did he tell you? 
MR MOKOENA:  He told me that we must ensure that this 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 10 of 130 
 
contractor gets contract to build houses in Kroonstad 
because that is an instruction from the Premier.  And when 
the projects had started running when time comes for the 
claims to be submitted he would come and tell me that we 
must expedite the claims because the Premier wants to be 
– that claims to be expedited. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So would that be Mr Zwane coming to 
you when claims had been logged, he would come and say 
you must expedite Ms Rochelle Ells’ claims because the 
Premier has said they should be expedited? 
10 
MR MOKOENA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  A narrative Mr Mokoena that you 
have put before the Chair yesterday and today involves a 
member of the Provincial Cabinet.  Involved the National 
Treasury and the National Minister and you have spoken 
about several meetings at which senior officials were in 
attendance.  You would have to say yes a bit louder. 
MR MOKOENA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It is difficult to conceive then that 
20 
all this happened within a bubble and no-one else within 
the 
Province 
knew 
what 
was 
happening. 
 
Do 
you 
understand the point I am making? 
MR MOKOENA:  No Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  No.  The members of the Provincial 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 11 of 130 
 
Cabinet. 
MR MOKOENA:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It is probable just on the face of it 
and I would like to explore this with you that other people 
in the Cabinet would have known as well. 
MR MOKOENA:  That is correct.  Now I understand. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  What do you know about 
that? 
MR MOKOENA:  I think in the meeting of the EXCO it was 
raised by the National Treasury in one meeting that these 
10 
materials – advance material scheme is not correct and 
that is money already that has been deposited from our 
account into the accounts of the material suppliers and 
that was in a meeting of the EXCO when it was raised. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  EXCO what body is that? 
MR MOKOENA:  EXCO is the Executive Cabinet Meeting of 
the MEC’s with the Premier. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  So as far as you were aware 
the EXCO at least would have known about the issues to 
which you have testified.  At least at a general level. 
20 
MR MOKOENA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And they would have known about 
the financial implications that were raised by National 
Treasury? 
MR MOKOENA:  Correct Chair. 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 12 of 130 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And that matter was discussed? 
MR MOKOENA:  That matter was discussed. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Were you at that meeting? 
MR MOKOENA:  I was at that meeting. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What was the Premier ’s attitude to 
what was happening? 
MR MOKOENA:  She did not come up with what – what can 
I say – a conclusive detailed decision about what to do 
about it – about that item as it was discussed.  And I think 
the person came especially for that from the National 
10 
Department of Treasury to come and inform the EXCO in 
that meeting on the day. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Who was on the EXCO can 
you just give us as much as you can remember? 
MR MOKOENA:  I think all members of EXCO and they are 
all MEC’s.  All Heads of Departments I think were there.  
CFO’s as well yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And was the Premier? 
MR MOKOENA:  And the Premier who was there was 
chairing the meeting. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes who was the Premier? 
MR MOKOENA:  The Premier was Mr Magashule. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Now there would obviously be 
minutes of EXCO meetings? 
MR MOKOENA:  That is correct. 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 13 of 130 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Would this matter have been 
reported on Cabinet at Cabinet level – Provincial Cabinet 
level? 
MR MOKOENA:  This matter should have been reported 
there I agree. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  And there would be 
minutes of those meetings? 
MR MOKOENA:  There would also be minutes of those 
meetings as well. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Would you in your capacity as HOD 
10 
have submitted reports to the MEC, to EXCO or to the 
Provincial Cabinet? 
MR MOKOENA:  Yes if there were items that we wanted to 
be discussed and agreed upon we would write our own 
memo, submit to the EXCO as a report or as a memo and 
then it would be discussed at that level and be approved or 
disapproved at that level. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Did you write reports at this time? 
MR MOKOENA:  On this matter no. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  No? 
20 
MR MOKOENA:  No. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Any reason for that important 
matter? 
MR MOKOENA:  Important matter yes but it was – as it 
was raised by the National Department in the meeting it 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 14 of 130 
 
ended up there.  They did not focus [00:15:34]. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You say there was no need for you 
to do so? 
MR MOKOENA:  I think it did not come to my mind that I 
should write a report about it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well when this matter came up 
before the EXCO that you have now described at that 
meeting that you have now described was there no 
instruction that came from EXCO sort this matter out as a 
matter of urgency? 
10 
MR MOKOENA:  I cannot recollect any decision taken 
which was tasking me to make a report on that matter. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Anyway, I understand that all 
reports made to EXCO, the Cabinet, the Premier minutes of 
all relevant meetings will be a matter of record and those 
records should be at the offices of the Province in 
Bloemfontein? 
MR MOKOENA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Are there any other documents that 
you can think of that would record the events of 2010/2011 
20 
in relation to the evidence you have given? 
MR MOKOENA:  I think the most confidential document for 
me that I think could help us with information is the report 
from the BAS B-A-S the system that captures and records 
all the transactions of all the material that we have 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 15 of 130 
 
supplied.  How much did we pay out?  To which contractor?  
When?  And the – it must also show the – the bank account 
of where the money went.  So that is why I was proposing 
that if we could get from the National Treasury the record 
of December 2010 and December 2011 surely from there, 
we can pick up all the contractors and all the material 
suppliers that we have supplied. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And this information is BAS; B-A-S? 
MR MOKOENA:  This information comes out of the BAS 
system. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And that is the financial system 
where all payments are recorded? 
MR MOKOENA:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Including of Provinces? 
MR MOKOENA:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And it resides with National 
Treasury you say? 
MR MOKOENA:  And it resides with National Treasury 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 After 
Mr 
Zwane 
had 
proposed 
his 
20 
“solution” in quotes for the problem that the Department 
was facing in relation to this matter namely failing to spend 
the money that it had been allocated for low cost housing 
do you know whether there was a report that he – a written 
report that he may have submitted to the Executive Council 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 16 of 130 
 
the Provincial Cabinet or to the Premier which would have 
set out what the solution is and what was going to be 
done?  Whether it is a report or a memo do you know 
whether there was such a document? 
MR MOKOENA:  Chair in as far as I can recall no 
document was written in that direction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You cannot remember. 
MR MOKOENA:  To the Cabinet.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MOKOENA:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We have heard of the quote 
“solution” unquote that was proposed and implemented in 
order to ensure that money was spent before the year end 
and the budgetary allocation was not lost and principally, 
we have heard about the prepayments made to suppliers. 
MR MOKOENA:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And we have also heard about 
money paid to suppliers for onward transmission to the 
contractors, do you know about that?  The so called 
20 
bridging finance payments. 
MR MOKOENA:  No – I am not aware of that one.  Bridging 
finance. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well there is evidence and it has 
been confirmed that some of the money paid to suppliers 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 17 of 130 
 
was transmitted onwards sometimes in cash to contractors.  
Do you know anything about that? 
MR MOKOENA:  No I do not know anything of that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You sure? 
MR MOKOENA:  Because for me the money that was sent 
to – into the accounts of the material suppliers was just for 
materials and could not be bridging finance. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  No of course it could not but 
notwithstanding that money was nevertheless paid. 
MR MOKOENA:  Then it was out of my control then it was 
10 
not brought to my attention. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright but that is – those findings 
are on record and they have been confirmed.  Do you know 
anything – do you understand what a right of retention is? 
MR MOKOENA:  No I do not understand. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright so in the contract that is 
entered into between the Department and the contractor, 
the builder the Department negotiates for and contracts for 
a right of retention.  In other words, it withholds money 
that ought to be paid to the contractor as a type of 
20 
insurance policy so that if there are any defects the work is 
not complete or the work is not properly done there is 
money that can be drawn on to meet the financial deficit 
that arises.  Do you know anything about that? 
MR MOKOENA:  That is the retention. 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 18 of 130 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right of retention yes. 
MR MOKOENA:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You know that? 
MR MOKOENA:  Yes I know that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That type of clause in a building 
contract? 
MR MOKOENA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What happened and this was found 
to be the case in the disciplinary inquiry is that these 
rights of retention were abandoned and the retention 
10 
money was paid over to the contractors thus ensuring even 
more money was paid out even more quickly.  Do you know 
anything about that? 
MR MOKOENA:  No I do not know about that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So that would have happened 
without your knowledge? 
MR MOKOENA:  If the retention is paid before the product 
is completed. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR MOKOENA:  Then that would have been incorrect.  I 
20 
would not have agreed to that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Or even paid before the time came 
for payment before defects in the building would appear 
and before the time for payment of the retention money 
over had occurred.  In other words, a premature payment 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 19 of 130 
 
to ensure that money was spent. 
MR MOKOENA:  No.  I think in the recovery plan we did 
not have something like that to say that now because we 
are literally pushing to spend we now have to spend it in 
the money that is supposed to be retained for the project.  
I think that could not have been agreed upon. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well it could not – it might not have 
been agreed upon but there is evidence in the disciplinary 
inquiry that it actually happened. 
MR MOKOENA:  That it happened.  I have no knowledge of 
10 
that Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You have given evidence about the 
MEC’s involvement in the selection of contractors.  Did the 
same principle apply to the selection of suppliers? 
MR MOKOENA:  No not on suppliers it was only on 
contractors Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Do you know of the War Room 
meetings? 
MR MOKOENA:  Yes I know. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Did you attend the War Room 
20 
meeting 
MR MOKOENA:  I did attend some of them. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What were these meetings? 
MR MOKOENA:  These meetings were like project office 
where we gather information about our projects.  What – at 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 20 of 130 
 
what stage are we with different projects and from there we 
would record that and then we follow up where we think 
that there are problems that need us to unlock then we go 
there and unlock.  Say for instance there is a problem at a 
Municipality level which blocks this project from moving 
then we will task one person to go to that Municipality and 
talk to them so that that problem can be solved. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Did these War Room meetings 
monitor 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
early 
payment 
or 
advance payment scheme? 
10 
MR MOKOENA:  No it is before that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry? 
MR MOKOENA:  The War Room came before that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes but at a stage the War Room 
meetings also monitored the – the early payment scheme. 
MR MOKOENA:  Correct at a later stage. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  At a later stage.  If you would bear 
with me Chair I would just like to get a reference to put to 
– you have given evidence about Mr Tsoametsi. 
MR MOKOENA:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  He certainly on the evidence that 
we 
have 
heard 
played 
a 
role 
in 
the 
devising 
and 
implementation of the scheme – the early payment scheme 
– the advance payment scheme. 
MR MOKOENA:  That is correct Chair. 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 21 of 130 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Do you know why he was not 
disciplined? 
MR MOKOENA:  No I do not know why because I was now 
working at the Municipality in Mangaung I was not in the 
Department any longer. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Did you ever report to anybody 
other than Mr Zwane about your dissatisfaction and 
opposition to the advance payment scheme? 
MR MOKOENA:  Chair no. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You did not think it apposite to 
10 
report to the Premier in that regard? 
MR MOKOENA:  I was still coming there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.   
MR MOKOENA:  No I did not talk to anyone else because I 
thought – what came to my mind was that I should talk to 
someone who was going to advise me and then I thought 
that looking at the situation the Premier will be a better 
person because the Premier is also a boss to my MEC.  
Then that is the person I tried to get hold of same day 
when we came from the meeting in the office of the MEC.  
20 
After 
that 
meeting 
when 
I 
realised 
that 
we 
are 
at 
loggerheads with MEC then I went down to the office of the 
Premier just to check when it was possible for me to meet 
him.  And it was unfortunately not possible.  And then after 
I was there I went again stood in the queue there waiting 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 22 of 130 
 
for him up until nine in the evening the queue was still long 
then he said – they said we must come the following day.  
So it continued days after days – a week – second week 
and then I stopped following it – pursuing it.  Because I 
thought that was the relevant person to help me out of this. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Chair I am just dealing with notes 
given to me by the legal team if you would bear with me? 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine.  So Mr Mokoena the housing 
units that were meant to be built in 2010/2011 financial 
year is the position that to date they have not been built or 
10 
have they since been built after you had left? 
MR MOKOENA:  I am not sure Chair because what we tried 
to do was to agree with National to come and help us so 
that we could turn as much as possible from the amount of 
money and the materials into units.  And when I left 
National was still there.  Was still working very close with 
our colleagues especially in the War Room.  So my 
understanding is that by the time I left most of those – 
some of those units should have – could have been built 
but not most.

ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If you would look please at para 59 
on page 113 of Bundle FS14.  That is a different bundle. 
MR MOKOENA:  Not this one? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Ja not that one.  Bundle FS14 
behind you.

MR MOKOENA:   Number? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Page 113.  If you can look at 
paragraph 59, please. 
MR MOKOENA:   59? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
MR MOKOENA:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Just take a minute to read it, please. 
MR MOKOENA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In essence, what is said in the 
affidavit of Mr Mokhesi in the review application is that: 
10 
“Mr Maxatshwa returned to Bloemfontein having 
attended a meeting.  Advised the then head of the 
department 
(that 
is 
yourself), 
but 
that 
the 
department (your department) had been warned not 
to 
implement 
the 
expenditure 
recovery 
plan.  
However, Mr Mokoena instructed Mr Maxatshwa to 
proceed with the plan.” 
 
And that was found in the disciplinary hearing.  What do 
you say about that? 
MR MOKOENA:   I think, that is not correct.  Why I say it is 
20 
incorrect is because when Mr Maxatshwa went to that 
meeting, he went on our behalf.  He knew already that the 
MEC had already said you are not to move away or you not 
refrain from implementing this project.   
 
So here, my understanding is that, it looks like I am the 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 24 of 130 
 
one who is pushing for these projects to continue.  It is not 
the MEC.  So I disagree with it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  He does explain over the 
page on page 114 that the instruction that he is referring to 
is the memorandum prepared by Mr Tsoametsi and signed by 
him and yourself on the 25t h of November.  You have given 
evidence about the circumstances of that memorandum. 
MR MOKOENA:   Thank you, Chair.  I think, this narrative is 
a narrative I had always when I was witnessing at the 
hearing, the disciplinary hearing.  It is an incorrect narrative.  
10 
It takes the logic and puts it on his head.   
 
We know that the origin of the scheme that we had a 
meeting in the MEC’s office.  The instruction to Mr Tsoametsi 
to prepare a document came from that meeting.   
 
Now for me today to come and say a different version 
here that I am the one who instructed Mr Tsoametsi to write 
this 
internal 
document, 
linked 
the 
instruction 
to 
Mr 
Maxatshwa.   
 
I think here the logic is not linking.  That is why I am 
saying that the logic is standing on its head here.  Thank 
20 
you, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   When the employers who were 
ultimately dismissed, were first suspended, were you still in 
the office? 
MR MOKOENA:   No, Chair.  I was out of office at that stage. 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 25 of 130 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Just bear with me a moment. 
MR MOKOENA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The findings, and you can look at 
FS19 if you want to check.  I am going to read it to you 
anyway.  At page 757 for the record.  The findings of the 
disciplinary inquiry deal with the retention clause, none-
enforcement or abandonment.   
 
And in paragraph 396 of the disciplinary findings, it 
reads... Refer to a paragraph of the ERP which we are 
looking for but it is not at hand at the moment.  It is recorded 
10 
that: 
“It was decided that the retention clause be retained 
in the contract but not be enforced these projects to 
ensure 
expenditure 
and 
cash 
flow 
for 
the 
contractor”. 
 
So in order to ensure that the contractor receive money 
but also to ensure that the department spend as much money 
as possible, that retention clause was abandoned.  I just 
wanted to put that before you.  You still do not have any 
knowledge of that? 
20 
MR MOKOENA:   I still do not have any knowledge of it 
Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do you have anything to add to your 
evidence that I perhaps have not asked you and you wish to 
place before the Chair? 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 26 of 130 
 
MR MOKOENA:   From my affidavit, I think we have covered 
all the areas of importance that I requested that they be 
covered as part of my evidence. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   What would you say if somebody comes 
before the Commission Mr Mokoena and say you have down-
played your role in this matter and that you were a much  
more active role player than you seem to want everybody to 
believe?  What would your response be to that? 
MR MOKOENA:   Thank you, Chair.  I think the first thing 
10 
would be.  The second point of...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And I am talking especially with special 
reference to ...[intervenes]  
MR MOKOENA:   My singing of the two documents? 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...Mr Zwane’s “solution” and that you were 
much more active, at least, maybe from a certain stage 
onwards than you may be making it out to be. 
MR MOKOENA:   Chair, I think the starting point for me 
would be that I disagree with that version. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
20 
MR MOKOENA:   And that the origin of this scheme came 
with the MEC as advised. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MOKOENA:   So if it was not him being advised as 
whereby the person and the source that he never wanted to 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 27 of 130 
 
disclose to me, then I would have said that I was actively 
involved. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MOKOENA:   Because I am the person who were 
supposed to work very close with him and advise him about 
Human Settlement issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MOKOENA:   Because I have been in the business for 
more years than he was. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
10 
MR MOKOENA:   That is my starting point.  My second point 
is that, when it was already been detected that we are doing 
wrong about this scheme, still when you come back from 
there, he wants us to continue.  Then if I am with him, I 
would have said no in February to stop the scheme or the 
implementation for the scheme.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR MOKOENA:   And then three.  The research that was 
done, it is because I am the one who said that this scheme is 
bordering on illegally.  Therefore, we cannot implement it.  
20 
So that is why he instructed Mr Tsoametsi.   
 
So it is not me who instructed Mr Tsoametsi.  So on 
those three key points, I am still saying that my evidence is 
that it looks like here I was corralled into a corner with a 
plan that was well-orchestrated beforehand.   
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 28 of 130 
 
 
And for me getting to that meeting, it was me getting 
into a trap and I think I was on top of the trap.  Realising in 
the meeting that everyone else was not speaking.   
 
So that quietness was quite uncomfortable for me, 
especially coming from the CFO who should be supporting 
me in the meeting because I am arguing in terms of the 
procurement procedures.   
 
She should have come in and said, I am right.  Can you 
not see this is not possible?  This is wrong.  This cannot 
happen. But she was quiet, sitting there.  And all the other 
10 
colleagues were quiet.   
 
So on that note, I would therefore say, if it was... if I had 
power, I would have said that maybe I am not the only 
person who finds himself in these circumstances.   
 
I would recommend that there must be some kind of a... 
I do not know how to put it now.  Administrative truth(?) for 
an avenue which was available to each and every official, 
each and every manager when you are in the circumstance 
where I was forced to do things that you feel like this is 
illegal.   
20 
 
Then you can touch a button or you can submit your, 
what I would call, an intervention request.  If you could have 
something like that, I think we can save South Africa a lot of 
money because I think in practise it is also the same 
problem.  In other department of the province I think the 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 29 of 130 
 
same problem.  So that could help.   
 
I am just trying to think out loud now that if we could 
have a platform or a structure that is in the presidency 
because I think that is the highest office.   
 
And that in that structure, we must serve people who is 
competent in terms of procurement, in terms of legal, in 
terms of communication, and in terms of investigations.   
 
So that if you submit your intervention request, they can 
respond quickly and then bring the two parties to validate 
whether it is true or not.  And then they can take action at 
10 
that time.   
 
But this structure must not just look at serving this 
problem that I am putting here.  I think it must have at least 
three focus areas.   
 
One, it must be stop from the source, the instructions 
and the writing of documents.  Two, it must also look at how 
to professionalise the whistle-blowing programme.   
 
Because there is a whistle-blowing programme there but 
it is stuck in delays in the terms of bureaucracy.  And then 
three, 
also 
to 
ensure 
that 
we 
bring 
that 
close 
and 
20 
professionalise the last audit initiative.   
 
If they can bring those three things together, that will 
help us a lot.  And the wasteful expenditure that we are 
having, it can be stopped by it because you are strangulating 
the 
fruitless 
activity 
right 
from 
the 
start 
where 
the 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 30 of 130 
 
instructions come.   
 
Because the source is the instruction.  Someone 
instructs the other person to do... to give some examples.  
He or she is not signing a petition.   
 
I am not party to the procurement processes but already 
upstream, you have already conditioned this project how to 
role(?).  So I think that the problem is also the manager of 
the...  So that is what I propose Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You mentioned in your evidence, at least 
three contractors, I think you said that Mr Zwane seemed to 
10 
be interested in.  Those were the ones, I think you said, he 
would approach you and ask you to expedite their payments.  
Is that right? 
MR MOKOENA:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  As after you had left, do you know if 
those contractors still exist or is that something that you do 
not know? 
MR MOKOENA:   No, I am not sure about that Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are not sure.  Okay. 
MR MOKOENA:   Because by the time that I left the office, I 
20 
did not even take anything in my office.  I left all the files 
and everything. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOKOENA:   Because I knew that all those the files are 
the property of the department. 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 31 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR MOKOENA:   And I was going just across the street. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOKOENA:   To throw away. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOKOENA:   They will not have me on anything.  I would 
have come back and talk to them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now, Mr Pretorius mentioned that 
there are indications that payments may have continued after 
your meeting with the MEC and the National Minister.  You 
10 
said you do not know that because you said that you have 
taken the position there should be no further payments.  Do 
you remember that? 
MR MOKOENA:   Correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is there a possibility that payments may 
have 
happened 
without 
your 
knowledge, 
without 
your 
authorisation?  Is there such a practical possibility that 
maybe somebody else, other people within the department 
may have continued to authorise payments without your 
knowledge? 
20 
MR MOKOENA:   It is possible Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is possible? 
MR MOKOENA:   Possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The payment processed did not... did not 
always have to come to your attention? 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 32 of 130 
 
MR MOKOENA:   That is true. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  But would you not have told 
everybody concerned after your meeting with the National 
Minister and the MEC that there should be no further 
advance payments anymore? 
MR MOKOENA:   We had a meeting that is announced that 
as we come back from the minister, the feedback is that we 
must stop this project. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOKOENA:   We must not do this again, nor other new 
10 
transactions must go to suppliers.  No new contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOKOENA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So if anybody authorised them after that, 
then they would have done so knowing that you had issued 
an instruction to say there should be no further payments? 
MR MOKOENA:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now, are you able to say that the MEC, Mr 
Zwane, definitely knew that his scheme was illegal or was 
requiring the department to do something illegal?  Or is the 
20 
position that you believe that in his view that it was legal?  
Or are you able to say he may have say it was illegal but he 
knew it was illegal?  What is your position? 
MR MOKOENA:   My position is that he knew it was illegal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 33 of 130 
 
MR MOKOENA:   Because the first time when he mentioned 
it, I responded and I told him that it was illegal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOKOENA:   So he tried ways to ensure that he 
convinces me about the legality of the scheme. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, yes. 
MR MOKOENA:   So for me, then it shows that he knew.  And 
the mere fact that he did not want to inform us about who is 
the person who advised him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
10 
MR MOKOENA:   Then there is something that he is hiding 
from us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOKOENA:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did he... what were the reasons that you 
told him as to why his scheme was illegal?  What did you say 
to him in terms of A, B, C, D?  It is illegal because of this 
and this and that.  Just repeat that to me. 
MR MOKOENA:   I told him that it was illegal because it was 
illegal because one, the services is in government.  Yes, you 
20 
get the service first as the government before you pay.  So 
this scheme is the very opposite to that.  So this is illegal.   
 
And also, number two is that, we do not have the 
capacity within the department.  We are still a young 
department.  We cannot be able to run all those things 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 34 of 130 
 
including what we were doing in the office at that stage.   
 
And then I think, also finally I said, in terms of the 
supply management from the procurement point of view, it 
was incorrect.  It will come with this of a scheme.  It will not 
help us at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did he counter your reasons for saying his 
scheme was illegal with anything?  In other words, did he 
engage your reasons to say but your reasons for saying the 
scheme is illegal are not sound because of A, B, C, D? 
MR MOKOENA:   He did not engage my contact. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MOKOENA:   What he engaged was the form, the outside 
part.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MOKOENA:   He said that this advice... he has been 
advised, 
he 
was 
advised 
by 
the 
person 
who 
is 
knowledgeable.  He is an expert now.  So I wanted to know, 
who is this expert?   
CHAIRPERSON:   But he never disclosed? 
MR MOKOENA:   And he never disclosed. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOKOENA:   And the second thing that he looked at 
then was, because he realised, I was not moving, I was 
adamant.  Then he said, let us be... because we know that 
this is happening in other provinces.   
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 35 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  If he comes here and says:  I never 
said... I would never have said a scheme should be carried 
out that I knew to be illegal.  I was the MEC.  I had taken an 
oath to uphold the constitution and the law.  What Mr 
Mokoena is saying is not true.  I do genuinely believe that 
this scheme was legal.  What would you say? 
MR MOKOENA:   Chair, I would say that what made him to 
ask Mr Tsoametsi to go and do a research? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m.  And you say the document that 
...[intervenes]  
10 
MR MOKOENA:   The document did not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...was not... did not talk to legality. 
MR MOKOENA:   The legalities, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MR MOKOENA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair, arising out of these questions, 
may I just put one or two more? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The evidence of Mr Mokhesi says 
20 
that 
he 
had 
difficulty 
in 
understanding 
or 
obtaining 
information in regard to what had happened prior to him 
taking office in 2010/2011.  Did he ever ask for your 
cooperation? 
MR MOKOENA:   No, Chairperson. 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 36 of 130 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did anybody actually come to you 
and say:  Please explain to us what had happened? 
MR MOKOENA:   Is the first time today anyone else to 
discuss this matter, today. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Really? 
MR MOKOENA:   Since I left the office December 2011, no 
one has ever come to me to discuss, investigate, interview 
or discuss with me this matter. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you give evidence at the inquiry? 
MR MOKOENA:   [No audible reply]  
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Were you asked to give evidence at 
the disciplinary inquiry? 
MR MOKOENA:   At the disciplinary inquiry I was a witness. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
MR MOKOENA:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now in preparation for that, who 
spoke to you? 
MR MOKOENA:   For that meeting? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
MR MOKOENA:   I was just told that I must come to a 
20 
meeting.  I was not briefed properly.  I was not given 
documents.  It was just that I must come there and be part of 
the disciplinary hearings. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No one sat with you and said:  Look, 
we want to know what you know.  Let us go through the 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 37 of 130 
 
details. 
MR MOKOENA:   The secretariat, the lawyer that were 
running this, were the people who came to me. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And did they brief you beforehand? 
MR MOKOENA:   They briefed me a day or two before the 
hearing. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You understand that as the head of 
the department, you are the accounting officer and you are 
therefore responsible in terms of the PFMA, Public Finance 
Management Act, for what happens under your command? 
10 
MR MOKOENA:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And even if you do delegate, you are 
still accountable. 
MR MOKOENA:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now, what is puzzling about the 
events of 2010/2011 and your department, is that there 
seems to be a blurring of the lines between your role and the 
role of the MEC.   
 
How do you understand the distinction or the riding line 
between your function and responsibility on the one hand 
20 
and that of the MEC on the other?   
 
Because you have given evidence to a great extent of 
what would seem to be a blurring of the lines of the MEC 
entering onto your domain.  Please share your thoughts with 
the Chair. 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 38 of 130 
 
MR MOKOENA:   Thank you, sir.  I think mainly, I felt 
strangulated because for me, they exert with authority at that 
particular point.  And most of the thing that he was meddling 
in for me, are the things or the areas of work that belongs to 
me as the head of the department.   
 
I think it was a deliberate ploy to unsettle me so that 
when he comes to me with instructions that I must take, it 
must be instructions that come from him and when it is me 
who according to the PMFA who is responsible but I am 
referring to the things that he is bringing into my area of 
10 
work.   
 
I think he was doing this deliberately.  He was aware 
that he was getting to the... he was getting insight into the 
environment view which did not belong to him. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What is the environment of an MEC 
as opposed to your environment?  What is the dividing line?  
Can you describe it briefly for us? 
MR MOKOENA:   Well, mainly, the MEC will come with 
regulatory and the HOD will come the implementation.  When 
I talk pageants, it is only the HOD that would talk pageants.  
20 
When I talk supply chain management procurement, it is the 
HOD.   
 
When I talk management of staff, it is the HOD.  So he 
was into all those areas and he I think he was doing it 
deliberately.  And I think he was being advised from 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 39 of 130 
 
somewhere.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Finally, Mr Mokoena.  You gave 
evidence yesterday in relation to the ERP plan.  There is the 
slide presentation, the summary of the ERP plan.   
MR MOKOENA:   Correct, sir. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And you spoke expressly to the 
Chair about the cash flow projection document.  Do you 
recall that cash flow projection document? 
MR MOKOENA:   I recall it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Would Mr Zwane had been aware of 
10 
that? 
MR MOKOENA:   I think because it was an ERP, we would 
have taken him through it because we wanted him to know 
what it is that we are trying to achieve. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you very much Mr Mokoena for 
coming to give evidence.  If needs be, we will ask you to 
come back but thank you very much.  You are excused for 
now. 
MR MOKOENA:   Thanks very much Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  We are at two minutes to 
eleven.  But if your next witness is ready, we can start but if 
you need some time. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Perhaps we should allow the time for 
the Jo'burg.  Could we take an early short adjournment? 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 40 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Shall we just make it our tea 
adjournment or...?  Shall we make it our tea adjournment 
already? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you are happy with that Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   From your side? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, it will give chance to do the 
handover. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Shall we say we resume at quarter 
past or shall I give you more time? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Twenty past?  Would that be 
10 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Twenty past. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  We will resume at twenty-
past eleven then. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn.

me God. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Thank 
you, 
you 
may 
be 
seated.  
Continue, Mr Pretorius.

ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Maxatshwa 
would you look at bundle FS12 at page 183?  We are 
referring to the black numbers in the top left hand corner 
of that bundle before you. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   I see, Chair, my document is starting 
at 184. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, they will assist you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair, would you just bear with us 
a minute?  Apparently, we have yet another bungling issue 
to deal with. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I did try and check some but 
20 000 pages was a bit beyond us.  Is that document in 
front of you now, sir? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Thank you, Mr Pretorius, I have now – 
on page 183. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes and if you go through to page 
212, you will a signature on that page.   
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes I am on 212. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Whose signature is that? 
20 
MR MAXATSHWA:   It is my signature. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, this document from page 
183 to 212, is that your affidavit prepared for the 
Commission? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, Mr Pretorius. 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 43 of 130 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   As far as you are aware are the 
contents of this affidavit true and correct? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So the exhibit number is EXHIBIT 
UU2.  May that be admitted? 
CHAIRPERSON:   The affidavit of Mr Mphikelei Kaizer 
Maxatshwa starting at page 183 is admitted and will be 
marked as EXHIBIT UU – did you say 2, Mr...? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair,  UU2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   UU2, okay. 
10 
AFFIDAVIT 
OF 
MPHIKELEI 
KAIZER 
MAXATSHWA 
HANDED IN AS EXHIBIT UU2 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  Mr Maxatshwa, would 
you please look at paragraph 4 on page 184 of your 
affidavit? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, I am at page 184. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  And you say in that 
paragraph that you have read the affidavit of Mr Mokoena, 
you have read the founding affidavit deposed to by Mr 
Mokhesi in the review application and you have read 
20 
extracts from the evidence given and the disciplinary 
proceedings given by Mr Mokoena and Mr Neville Chaney, 
is that correct? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And you refer in paragraph 5 to 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 44 of 130 
 
certain disciplinary proceedings the result of which was 
that you and some of your colleagues who were employed 
in the Department of Human Settlements in the Free State 
were dismissed. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You say in paragraph 6 that you 
have taken a view that your dismissal was unfair and you 
refer to the contents of your affidavit. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What is the status of those – your 
10 
challenge to the disciplinary proceedings at the moment? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Chair, we are now at the CCMA, we 
have referred the matter after our dismissal in 2015 but the 
CCMA has not assisted us up until so far.  There has been 
so many changes of Commissioners on our case.  There 
was a stage where the evidence bundles of the transcripts 
were lost at their offices.  Yes.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It seems a very long time that has 
elapsed before you actually come before and get a result 
from the CCMA. 
20 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, Chair, it has been a long time.  
Normally they say justice delayed is justice denied. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Has that been over the what, seven 
years?  Has there been no time when oral evidence was 
led?  In other words, no oral evidence has been led at all 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 45 of 130 
 
at the CCMA? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   No oral evidence has been led at all at 
the CCMA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it is …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Perhaps that is a matter that we 
could look into, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it is quite long, ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And certainly, the circumstances 
giving rise to the delays, lost files and the like.  In any 
event, you also refer in paragraph 9 – well, before we go 
10 
there, you refer to the Open Waters report.  Have you been 
given an opportunity now to peruse that report? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   We were denied that particular report. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am sorry, I did not…? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   We were denied that particular report. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Well, it is available.  We 
can make it available to you should you require it. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Chair, if it is available, we will gladly 
accept it and study it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In paragraph 9 you refer to an 
20 
investigation carried out by the Special Investigation Unit.  
That report of the SIU you say was never formally 
submitted 
to 
and 
adopted 
by 
parliament. 
 
That 
is 
information that you have received. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Ja, that is the information we received, 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 46 of 130 
 
Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  In any event any 
information 
that 
you 
do 
require 
can 
because 
made 
available to you. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Chair, will gladly like the assistance of 
the Commission with that particular information. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In paragraph 12 you list your 
qualifications.  What are they? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Chair, I have junior degree in law, 
B.Proc and an honours degree in law, LLB, both from the 
10 
University of Durban-Westville completed in 1995.  I also 
have an honours in Government Regional Planning from 
the University of the Free State. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You were a Municipal Manager at 
the Nketoana Municipality from 2000 to 2006, is that 
correct? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And then when were you appointed 
to the Local Government and Housing department in the 
Free State Province? 
20 
MR MAXATSHWA:   At the expiry of my contract at 
Nketoana I was appointed at Free State, the Local 
Government and Housing department in 2006, November. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What position did you occupy 
then? 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 47 of 130 
 
MR MAXATSHWA:   I was a Chief Director in the Local 
Government branch. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Of the Local Government and 
Housing? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   The Department of Local Government 
and Housing, yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And to whom did you report? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Then I reported to Mr [indistinct] 11.15 
Konsani(?). 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And to whom did that person 
10 
report? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   That person reported to MEC Mafereka 
then  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  So just for the record, is it 
my Ralikantsane that you mentioned now? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, Mr Ralikantsane.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That is R-a-l-i-k-a-n-t-s-a-n-e.  His 
first Kopung, K-o-p-u-n-g and Mr Joe Mafereka, M-a-f-e-r-
e-k-a, is that correct? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   That is correct, Chair. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In 2009 we know that Mr 
Magashule became Premier and Mr Zwane became the 
MEC for Local Government and Housing, is that correct? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And the head of departments 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 48 of 130 
 
Human Settlements was Mr Mokoena. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The names of all the departments 
and positions may be confusing because there were 
changes over time. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   That is correct, Local Government and 
Housing, as a department, was split into two, it was now 
Local Government and Traditional Affairs and then a 
Department of Human Settlement was created separately. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And you were in the Human 
10 
Settlements side of the organogram, is that right? 
MR 
MAXATSHWA: 
 
 
I 
was 
transferred 
from 
Local 
Government to Human Settlement as a Chief Director. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The reporting structures appear at 
page 190 at paragraph 21.  Do you see that? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And without intending any adverse 
comment, you are fairly low down in that hierarchy. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, Chair, it would be the HOD above 
me, there will be DDGs and then there will be the CFO 
20 
above me and then will come as Chief Directors just below 
those executives. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, the only reason I make the 
point is that those were disciplined, who were ultimately 
disciplined and dismissed were not at the top of the 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 49 of 130 
 
rankings. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Can I ask – we have just had a 
message from the transcriber, unlike other witnesses, you 
speak very loudly and clearly, so if you could just move 
away from the microphone please?  We have to say exactly 
the opposite to all the other witnesses.  What were your 
responsibilities as Chief Director?  You deal with that in 
paragraph 24. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   In the Human Settlement? 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   In the Human Settlement I had two – 
oh no, two directorate, I had a technical directorate which 
was mainly your building inspectors that will inspect the 
construction of the houses and they were constructed and 
then 
on 
the 
other 
directorate 
will 
be 
directorate 
responsible for planning and research. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So the inspectors who went out 
pursuant to the building contracts and inspected and 
milestones, did they report to you? 
20 
MR MAXATSHWA:   They reported to me via the director 
that was responsible for them which was Mr Kabelo Koloi. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Koloi, right.  On page 192 you deal 
with the standard protocols for building RDP houses with 
the Division of Revenue Act funding, DORA funding.  That 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 50 of 130 
 
evidence is a matter of record we need not detail it any 
further.  But what is your recollection?  You deal with it in 
paragraph 30 of the amount allocated for the 2010/2011 
financial year.  I am referring to paragraph 30 on page 193. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, Chair.  We were allocated 1.4 
billion by the National fiscus, the National Treasury via 
Human Settlement Department. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, most of that was a new 
allocation, we understand, but part of that was a rollover 
from the previous financial year. 
10 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Ja, they were the rollover a new 
allocation will be combined to form the amounts. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  And the purpose of that, as 
we know, was for the construction of low cost housing in 
the province. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What is the provincial business 
plan?  You deal with that at paragraph 31 and following. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   The provincial business plan is a plan 
that each province compiles a year before implementation 
20 
which talks to the projected allocated amount in terms of 
medium term expenditure framework which then says this 
will be our projects, lost cost housing in terms of several 
programmes that are included in the what you call the 
housing project. 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 51 of 130 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And in order to compile that 
business plan you communicate with the municipalities 
where these houses will be built on the one hand and the 
National Department on the other. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Correct, Chair.  The planning cycle of 
government is such that a municipality must compile and 
IDP.  Within that particular integrated development plan 
you have to have a housing sector plan which is a specific 
plan that talks to housing matters. That housing sector 
plan will identify that area of needs and it will also talk to 
10 
the special availability of land and the number of people 
that are looking for housing in the area.  Then it will be 
integrated into the district development plan.   The district 
development 
plan 
will 
also 
be 
integrated 
with 
other 
departments at a provincial level where you produce what 
we call provincial growth and development strategy which 
will also talk to the special development framework of the 
province.   
In essence, the documents, the building documents 
will then tell you where we should be focusing in terms of 
20 
delivery of housing together with other amenities. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So at a general level there is a 
detailed system and plan that controls the allocation of 
money for housing projects in a particular province. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Correct. 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 52 of 130 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let us deal with it at another level.  
One of the issues of concern in this matter is that monies 
were not properly spent and there was wasteful and 
irregular expenditure in the construction of houses.  Now 
there are various protections built into the system which 
were ignored in this case which you will talk about in your 
evidence but before payment can be made to a contractor, 
milestones must be achieved.  We have heard that 
evidence.  Is that correct? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   That is correct. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What are those milestones? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   There is three milestones.  There is 
basically the foundation, a milestone, the wall plate and 
then the roofing, completion milestone.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now before the contractor can 
claim at the completion of any milestone, you have told us 
that there are inspections.  We have heard that there are 
inspections that must take place and the work must be 
verified. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Correct, Chair. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And not only is this provided for in 
the contract itself but in the Human Settlements Scheme 
documentation, am I correct? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   I mean …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Housing subsidy scheme. 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 53 of 130 
 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Housing subsidy scheme, which is the 
system 
that 
assist 
in 
building 
management 
in 
the 
Department of Human Settlement both provincial and 
national. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  Would you just tell the Chair 
in paragraph 42 and 43 on page 195, you talk about those 
inspections which are required by the contract and the 
housing subsidy scheme, those events that must take place 
before payment can be made, paragraph 42 and 43.  
Particularly 43, the extent to which the inspection must be 
10 
carried out. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, Chair.  Firstly, you will receive a 
request from the contractor that they have completed the 
excavations.  There would be different activities on a 
foundation itself.  There will be excavations, compactions 
and filling of the foundation that should be inspected 
before a slab is casted, the concrete is casted.   
 
After that, after the casting of the foundation it will 
be left to cure and then seven days to ten they will request 
that the inspector should come and approve that particular 
20 
foundation that has been completed and is standing as per 
the specifications.  But then the contractor ’s engineer will 
also be there to make sure that if there are any concerns 
that our inspector, the department, raises is able to can 
explain. 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 54 of 130 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Fine, if you would go to paragraph 
44.  If the construction work is then approved what 
happens then? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   In the construction, the milestone is 
approved, all the concerned parties meaning our inspector, 
the engineer, the contractor ’s engineer, NHRBC’s people, 
inspectors, and the municipal building inspector, they 
certify the document and give it back to the contractor to 
go and submit for payment at the department. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And finally, what happens then? 
10 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Finally, when it is submitted it is 
captured on the system, the HS system, and there will be 
another system of payment which is called BAS where 
information will also be captured on the CFO’s side so that 
payment can be generated and then the contractor can be 
paid. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You referred to the system, is that 
B-A-S system? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Ja, B-A-S system, BAS. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  The point of this evidence 
20 
is just to illustrate that there is an elaborate system of 
checks and balances for the proper expenditure of payment 
for low cost housing on the one hand and for the proper 
construction under supervision of low cost housing on the 
other hand, is that correct? 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 55 of 130 
 
MR MAXATSHWA:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So if that system is followed, the 
low cost housing plans should work. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now clearly, we know that that 
system simply did not apply in relation to what happened in 
2010/2011, am I correct? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Ja, to some extent it did not apply, 
Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, we can deal with that in your 
10 
evidence as we go through it.  We have dealt with the 
events of 2010/2011 which required the issue of a new 
tender and the commencement of the new procurement 
process for the appointment of contractors.  We need not 
go into any detail although you do deal with it in detail in 
your statement.   
The result of this was a new tender process for the 
appointment 
of 
contractors 
was 
initiated 
and 
that 
collapsed, basically, the tender period was exceeded and it 
was decided to approve a database of contractors.  You 
20 
recall all that. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   I recall that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But that would not have happened 
at your level of operation. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   No, that will be a supply chain matter. 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 56 of 130 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But we know that that database 
included contractors who had been disqualified in the 
abandoned procurement process or, amongst other things, 
that they were not competent to do the work.  Do you recall 
that? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   I recall that because I have a sight of 
the bid evaluation report.  The bid evaluation committee 
report and also the bid adjudication report. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   At the level at which you were 
dealing with the construction of houses and supervising 
10 
inspectors, 
did 
the 
appointment 
of 
under-qualified 
contractors cause a problem in the construction of houses? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Chair, there will be new entrants into 
the system.  In a normal construction business you look for 
those construction companies that have a muscle to can 
handle the construction.  When you look at their bid 
document, they will tell you the functionality and their 
financial muscle that can handle the project.  But once 
those 
requirements 
are 
not 
in 
existence 
in 
the 
bid 
documents, you will find it hard for those that gets 
20 
appointed to move at speed. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And the quality of the building that 
results? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   That will also affect the quality of 
building because they will not be having that experience, 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 57 of 130 
 
the [indistinct] 28.40 to produce quality.  Hence you will 
allocate them 50 or 100 units just to test the waters and 
then put an emphasis on your inspectors to say look after 
these guys so that they can produce quality in terms of the 
specs and if there is any shoddy work they will be 
punished for that because at the end of the day you will 
have to demolish the house and then start afresh. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let us move on then.  Much of the 
content of your affidavit up to page 201 has already been 
dealt with in evidence and we need not deal with it 
10 
because it is largely consistent with what you say but if we 
can go to page 201 of FS12 and deal with the ERP or the 
expenditure recovery plan.  We know that the National 
Department of Human Settlements raised concerns about 
the level of spending in the Free State department, 
correct? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And Minister Sexwale issued a 
...[indistinct] to the MEC, Mr Zwane, expressing his 
concerns. 
20 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And the requirement that arose out 
of that communication was to produce an expenditure 
recovery plan. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Correct. 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 58 of 130 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And you say in paragraph 64 that 
that plan was indeed prepared as part of the so-called War 
Room.  What was the War Room?  
MR MAXATSHWA:   The term War Room Chair you will 
hear it in most of the government sectors.  When there is 
trouble a War Room is created it is where people will sit, 
monitor and implementation of the decisions that have 
been taken to ensure that there is constant monitoring and 
there is constant delivery on the ground and if there is any 
problems you will raise a hand and say this is concerning 
10 
me and can it be attended by the relevant authorities.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The advance payment plan we 
have heard that it originated in discussions in the War 
Room that the instance of the former MEC Mr Zwane, is 
that your recollection? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   No Chair, my recollection is that the 
advance payments scheme – the War Room was a product 
of the advance payment scheme because whilst that 
scheme was designed and approved it needed hands of 
people that will manage what is contained in the advance 
20 
payment scheme.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, so other witnesses have 
said that the plan was actually devised as part of the War 
Room but that is a matter of semantics.  There was a 
meeting at which the devising of the plan was discussed.  
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 59 of 130 
 
The creation of the plan was discussed and you say the 
War Room meetings governed the implementation of the 
plan and monitored the implementation of the plan.  Is that 
correct?  
MR MAXATSHWA:   That is correct.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alight, the ERP the expenditure 
recovery plan where was that prepared? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   The ERP it was prepared by the senior 
managers including MEC Zwane in a separate meeting.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  
10 
MR MAXATSHWA:   You mentioned actually that a notice 
from Minister Sexwale was sent to the office of MEC 
Zwane.  He then called a meeting of all head of officials 
both in local government and traditional affairs because 
you had people who were experienced in terms of the 
government planning and those that were controlling 
especially the directory that controls the approval of 
special plans that establishment plans and alike.  And 
included in that meeting were also the officials from deputy 
director level in the human settlement up to the chief 
20 
director level.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you take any part in the 
preparation 
of 
that 
plan, 
did 
you 
contribute 
to 
the 
preparation of that plan? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, Chair I took part because my 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 60 of 130 
 
corner as a chief directorate was going to be handling the 
technical aspects of the construction.  So you had to say 
look from where I am sitting this is what I will need if we 
talk capacity building.   
If we had to run faster, I will need more runners, 
more 
inspectors on the ground in terms of human bodies, warm 
bodies and I will also need maybe software gadgets that 
will assist me when the outside to communicate and the 
budget linked to that because if inspectors go outside 
10 
Bloemfontein, they will have either to spend the whole 
week or two weeks being on the field.        
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   At a more senior level – and I am 
referring to HOD’s and I am referring to the MEC, who was 
involved in the preparation of the ERP?   
MR MAXATSHWA:   Mr Mokoena was there, Mr Tsoametsi 
was there, the CFO was there and Ms Dhlamini and the 
MEC’s office was there also included was the MEC.    
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right and were they responsible 
for the final compilation of the plan, together?  You say so 
20 
in paragraph 64.  
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now that ERP is something 
separate from the advance payment plan as I understand 
your view of things.  
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 61 of 130 
 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Ja, there will be an ERP and there will 
also be an advanced payment scheme.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right who – were you involved in 
the development of the advanced payment plan? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   The advanced payment scheme as you 
said? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  
MR MAXATSHWA:   EPS? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  
MR MAXATSHWA:   No I was not involved.  
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We have dealt at some length with 
the document which is a slide presentation of the ERP, the 
expenditure recovery plan and the cash flow projections 
section of that plan.  You talk about that in paragraph 66.  
Do you see that?    
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now that cash flow projection and I 
think you have shadowed it in your previous answers now 
contemplated the normal process taking place, milestone to 
milestone and payment on milestones.  Do I understand it 
20 
correctly?   
MR MAXATSHWA:   Correct.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The consensus so far has been 
that – well let me ask you this first.  When was that plan 
compiled and completed the plan part of it?  When was the 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 62 of 130 
 
document finally completed?   
MR MAXATSHWA:   The ERP or the?  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The ERP.  
MR MAXATSHWA:   The ERP was compiled during October 
month.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right and we know from other 
witnesses and you can correct us if this evidence is not 
correct that at that stage no houses had been completed, 
at that financial year.   
MR 
MAXATSHWA: 
 
 
There 
were 
houses 
that 
were 
10 
completed 
on 
the 
ground, 
rolling 
from 
the 
previous 
financial year.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, but we talking about this 
particular allocation.  
MR MAXATSHWA:   On this particular allocation, no.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, okay now would you agree 
with the evidence that has been given to date that the cash 
flow projections were overly ambitious.  You were not going 
to spend over a billion rand in the final months of the year.  
MR MAXATSHWA:   Ja, Chair I will agree and qualify my 
20 
statement by saying if we were to start in November 
running there will be construction holiday in December 
which will move up until January.  Middle January is when 
everybody comes back to do construction.  So it is 
basically the step in terms of your delivery.    
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 63 of 130 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, you would not finish by the 
end of the financial year.  
MR MAXATSHWA:   Ja, you will not finish you will 
obviously have – what you call it – a rollover of the funds 
to the next financial year.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well yes and you say that was 
obvious but what the cash flow projections said was that 
everything would be complete to the tune of over a billion 
rand by March.   
MR MAXATSHWA:   That was ambitious.  
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, to put it gently.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Was it ever going to happen? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was not going to happen.  
MR MAXATSHWA:   It was not going to happen as I have 
said 
if 
you 
begin 
in 
November 
to 
start 
chasing 
construction, you will be hit by the construction holiday 
anyway.   
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR MAXATSHWA:   The suppliers will close, producers of 
20 
material will be closed mostly people who want to go and 
have festive with their kids especially the loyal employees 
that will have migrated to come in and work in certain 
projects. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, did you say you were part of the 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 64 of 130 
 
preparation of that plan?     
MR MAXATSHWA:   Of the ERP, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   You were part? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   I was part.  
CHAIRPERSON:   You admit that you were all aware that 
you were misrepresenting the position when you indicated 
through the plan that by end of the financial year you 
would have completed the allocation, the houses needed 
for the allocation.  
MR MAXATSHWA:   Chair yes we are sitting there and 
10 
debating all of us and if your point was not carrying any 
sense those who believed that this can be done will say no 
this can be done.  But you will sit there in a meeting and 
say…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Speaking for yourself you knew that it 
could not be done.   
MR MAXATSHWA:   Ja, from my experience in terms of 
construction? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, that was impossible.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and was there anyone in the room 
who was participating in that plan who said that they 
genuinely believed it was achievable?  Do you remember 
anyone in the room who participated in preparing the plan 
who genuinely or who said they genuinely believed it was 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 65 of 130 
 
achievable? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Chair because there was so many of 
us…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or is the position that when all is said 
and done, when you look at everybody you know that 
everybody knew that this was not achievable.  They may 
have said whatever they said but the truth is they knew it 
was not achievable.  Are you able to say that or are you 
only able to say that for yourself?  
MR MAXATSHWA:   I am able to say the majority of us will 
10 
say with the lack of capacity as a new department this will 
not be happening.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR MAXATSHWA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, do you remember anyone that may 
have pushed strongly that as far as he or she was 
concerned this was achievable and if so who was that?  
MR MAXATSHWA:   Chair because it was a long time when 
this meetings happened one cannot clearly recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No that is fine.   
20 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   No okay, no that is fine, yes Mr 
Pretorius.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   There must have been present at 
these meetings or at this meeting technical experts people 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 66 of 130 
 
who understood the requirements of the normal building 
process.  The costing of foundations, the inspections, the 
walls, the roofing all the services that had to be provided.  
There must have been technical experts with a knowledge 
of whether this was an achievable plan or not.  
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, Chair I would say there must have 
been people with knowledge but since we are a new 
department still struggling to get experts.  If I put it right 
the technical experts that we needed were like quantity 
surveyors, professional engineers in terms of construction, 
10 
civil engineers that will talk to your bulk supply and stuff 
like that.   
Those were not in existence in our department until 
 such time we received I think it was a year later when we 
received assistance from the Cuban Government in terms 
of 
the 
Cuban 
exchange 
program 
and 
the 
Cuban 
professionals.  Then we had architects, we had also 
engineers people that can really think thoroughly on 
technical matters.           
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You know this is a technical 
20 
exercise Mr Maxatshwa one would have thought with a 
billion rand at stake that at the very least technical 
expertise would have been called upon in the preparation 
of this review plan.  It seems to me that it was prepared 
without any regard to the technical aspects of the matter 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 67 of 130 
 
and this is a technical matter.      
MR MAXATSHWA:   I agree with you with that statement.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But you say in paragraph 67 Mr 
Maxatshwa that the ERP was presented at the October 
technical ministerial meeting of the executive council that 
is the MINMEC, the technical MINMEC.  Which senior 
officials would have attended that meeting?  
MR MAXATSHWA:   The October meeting will have been 
attended by myself and Mr Mokoena, the CFO.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right and any other officials of a 
10 
senior nature from the national department? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, from the national department you 
will have the whole senior management and the executive 
management there from the Director General, Mr Thabane 
Zulu who is the chief operation officer, Mr Nagel Chain 
0:16:20:08, the CFO office and then you will have their 
supporting staff.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did the members of the national 
departments say anything to the members of the provincial 
department about the viability and legality of the ERP? 
20 
MR MAXATSHWA:   At the meeting in October? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  
MR MAXATSHWA:   In October we say that because to go 
and revise the plan and present what would have been a 
revised ERP in the November technical MINMEC.  
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 68 of 130 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, and did the November 
meeting then take place? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, the November meeting did take 
place.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You talk about that on page 202.  
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And was it at that meeting that the 
advanced payment issue was raised? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, I did highlight at that meeting that 
this is the thinking about spending the money in the Free 
10 
State.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And what was the response of the 
meeting to what you said? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   The response from those that had the 
experience especially guys from Gauteng were saying that 
will not work, we have the experience of it.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At that stage when you said to them this 
was the thinking in the Free State about advance payments 
where did you get that idea from had that been discussed 
20 
in the Free State already?  
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, it was discussed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It had already been discussed.   
MR MAXATSHWA:   It had already been discussed.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But it had not been placed put in writing 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 69 of 130 
 
or in anything like that?  
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright you deal with that in the 
next paragraph perhaps the most straight forward question 
was as far as you are concerned whose idea was the 
advanced payment plan? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   It was the idea of the MEC.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And as you say in paragraph 71 by 
the 18 t h of November when this technical MINMEC meeting 
10 
took place Mr Tsoametsi recommendations or his document 
which we have discussed in evidence thus far had not yet 
been signed off that only happened on the 25 t h of 
November 2010.  Correct? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Correct.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   At the two meetings or in fact there 
were three meetings.  There was one on the 18 t h of 
November, there was one in October and there was a third 
meeting on the 19 t h of November.  What was that meeting?  
MR MAXATSHWA:   It was the political MINMEC as you 
20 
know it, the Ministers and the MEC’s.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And at that meeting which 
Ministers and which MEC’s would have attended? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Minister Tokyo Sexwale was our 
Minister then and then all the MEC’s responsible for human 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 70 of 130 
 
settlement or local government, traditional affairs and 
human settlement.  Whatever combination that you will 
have in any province. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you attend that meeting the 
MINMEC meeting, the Minister – the political meeting as 
you call it? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, Chair I attended it.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What was said there both about the 
ERP and about the advanced payment plan? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   That political MINMEC confirmed what 
10 
was submitted as recommendation from the technical 
MINMEC on the ERP, our ERP.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What was that? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   It was summarised in the minutes 
where the Chairperson said I will recommend that not to be 
taken of the presentation of the Free State and that the 
ERP is not convincing enough and the money will be taken 
from the Free State.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay so it was rejected the ERP 
was rejected? 
20 
MR MAXATSHWA:   The ERP was rejected.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And the advance payment plan?  
MR MAXATSHWA:   It was not only ERP itself.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No, no I know it was not only the 
ERP but was the advance payment plan discussed at the 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 71 of 130 
 
meeting of 19 November? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Ja, the comments were passed after I 
have indicated the comments were passed to say no that 
thing is unlawful, it will not work.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So at the political meeting where 
the National Minister and the MEC’s were present held on 
the 19 t h of November 2010 two things happened.  The ERP 
plan was rejected and secondly the advance payment plan 
was stated to be illegal and it could not continue.  
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And did your MEC participate in that 
discussion?  
MR MAXATSHWA:   No, Chair he had tendered the apology 
together with the HOD. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So both of them were not there? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Ja they were in the NCOP, the NCOP 
was visiting Free State on that particular dates.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I may have missed something that I 
think would have come earlier.  I think I saw in your 
affidavit that you said that when the idea of advanced 
20 
payment was put on the table by MEC Zwane in a meeting 
in the Free State in the housing department that the 
reaction of most of the people who attended that meeting 
was that that would be illegal, advance payment would be 
illegal.  Is that correct?   
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 72 of 130 
 
MR MAXATSHWA:   No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh I misunderstood.  
MR MAXATSHWA:   I was talking to the ERP. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh the ERP.  
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not the advance payment.  
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, not the advance payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay alright.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But we have evidence on record of 
various meetings that took place in the Free State and 
10 
meetings that took place involving the National Minister 
and members from the national department, there were a 
range of those meeting.   
But let me put it at a summary level the details are 
in the affidavits and in the review application which was 
testified to by Mr Mokhesi.  In the province was it made 
clear to the department officials in the department and the 
MEC that the advanced payment plan was unlawful.  
MR MAXATSHWA:   Chair according to what I have read 
from the affidavit of Mr Mokhesi that was told to the MEC.  
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  
MR MAXATSHWA:   In the meeting between I think it was a 
private meeting between the Minister and the MEC together 
with the HOD.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now we also know from your 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 73 of 130 
 
evidence now that the ERP plan or ERP itself was also 
rejected.  
MR MAXATSHWA:   It was rejected.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And you refer to a meeting of the 
19 t h of November which was not attended by Mr Zwane nor 
by the HOD at the time Mr Mokoena? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Would they have received reports 
of what happened at the meeting that would seem probable 
as a matter of common sense.  But what do you say about 
10 
that?   
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, Chair as a delegated person at a 
meeting you will immediately when issues are raised and 
which are burning your province if I may put it in that 
particular manner take a phone and call the delegating 
authority which is the HOD.  To say HOD this is what had 
been said in this particular meeting, the ERP is not 
accepted, the idea of the advance payment scheme is not 
accepted.   
So please inform the higher authority which is the 
20 
MEC because by then one was thinking that both of them 
are together at the NCOP which was held in QwaQwa.  So 
they will brief one another in terms of what is to happen.        
Following that would be the minutes both sets of minutes 
the technical MINMEC and also the MINMEC minutes will 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 74 of 130 
 
be transcribed same day and then be sent to all the 
recipients, the people that should have been in that 
particular meeting as per the distribution list.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I have just picked up what I had in mind 
when I asked you the last question that I asked you.  It 
appears in paragraph 83 of your affidavit that maybe is 
something that Mr Pretorius has still to come to I am not 
sure.  But I see there you deal with a certain meeting but I 
see that you do not indicate whether you attended the 
meeting yourself that was called by Mr Zwane seems to 
10 
have been on the 29 t h of October 2010 where he put his 
plan on the table, his solution in quotes.  And you say in 
paragraph 83 fist line:  
“The opinion of the meeting was that such a 
payment system would be illegal because the HSS 
policy 
framework 
did 
not 
provide 
for 
advance 
payments.”   
I think that is what I had in mind can you see that? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, Chair I can see that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you did not attend that meeting 
20 
yourself.  You start talking about that meeting in the 
previous page from paragraph 79.  You mentioned people 
were there but you do not seem to mention yourself.  
MR MAXATSHWA:   Ja, before the meeting of the 29 t h 
Chair we were called into a meeting by MEC Zwane which 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 75 of 130 
 
meeting was alluded to by Mr Mokoena where the MEC 
briefed us about the advance payment scheme.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So but this one of the 29 t h you did not 
attend or do you not remember?  
MR MAXATSHWA:   The technical meeting of the 29 t h I did 
attend with Mr Mokoena.  
CHAIRPERSON:   You did attend? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay but can you see that you do say 
in paragraph 83:  
“That the opinion of the meeting was that the pre-
payment system was illegal.”   
Remember I asked you the question whether the majority of 
the people who attended the meeting where Mr Zwane put 
on the table, put his proposal on the table, his solution 
whether the majority of the people indicated that his 
solution would be illegal in terms of pre-payments and you 
said no you had said that in regard to the ERP.  
20 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Ja, in the meeting before October 
where the MEC briefed us about the advance payments 
system. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes.  
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 76 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no I will come to that just now I 
just want to understand what the position is with regard to 
what was said at this meeting of the 29 t h of October.  You 
confirm what you say in paragraph 83 namely:  
“That the opinion of the meeting was that such a 
payment system would be illegal.”     
MR MAXATSHWA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That was the view of the meeting.   
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay but you understand why I am 
10 
coming back to it.  
MR MAXATSHWA:   Okay, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you understand? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because I thought you did not seem to 
think that that what was said but you are [indistinct] if that 
is true. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was the view of the meeting? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the 29t h. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in the… 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Not – not… 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the meeting before that that you have 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 77 of 130 
 
just talked about. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  You [talking over one another]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was the position the same? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Before the meeting of the 29t h 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  The technical meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  There was a meeting of the MEC too. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Yes where … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that meeting was attended by Mr 
Zwane, yourself, Mr Mokoena and who else? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  And Ms Dlamini. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Dlamini. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Mina Meintjies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Kabelo Kaloi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  There might be one or two that you 
forget. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Ja Muso Tsoametsi was in that – also in 
20 
that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that – okay that is fine you do not have 
to specify all of them. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the – is that the first meeting where Mr 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 78 of 130 
 
Zwane advanced his “solution” in quotes for the problem? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And what was the reaction of those 
who were present to that proposal of advanced payments? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  The reaction was that will be legal 
because you know the milestones. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Does not cater for such. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is a meeting that Mr Mokoena spoke 
about in his evidence yesterday and I think he said it is the 
meeting where Mr Zwane put this proposal on the table for 
the first time. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  It is the same meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he said he was the only one who 
spoke against this “solution” and said it would be illegal.  He 
said that everyone else was quiet and he even went further 
and said it was as if the other people in the meeting knew 
about this maybe there had been some discussion.  The 
20 
meeting seemed to be just between himself and Mr Zwane.  
Did you – would that reflect what the position was?  Were a 
lot of people in the meeting quiet during that meeting? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  No Chair.  When you attend a meeting 
with the MEC you are expected to contribute. 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 79 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   There because whatever decision that 
will be taken. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Will – you will be required to implement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  So you will have to say your say and say 
this is how I see it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But is the position as you recall with 
regard to that meeting which was prior to the technical 
meeting – is the position that a lot of people may have kept 
quiet but they were associating themselves with the views 
expressed by Mr Mokoena or is your recollection that they 
were actually vocal; they did express the same views as well 
namely these advance payments would be illegal? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Chair the people who are attending that 
meeting were vocal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Ja [00:03:03] know how the system 
should work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you able to say those who were saying 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 80 of 130 
 
this system would be illegal would have been the majority of 
those who attended but some agreed with the – with the 
MEC or would you say everybody was – spoke with one voice 
that this system of payment would be illegal? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  The majority of us in that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  We are not – we are not in agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Yes with the MEC. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
You 
cannot 
say 
everybody 
but 
the 
10 
majority? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Ja the majority. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Thank you Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Chair we were coming to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And maybe – I am sorry 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  To the advance payment system. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am terribly sorry Mr Pretorius.  At that 
meeting when the majority made it clear to Mr Zwane that 
they thought his “solution” in quotes was illegal were there 
reasons why the majority thought his “solution” was illegal 
20 
spelt out? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Chair yes considering that we are a new 
department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  If you had to go buy the material at 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 81 of 130 
 
[00:04:27] you will need as I have said you will need more 
hands to be able to can keep an eye and control such an 
exercise.  Unlike limiting it to one or two contractors where 
you say look come help us we are in – we are at a deep end.  
We are advancing you with so much so that you can be able 
to deliver quicker.  I should say Chair it was not for the first 
time that the advance system was used.  It was used 
previously when Free State lost R100 million at National 
fiscus.  There were a few contractors that were out 
performing others that you allocate the money but you were 
10 
able to produce the type of units that were required.  Even 
under what we became known as the Phlasela [?].  The 
Department will in terms of their thinking of Phlasela [?] they 
will send their money to Public Works to be an implementing 
agent on their money.  I remember there were a few projects 
– priority projects that needed to be – to be run before 2010 
where we were required as a Department to send our money 
to Department of Public Works and then they start building. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But my question is simply whether 
you recall whether the grounds on which the majority was 
20 
saying the advance payments would be illegal were spelt out 
– were articulated to Mr Zwane at that meeting?  Do you 
remember whether those were set out? Somebody did say 
this is why it would be illegal ABCD? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Chair as I am saying we were a fairly 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 82 of 130 
 
new department.  The capacity was not there.  It was a huge 
concern. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Of the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why were you saying the prepayment 
advance payment would be illegal?  Talk – if you talk for 
yourself? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Chair the allocation as per the DORA 
10 
Division of Revenue Act has got conditions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  But you do this with the money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Yes this I have targets that must be 
achieved.  Then… 
CHAIRPERSON:  The milestones. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  The milestones.  Then the sector which 
is Human Settlement will have a system in which the 
expenditure will flow.  Ja which will – bigger milestone 
20 
achievement.  The three milestones.  Those milestones will 
get monitored and [00:07:50] every quarter to the National 
Fiscus.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did Mr Zwane say that as far as he was 
concerned there was nothing illegal or unlawful about 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 83 of 130 
 
advance payments or did, he not say anything along those 
lines? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Chair I cannot recall exactly what he 
said but he came with the scheme. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  The idea and then we debated it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  And he said this thing will work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he said it would work? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Yes this thing will work you guys have to 
put your mind in it to work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
But 
you 
do 
not 
recall 
whether 
he 
responded to the concept of illegality? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  No.  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot remember? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  I cannot remember. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Less there be any confusion.  There 
was a meeting on the 28t h or 29t h you give two dates of the – 
of October the – the October MINMAC meeting – Technical 
MINMAC meeting, do you recall that? 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 84 of 130 
 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Before that meeting right there had 
been a meeting about which you have told the Chair at some 
length of the proposal, the idea formulated by the MEC 
presented and the responses, correct? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Was it at that meeting that Mr 
Tsoametsi was told to go and draft a memorandum? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Ja that was at a meeting where Mr 
Tsoametsi was told – instructed to go and research about the 
10 
… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes and he came back with the 
product on the 25 November a month later? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And it was at that – that document 
that we have looked at that does not contain any legal 
advice about its legality but merely about how it should be 
implemented. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Then there was the meeting 
20 
of the 28 October you say later 29 October but it is not 
material that the Technical MINMAC meeting. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And you have said to the Chair who 
attended.  What was discussed at that meeting?  As I 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 85 of 130 
 
understand your statement it was the expenditure recovery 
plan that was discussed at that meeting. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Yes because there was a concern of the 
below par expenditure. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  We were required to present a recovery 
plan. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right 
10 
MR MAXATSHWA:  In order to meet. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes and it was not accepted at that 
meeting. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  It was not accepted we were told to go 
and revise it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Revise it.  Then the next meeting 
Technical MINMAC meeting took place on the 18 November. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The ERP was presented again at that 
meeting? 
20 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Is that the ERP that we have looked 
at … 
MR MAXATSHWA:  The revised – the revised one that is 
contained in the document. 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 86 of 130 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Was it also rejected at that 
meeting? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  It was also rejected in that meeting. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  At that meeting you also raised the 
advance payments issue? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right what was the response of the 
meeting to the advance payments issue? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  It is unlawful you do not even try it, it is 
risky. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  That took place on the 18 
November.  Then on the 25 November we get Mr Tsoametsi’s 
memorandum which is signed off by Mr Mokoena. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Then there is a MINMAC 
meeting that takes place on the 19 November.  Now the 
MINMAC meeting is what you call the political meeting. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  At that meeting was the ERP 
rejected? 
20 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Yes it was rejected because the 
recommendation will have come from the Technical MINMAC. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Okay and the advance 
payment plan was that mentioned at that meeting? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  No it was mentioned in the – in the 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 87 of 130 
 
recommendations of earlier Technical MINMAC. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright okay.  And you have told the 
Chair that although Mr Zwane and Mr Mokoena did not 
attend the MINMAC meeting of 19 November they would 
have received a report back as to the decisions of that 
meeting? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  And it was at that meeting as I 
understand it was decided to withhold certain monies is that 
correct? 
10 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  In paragraph 77 of your 
statement and of course we will deal in more detail with the 
advanced payment system at paragraph 79 and following.  
Certain of those questions have already been asked of you 
but you refer in paragraph 77 to certain correspondence 
between the National Department of Human Settlements and 
the Free State Department of Human Settlements.  It is a 
letter dated the 8 November 2010.  That appears – that letter 
appears at page 252.  It is a letter addressed to Mr Thabane 
20 
Zulu of the National Department by Mr Mokoena of the 
Provincial Department.  Do you see that? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  252 yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  It seems to deal with the 
expenditure recovery program and seems to talk favourably 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 88 of 130 
 
of the possibility of its implementation.  We have not put that 
to Mr Mokoena but that is something we can deal with later.  
At paragraph 77 what do you say about that letter?  What is 
the point you are making about that letter? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  The point I was making is that the 
Minister was concerned. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The National Minister? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  The National Minister.  He wrote a notice 
to MEC Zwane to say your province is not spending 
accordingly.  Take care of the situation and tell me how are 
10 
you going to take care of the situation.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  And the response was the 
ERP? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  The response was the ERP. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The intervention by the National 
Department and the request to Mr Zwane to deal with it and 
specify precisely how expenditure would take place was a 
letter that appears at page 252 that was the response from 
Mr Mokoena. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Yes Chair. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But as I understand the point you are 
making in paragraph 77 correct me if I am wrong was that 
the original concern about under-spending the allocation 
came from the National Department and the Minister in the 
National Department Minister Sexwale, correct? 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 89 of 130 
 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Correct.  You will have a sight of the 
financial reports that his office at national level will have 
presented to him. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes and he said to Mr Zwane: 
“Account to me please.  I want to know what 
you are going to spend and how it is going to 
be spent because it is a matter of concern to 
me.” 
 
Correct? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Correct. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And the expenditure recovery plan 
was in effect the response? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. If we can go over the page 
please to page 204 and there you deal with the advance 
payment system.  We have heard much evidence about it but 
there may be matters you could clarify; corroborate or even 
add to the evidence that has been given and we will deal 
with that now.  But we will not deal with everything that you 
have said here.  The meeting that took place in October 
20 
before the Technical MINMAC meeting you say here of 29 
October was the meeting at which the plan was presented by 
Mr Zwane, is that correct? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And you have spoken about the 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 90 of 130 
 
responses to that 
plan from 
various 
people including 
particularly your own response. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But is it correct in paragraph 80 
where you say: 
“During the meeting the MEC advised those 
present that he had come up with the plan.” 
 
Is that your recollection of what happened? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  In other words the origins of the plan 
10 
where did this plan originate as far as you are concerned? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  From the MEC. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And he explained then what that plan 
would involve and that was essentially buying material for 
building projects from suppliers and paying for those in 
advance. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And you emphasise that at the stage 
that the payments would be made there would be no 
contractual obligation on the Department to pay the building 
20 
contractor for those materials. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Correct because the contractors will 
have – in terms of the contract the initial contract they will 
have to procure the material themselves. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So we have been through this but 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 91 of 130 
 
just to summarise the original contract with the contractor 
specified that that contractor had to purchase the materials; 
put them in the buildings that detailed and sophisticated 
process of checks and balances that you have discussed 
with the Chair and told the Chair about involving expert 
assessments and the like and reports would then be followed 
and only then would the materials be paid for but paid to the 
contractor, correct? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Without any of those checks and 
10 
balances being adhered to payments were now being made 
to the – the suppliers? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  In advance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now given that as you say and other 
witnesses have said that the contracts that the Department 
would conclude with the contractors included the obligation 
of the contractor to buy the material – building material if I 
understand correctly.  In other words if it was said that the 
contractor would be paid R50 000.00 per house or your 
20 
housing unit or R72 000.00 or whatever that included 
whatever the contractor would use in terms of money would 
use to buy the material.  Is that right or do I misunderstand 
something? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  That is correct Chair. 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 92 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So when therefore Mr Zwane came 
with the idea that the Department should buy material – 
building material for the contractors he in effect was coming 
up with an idea in terms of which the Department was going 
to pay for something that it did not need to pay for 
additionally.  In other words the Department was – the 
Departments’ payment would have included the building 
material when they paid the contractors.  Now paying for the 
material in terms of this proposal was actually not necessary 
as far as the building material is concerned. Because even if 
10 
that the Department did not pay that money that would be 
taking care of as and when the contractor was paid after 
those milestones had been reached.  Or am I confusing you? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  No Chair.  I was listening to what you are 
saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes in other words I just want to – because 
I have not heard any witness who has come before you and I 
have not heard you say this but maybe because I have not 
asked you.  I have not heard anybody saying in terms of this 
proposal by Mr Zwane if the Department paid for the building 
20 
material in the way and [00:22:54] his proposal then the 
price that the Department was going to pay for the building 
of a house – each housing unit would be reduced because it 
otherwise had included whatever the contractor would have 
used to buy material.  But now it is a duplication. 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 93 of 130 
 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Let me explain in this way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Chair.  A unit cost R55 000.00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  As – for a 40 square meter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  House. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  That is what we refer to as a Bantam. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Amount allocated per unit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  That quantum is then distributed as per 
the items.  There are items that constitute that particular 
Bantam. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes to say what is included in this. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Ja what is included labour, foundation 
building material. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Plumbing. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  And so forth. 
CHAIRPERSON:  yes. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  That will comprises – that will comprise 
of – comprise the price of R55 000.00. 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 94 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Then you take – say for instance you pay 
money on milestone 1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja foundation. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  For foundation for the material.  You will 
then take say for instance milestone 1 was R10 000.00 you 
will then take the R10 000.00 in terms of the material that 
needs to be procured and pay it over to the contractor to 
procure the material.  The system – on the system if the 
contractor says I need as per the quotation I need R8 000.00 
10 
you will pay in R8 000.00 and then you will keep the 
R2 000.00 so that when he claims for the foundation 
milestone you pay the remainder of R2 000.00.  Yes.  So you 
will have paid the material. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  But there would be a remainder to 
complete the total amount of that particular milestone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but I think the – the – my question is 
whether Mr Zwane’s proposal necessarily meant that the 
Department would pay twice for the material or whether it did 
20 
not mean that in the end even if his proposal was 
implemented and the material was bought in terms of his 
proposal the Department was going to make sure that that is 
set off somehow when it comes to the contractual amount 
per house that would have been agreed to with the 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 95 of 130 
 
contractor. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Ja the latter statement… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is correct? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was not going to be a duplication in 
terms of money spent on material? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Thank you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  At paragraph 83 and following you 
having described the plan or having summarised the plan 
10 
that was presented by Mr Zwane at the October meeting you 
summarise then the response you have given the evidence 
but perhaps we could put this on record.  At paragraph 83 
you say: 
“The opinion of the meeting that is in 
response to Mr Zwane’s proposal was that 
such a payment system would be illegal 
because the Human – the housing subsidy 
scheme Policy framework did not provide for 
advance payments.” 
20 
 
So there were a number of problems not only in 
relation to advance payments in the Division Revenue Act 
and other regulatory provisions which you have dealt with.  It 
was also in contravention of the HSS Policy, correct? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Correct Chair. 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 96 of 130 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Because the HSS Policy is very 
detailed about the milestone system. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Interestingly it was sought to deal 
with that problem by putting another milestone in for 
advance payments. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Correct Chair because the system is 
owned by the Department and then when you want any 
changes to be introduced. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
10 
MR MAXATSHWA:  You send a request but your request will 
be interrogated by those that administer the system at Head 
Office to say, what do you want to do?  This is what you want 
to do – no it is not possible or it is possible. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes well to describe an advance 
payment as a milestone having been reached it is a bit of a 
contradiction in terms, is it not? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Ja, ja I agree. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  A milestone is the achievement of 
certain progress whereas an advance payment is exactly the 
20 
opposite. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And you make that point in paragraph 
83 which we do not need then to deal with anymore but Mr 
Zwane’s 
response 
to 
the 
criticisms 
of 
his 
plan 
you 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 97 of 130 
 
summarise in paragraph 85 what did he say? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Chair Mr Zwane said he was advised as 
per the lawfulness of the scheme. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Did he say it had been used in other 
provinces? 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Ja he said it has been used in Gauteng 
that is why Muso was commissioned to go and research. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You gave evidence earlier that it had 
not worked in Gauteng. 
MR MAXATSHWA:  Ja when I was sitting at Technical 
10 
MINMAC of the 18 November the Gauteng guys confirmed 
that.  You are putting yourself at risk.  It does not work.   
CHAIRPERSON:   And did you subsequently share that 
feedback with Mr Mokoena and Mr Zwane by any chance? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that this is what the Gauteng people 
say? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But in any event, it was at that 
20 
meeting that Mr Tsoametsi was mandated to go and research 
and come back with an answer? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And we have dealt with the answer 
he came back with and you have annexed it to your 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 98 of 130 
 
statement.  We can go over the page to the summary of the 
Advanced Payment System in paragraph 96.   
 
And that fairly summarises the evidence that you have 
got in the agreement.  In your affidavit rather.  And the 
evidence we have heard from other witnesses.   
 
Perhaps you could just read onto record what your 
summary is on paragraph 96 on page 207. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, Chair.  I say on paragraph 96 that: 
“The 
Advanced 
Payment 
System, 
therefore, 
emanated from Mr Zwane, the MEC.  It was 
10 
designed 
and 
detailed 
by 
Mr 
Tsoametsi 
and 
approved by the HOD of the Department of Human 
Settlements, Mr Mokoena.” 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We are going back now because we 
have dealt at various times with the contents of various 
meetings, but we have the time and just in case we leave 
anything out from your statement, perhaps we should deal 
with the contents of paragraphs 97 and following. 
 
In paragraph 97, you say you conveyed the outlines of 
the proposed advanced payment plan proposed by the MEC 
20 
to the Techman Mac Meeting of October 2010.  Correct?  Did 
you do that? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   My apologies.  That is in a meeting of 
November 2010. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 99 of 130 
 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So we should change paragraph 97.  
That was on the one of the 18t h of November, is that correct? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, that was the one on November, 
18t h. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  And it was at that meeting or 
in respect of that meeting that the HOD had tendered his 
apologies.  Mr Zwane was also not there. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   After the meeting... well, at that 
10 
meeting, you have told the Chair that you were advised that 
advanced payments as contemplated by the MEC would be 
unlawful. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You have also added during the 
course of your answers that the representatives of the 
Gauteng department gave a similar warning. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   After the meeting, did you speak to 
Mr Mokoena? 
20 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, Chair.  Immediately after the 
meeting, I called Mr Mokoena. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now, or you will recall that this 
meeting is on the 18t h of November and we have not yet 
received 
Mr 
Tsoametsi’s 
memorandum 
of 
the 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 100 of 130 
 
25t h of November. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So what did you tell Mr Mokoena? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   I said to Mr Mokoena on the phone, the 
ERP has not approved.  Money is going to be taken from us. 
The 
idea 
of 
the 
Advanced 
Payment 
System 
is 
also 
discouraged unlawful.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And did you say who he should 
speak to about this? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Come again, SC? 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   When you spoke to Mr Mokoena, 
what was your expectation as to who Mr Mokoena would 
relay your information to? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Ja, my expectation was that Mr Mokoena 
will relay the information to the executing authority which is 
the MEC. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Mr Zwane. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In case we are not in... we have not 
been entirely accurate in our discussions with the witnesses 
20 
to date on the consequences of the National Department and 
Treasury’s rejection of the expenditure recovery plan.   
 
It seems that national, the National Department of 
Human Settlements and Treasury were not as it were taking 
in by the expenditure recovery plan.  Is that correct? 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 101 of 130 
 
MR MAXATSHWA:   You mean, they did not buy the idea? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Ja, the National Department did not buy 
the idea. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And deducted money anyway.   
MR MAXATSHWA:   Ja, they took R 230 million away from 
us. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Leaving over a billion rand still to be 
spent. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, Chair. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And I take it, no one had told 
National or Treasury that, we have heard this evidence, that 
you had a plan B as it were, the Advanced Payment System? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   If I may recall, there was a meeting 
with... at the Provincial Treasury. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am talking about National Treasury. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   No.  Yes, I am coming...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Oh, I am sorry. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   There was a meeting with the Provincial 
Treasury, where Mr Mokoena presented the monitoring of the 
20 
expenditure.  And in that meeting, usually have... they call 
him the CEO of Provincial Treasury but is the HOD, in 
essence, of Provincial Treasury.   
 
And because we... the department was in serious 
trouble, he did not canvas as the HOD of Treasury to say:  
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 102 of 130 
 
Yes, please accompany us to go and see the National 
Treasury in Pretoria.   
 
A meeting was arranged.  I was part of that particular 
meeting with the HOD, the then CFO, Ms Danny Hattingh and 
from the National Human Settlement there was an acting 
Treasurer.   
 
We... and then our provincial, the head of department.  
To go and talk and report.  Mr Mokoena is to report himself 
to the National Treasury in terms of what is happening.  Why 
the expenditure and the likes. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Was the proposed solution, the 
Advanced Payment System discussed at that meeting? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   It was discussed and the National 
Treasury said:  Look, we are not for the idea.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  So it was discussed.  And 
was it... were they told that you are going ahead anyway with 
the plan? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   We returned back to the province and I 
believe Mr Mokoena had discussions with the MEC.  I was 
not part of that. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, we know that it was decided to 
go ahead with the plan, nevertheless. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, that is what happened. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair, is this a convenient time?  We 
will finish shortly after the lunch adjournment. 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 103 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, that is fine.  Let us take the 
lunch adjournment and we will resume at two.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us continue. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Maxatshwa, 
can we go to paragraph 104.1 please?  On page 208 and 
209 you deal with the advance payment system, much of 
that is on record at the moment and we are really have 
your confirmation on the affidavit but there are a few 
10 
questions arising that I would like to put to you. 
 
Who chose the contractors that were to be allocated 
units to build? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   It is the MEC. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did anyone ever say to the MEC 
look, you know, that is really our job in the department, 
you know, it is an operational matter, it is not a matter for 
an MEC.  Was that issue ever raised? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Chair, it was supposed to be raised by 
the HOD. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But did he raise it? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Not as far as I know. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Well, he gave evidence yesterday, that 
is the HOD of the time, Mr Mokoena, you know, that there 
was a practice in the department which had gone for some 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 104 of 130 
 
time that the MEC, whoever the MEC was at any particular 
point in time, would be the one who would pick the 
contractors who should be given contracts.  Now you were 
in the department for a long time, do you know anything 
about such a practice? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   When I joined the department in 2009, 
especially the housing part, projects were already running 
but in preparation of the 2010/2011 there was a list that 
was signed off by MEC Mafereka which indicated that he 
had an input on it and he approved it.  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is before Mr Zwane? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Now with Mr Zwane, I saw in Mr 
Mokhesi’s affidavit where he is making reference to NM14, 
which is the list of the contractors.  At the bottom it is the 
signature of Mr Zwane and the date when it was approved.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, is that a document that you saw in 
the bundle here or is that a document that is somewhere 
else? 
20 
MR MAXATSHWA:   No, it is in the bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes as part of the annexures to his 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I did not pick that up. 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 105 of 130 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We will look at that, perhaps find it 
in the next few minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You say it is attached to the 
affidavit of? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Of Mr Mokhesi, I think it is NM14. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you very much.  At the time 
the advance payment system was being implemented - we 
have been told that there were three sets of contracts.  
The first was the contract with the contractor and we know 
10 
what it said about who was responsible for sourcing 
supplies and paying the supplier in that contract and when 
the department’s obligation to pay the contractor would 
arise.  We understand that. 
 
The second level of contract was the tripartite 
agreement, the building material, supply agreement which 
involved the supplier, the contractor and the department, 
correct? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And the third was the so-called 
20 
cession agreement where the claim or the payment for 
supplies was ceded by the contractor to the supplier.  Do 
you recall that contract? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And we know, of course, that that 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 106 of 130 
 
really – that cession was really not a valid or real cession 
because claim was not in existence at the time that 
cession was signed.  We know that.  
MR MAXATSHWA:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But interestingly you say at 
paragraph 104.3 that all the contracts were signed at the 
same time. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That is even more strange because 
you are signing a cession agreement and a supply 
10 
agreement which contradicts the contract agreement and 
the cession agreement, the cession has not even arisen.  
Did these anomalies strike anybody? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Ja, what happened, Chair, is that 
before contractors were appointed there were briefing 
sessions in terms of what is going to be unfolding in terms 
of the advance payment system.   
The MEC led that briefing sessions, they were held 
district by district, to say to contractors – we met with the 
contractors first and said to them guys, this is how we are 
20 
going to move.  You will be signed contract, you will be 
allocated houses, this is how much you have been 
allocated, each contractor.  And then you are going to sign 
an agreement with the department.  Because we are in a 
rush, you are going to sign a tripartite agreement with us 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 107 of 130 
 
and a material supplier that will be supplying you with 
material. 
You will go and conduct your own material supply in 
your own space.  For instance, if I was in Welkom, I will go 
to the Welkom building material supplier, Corobrik or 
whoever, and say look, give me a quotation, I want to go 
and sign this particular agreement. 
After 
those 
briefings, 
contractors 
were 
like 
screaming to the department to come and sign the first 
contract that allocates them work, the second contract, 
10 
tripartite and a cession agreement at the same time for this 
scheme to happen in any way. 
But I must also qualify, Chair, that all those 
particular 
instruments, 
the 
three 
instruments 
were 
a 
product of the state legal advisers on the first floor 
because they had an input into those particular contracts 
as legal gurus.   
Ours was to give them the technical thinking in 
terms of the quantities that will be there and the technical 
– what you normally call bill of quantities as to what you 
20 
need to see in the house and they will draft the contract 
and bounce them amongst themselves and finalise them 
because that was the instruction that came from a cabinet 
to say no projects will happen in the department besides 
the department bouncing all those particular contracts with 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 108 of 130 
 
the fourth floor, the fourth floor being the Premier ’s office 
in the Free State. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, there is evidence that these 
contracts did not get there, there is contradictory evidence 
that this contract did get there, but that is Mr Venter ’s 
office. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Ja, that is Mr Venter ’s office. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, there is evidence that these 
contracts never got to him. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Chairperson, I would like you to go – 
10 
maybe look at the transcript of our disciplinary hearing, 
there was somebody that testified, a lady, I happen to have 
forgotten her name, from the office of Mr Venter who came 
and testified on those particular contracts. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, we will deal with that 
evidence but they ought to have gone there for vetting. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And any lawyer who looked at this 
mess of contracts would have concluded that they cannot 
all sit together and the explanation you have given that 
20 
there was a briefing session only makes it worse because 
you have a verbal briefing session explaining one thing 
and you have three contracts that cannot live together 
explaining another system.  It does not help to have a 
briefing session where you give a verbal explanation to 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 109 of 130 
 
contractors and suppliers, how things are going to work 
and then you have a written signed contract which appears 
to be completely contradictory and none of these contracts 
can live with one another.  It is just an unacceptable mess, 
surely? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   I agree with you, Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Then let us go to paragraphs 105, 
6 and 7.  Basically, as I understand it, this collection of 
contracts, the writing, the written contracts are used to 
justify payments, not the verbal side agreements. 
10 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 110, what do you say 
there?  Sorry, perhaps we had better place on record what 
you say in paragraph 109 because that concerns you and 
your evidence.  Did you ever sign any of the contracts 
which form part of the advance payment system? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   No, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you ever collate all these 
contracts and place them on the HSS system, the housing 
subsidy system? 
20 
MR MAXATSHWA:   No, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That is an electronic subsystem is 
it not? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And in fact that system, which was 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 110 of 130 
 
picked up by the National Treasury or the National 
Department CFO to learn that advance payments were 
being made, is it not? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   That is the system we are referring to. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And did you ever hand any 
contracts or invoices to the financial department for 
processing and payment? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   No, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   When did you become aware, as 
you say in paragraph 110, that despite the fact that these 
10 
payments were made on this collection, to put it politely, of 
contracts that materials were in fact never supplied by the 
time payments were made.  What are you saying there? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Chair, as you move around in 
monitoring through your site meetings, sometimes you will 
see that nothing is happening on site.  But this contractor, 
when you look into the HSS, he has been paid, material 
supply has been paid, you asked yourself but how is it 
happening 
that 
there 
is 
no 
material, 
there 
is 
no 
construction on site?  As you were sitting in the war room, 
20 
we were monitoring everybody’s performance by simply 
taking a phone and calling that particular contractor to say 
what is happening, are you on site?   
The contractor will tell you many stories.  No, I 
have not received a material wadda, wadda and the 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 111 of 130 
 
material supplier has got my money and I am still waiting.  
Mostly they were complaining Corobrik has not come to us 
and we are last on the list and stuff like that.  Then you 
know that material has not been supplied and payment has 
been advanced already. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You say this information came to 
the knowledge of the war room whilst the advance payment 
system was being put into place? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So it must have been apparent to 
10 
those officials including senior officials and Mr Zwane that 
the system was not working. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   It was because there were reports 
generated by the war room. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But then why was it not stopped?  I 
mean, you have a system, you are told it is illegal, you 
know it is illegal, you nevertheless – and I am talking you 
in plural not your personally, one has a system, one is told 
it is illegal, one begins to implement the system, one sees 
that the system is not working, you are paying money and 
20 
no houses are being built because there is no delivery of 
materials, why was it not stopped? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Because the MEC believed that it will 
work. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But he knew it was not working. 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 112 of 130 
 
MR MAXATSHWA:   He knew it was not working because of 
the reports. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   On that note let us look at FS14 if 
you would.  Thank you for drawing this to our attention.  
Perhaps you should come join our team. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   It will be my pleasure, SC. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you look at page 223, what is 
this document? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me get there first.  223 you said? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, I have got it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   FS14.  What is this document? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   It is a list of contractors and the 
allocations and the areas where the contractors were 
allocated. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, so there are two elements 
that are put into this document.  One, the identity of the 
contractors who are going to receive contracts or who have 
received contracts, correct? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Correct. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   As well as the number of units that 
they have been allocated to build. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And, of course, the areas from 
which they come. 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 113 of 130 
 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you look at page 225 you will 
see there a signature.  Do you recognise that signature? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   That is the signature of MEC Zwane.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right and it is dated the 10 
September 2010. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Oh, that is page 225 of 
bundle FS14, so that is the signature appearing next to the 
date 10/09/2010. 
10 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is Mr Zwane’s signature. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and you know it well? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Would go to paragraph 116 please? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Paragraph of page? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Oh, I am sorry, Chair, back to 
bundle FS12. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Page 212. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You have paragraph 116? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, Chair. 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 114 of 130 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You say in that paragraph: 
“According to my recollection the advance payment 
system was not stopped in February 2011 by Mr 
Mokoena as accounting officer of the Department of 
Human Settlements despite a meeting which he, the 
MEC, Mr Zwane, the Chief Financial Officer of the 
Free State Province and Mr Tsoametsi had with the 
National Department.” 
Let us begin with the meeting.  What meeting are you 
referring to there? 
10 
MR MAXATSHWA:   It is the meeting between Minister 
Sexwale and the MEC and HOD and all those that are 
reflected there, the CFO and Mr Tsoametsi.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And were you at that meeting? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   I was not in that meeting. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   How do you know what happened 
at that meeting? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Mr Mokoena came and briefed us. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, what did he say to you? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Mr Mokoena said Mr Sexwale advised 
20 
them that the scheme that they were implementing was 
unlawful and they must stop it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  Now Mr Mokoena’s 
evidence is that he in fact took steps to stop it.  Do you 
know anything about that? 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 115 of 130 
 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Chair, there should have been an 
instruction to the CFO but I do not remember it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, do you know whether there 
was any instruction to the CFO in pursuance of this 
instruction given by the National Minister? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   No, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do you know whether payments 
continued? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, Chair, I know because on the HSS 
system they were still running, those particular payments. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, did you see the evidence of 
the payments being made? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Well …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You say it was on the HSS system 
that payments were being made, what did you see on the 
HSS system?  How did you come to learn of this and what 
did you do about it? 
MR MAXATSHWA:    I had the viewing rights of what is 
happening on the HSS then I will go and view and check 
what is happening on the HSS.  
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, do you know whether these 
payments were made to suppliers in advance? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, Chair, I know that payments were 
made to the suppliers in advance because they will come 
knocking at my door and say look, we are waiting for your 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 116 of 130 
 
contractors to come and collect their material, we have 
been paid. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So if one wanted to verify your 
evidence and understand whether the evidence of Mr 
Mokoena and Mr Mokhesi was correct one could go to the 
HSS system and see the payments listed there. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Exactly, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And that would give one enough 
information to determine that these were indeed advance 
payment system payments being made after February 2011. 
10 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Ja, they will be captured by dates. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Would it be an answer to say well, 
these payments were made in terms of obligation which 
had arisen prior to February 2011 when we were just 
clearing out the system, but we entered into no new 
agreements after Feb? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Chair, that – I will not say precisely it 
was - information was entered via the new contractual 
obligations because, I mean, money was spent prior and 
there was a system overload, people – the information was 
20 
still being captured as we move along. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, that may be a technical 
explanation for it or a computer-based information or a 
database explanation but I do not intend to suggest to you 
that when a decision is made to stop and an instruction is 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 117 of 130 
 
given to stop payments that they should not be stopped, 
the contracts were unlawful, anyway, so there was no 
reason to continue paying just because an agreement had 
been signed before February.  So I am not suggesting it 
was but there are two situations that could have arisen 
here.  One – well, let me put it to you this way.   
The first is that these were merely the processing of 
payments agreed to before February, not excusable, in our 
submissions to the Chair eventually, but nevertheless an 
explanation, however unsatisfactory.  
10 
 
The other is that even after February new contracts 
were being entered into for advance payments.  Do you 
know whether that happened? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Chair, that will be the point to be 
investigated because if you capture something by the date, 
all the documents that you are capturing will have a 
reflected date when they were signed. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, okay. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So that information into which 
20 
category it falls would be available on the HSS system. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Ja, you will have the HSS system 
reflecting the dates, then you will go to those payment 
advices and the supporting documents to determine exactly 
when the document was signed and submitted because 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 118 of 130 
 
there will also be a stamp on them. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  Well, we will have to look at 
that.  Thank you for that.  I just want to put to you FS12 at 
page 450, if you would go there, please.  This is the 
statement of Mr Bertus Venter, the legal adviser who lives 
on the fourth floor, as you mentioned.  Correct? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   FS12? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Page 450. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   450.  Chair, I do not have – oh, 450.  
My apologies, Chair, I was looking at FS14, sorry. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you could go to 450, it is that 
bundle, please. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   I am at 450. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, this is a page from the 
affidavit presented to the Commission by Mr Venter who is 
a legal adviser in the Office of the Premier Free State, is 
that correct?  Well, I am …[intervenes] 
MR MAXATSHWA:   I am only seeing it now, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, well you can accept what I am 
saying, you can trust me on that. 
20 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Thank you, Chair, I am taking your 
word, SC. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, I want to put to you 
what is in paragraph 7.  If you take issue with that you can 
check whether it is actually his affidavit or not but in 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 119 of 130 
 
paragraph 7 on page 450 of FS12 Mr Venter says the 
following.  He says and I quote: 
“Neither me nor any of the other state law advisers 
in the office of the Premier was involved in any of 
the processes when the initial transfer of money to 
building materials suppliers took place.  No one in 
the office of the Premier provided a legal opinion on 
the issue of the initial transfer of the money to the 
building material suppliers and we were never 
requested to do so.  I have no idea why the state 
10 
law advisers in the office of the Premier was...” 
I read it as it is. 
“...was not involved by the Department of Human 
Settlements.” 
Now 
I 
understand 
it 
would 
not 
have 
been 
your 
responsibility to make sure that this was done but were you 
aware of a requirement that the Premier actually put in 
place that contracts should actually be submitted to the 
office of the Premier, legal advisers? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes, Chair, I was aware.  There was a 
20 
letter 
written 
by 
the 
former 
DG 
of 
the 
Free 
State 
Government, Dr [indistinct] 29.08 to all HODs instructing 
them to go this route of bouncing all the contract legal 
documents with the state law advisers. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And if that directive was not 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 120 of 130 
 
obeyed and deliberately not obeyed, it was a serious 
omission, you would agree with that? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Chair, as I have mentioned, in terms of 
my recollection, the lady that came from the state law 
advisers to come and testify during our disciplinary hearing 
came because we were questioning their involvement on all 
those legal instruments. They will not even have come to a 
disciplinary hearing if they were not involved 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well we can look at the transcript 
of 
the 
disciplinary 
hearing 
and 
make 
the 
necessary 
10 
submissions or deal with it in later evidence, but it is not 
matters 
directly 
within 
your 
knowledge, 
although 
it 
seriously affected the outcome of your disciplinary hearing. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Is there anything else Mr 
Maxatshwa that we have not dealt with that you would like 
to tell the Chair about, in relation to the matters we have 
dealt with today? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes Chair.  If granted an opportunity  
Chair my first issue will be to call for your assistance in 
20 
terms of finalisation of our disciplinary hearing.  This 
matter has taken toll on I am not saying – sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you want to drink water.    
MR MAXATSHWA:   Chair when we began this road seven 
years ago, there were six of us, selectively charged 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 121 of 130 
 
unfairly.   In the process of travelling this road and trying 
to get justice we lost one of our colleagues.   Maybe when 
you read the transcript you will hear the name, you will 
come across the name of Vushi Magotsi [?].   He 
unfortunately succumbed to depression and the pressures 
of this whole exercise of us getting purged by those that 
have powers to do so on our lives.   
 
Even today as we sit, we still getting that unfair 
treatment, not to finalise this matter as speedily as we can 
so that we can move on with our lives.  From my own 
10 
experience I have tried several times to get work, but the 
mere fact that there is this thing hanging on your career 
you won’t get anywhere.    
 
So we are pleading with the Commission to if they 
can, if the Commission can assist us. 
 
We are also pleading with the Commission Chair 
that 
necessary 
documents 
to 
exercise 
our 
rights 
be 
availed.  I have mentioned when we started that we never 
had a clue of Open Waters Report or Preliminary Report as 
purported in Mr Mokhesi’s affidavit, why were we charged.  
20 
If you needed an answer to various questions that he had 
about anything in the department we had to explain to him, 
we will not even run away.   
 
I understand from his affidavit that we never came 
to assist him.  The very same day he decided to suspend 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 122 of 130 
 
us, the Friday he gave us the letters, which gagged us not 
to talk to anyone unless he takes his phone or he writes to 
us to say so and so will come and consult with you, give 
him a hearing.  We were never contacted, he never 
attended as a person that believed that there were 
wrongdoings, he never even attended the disciplinary 
hearing.   Junior officials were sent there to go and 
understand what is happening, who had note what was 
happening.    
 
Even during the road we said we are still here, can 
10 
we sit down and amicably settle this particular matter, 
because now we have realised after six years down the line 
that he has submitted his affidavit in trying to recover the 
man and he clearly identifies who is responsible for design 
approval of the system that was there, which means wait a 
bietjie, time to see that we are not in the wrong, as to Mr 
Mokoena if you look at the transcript what he said in his 
affidavit this week that was submitted to the Commission is 
total contradiction of what he said during the disciplinary 
hearing.   He totally denied responsibility of the system, 
20 
whereas 
documents 
are 
there, 
he 
approved 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
system, 
the 
memo, 
he 
also 
instructed and participated in the war room and the Chief 
Accounting Officer of the department he could not spread 
the accounting to all of us, we will be there to assist him 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 123 of 130 
 
and to say, point him in the right direction, no this cannot 
be done, this cannot be done, but the responsibility to 
make a final decision rest with him in terms of all the 
legislative framework. 
 
Chair I saw which other colleagues came here with 
our matter having been solved so that I can place all the 
documents and the decision reached by the forum that we 
are in now, which is the CCMA, it was – the entire process 
has cost us even our pensions are over now, we are owing 
our lawyers on the labour matter.  We cannot even move 
10 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you represented by lawyers in your 
CCMA matter?  
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the explanation they give you for 
the matter to take so long, is the CCMA’s an organisation 
that is required to deal with disputes expeditiously and you 
are supposed to refer your dismissal dispute to the CCMA 
within 30 days of  your dismissal because it is looked at as 
some matter that should be dealt with expeditiously.  Now 
20 
if you talk about six years, seven years, eight years of 
such a matter not being finalised, especially when you talk 
of the matter not even having reached the stage of oral 
evidence it seems just too long.  Sometimes these matters 
can take as long as this in circumstances where there has 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 124 of 130 
 
been a trial, there has been an arbitration but whoever has 
lost in the arbitration has taken the matter on review and 
there are appeals to various courts.  Sometimes the 
appeals go up to the Constitutional Court so it takes, it can 
take a long time, a number of years when it is that 
situation but you said that the matter has not even reached 
a point where oral evidence has been led and that does 
make the delay  very, very long to me. 
 
What explanation do they give you, your own 
lawyers because they are supposed to know, they are the 
10 
ones who are supposed to pressurise the CCMA, to 
allocate the matter a date.  What explanation do they give 
you when you say what’s holding things back? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Firstly it was the appointment of 
Commissioners.   You will get a Commissioner appointed 
on a matter, but seeing the vastness of the evidence that 
he must deal with he will then say no I am not take this 
particular case, that is on the brink, on the brink of you 
hearing the matter you are going to sit down on the matter, 
there will be a recusal of the Commissioner. I think we had 
20 
if I am not mistaken three or four of such incidences.  The 
last incident that we had Chair was when we reached an 
agreement with the employer party to say now that  you are 
reviewing the scheme which you should have done and 
declared it unlawful before you charged us, can we wait for 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 125 of 130 
 
the matter to be finalised and it took forever for the matter 
to be finalised.   And then we came back and said no this 
is not working for us, can we now go back to the CCMA and 
say let us continue and then we continue.  This one 
commissioner came there; it was during November he says 
hey your matter is too complicated.  We asked him look 
take all the documents, the evidence that has been 
collected because I mean going back to call again all the 
witnesses, taking 33 days or 50 day is going to cost us 
money and it is going to cost the employer money.  Some 
10 
of the witnesses aren’t even there.   Mr ...[indistinct] 
passed away, Ms Figi Magaza passed away so if we need 
to use those particular individuals how are we going to 
cross the river. 
 
After three months he came back and said I want to 
hear the matter afresh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, well I suspect there may be a lot of 
things that may have happened which led to the matter 
being wherever it is now. 
 
Since you are represented by lawyers I think that 
20 
the first thing would be to get a proper explanation from 
the lawyers, have they given you anything in writing that 
sets out exactly what has been happened over the past 
seven/eight years, all these pages? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Yes Chair we ...[intervenes]  
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 126 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   There is such a document? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   There is such a document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you got it here by any chance? 
MR MAXATSHWA:   No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is at home?  
MR MAXATSHWA:   It is at home, we can avail it to the 
Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you see if you are represented by 
lawyers I am not sure that the Commission could not do 
much but I leave that to Mr Pretorius and his team but 
10 
again it is not the job of the Commission but it might not 
harm to find out what is happening. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Certainly Chair, the matter should 
be referred to the head office of the CCMA, where 
arrangements can be made for special appointments. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, for example I would have expected 
that your lawyers if they were unhappy with the Provincial 
leadership of the CCMA in expediting the matter I would 
have expected them to escalate your concerns to the 
National Office of the CCMA, but I speak without knowing, 
20 
maybe they have done all of those things, so I think I will 
leave the matter on the basis that you will talk to Mr 
Pretorius and he will make his judgment call about what if 
anything the team can do about. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, there is a second issue that 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 127 of 130 
 
may be relevant to the Commission’s work and that is 
whether there is any link between the officials in the Free 
State and the delays in the CCMA, it may be worth 
investigating. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  The last thing I wanted to say Mr 
Maxatshwa in regard to this matter is that it is quite 
concerning that a lot of money that had been set aside for 
the purposes of building houses for people seems to have 
ended up in various – in the hands of various suppliers and 
maybe contractors, more than R500million I think I was told 
10 
by Mr Moketsi and yet no houses were built in regard to 
that particular allocation for that financial year, 2010 to 
2011 and the money should have benefitted ordinary 
people, they should have got house but they didn’t get any 
houses and yet government had set aside a huge amount 
of money, R1.3billion, it is very concerning, because a 
government is there to ensure that the people get the 
services they need. 
 
Now it is not just this matter where I am hearing 
this kind of evidence, where a lot of money has been set 
20 
aside for things to be done that would benefit people but 
the money ends up with other people and the people who 
are supposed to have benefitted from that money or what 
was to be used, what that money was to be used for do not 
get anything.    
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 128 of 130 
 
 
Within the context of the Free State I heard a few 
weeks ago evidence relating to what we have termed the 
asbestos project where the documents that were issued by 
the Department of Human Settlements, same department, 
indicated that they were giving a contract to a certain joint 
venture in order to ultimately remove asbestos from the 
roofs of various houses because it is dangerous and so on.  
I heard evidence that the job could have been done with 
R21million 
but 
the 
Provincial 
Government 
gave 
this 
particular joint venture about R250million for a R21million 
10 
job. 
 
On the evidence I have heard so far there is very 
little, if any work that the joint venture did, it just got sub-
contractors, actually the second – the first sub-contractor 
also did not do any job, only the third sub-contractor did 
the job.  The joint venture and the first sub-contractor just 
pocketed the money but to make it worse there was no 
removal of asbestos from the roofs of the houses of 
people.  There was simply the counting of houses that 
happened. 
20 
 
Leave that aside.  I have heard evidence about 
what has been referred to as the Vrede Dairy Farm, the 
Estina Project, that is well known.   A project that was 
meant to be benefit a lot of black farmers, people who 
wanted to do farming to earn a living, there too the people 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 129 of 130 
 
who were supposed to be beneficiaries, to benefit from that 
project I heard evidence that they never got anything and 
yet millions and millions and grants were paid out by the 
government, Free State Provincial Government, and that 
money ended in the hands of other people and the real 
people who were supposed to benefit did not get anything.  
It is very concerning.   
 
This does not necessarily mean the Free State 
Provincial Government was the worst, because we have not 
had 
evidence 
from 
other 
provinces 
and 
how 
other 
10 
Provincial Governments worked and we will not because 
that kind of job needs years to do, so we will not know but 
my own thinking is that if one went around the provinces 
one would find a lot of projects where money that was 
supposed to benefit ordinary people ends up in the pockets 
of some people and the ordinary people gets nothing.  It is 
very worrying. 
 
So I am just mentioning that, that as I hear all of 
this evidence here is something that troubles me quite a 
lot, because the people who were supposed to be taken 
20 
care of end up receiving no benefits and yet their money 
because it is taxpayers money, gets paid to other people. 
 
I just – Mr Maxatshwa you might not be able to say 
anything and I am not inviting you to say anything, I am 
just saying that it is most frustrating to hear what I hear in 
23 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 270 
 
Page 130 of 130 
 
this Commission and there seems to be no indications that 
it is slowing down, instead it looks like there’s some people 
who say they don’t care, they will also get their fair share. 
 
We 
will 
call 
you 
if 
we 
need 
you 
again 
Mr 
Maxatshwa, thank you very much for coming to give 
evidence.   You are now excused. 
MR MAXATSHWA:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Pretorius, is that the end of, the last 
of your witnesses for today? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes Chair, and we will resume, by 
10 
your leave, ten o’clock on Friday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and who is your witness, or who 
are your witnesses on Friday? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well that’s a matter still to be 
finally determined but the very least Mr Zwane will be 
present. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  We are going to adjourn for 
the day and we will resume on Friday at ten o’clock. 
 
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise.
