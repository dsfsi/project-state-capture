procedural issue.  I noticed that Mr Hofmeyr has some files.

Page 4 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So that is why all of these processes have not 
been managed to be done yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But she has just been handed copies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Alright.  Thank you.  Then you can switch 
off your microphone Ms Mbanjwa.  Thank you.  Yes okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  We had concluded matters on 
Friday with the beginning of the role that you played in relation to the 
sale of the GPU’s. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr I just wanted to say to Ms Memela.  I am 
sure you feel much more comfortable today with your lawyer here. 
MS MEMELA:  I do Chair.  I know that it was stated that I am a lawyer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  But of course as much as I am a lawyer I am a human 
being. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  Certain things like touch your emotions and you end up 
maybe reacting irrationally. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  So I am happy that my lawyer is here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No that is fine.  Thank you.  Yes.  Oh please 
come this side if you want to say something Ms Memela.   
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Chair I just need to be guided as to 
procedure. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 5 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    H’mm. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Because in a normal court. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  If a statement is put to the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Which a legal representative is of the 
view that it is not factually correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  There would be an objection.  But I do not 
want to keep interjecting. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  So I propose the following. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  A statement will be put to the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Which I believe is factually incorrect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  By then I will wait my turn.  Like for 
instance now the statement that has been put to say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
20 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  The conclusion was about the role Ms 
Memela played in the GPU’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  There will be an objection to that but I am 
proposing that when I keep quiet it is not that we accept those 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 6 of 216 
 
statements but we will just at the end of the proceedings of Mr Hofmeyr 
interject. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no you do not object necessarily because 
what is being put to the witness is not factually correct because the 
witness will point that out, that it is not true.  Of course there could be 
something if for example there is a factual assumption on which the 
question is based there where you could point that out. But most of the 
time it is matters that really can be clarified during re-examination.  So 
if you do not say anything I will not assume that you agree. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  I am guided by you, thank you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela if we could pick up your evidence at 
page 5 of Exhibit DD25A.  It contains your statement.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Ms Mbanjwa I just want to say for what it is 
worthwhile you must feel free to protect your client’s rights as much as 
possible and where necessary object I can assure you that over the 
past one and a half years or so since this Commission started hearing – 
having hearings and hearing evidence there have been a lot of lawyers 
who have represented witnesses and implicated persons and it is 
difficult to remember people who have objected a lot.  I think there is 
20 
only one that I can remember who objected quite a lot.  I think a lot of 
people find that there is an attempt to be as fair as possible.  But that 
is not to say when you think there is reason to object you must not.  
But I am just saying that mostly I think most lawyers you know seem to 
feel that questions that are being asked are fair and so on. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 7 of 216 
 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  No Chairperson – I do not know about the 
questions because I …(indistinct, not speaking into the microphone). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  I can only say we have full confidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  In the Chairperson ...(indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  But sometimes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  It can be. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no that is fine.  No when you feel that there is 
something and you feel it is something serious feel free to object.  
Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Memela I wanted to pick 
it up at paragraph 15 on page 5 because there you start to talk about 
the role that JM Aviation played in relation to the sale of the GPU’s.  
And if I can pick it up in the middle of that paragraph 15 you say there 
in your statement: 
“From SAAT side JM Aviation never mentioned that 
they would be reselling the GPU’s to Swissport.” 
20 
What we understood during the discussion was that they were 
buying them from SAAT as the Swissport BEE Company to cover the 
30% set aside mandate by SAA to all suppliers.  Do you see that? 
MS MEMELA:  I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Does that remain consistent with your account 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 8 of 216 
 
of the events? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay remember on this paragraph I was talking about 
Open Water how they have investigated this whole transaction 
Chairperson in terms of like them coming out or maybe reaching the 
conclusion that the GPU’s were sold below market value.  So what I 
was trying to highlight was the fact that as much as I was not involved 
in the decision making and all they did not test the market nor have 
they shown anything that showed that it was supposed to be this much.  
You know instead they relied on the agreement or maybe the 
arrangement between JM and Swissport in terms of like reselling each 
10 
other the GPU’s which is not to our possession or maybe SAAT’s 
possession they only know that.  So I was coming from that angle. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  Of course I do not remember during the discussion Ms 
Hofmeyr where a JM representative said they were going to resell to 
Swissport.  When we discussed they were talking about okay they have 
learnt that the Swissport and SAA contract has been signed.  And they 
have made a proposal to the acting CEO at that time and then from that 
they wanted to negotiate and see a way forward.  So whatever that they 
had agreed upon with Swissport it did not really include SAAT because 
20 
like now it was already out of SAAT’s hands.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Ms Memela. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay Ms Hofmeyr I did not want to disturb you but 
when you indicated what page I was trying to get a pen. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies Chair. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 9 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what page are we ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We are at page 5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And paragraph 15. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela the part that I was actually 
interested in your statement is when you said what you understood in 
the last sentence.  You said: 
“What we understood during the discussion” 
This is the discussion with JM Aviation.  Was that they were 
10 
buying the GPU’s from SAAT as the Swissport BEE Company and I 
place emphasis now on the part that I am interested in “to cover the 
30% set aside mandate by SAA to all suppliers.” 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Was that your understanding at the time? 
MS MEMELA:  At the time that was the understanding and remember I 
did mention on Friday Chair that the 30% set aside it was something 
that was put on the table by the then Chairperson of SAA and I think 
the Board because maybe she was not acting alone.  And I have in my 
capacity never ever applied that in terms of like I mean for SAAT 
20 
contracts you know.  So that is why I am saying maybe in the Swissport 
contract which you have seen and you have directed me to on Friday 
that maybe they were – the reason why maybe the amount from what 
we like SAAT had sold the GPU’s for it went up when these guys sold it 
to Swissport because of maybe a certain arrangement with regard to 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 10 of 216 
 
30%.  That was our assumption. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  And you evidence on Friday was that 
you, yourself regarded the 30% set aside as unlawful, is that right? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  That is why it was not applied at SAAT.  Remember 
I am talking on behalf of SAAT not SAA. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  So when you started engaging with JM 
Aviation with the understanding that they were playing a role because 
of the 30% set aside mandate did you raise with anyone that you should 
not be dealing with them because the 30% set aside mandate was 
unlawful? 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Okay can I understand the question again like 
…(intervenes)? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Certainly.  Your evidence on Friday was that 
your view was that the 30% set aside mandate of the SAA Board was 
unlawful, correct? 
MS MEMELA:  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then you indicated that your understanding 
at the time of your interactions with JM Aviation was that they were 
playing the role of the Swissport BEE Company pursuant to the 30% 
mandate, is that correct? 
20 
MS MEMELA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then my question was, well if you regarded 
the 30% mandate as unlawful did you at any point in your interactions 
with JM Aviation about the sale of the SAAT GPU’s raise with anyone 
that you should not be dealing with them because the 30% mandate 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 11 of 216 
 
was unlawful? 
MS MEMELA:  Chair the role that SAAT played there was absolute 
nothing that could maybe nullify the decision that had already been 
made by SAA Board or maybe SAA Procurement.  Because remember 
the decision had already been made there.  So the only role that SAAT 
played was the selling of the disposal of these DPU’s as to the Board’s 
mandate.  Now just to give clarity in terms of why I said like the 
understanding may have been they relied on the 30% set aside.  I told 
you Chair that on Friday Open Water had never given me or anybody 
else who was involved in this transaction a chance to state their side of 
10 
the story because I promise now like I would not be sitting here if it 
was – like they had given me that opportunity because I would have 
explained to them that – in fact we found out in 2017 that JM has sent 
– has sold the GPU’s to Swissport and then now Open Water is relying 
on the amount that this – the GPU’s were sold for.  And how I find out 
Chair because I thought I will get this opportunity to state that.  How I 
find out I found out through the media.  I had not even seen the report 
that time and that is why if you heard Friday as much as I was not 
directing that point to Ms Hofmeyr because I know she is not acting 
person – like I mean personal towards me on this thing she is on a 
20 
mission – a fact finding mission.  At that time I felt that this whole GPU 
thing was a way of getting to me in terms of the – because of the 
person that I am. Because of what I was fighting for at that time which 
of course had nothing to do with the GPU’s.  So I learnt about the 
GPU’s being sold to Swissport only in 2017. Remember the Board 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 12 of 216 
 
awarded this in 2016 and then I was instructed with my other 
colleagues to negotiate in 2016.  But I found out that they were sold to 
Swissport in 2017 when I read the Sunday Independent.  The article 
was written by Steve Motale and specifically crafted to paint to the 
public that Advocate Memela has been involved in the sale of GPU’s.  
And of course Chair when the public reads they think I have ran with 
the whole process from the beginning like as I said this thing started 
from SAA and I was not part of SAA negotiations.  And it went to the 
Board of SAAT.  I was not part of – I was not a Member of the Board of 
SAAT I only joined – I only joined the meeting through an invite.  So the 
10 
way it was – the article was written it was written to paint a picture to 
the public that SAAT had lost these assets and then money on each – 
based on Advocate Memela’s involvement.  And then when I had to now 
explain to – during the disciplinary hearing to Advocate Cassiem and 
also to CCMA that is when it all started getting clear to everybody that 
actually Advocate Memela only started getting involved at the end of it 
all.  You understand.  Like I mean Chair I am just a small fish.  I am not 
above the Board.  I am not above the CEO.  The Board is the 
accounting authority of SAAT.  CEO is accounting officer of SAAT.  But 
if you notice from 2017 like from the media everything has been talking 
20 
about Advocate Memela’s involvement and stuff as if I was the one who 
was initiating this whole thing.  And when I sat with the Team, the 
Commission’s Team, I remember Andrew – Mr Kurland kept on saying it 
was in the media.  You know and I became worried again that okay it 
looks like we are going to go back again to Mr Steven Motale’s version 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 13 of 216 
 
of – I mean painting the picture to the public that this is the person who 
is responsible, who was involved in the decision making of this whole 
thing.  Nobody is interested in the Board Resolution.  Nobody is 
interested Chair in the discussion from SAA from the time when they 
discussed about offering five-year period contract that was mentioned 
by Ms Hofmeyr on Friday to Swissport.  And then like included the 
provision there that talked about the GPU’s and the BEE Company no 
one is looking at the fact that there was a list of people there.  Top – 
top people and then from the Board of SAA they had decided on the 
issue of Swissport and GPU’s and then it went to the Board of SAAT.  
10 
They decided on the issue of GPU’s and in fact on the issue of 
dissolving disposal of the GPU’s.  But the focus is on Nontsasa Memela 
because of the – the painted version that okay Nontsasa Memela knows 
JM this way because of that and that.  So I am glad that this question 
is raised this morning so that we will be able to give that clarity and 
stuff.  But like for me I thought Chair of course as much as I am – it is 
relevant to bring me here so that I give my own version.  But I thought 
from 2017 this thing has been following the person who has never taken 
a decision about it.  It has followed a person where I was not even 
involved in the discussion about Swissport you know.  But – because 
20 
there is this link between JM and Nontsasa and Nontsasa being the 
HOD SEM of SAAT.  So like the link is continuously it is being created.  
Ja.  So I am saying Chair then when I got to know about the reselling 
by JM to Swissport I got to know about it through the media.  So like 
my statement made here it does not mean that okay we knew at that 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 14 of 216 
 
time that they were going to resell.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well that answer may have been important for you to 
give a full picture but you need to go back to Ms Hofmeyr’s question.  It 
may be that that answer seeks indirectly to give the answer to the 
question.  The question was whether you ever raised the issue of 
saying you ever said to the people who were involved here but – or to 
JM whether you ever said but 30% set aside is unlawful.  You know it 
should not be done.  
MS MEMELA:  Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was the question ja. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Okay Chair I tend to talk a lot giving the background. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  I apologise for that.   But I think the point that I was 
trying to make Ms Hofmeyr is that at that remember as I have said in 
my statement we did not know there was going to be resale like from 
buying from SAAT. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  To the sale – to Swissport. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  So of course the 30% set aside issue was not raised at 
20 
that time.  Ja and we thought maybe them going to – remember Supply 
Development Ms Hofmeyr it does apply to BEE Companies given the 
sub-contracting kind of work from this multinational or maybe these 
giant companies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 15 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:  So it could have been maybe when they buy the GPU’s 
from SAAT they were going to maybe operate them like for what SAAT 
purpose they were bought for.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Like only half of Swissport.  So that was the 
understanding at that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  So it was the 30% set aside issue was never raised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There may be times when I will restrict you. 
MS MEMELA: Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your lawyer will know what areas we might 
clarification at re-examination stage. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But let us continue. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So with your understanding that JM Aviation 
was acting as the agent for Swissport in the procuring of the GPU’s? 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Ms Hofmeyr we do not – Chair we do not call BEE 
suppliers agents.  The correct wording is SMME’s or Small Black 
Owned Companies.  Agent is something else.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja so that our understanding was that then because Mr 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 16 of 216 
 
Ndzeku at that time was the Director of Swissport and it appeared that 
they had – he had joint ventures with Mr Jules Aires who has been the 
supplier of SAAT since 199.  And I want to mention again Chair before 
you restrict me I am not going to take long.  My understanding just like 
from Ms Hofmeyr’s questions on the Swissport contract on Friday that it 
appeared to me in fact as much as I complained that I – why should I 
answer something about Swissport but it gave me light on something.  
But Mr Vuyo Ndzeku did not start operating or maybe having a business 
with – between himself and SAA.  He has been on business between 
SAA and – like I mean through Swissport for as far as back in 2012 
10 
before I joined SAAT.  I may have known him during the Road Show but 
he has known SAA long time, long before me.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So just for a point of clarification.  When you 
were dealing with JM Aviation about the sale of the SAAT GPU’s did 
you know that Mr Ndzeku was a Director of Swissport South Africa at 
the time? 
MS MEMELA:  He had mentioned I think during our discussions I mean 
you know I did mention to you that after that Road Show. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Like we had talked a lot. Like I mean to an extent where 
we talked about other things that had nothing to do with SAAT. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  So he did. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 17 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  But like on Friday when you were talking about that I 
had forgotten. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No that it is fine. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is helpful for us to know. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That you were aware of that. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The reason why I asked about the role of JM 
Aviation as an agent is because the actual clause of the Swissport SAA 
agreement that you were implementing as SAAT in the sale of the 
GPU’s does not refer to any entities other than SAA and Swissport.   
MS MEMELA:  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You will recall I will just read it to you.  If you 
want to go to it I can give you the reference. 
MS MEMELA:  No I understand. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I just want to read it into the record. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It says: 
“The Handling Company that is Swissport as defined 
in the agreement agrees to purchase and or arrange 
the purchase ...(intervenes).” 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Just to remind Ms Hofmeyr that 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 18 of 216 
 
...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh sorry Chair.  I understand from the 
transcribers that when Ms Mbanjwa makes an objection she needs to 
come to the podium. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because otherwise it will not be caught. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja.  What you can do for the future Ms Mbanjwa to 
raise your hand then I will know that you wish to say something then 
you can come to the podium. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Thank you that will be helpful Chair.  It is 
10 
not an objection Chair I just wanted to remind Ms Hofmeyr that if she 
can please give the page references. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  When she reads. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For your assistance. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think she probably – she was going to give I am 
sure. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  Of course I was just indicating 
whether Ms Memela wanted to find the page. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then I was going to indicate for the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Where we were. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 19 of 216 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I am reading from Exhibit DD25A at page 316.  
That is the page that contains clause 8.2 of the SAA/Swissport 
Agreement.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And we had looked on Friday at the provisions 
of clause 8.2.  It reads as follows: 
“The Handling Company” 
And I pause there just to assist that is Swissport under the 
agreement. 
“Agrees to purchase and or arrange purchase of all 
10 
recently acquired surplus SAAT GPU’s at current 
book value, fair market value or other such valuation 
as mutually agreed.” 
Do you see that Ms Memela? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  Can I ask Chair for Ms Hofmeyr to read from 8.1 
as well? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Certainly 8.1 says: 
“As part of the continuous improvement of its B-
BBEE and promoting the government’s development 
agenda the handling company that is Swissport will 
20 
sub-contract some of its services or enter into 
agreements with 51% Black Owned Companies that 
have the representation of all or either of women, 
youth, disabled persons and military veterans for the 
purchase of equipment required as part of its 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 20 of 216 
 
investments to this agreement.” 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then it goes on at 8.2. 
MS MEMELA:  Good. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And my question was, when you were dealing 
with JM Aviation you indicated you did not regard them as Swissport’s 
agent, correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So in a provision like 8.2 that says the sale is 
going to happen between SAAT and Swissport how does JM Aviation 
10 
enter the terrain then at all? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay I understand that you have the e-mail from Ms 
Jules Aires to Mr Malola-Phiri, do you have that? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes we do indeed. 
MS MEMELA:  Can you direct – yes – can you direct me to that 
because I want to read it for the court. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Certainly just before we go there what I am 
interested in is your understanding of the provision? 
MS MEMELA:  I need ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So if you would like to go to the e-mail for that 
20 
purpose I am happy to direct you? 
MS MEMELA:  I am going there for that purpose.  Thanks Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  If it might take time to find your junior could look for 
it. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 21 of 216 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you deal with other questions. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I think we will need to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And come back to it later. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh no.  It is alright I have it in front of me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I just sometimes have to remind myself which 
of the two bundles we are in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You will find it in Exhibit DD25B at 607. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  607.  Oh the additional file?  Is it the additional? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes it is in the B file.  Indeed.  DD25B at page 
607. 
MS MEMELA:  I got it Chair.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. So just to remind you the question 
was, in what role did you understand or in what capacity did you 
understand JM Aviation was interacting with SAAT insofar as the sale of 
the GPU’s was concerned when the only agreement was between 
Swissport and SAA for the purchase of the GPU’s? 
MS MEMELA:  Is it just me or your question has just changed?  Or 
20 
maybe the wording has changed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I do not always – I do not have the ability to 
repeat exactly the words I used 10 minutes ago. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So I am trying to just convey the essence of 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 22 of 216 
 
the question.   
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So that when you draw us to the e-mail at page 
607 you understand the background from which I have asked the 
question. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Would you like me to repeat it or are you 
comfortable? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay Chair I would like to state on record how I 
understood her question to be. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes that is fine. 
MS MEMELA:  Which led me to come to this e-mail. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Well if you like you can indicate this is 
how you understood the question earlier. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this is your answer. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that may or may not coincide with the question as 
formulated after. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay.  How I understood her question Chair was that 
20 
she wanted to find out from the provision that she read, Provision 8.2 
of the contract, because it does not talk about a specific BEE Company.  
It talks about between SAAT or SAA and Swissport contract.  How did I 
find out or maybe conclude that JM was one of the agent or BEE 
Company right?  I think that is the – that was my understanding.  
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 23 of 216 
 
Because they were not mentioned in this provision. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay.  So that is the reason then Chair that I thought 
this e-mail ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  You wanted the e-mail ja. 
MS MEMELA:  Is relevant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  The e-mail Chair was written in April 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is April 26 t h. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja we go back then to. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  To page 608 Chair before we get to 207. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  It – my understanding it was written at the same day.  
So it was written by Mr Jules ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MS MEMELA:  To the then Acting CEO of SAAT, Mr Arson Malola-Phiri, 
and copied Mr Musa Zwane who was the CEO of SAAT, but was acting 
at SAA at that time and then copied Ms Sokhulu – Ms Khosi Sokhulu 
and the subject Chair says re: 
20 
“Formal purchase offer of his – he is saying that 
Diesel Ground Power Units Model MDE18KVA.” 
Now Jules says: 
“Dear Arson Malola-Phiri, in accordance with the 
Swissport Contract recently signed with SAAT.” 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 24 of 216 
 
Here I think Chair he meant SAA, because the Swissport. 
Contract was between SAA and Swissport. 
“We are offering to purchase the quantity 12 of the 
Ground Power Units.  We will accept the units in as 
is where is condition and SAAT will not incur any 
further costs.  Purchase price 225 000 each.  Total 
purchase price will be 2 700 000.  Please can you 
arrange for me to inspect the units at SAAT?  We 
look forward to your acceptance of our formal offer.  
Can you please confirm receipt of our formal offer?” 
10 
Now this e-mail Chair is coming from the CEO of JM.  This is 
before Mr Malola-Phiri goes to the Board with the submission 
requesting to sell the GPU’s.  Mr Arson Malola-Phiri responds. 
“Dear Jules, I am in receipt of your e-mail below re 
formal purchase offer in respect of SAAT GPU’s.  
Whilst I understand the provision made in the 
Swissport SAA Contract in respect of sale of GPU’s.  
It is incumbent on SAAT to follow due asset 
disposal process which will include SAAT Exco and 
Board approvals.  If there are compelling merits to 
20 
say as opposed to leasing out.  SAAT will submit a 
business case motivation to dispose of the GPU’s at 
the Board Meeting scheduled for the third week of 
May 2016.  Shall it be approved I will engage with 
JM Aviation Ltd for conclusion of the transaction.  
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 25 of 216 
 
Hope you find this in order.” 
This is the response from the Acting – the then Acting CEO of 
SAAT.  So Chair the reason why then we understand that JM is the BEE 
company of Swissport.  It was through this e-mail, because remember I 
said on Friday.  We got an instruction for the – from the Acting CEO 
after the Board approval of the sale of GPU’s to sit with JM Aviation 
and negotiate the offer. 
Which the offer was sent to Mr Arson Malola-Phiri April, the 
26 t h before the Board Meeting and then she – he referred to it that 
these the processes that are going to be followed and then once the 
10 
Board approved and Exco approved we will then come back to JM.  
Which is going back to JM he did that through myself and the 
colleagues when he said we should what – negotiate the deal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  So I hope I have answered.  If you – if I have left 
something out you can actually add here. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Certainly.  I will follow up there. 
MS MEMELA:  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you so much.  I understood your 
evidence to be you did not know until 2017 that JM Aviation then on sell 
20 
– sold the GPU’s to Swissport.  Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  We – I had found out then that they were sold to 
Swissport. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
MS MEMELA:  Through the report that was coming from Open Water 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 26 of 216 
 
Report, but I found that out from the media, Sunday Independent 
written by Steven Motale. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So the answer is yes? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  At the time that you were dealing with JM 
Aviation in 2016 then. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What did you think they were going to do with 
the GPU’s after they bought them from SAAT? 
MS MEMELA:  As I have said on my statement Chair or maybe earlier 
10 
this morning.  I said our understanding and I did mention on Friday that 
in the – within – during the meeting there was the owner of the GPU’s 
Mr Chaile Makaleng.  He Heads the Department that owns the GPU’s 
and then there was Mr Stan Vosloo and both these guys are technical – 
technicians – former technicians and they know the technical split part 
of things. 
For me I was sitting there to ensure that okay maybe SAAT 
gets value for money although I would not do it to the best of my ability 
if we do not go out on a tender since the Board had already decided.  
Ja.  Okay.  I forgot.  You see now this thing of talking too much.  I 
20 
forgot the question. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  Let me give you the question again. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What did you understand JM Aviation was going 
to do with the GPU’s ...(intervenes). 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 27 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:  Oh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  After it bought them from SAAT? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay.  My understanding at that time Chair was that 
they were going to maybe operate them ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  For the people they were bought for ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  Because remember the reason SAAT bought these 
GPU’s 
were 
that 
they 
were 
going 
to 
provide 
those 
services 
...(intervenes). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  To Swissport ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  But later on when the contract was never signed as 
mentioned by Ms Hofmeyr. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  From 2012.  They were used for another people.  Not 
the people that they were bought for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you had no understanding that they were in 
fact acting on behalf of Swissport when they purchased the GPU’s? 
MS MEMELA:  Huh-uh.  Okay.  Come with simple English. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was not your understanding ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 28 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That they were acting on behalf of Swissport 
...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When they got involved with the purchase. 
MS MEMELA:  Chair, my understand was that they were buying them as 
the BEE company of Swissport and then maybe they will operate on the 
subcontracted part of things.  Where they will then be operating the 
GPU’s for what SAAT was going to use them for when they were initially 
bought in 2012. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  So that was my understanding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Let us then move to the Board 
Resolution Ms Memela, because I do understand from your evidence 
and you emphasised this on Friday and you have emphasised it again 
today. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You did not take the decision to sell these 
GPU’s for SAAT ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And in fairness to you I want to take you to the 
Board – the Minutes of the Board Meeting at which the Board not you 
made that decision. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let us go to it if we may, because part of your 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 29 of 216 
 
concern earlier as I understand it is that people have drawn links 
between yourself and this arrangement that are unfair ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And I want to say to you we are going to remain 
faithful not to media reporting, but to documents and your evidence in 
the course of today’s proceedings. 
MS MEMELA:  I hope so. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So let us do that.  Let us go to DD25B.  It is 
the smaller bundle in front of you and if you just go over the page to 
page 609.  You will see the Minutes of the Meeting of the SAAT Board.  
10 
Do you have that? 
MS MEMELA:  This is – Chair the extract of the meeting – of the 
Minutes – of the main minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  So just for the Chair’s understanding Ms Hofmeyr I do 
not know if you remember I sent you the full Minutes of that Board. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Because now if we read this on record ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well wait for her question. 
MS MEMELA:  Oh.  Okay. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Wait for her question ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because it does say at the top there extract 
...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Of the Minutes. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 30 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  From the Minutes. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we know that it is not the whole Minutes. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let us do it this way.  This is the extract 
dealing with the item on the agenda for that meeting which is the 
disposal of the Ground Power Units. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If you regard any other provision of the Minutes 
10 
as relevant you will direct us to them in due course.  I am interested in 
the decision that was taken at that meeting by the Board of SAAT. 
MS MEMELA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Related to item 4.4 which is the disposal of 
Ground Power Units.  The matter that we are concerned with the 
Commission today. 
MS MEMELA:  Alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR: It records there in the first paragraph: 
“The Board was requested to consider and approve 
the disposal of 12 Ground Power Units as the 
20 
services they were purchased to offer had been 
outsourced 
to 
an 
external 
service 
provider, 
Swissport, by SAA.” 
Before I continue can I just confirm?  You were not in 
attendance for the whole of this Board Meeting on the 15 t h 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 31 of 216 
 
of June 2016.  Were you? 
MS MEMELA:  I was not Chair.  That is why I think I wanted to go to 
those minutes because they are very detailed ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  But it fine.  We will go ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Our notice is enough as an answer. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  Alright. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you were invited to attend and were you 
there for the conversation and debate around the disposal of the 
Ground Power Units? 
MS MEMELA:  I – as much as I do not remember correctly, but like I 
know that I was only invited for I think the logistics discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Another item? 
MS MEMELA:  Ja.  Logistics ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the agenda? 
MS MEMELA:  Item, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you are not sure whether you were there when the 
20 
Board discussed this item? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  Yes, but I do know that it was tabled before I think 
I walked in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 32 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And did you familiarise yourself after the 
meeting with a decision that the Board had taken in relation to the 
Ground Power Units before you got involved in negotiating their sale 
price? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay.  Mr Malola-Phiri sent us the Board Resolution and 
not this extract of the Minutes.  The Board Resolution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He gave you the Minutes? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  No.  He gave us the Board Resolution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  Not these extracts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So is today the first time that you are seeing 
this extract? 
MS MEMELA:  No.  Today is not the first time.  The first time I got to 
get these.  It is when I was actually going to defend myself during the 
disciplinary hearing and at the CCMA. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  So I dug all the information that I could use. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The next paragraph reflected in these Minutes 
of the Meeting of the SAAT Board on Wednesday, 15 June 2016 is as 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 33 of 216 
 
follows and I quote: 
“It was reported that the GPU’s would be sold to 
Swissport at their current asset value.  The Board 
was informed that SAA’s Contract with Swissport 
provided for Swissport to purchase the GPU’s from 
SAAT.” 
It then goes on and records: 
“The 
submission 
proposed 
that 
SAAT 
should 
consider whether to recover the difference between 
the purchase value of the GPU’s and the current 
10 
asset value from SAA.  The ICFO and GMLRC 
indicated that SAAT had been utilising the GPU’s 
whilst SAA was resolving its contractual issues with 
its ground handling service provider.  Therefore the 
reduction in value of the GPU’s was due to 
depreciation and was not a loss.” 
And then the Resolution is recorded. 
“It was resolved that the disposal of SAAT’s 12 
diesel operated Ground Power Units, GPU’s, as a 
result 
of 
SAA 
awarding 
the 
ground 
handling 
20 
services to an external service provider b, and is 
hereby approved.” 
MS MEMELA:  Chair, can I ask Ms Hofmeyr to go back to the third 
paragraph.  Where it starts from the ICFO.  I know people who are 
listening.  They do not know what those abbreviations are for. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 34 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  So I – ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on.  She asked you a question. 
MS MEMELA:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think wait until she asks you a question, because 
everything we do must relate to the questions.  If after she has asked 
questions in your answer you think it is important to draw attention to 
that.  Then we can go there. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  So that was a recordal of 
both what had been conducted in the course of the meeting as well as 
the Resolution that the Board took and as I understood your evidence 
earlier.  You were then provided with the Resolution itself.  Is that 
correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And after that point Ms Memela I understand 
your evidence to be you were then tasked with negotiating the sale 
price for the GPU’s.  Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Myself, the HOD for the Department that owns the GPU’s 
20 
...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is Mr Makaleng. 
MS MEMELA:  And – Mr Makaleng and Stan Vosloo. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And Mr Vosloo. 
MS MEMELA:  The only person who could not make it to that meeting 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 35 of 216 
 
was Mr Leon Roberts. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  So you will come back to it.  That 
is the meeting of the 21 s t of June 2016.  Is that correct?  That you are 
talking about. 
MS MEMELA:  I do not remember, because we do not have the Minutes 
for that.  So I would agree it will be that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  There is an e-mail that is sent to 
you after the meeting by Ms Sokhulu. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Which talks about the meeting that day.  That is 
10 
what I am basing my suggestion that it is the 21 s t of June meeting. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  So let us go through what you did after 
this Board Resolution was taken to now negotiate the price. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We now go back to her affidavit? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well it is going to be a few documents I will 
take you to Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I want to know first of all whether you went and 
found out what SAAT had purchased the GPU’s for the year before. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  You want to know if I had to go and found out if SAAT 
had – like I mean how much they have purchased the GPU’s for. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Slightly different.  I did not ask whether you 
had to.  I asked you first whether you did. 
MS MEMELA:  Did I?  Okay. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 36 of 216 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you go and find out what SAAT had paid 
when it bought the GPU’s the year before? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay.  Chairperson remember the Board Resolution talks 
about the book value.  Myself together with the owner of the GPU’s and 
Mr Stan Vosloo.  We did not go back to the time when the GPU’s were 
bought and the reason for that is that for that moment as well there was 
no tender that was like I mean SAAT went out to buy the GPU’s. 
They negotiated with this specific company and no one is 
sure that for whatever amount that they bought them for – SAAT bought 
them for – was the correct amount, because there is absolute no proof 
10 
that they had negotiated the amount or they just bought the GPU’s for 
what the Board had approved for, because my understanding is that 
sometimes the Board will approve R500 and then from the procurement 
point of view it is your duty to go and negotiate and try and save as 
much as you can. 
So I think the reason at that time that we did not want to go 
back to that is because the Board had approved for the specific amount 
and then the people who bought these in that that time bought them 
exactly for the amount that was approved by the Board.  It did not 
really sit well with us, because like relying on that at the end of the day 
20 
does not determine the price or the amount that they should be sold 
for. 
That is the reason why I was – I wanted to go back to where 
the Interim CFO at that time and the GM Legal made that statement, 
but Chair we did not go – like I mean the response is that we did not go 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 37 of 216 
 
back to that.  We relied on the – what was there in the book value at 
the time and I did mention – I do not know.  Maybe it is not in the 
documents here. 
I did mention that the system that SAAT was using was 
outdated long time ago with a software that is outdated.  So the book 
value whatever that was put there was not like really stick.  So like I 
mean we had to rely on other, ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  So can I just make sure I understand?  
You did not look at the purchase price from a year earlier, because you 
were concerned that that did not represent fair market value.  Is that 
10 
correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  It did not really represent the fair market value. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then you started talking about the book 
value. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do I understand your evidence to be.  You did 
consider the book value. 
MS MEMELA:  The book value was considered looking at the MEMIS 
20 
record and I think maybe it will be from Mr Chaile Makaleng and also 
checking with finance.  Remember Chair during the Board Meeting.  
That is the reason why I wanted like to go to the full minutes.  There 
was a CEO – CFO ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 38 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:  Of SAAT sitting there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Remember the Asset Register is ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  Is maintained and managed by finance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  So my understanding him sitting there with the Acting 
CEO submitting to the Board what he was submitting being the book 
value or whatever. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Versus I mean what is actually in the Asset Register 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  And ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  Book value. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja.  So ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well we can go to those minutes if they are here.  If 
that will assist you to give ...(intervenes).

MS MEMELA:  The response. 
CHAIRPERSON:  An answer ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you want to give. 
MS MEMELA:  I request we go to that ...(intervenes). 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 39 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Because I think it will give a clear clarity of what I want. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ja.  You will have to find them Ms Memela.  
They were – I understand you say they were amongst the annexures 
that you provided to the Commission, but I explained at the outset of 
your evidence that they had never been identified with cross reference 
to your statement. 
So they have just been assembled for your benefit after your 
statement, but I am not on top of those documents.  So we will need to 
10 
find them.  I asked my junior to assist me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To – ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So what we will do Ms Memela. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Dimbikiwa will try and look for them – your own 
lawyer will try and look for them while we continue with other 
questions. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then at a later stage we will come back to the 
20 
question once somebody has found them. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela, can I just get clarity though.  I 
understood your evidence earlier to be you had not seen the Minutes of 
those – of that meeting at the time that you were negotiating the sale 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 40 of 216 
 
price.  I understood your evidence earlier to be you only saw them 
much later when you were preparing for your CCMA case.  Is that 
correct? 
MS MEMELA:  That is correct.  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is very helpful, because then anything that 
is contained in the Minutes is not going to assist in understanding what 
was in your mind and what you were doing at the time that you were 
negotiating.  Is that right? 
MS MEMELA:  No.  That is not right.  That is not my understanding. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let us try and get that out of the way.  
Ms Memela ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you are looking for the Minutes.  Let us stop 
looking for the Minutes for now. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that we can continue with other questions, but 
your lawyer and junior counsel to Ms Hofmeyr will be looking will be 
looking for those minutes in the meantime.  You must just remember 
that at some stage we go back to them if it is necessary ...(intervenes). 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I do not understand your answer to Ms Hofmeyr 
when she says if at the time you were not aware of the Minutes.  
Whatever is in the Minutes could not have been a factor in terms of 
your understanding and you say no.  That is not right. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 41 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do I misunderstanding something? 
MS MEMELA:  The reason I put it like that Chair was that what is 
written in the Minutes is supporting our understanding at that time.  As 
much as we did not see the Minutes, but like that was our 
understanding.  Myself and the colleagues that were sitting during the 
negotiations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  That is fine.  So it is not that you were aware of 
the Minutes at the time. 
MS MEMELA:  Huh-uh. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is just that you had a certain understanding 
...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And subsequently you saw something in the Minutes 
that supports your understanding. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what you say? 
MS MEMELA:  That is what I am saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Memela, do you accept 
20 
that the Acting SAAT CEO thought that the book value of the GPU’s was 
relevant to the price at which they should be sold given what he 
included in his submission to the Board? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  The book value that was put by Mr Malola-Phiri 
was in the submission ...(intervenes). 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 42 of 216 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Correct. 
MS MEMELA:  Before the Board.  I agree. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And let us just look at what the book value was 
at the time.  You will find it in your DD25B bundle and it is at page 611. 
MS MEMELA:  611? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What I have at 611 does not appear to look like what 
you have. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  I am also worried. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Oh.  No, no.  I think what you have in your hand 
is what is different from what I have, but what you have on the next 
page there seems to be ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  It is your 611.  Oh, goodness.  It is 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  It is my 611. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Very worrying.  Well I think there is another 
location for this in Mr Human’s affidavit, because he was taken to that. 
MS MEMELA:  H’mm. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Maybe what I do for now is just read it into the 
record.  I am concerned that there is a difference in the pagination 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But it was an aspect that he confirmed in his 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 43 of 216 
 
evidence before the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela if you ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Would like to ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I think Ms Mbanjwa wants to say something. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Thank you Chair.  I just wanted to put on 
record ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Come closer to the mic.  Otherwise you will not be 
recorded. 
10 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Thank you Chair.  I was also looking at the 
reference.  I do not see the book value.  So I wanted to point out that 
what I have been referred to in the record ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Is not what Ms Hofmeyr ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Is talking about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  If it is possible it might be helpful if you sat 
much closer to Ms Hofmeyr. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Subject to her own stuff there, because sometimes 
you can just whisper to her something or make a note and give to her 
...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair, can I ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 44 of 216 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Be problematic? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I am just about to direct Ms Mbanjwa to the 
Human bundle ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Which I see is in front of her and it is very 
difficult to move. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So it is just for now ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright.  Ja. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because I want everyone to have the document  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In front of them.  Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There seems to be – have been some error 
between my copy of Ms Memela’s bundle ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But it is not a problem, because we have the 
very same page in the Human bundle ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because as I indicated he had testified about it 
earlier in the week ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And Mr Human’s affidavit and annexures have 
previously been provided to Ms Memela. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 45 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but before we do that ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So where we need to go ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  That box – the second box between you and 
Ms Mbanjwa ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does it have to be there, because if it can be 
removed.  She could come closer. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is preferable.  Let us do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because some of the issues – she could make a note 
for you.  Bring something to your attention without ...(intervenes). 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Us stopping the proceedings. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe let us try and to that and even – although it 
can still be brought closer.  It is just going to help with the smooth 
...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Running of the proceedings.  Of course you - you do 
need to have your stuff there ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think that will help. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I am certain it will. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  Chair, if I can request Ms Hofmeyr?  Can you direct 
which file that …(intervenes)? 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 46 of 216 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I was about to. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  So Ms Memela at ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – yes, so.  I am sorry Ms Hofmeyr.  So sometimes 
you can just make a note and bring it to her attention and she can take 
that into account.  If there is a problem she will say okay let us stop 
and then we can – you can articulate, but sometimes she will be able to 
address what you are saying without us stopping the proceedings. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Very good Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  We are indebted.  The 
second copy of the same document is in Exhibit DD22B.  That is the 
second file of Mr Human’s bundle and you will find it there at page 694. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat the bundle. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  DD22B at page ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can you see it Ms Memela? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  694. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  At page? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  694.  This is an extract from the Asset Register 
20 
as it was in June 2016.  Do you see that Ms Memela? 
MS MEMELA:  As it was in June 2016? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Correct. 
MS MEMELA:  Chair, not to be problematic or anything.  I see a 
document that was done in an Excel spreadsheet and then with 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 47 of 216 
 
something written June 2016 with somebody’s hand and then it has got 
some signatures in the corner which does not really say who signed.  
Was it the person who is responsible for Asset Register or not, but that 
is what I see and my understanding in Asset Register should be as 
formal as possible as much information as possible and this to me – 
this is exactly what I had disputed at the CCMA and during the 
disciplinary to Advocate Cassim and which he accepted that this cannot 
be accepted as a formal Asset Register, because anybody could have 
put whatever that they want to put and it was only the representative of 
the employer who had that at the time. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  So I am not sure then if mister – who signed this.  Who 
was managing it at that time and whatever? 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you say that you see a document here, but you 
cannot accept that it reflects what was in the Asset Register.  Is that 
what you are saying? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  I am saying also Chair remember the book value 
should rely on the system which was MEMIS at that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  So there is no attachment.  Maybe that is coming from 
20 
MEMIS. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  That states how much did MEMIS say at that time 
...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So ...(intervenes). 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 48 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:  In the book value, ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela you never saw this document when 
you were negotiating the sale price.  Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  No.  Definitely not Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Hang on.  Ms Mbanjwa. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Thank you Chair.  I also have an objection. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  To the document that has been presented, 
because there is an e-mail that was produced.  I just want the page of 
the e-mail and in the e-mail these Ground Power Units were given a 
10 
name.  They were called HISH-something.  I just want to get that e-
mail. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I think what you may wish to do is make a note.  
Let us see what Ms Hofmeyr’s response or reaction is to the answer 
given by the witness and bear in mind that clarification could be given 
later. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  I think Chair I may have to be guided 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Because Chair has said. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  This Commission has been sitting for one 
and a half years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Apart from the very lofty position that Chair 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 49 of 216 
 
has ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  H’mm. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  In the judiciary.  What Ms Hofmeyr is doing 
– the way I see it.  She is making Ms Memela answer questions on a 
document.  The correctness thereof is not acceptable to us or to put it 
in another manner.  All I want Ms Hofmeyr to do is to say at least that 
these assets that are described here are the GP Units that we are 
referring to.  That is basically our objection. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no.  I am saying the witness had just given 
her answer and I do not know if she had finished and Ms Memela had 
10 
not – Ms Hofmeyr had not had a chance to respond – to react to the 
answer.  The reaction to the answer could be yes I understand what you 
say, but there is another document. 
I will take you to that document at some stage.  The reaction 
could be no.  I – maybe you are mistaken Ms Memela about this 
document.  So let us go on and let us see ...(intervenes). 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  I am premature.  As it pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes you are premature.  Okay.  Thank you. 
MS MEMELA:  Chair, I was just about finished then and then 
...(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. You had not finished your answer? 
MS MEMELA:  I had not finished. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  That is the point I am making, ja. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja, but I am not going to take long. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Just finish your answer. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 50 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:  Just for the Commission’s understanding and for record.  
I just needed to – I know – am I allowed to ask an Evidence Leader, 
because I want to understand this document in front of us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ask for clarification. 
MS MEMELA:  Clarification. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can ask for clarification. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  I would like to ask Ms Hofmeyr there are dates 
here that are under “capitalised on”.  I just want clarify on that if you 
understand what those dates were for. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No.  I was not employed at SAAT at any point. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Oh.  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  You see now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let us go back to the question.  Okay.  I think 
just stop there. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Too much has happened since the question was 
asked. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just go back to the question Ms Hofmeyr.  I just want 
20 
to ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
MS MEMELA:  Because I just need clarity Chair on the June 2016 one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To make sure.  Hang on.  Hang on. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 51 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:  Oh.  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us go back to the question.  You listen to it and 
you give a crisp answer to it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela you confirmed you had not seen 
this document before you engaged in the negotiations of the GPU sale 
price.  Correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  I confirmed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I do not need to deal with the 
document any further then, if you did not see it at the time. 
MS MEMELA:  Oh.  So there is this ...(intervenes). 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR: 
 
What 
I 
would 
then 
like 
to 
go 
to 
is 
...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The submission that Mr Phiri who was the 
Acting CEO prepared for the Board before he took the decision to sell 
the GPU’s, because Mr Phiri spent some time looking at the book value 
of the GPU’s and made submissions to the Board about what the book 
value was. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So if we could go there.  Your ...(intervenes). 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Chair ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  I feel that it is too easy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MS MEMELA:  Or maybe it will not give clarity to the public or our – I 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 52 of 216 
 
mean people who had read about this whole thing in the media 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  And I am glad I see NUMSA is here.  They have been 
quite interested in this GPU issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MS MEMELA:  If Ms Hofmeyr decides not to deal with that document, 
because I have had a relevant question asked about the dates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Remember when Open Water ...(intervenes). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  Reached a wrong conclusion ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  On this matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  I am still going to add that like they actually even used 
the wrong provision of the SCM to reach their conclusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  So their conclusion was based on this documentation.  
That is why I said I actually only started like I am seeing this during my 
20 
disciplinary hearing ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  And then at the CCMA where I had to actually defend 
myself ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 53 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:  And clear myself from this whole thing ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  But now if when I ask a question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  Maybe – and then because there are no answers.  Like -
as Ms Hofmeyr said I was not an employee of SAAT. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   
MS MEMELA:  Remember like she was going to use this as evidence 
and ...(intervenes). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But she ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  And now ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on.  Hang on. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on Ms Memela  
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I understand your concern about maybe certain 
aspects not being asked or not been dealt with to your satisfaction at a 
particular point in time, but she is there to lead evidence in regard to 
what is relevant and important to the Commission. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It may be that some things that she regards as 
relevant and is important to the Commission are not the same that you 
regard as important and relevant to be dealt with, but where she asks 
you a question and to answer it you need to look at a document I will 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 54 of 216 
 
allow you to do that. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Subject to the ambit of the question ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Fair enough Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But your lawyer is there to keep an eye on some of 
the things that she knows having consulted with you may be important 
for you and that at a later stage when she gets an opportunity to re-
examine she could then look at some of the answers you had given and 
give her a chance to clarify. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  It if fair enough. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair and just in explanation before I move to 
the next question.  The part of the evidence that we are interested in at 
the moment is Ms Memela’s role in negotiating the sale price. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is for that purpose that I am seeking to 
20 
establish through the questions of Ms Memela what she knew at the 
time.  When Ms Memela indicates to me she did not see a document at 
the time I must leave it ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because it was then not something that was 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 55 of 216 
 
weighing ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  On her mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I have now moved to the next place. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Where there was an indication of what the 
asset value was ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because I am then going to ask Ms Memela 
whether she had that knowledge ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  At the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There is no intended unfairness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I cannot persist in a line of questioning 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  With the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Where I am trying to establish her state of 
knowledge ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 56 of 216 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  At the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  When I present her with a document and she 
says she did not see it ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  At the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I must then move on with ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Your leave Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  No.  That is ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And so I move on  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To Exhibit DD22B and that is the Human exhibit 
and if you pick it up at page 811. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  I see we are at the time that – when we 
normally take the tea break. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I propose not to take the tea break unless either the 
witness or you, Ms Hofmeyr, needs some break, because I am going to 
20 
– we are going to have an extended lunch today, because I need to 
attend to another commitment in my other capacity that is urgent.  So 
our lunch will be longer than normal.  Maybe two hours. 
So I am – I want us to use this tea break if we can, but if 
either the witness or Ms Hofmeyr, because they are the only ones who 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 57 of 216 
 
cannot sneak out while they were talking.  If they are fine to continue 
without a break we will, but if one of them wishes to have some break.  
Then we will have a break.  Ms Memela, you would like to have a break. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  The reason why I am raising this without my lawyer is 
that remember on Friday I had mentioned that I was supposed to drive 
down to Eastern Cape and I ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  You had asked for Monday maybe to use two to three 
10 
hours ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  But I want to give – to inform you that we are okay with 
the whole day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whole day.  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  So you do not have to be under pressure as long as 
everything when we leave here is as clear as possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is finalised? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Thank you 
20 
very, very much for that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And Ms Memela you are happy to proceed? 
CHAIRPERSON:  But as for the break you do not have a problem? 
MS MEMELA:  A break we do need it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You need some break? 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 58 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair, if I may make the request then? 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just in the break if Ms Memela could find the 
Minutes she was looking for.  We have not been able to find them in the 
annexures that she provided, but she can obviously use the break just 
to go through them and assist us with where they are in the bundle 
10 
...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then when we return we will deal with the 
SAAT CEO submission. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay.  Then we will take the tea break.  It is 
11:20 now.  We will resume at 11:35. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
20 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   I would like us as far as possible to try and have a 
smooth-running session.  Now that does not mean, Ms Mbanjwa, that if 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 59 of 216 
 
there is something you feel strongly about you should not raise it, but I 
would like all of us to try.   
 
Ms Memela this is also directed at you.  I would like us to try 
and run as smoothly as possible.  In the process, I would like you to try 
to give crisp answers, short answers to short questions and 
Ms Mbanjwa is there to, she knows your story, she has taken 
instructions from you, she will be alive to somethings that you might 
wish to have clarified later on. 
MS MEMELA:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But apart from that, when you are done, when 
10 
Ms Hofmeyr is done, either before Ms Mbanjwa re-examines you I will 
give you a chance to deal with other matters that are relevant to some 
of the questions which you think might be part of putting your case 
properly to the Commission.  Okay.  
MS MEMELA:   Thanks Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I would like us to go quickly and smoothly with 
regard to questions and answers.  So, and the shorter the answers, the 
better. 
MS MEMELA:   Okay.. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you, Ms Hofmeyr. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair.  Before we broke for the tea 
adjournment we were going to be looking at Exhibit DD22B at page 811.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I think I am looking at the wrong one. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I think Claire is assisting.  Page 811 of Exhibit 
DD22B.  Ms Memela what is this document?  
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 60 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:   Chair this is the Site Board submission. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And who was it compiled by? 
MS MEMELA:   Based on the signature and based on who is it from.  It  
Acting CEO SAAT,  Mr Arson Malola-Phiri. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And the date of the document?  
MS MEMELA:   The date was 15 June 2016. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   We saw previously, the extract from the 
Minutes indicated that the Board Meeting was also on the 15 t h of June 
2016.  Does that accord with your memory? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes Chair. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Let us go if we may to the bottom of page 812.  
You will see there at the bottom 812 there is a heading under 6 
“financial implication”, do you see that? 
MS MEMELA:   Financial implications? Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Could you read into record what Mr Phiri the 
acting CEO of SAAT recorded under financial implication? 
MS MEMELA:   Okay.   
“Financial implication:  Each unit was purchased at 
a cost of R766 165.10.  Each with a total cost of 
nine million hundred and ninety-three, nine five or 
20 
nine six one, is it nine eight one, twenty, excluding 
shipping costs.  The current value of each unit per 
SAA Asset Register is at six eighty-two eight ninety 
sixty-two.  Selling the units at current asset value 
should realize an income of 4.7 million. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 61 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Four 
million, 
seven 
hundred 
and 
eighty 
...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:   Four million seven hundred and eighty, two thirty-one 
forty. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Ms Memela it appears from this 
document that Mr Arson Phiri the then acting CEO did have cause to 
look at the Asset Register and reflect the amount in the Asset Register 
do you agree with that? 
MS MEMELA:   I would think so because this amount that he has 
10 
written here is the same as what was written there on the Asset 
Register that we rejected, that was written by hand 2016 although it 
had ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No, it is actually different. But we do not need 
to go back to that document ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:   That amount yeah? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, so his amount here, having looked at the 
Asset Register is R862 890.62 per unit.  Correct?  Now, did you have 
reason to discuss with Mr Phiri what he had said in his submission to 
the Board?  Oh, sorry Chair, I see there is an objection. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay+ 
. 
MS MBANJWA:   Thank you Chair.  The basis of the objection is the 
fact that what we asked when we objected for this first time Chair is to 
say, let us have a proper Asset Register, so that the questions then can 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 62 of 216 
 
pertain to the proper Asset Register.   
 
This is still not a proper Asset Register.  And Ms Memela has 
been asked to authenticate this document as if it is her document.  She 
is not the author of this document; therefore, she cannot confirm the 
correctness of the contents of this document.  Otherwise that is 
prejudicial.  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, my understanding of the question was that 
she was supposed to just give her own understanding.  I do not think 
there was really a problem, but make a note when you re-examine, you 
can clarify all of those things.  
10 
MS MBANJWA:   Thank you Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Ms Memela were you aware that the acting 
CEO had indicated to the Board through this submission on the 15 t h of 
June 2016 that according to the then Asset Register of SAAT, each 
unit’s value was R683 380.62.  
MS MEMELA:   No Chair, I was not aware.  When the acting CEO gave 
us the instruction to sit and negotiate the proposal.  What he gave us 
was the proposal, that one page that talks to the GPU equipment, like 
from the SAA Swissport contract, plus the Board Resolution.  Yes Chair.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And as ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  Well I must say Ms Memela your 
answers are very crisp now. 
MS MEMELA:   Ja, I am trying Chair. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 63 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you are doing well. 
MS MEMELA:   Thanks Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And then let us move to the meeting you had 
on the 21 s t of June 2016.  I understood your evidence previously to be 
the Mr Makaleng and Mr Vosloo attended that meeting with you, is that 
correct? 
MS MEMELA:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Ms Memela both Mr Makaleng and Mr Vosloo 
have given affidavits to the Commission in which they deny having 
10 
attended those meetings.  Mr Makaleng’s I will take you to in a moment, 
is already in your bundle.   
 
Mr Vosloo’s affidavit came through this morning Chair, so it 
was added to the bundle this morning,  but he has subsequently just in 
the course of the hearing identified two typographical errors in his 
affidavit and so he has provided a further supplementary affidavit I 
would like to beg leave just to hand those in if I may. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   They have already been paginated they will 
come at the end of Exhibit DD25B and they are paginated from 
20 
page 742.  They have been paginated already. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The affidavits of Mr Standton Leonard Vosloo and 
that of mister – oh both of these are Vosloo. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, they are indeed.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. I admit and they will be added to Exhibit 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 64 of 216 
 
25B and they will run from page 742 to page 750.  Is that correct? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   We are indebted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Apologies, 751 I understand Chair goes right 
to 751. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh yes, up to 751. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Ms Memela do you maintain in your testimony 
to the Commission that despite the fact that both Mr Makaleng and Mr 
Vosloo say that they were not at the meeting on the 21 s t of June, that 
they were at the meeting.  
MS MEMELA:   I maintain Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Right.  Let us look at the proof that 
Mr Makaleng provides for having not attended the meeting.  And you 
will find that in DD25B at page 630.   
CHAIRPERSON:   One second.  25B. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   630 Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   25B.  630, yes.  Sorry let me put this in the right 
place.  630, yes.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Chair that is the first page of Mr Makaleng’s 
affidavit and I would like to draw Ms Memela’s attention to one or two 
aspects of the affidavit ...(intervenes). 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 65 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:   Sorry Chair, I am not there.  Is it the file of Mr Human 
or my file? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No it is your file, so DD25B ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well Ms Memela I think we were on the same, I was 
having Human’s bundle as well, I just rid of it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Apologies, there are far too many A’s, B’s, C’s, 
etcetera.  We are in Ms Memela’s bundle that is for the record Exhibit 
25 and we are in the “B” volume and we are looking at page 630.   
MS MEMELA:   Ja, I am there Chair.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  So, the affidavit commences at 
10 
page 630, and what Mr Makaleng goes on to deal with at page 631, is 
his involvement in the sale of the Ground Power Units.  There are just a 
few paragraphs I would like to highlight and then ask for Ms Memela’s 
comment.  We can pick it up at paragraph 7 on page 631.  What Mr 
Makaleng says at paragraph 7 is:  
“I was requested in early 2016 by Mr Arson Malola-
Phiri who was the acting Chief Executive Officer for 
SAAT. He e-mailed me and instructed to me prepare 
a submission for the sale of the GPU’s.  This was 
not something I was in favour of as can be seen in 
20 
the example correspondence in Annexure CM1, but 
I prepared a draft submission as instructed.” 
Mr Makaleng goes on to explain how he had first drafted the 
submission to suggest selling only seven of the 12 units and retaining 
five.  But the relevant next paragraph I would like us to look at in its 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 66 of 216 
 
own words is over the page at 632, Mr Makaleng in his affidavit says: 
“The GPU value I included in the submission was 
R682 890.62 each, which came out at the Asset 
Register at the time subject to depreciation.”   
Chair I just pause there to indicate for the record that is the 
same amount that was included in the submission that the acting CEO 
then gave to SAAT that we have just looked at.  And then he goes on at 
paragraph 13 to say the following, he is talking about the meeting 
scheduled for 21 June, he says, and I quote:  
“I did not attend this meeting which was scheduled 
10 
for 21 June 2016 from 11:00 to 12:00.  I did not 
accept the invite that I would attend the meeting 
because the invite to this meeting was sent to me 
at 09:09 on the 21 s t of June 2016 at which time I 
was attending our daily operations meeting (delay 
meeting), which starts at 09:00 to 10:30, and would 
not have been able to see the meeting invite in 
time.  I was also not in favour of the transaction 
and would not have attended the meeting to 
dispose of the 12 GPU’s.  I have not attended any 
20 
meeting with JM Aviation representatives to discuss 
the sale of the GPU’s nor pricing at any stage.  I 
have also not attended any SAAT internal meeting 
to discuss the pricing of the GPU’s to be sold.”   
There is a reference in that paragraph to an Annexure CM4 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 67 of 216 
 
which I would like to take us to because that is the meeting invite which 
Mr Makaleng attaches to his affidavit.  You will find that the same 
volume DD25B at page 647.   
MS MEMELA:   Page? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   647.  That – Mr Makaleng explains is the 
meeting invite that he received.  Ms Memela can you indicate the date 
reflected on that page from the calendar of Mr Makaleng? 
MS MEMELA:   The date? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MS MEMELA:   Is 21/06/2016. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you and then if you look at the bottom 
right hand corner there is a box there that says GPU discussion.  Do 
you see that? 
MS MEMELA:   Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Do you see that it gives a start time?  What is 
the start time of that discussion? 
MS MEMELA:   The start time 11:00. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   What is the end time? 
MS MEMELA:   12:00.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Who was indicated as the Organiser of that 
20 
discussion? 
MS MEMELA:   It was Nontsasa Memela.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And what does it say at the bottom of that 
block? 
MS MEMELA:   This meeting has not been accepted.   
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 68 of 216 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Do you have a comment on Mr Makaleng’s 
evidence in – on affidavit that he did not attend the meeting and the 
proof that he provides for that? 
MS MEMELA:   I have the comments Chair and I still stand by my 
statement.  I did say that he did attend the meeting and I did not refer 
to the acceptance because I know that he had at first rejected the 
meeting then he popped up before the meeting, I think it was 10 
minutes before the meeting.   
 
We went to the meeting, we attended it and we discussed 
everything in that meeting with them him, and Stan Vosloo.  Like I said 
10 
on Friday that in fact just to go back Chair so that I finish early, I see 
that he says he was attending the delay meeting ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:    Another meeting Ja.   
MS MEMELA:   Yes, that was starting from 09:00 to 10:30.  So, I 
remember that he came in just 10 minutes before the meeting started at 
11:00.  Meaning like I mean he was early enough to attend that meeting, 
so he came he rejected it, but he was there, and I said Friday  Chair and 
I understand my former colleagues maybe trying to distance themselves 
from this because there has been so much that was said about this 
transaction and of course him saying that he was against the transaction, 
20 
of course he was.   
 
He did say that he wanted to have seven GPU’s sold but the 
acting CEO, not Nontsasa, changed his submission to 12:00, you 
understand so and as the owner of the what the Department that owns the 
GPU’s.  I mean it should not end at being in favour or not agreeing to the 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 69 of 216 
 
sale of GPU’s.  We are all HOD’s. 
 
I mean my understanding is that at an executive level you have a 
fiduciary level to act in the best interest of the company.  So at least if 
we had that kind of an evidence that says, you see actually after I have 
shown my unhappiness about this say that the Board had already 
approved.   
 
This is what I did, I reported to the relevant authority.  Chair we 
work for the State Owned Companies and there are certain procedures 
that have to be followed like for a person who is not happy about a 
certain transaction such as this one to show that you know what, they did 
10 
this thing without me and I was not happy and I showed it, here is proof.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So, you are saying two or three things?   
MS MEMELA:   Yes, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   One is, you say; what he says in his affidavit that he 
did not attend that meeting is not true.   
MS MEMELA:   Is not true Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   You stand by your evidence that he did come.   
MS MEMELA:   I stand by my evidence.   
CHAIRPERSON:   You even remember that he arrived about 10 minutes 
before the meeting could start.   
20 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   And you accept that he had declined?  Is that right?   
MS MEMELA:   I accept that he had rejected the meeting request.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Rejected the invitation, Yes.   
MS MEMELA:   Yes, which is I do think he thought he will take longer in 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 70 of 216 
 
the delay meeting.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MS MEMELA:   The delay meeting Chair is not a for instance an executive 
meeting, remember like this one involved the asset that was under his 
department.  So, the delay meeting he could have sent his senior 
manager.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Somebody else.   
MS MEMELA:   Ja, so when he attended there and decided to come and 
join us I thought okay, he thought like I mean he is in a what presence 
will be important and he was there.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, now that he declined is that something you came 
to know afterwards or is that something you knew before he arrived 10 
minutes that he had declined the request.   
MS MEMELA:   I think – I knew because at first, he accepted it and 
during the disciplinary hearing Chair and the same day I had this 
evidence.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MS MEMELA:   Just that when I was sending it to the Commission, I could 
not find it but I can look for it and send it.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
20 
MS MEMELA:   He had accepted first and then later on rejected.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Rejected.   
MS MEMELA:   Then as colleagues.   
CHAIRPERSON:   And then he came.   
MS MEMELA:   Exactly, as colleagues I pick up the phone and then I said 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 71 of 216 
 
Ow, Chille, I mean why are you rejecting.  You accepted first and he said 
I do not know what, I do not remember he said but what I know is that he 
joined us for that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you agree with him that he was against the 
transaction?  But you say that he was there at the meeting? 
MS MEMELA:   I agree with him that he was against the sale of the 12 
GPU’s.  Yes, he was proposing he even did the submission that like seven 
should be sold.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MS MEMELA:   And then showed that to Mr. Arson Malola-Phiri acting 
10 
CEO.  Acting CEO showed him apparently the what you call the copy of 
the Swissport SAA contract that look my hands are tied as the acting 
CEO.  This thing says that we should sell all 12 of them.  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. Thank you   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Ms Memela are you aware that the award of 
the arbitrator of your CCMA proceedings does not refer to this aspect of 
your evidence?  That he first accepted and then rejected it?   
MS MEMELA:   Okay I did not quote my award when I was responding I 
was not quoting the award from the CCMA.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No, indeed, so I am asking you are you aware 
20 
that the arbitrator did not reflect that in his award?   
MS MEMELA:   Is it saying something opposite to what I am saying?   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   The arbitrator’s award resolved this issue on 
the basis that the Mr Makaleng’s rejection of attending the meeting had 
not been made available in the course of the CCMA proceedings?   
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 72 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, and the fact that Chair, Open Water did not 
approve – could not prove that indeed he changed his mind and go and 
attended the meeting.  So, it was like his word against mine.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But I must just I think you if you say what you have 
just said is part of what you testified about this at the CCMA, you can 
say, that is what I said at the CCMA.   
MS MEMELA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If the award does not reflect that it might not reflect 
but certainly if anybody goes to check the recordings, they will find that 
I said it.  If that is your evidence.   
10 
MS MEMELA:   That is my evidence, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Let us move to Mr Vosloo is he also giving 
false evidence before this Commission when he says that he did not 
attend the meeting?   
MS MEMELA:   Okay, can we go to his affidavit and then.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, I am just asking for your, whether you 
maintain your version that he did not attend the meeting?   
MS MEMELA:   I maintain my evidence, Chair, because as I said the 
only person who did not attend who I know for sure that he was not 
20 
there was Leon Roberts being the Senior Manager of Inventory in 
Logistics.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And Ms Memela you have emphasised Mr 
Makaleng’s responsibility as the owner of these assets, is that correct?   
MS MEMELA:   That is correct. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 73 of 216 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So, did he lead the discussions at that meeting 
to arrive at a sale price?   
MS MEMELA:   Chair, it was not about who is leading the discussions, 
who is Chairing the meeting because remember I am the one who 
actually called the meeting.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, hang on.   
MS MEMELA:   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   You see you were doing very well I think when I 
asked you questions I put you back to you can say yes, he lead the 
discussion or no, he did not lead the discussion.   
10 
MS MEMELA:   No, he did not lead the discussion, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and then will you wait for the next question?   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Was it you who lead them?   
MS MEMELA:   I did not lead the discussions because I mean we let 
the representatives of JM to put their story on the table based on the 
proposal.  No, I did not lead.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So, who lead?   
MS MEMELA:   Okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:   You might not be able to say who lead because 
everybody was talking, I do not know ...(intervenes).   
20 
MS MEMELA:   Exactly.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But just give the best answer that you can give if it is 
clear who that somebody was leading the discussion you can say so 
and so was leading if you are not sure who was leading because 
everybody was talking.   
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 74 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:   Okay, Chair.  Maybe the problem now is that maybe the 
question how it is formulated in terms of leading the meeting, because 
like I called the meeting ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe what you can do is, you can say who Chaired 
the meeting, and then you can say whether there was somebody who 
introduced this subject to the meeting and tell us who those are, and 
then in terms of discussion whether you are able to say there was 
somebody leading the discussion.   
 
If you are able to say, you say so, so and so was leading as 
far I am concerned.  If you are not able, you say; I cannot say who was 
10 
leading.  
MS MEMELA:   Okay, because I called the meeting Chair, then I think I 
may have been the one who opened the meeting discussions.  I am not 
running away from leading, because I have mostly Chaired meetings 
and lead but this one I am saying, opening discussions and I was the 
most I think active in asking questions because ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   You spoke because ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:   I even asked the one that, how did they reach the 
amount that like the made the proposal to the acting CEO in April.  That 
is when they responded via e-mail saying thank you for the meeting and 
20 
then responded.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Let us then go to Mr Vosloo’s affidavit if we 
may.  You will find that in the same bundle DD25B at page 742.   
MS MEMELA:   Is it not the one that was just ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it is the one that has just been handed out. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 75 of 216 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Now I am going to ask us to look at Mr 
Standton Leonard Vosloo for the record that is V-o-s-l-o-o.  if we go 
over the page to page 743, you will see a paragraph 6 he deals with 
this meeting, he says there:  
“I have been interviewed during the forensic 
investigations into this matter.  I am also aware 
through these investigations and through interviews 
with 
the 
investigators 
at 
the 
State 
Capture 
Commission that Advocate Nontsasa Memela then 
HOD procurement at SAAT alleged that I attended a 
10 
meeting on 2 June 2016 at SAAT.” 
Chair that is where the error has been identified.  The 
supplementary affidavit at page 750 makes it clear that he meant to 
refer to the meeting we are talking about which is the 21 June meeting 
...(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:   21?  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed, but just for reference purposes that 
correction appears in Exhibit DD25B at page 750.  He says – he goes 
and I quote from his affidavit:  
“The meeting was apparently for discussions on the 
20 
sale of the GPU’s.  Reference to the meeting is 
attached as per Annexure SV1.  The meeting was 
allegedly with members of JM Aviation.”   
At paragraph 7 he says:  
“I deny that I was ever involved with or in any 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 76 of 216 
 
meeting whatsoever with the sale of the GPU’s 
were discussed, any pricing was discussed or any 
agreed price was reached.” 
Ms Memela if I just stop there, is his evidence before the 
Commission false? 
MS MEMELA:   The part Chair that he did not attend the meeting is 
false.  The part where he said the price was not – the final price was 
not reached in terms of negotiations is correct, because that is when 
we had asked them to go home and then give us a background of how 
did they reach the amount that they had proposed to the Acting CEO at 
10 
that time.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And then at 8 – paragraph 8, he says:  
“My only involvement was where I received an e-
mail from Mr Jules Heirs indicating the offer to 
purchase and price offered.  I then forwarded this 
e-mail on 11 July 2016 to Advocate Memela asking 
if this was correct and that my department need to 
issue the invoice.” 
A copy of this e-mail trail is attached as Annexure SV2.  
Advocate Memela’s response was and there is another correction here.  
20 
He indicates that:  
“The response was yessed, and this was the price 
we agreed on.  This was on this e-mail that I 
proceeded to draft an invoice.” 
But he has corrected that again at page 750 because what Ms 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 77 of 216 
 
Memela’s e-mail reflects was:  
“Yes Stan, that was the reviewed price.” 
But let us go to the actual e-mail so that we can follow it, and 
you will pick that up at page 747 in the same bundle DD25B.  Ms 
Memela you may need to just go back a page to 746 so that we can see 
the start of the e-mail.   
 
The content of which appears at 747.  If you go right to the 
bottom of 746 can you tell us what e-mail that is? 
MS MEMELA:   So, 747 will be in Mr Human’s thing? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No, we are still in the same document that was 
10 
handed in of Mr Vosloo.  It is an attachment to his e-mail so if you just 
go on further in the pack that you have in front of you, and you go to 
page 746. 
MS MEMELA:   Oh okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Let us start at the bottom of that page.  There 
is an e-mail there right at the bottom from Khosi Sokhulu, do you see 
that? 
MS MEMELA:   At the 746 or 747? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, 746 right at the bottom is the start of the 
e-mail.  Do you see that? 
20 
MS MEMELA:   I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And who does Ms Sokhulu send the e-mail to? 
MS MEMELA:   Ms Sokhulu Sir, is sending the message to Advocate 
Memela. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And who else? 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 78 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:   It is just Advocate Memela. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I think also after that it says “Jules” does it 
not? 
MS MEMELA:   After that it is Jules. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes, so she sent to both you and Jules.  Who is 
Jules? 
MS MEMELA:  Jules is the CEO as per the proposal from JM – is the 
CEO of JM.  I do not know JM Aviation South Africa or JM International 
but ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what was the date of the e-mail? 
10 
MS MEMELA:  It was the 7 t h  – no, no, it was the 21 s t of June 2016. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That was the day you had the meeting, is that 
right? 
MS MEMELA:  That is day of the meeting ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what time was it sent? 
MS MEMELA:  At 14:39. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If you go over the page to 747, what does Ms 
Sokhulu say to you in her e-mail? 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Okay.   
“Dear Advocate Memela, thank you for meeting with us 
today with regards to the Ground Power Units.  We 
would like to give a brief explanation as to how we 
reached our offer, price of 225 000 per GPU. At present 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 79 of 216 
 
the are newer generation models under a year old 
available in the market that can be purchased at very 
competitive pricing.  In addition, the worldwide second-
hand market for GPU’s is soft currently due to the 
negative economic environment.  In consideration of our 
discussion we are able to amend our offer price to 248 
000 per GPU.  Best regards Khosi Sokhulu.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  She sends that e-mail only to you as a 
representative of SAAT?  Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  She send it to me, yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then you will see above that there is 
another e-mail they sent on the 7 t h of July 2016.  Who is that from and 
to? 
MS MEMELA:  7 t h of July. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  It was coming from Jules. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is Mr Aires, A-i-r-e-s, for the record. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  He is the JM Aviation ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  JM Aviation. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Representative and who does he sent it to? 
MS MEMELA:  He is sending it to Stan. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is Mr Vosloo. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 80 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:  Vosloo. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  H’mm.-hmm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And who else? 
MS MEMELA:  And Vuyiso Mbonani being the Senior Manager SCM.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and what does he say in that e-mail? 
MS MEMELA:  He says: 
“Hi Stan, below is our offer to purchase letter.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then above that there is a communication 
between Mr Vosloo and yourself. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you see that? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  When what date was that? 
MS MEMELA:  The date is 11 July 2016. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what does Mr Vosloo say to you in that e-
mail which is a forward of Mr Aires e-mail below? 
MS MEMELA:  He is saying; 
“Hi Nontsasa, this is the only information I received on 
the sale of the GPU’s to Swissport.” 
20 
Do you agree with this and that we issue an invoice as per 
below? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then your response as I have it is above 
that.  What did you say in response to Mr Vosloo? 
MS MEMELA:  I say; 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 81 of 216 
 
“Yes Stan, that was the reviewed price.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  Now if Mr Vosloo was at this meeting with 
you, why did you not just say to him, Stan you were at the meeting you 
know what was discussed. 
MS MEMELA:  Uh-huh man.  Chair, that would not cover the fact that 
he was there or not.  Ms Hofmeyr wants me – he wants an e-mail that 
would have said, Stan, you were in the meeting.  That is the price.  I 
cannot say that because remember I had said as much as I do not 
agree with Mr Stan saying he did not attend the meeting, I agree with 
him that the final price was not finalised because we had sent the guys 
10 
to go and check how did they reach the conclusion.  So, me saying, yes 
Stan, that is the reviewed price and ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that a reference to ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  To the reviewed ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  To the fact that the price had been reviewed after the 
meeting? 
MS MEMELA:  After the meeting yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, which anyone who had attended might not have 
known. 
MS MEMELA:  Would understand, exactly. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  Because remember during the meeting Chair on the 
proposal that was received from Mr Malola-Phiri, the amount was 
lesser.  And when Khosi Sokhulu wrights to us – writes to me, the 
amount is now more by 20 000 after we had questioned that.  So, Stan 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 82 of 216 
 
says, okay on that this is the only information I have.  Is this the price?  
And I said, yes Stan that was the reviewed price.  Because I knew that 
he understood exactly what the background was.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes, because I mean if he did not understand the 
background Chair he would have said, what do you mean the reviewed 
price?  Ja, I mean what was it before?  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So, can I just clarify, your evidence is then in 
that meeting the price was not finally agreed.  Is that right? 
MS MEMELA:  That is what I said Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
MS MEMELA:  Initially, I said to you, I disagree with Stan Vosloo that 
he was not part of the meeting but I agree with him that he was – the 
price was not finalised because we had asked JM people to go back 
and check how did they reach the price. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So, who finally agreed on the price then if it did 
not take place at that meeting? 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Who finally agree? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or who determined it? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who determined it ...(intervenes). 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 83 of 216 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  From SAAT side? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay.  From SAAT side Chair that will be quite – 
because remember the question now I understand it is, who made the 
final decision of the price? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  Remember the only time that you can say I have made 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe let us start a little earlier.   
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because your e-mail said, yes that is the reviewed 
price. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who did the reviewing of the price? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay, the review after they had gone back Chair 
...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I think that might have been me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It might have been me.  Okay, who did the reviewing 
20 
that you talk about in the e-mail. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay, the review was done by JM Aviation after they 
went and check and they came back with the reason why they have put 
that proposal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They came back with a revised price. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 84 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:  Yes, and then they came back with a revised price. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Offer. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MS MEMELA:  Remember the offer was made to in April to the Acting 
CEO Mr Malola-Phiri who said to them, no do not worry I am still going 
to go to the Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  I am still going to go to the Exco and stuff and then I 
will get back to you once I get the approval. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, that is fine.  I think Ms Hofmeyr then wants 
to find out who at SAAT responded and said the revised offer from JM 
is fine?  Who made that decision if you do know? 
MS MEMELA:  Oh, responding to ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja to this revised offer from JM. 
MS MEMELA:  No there was no e-mail made back to JM saying, okay 
we agree or maybe – we just continued with the transaction. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes, but I am interested in knowing who in 
20 
SAAT then agreed to the 248 0000 per unit sale price? 
MS MEMELA:  The one with the extra 20 000? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The one referred to in Ms Sokhulu’s e-mail of 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 85 of 216 
 
21 June. 
MS MEMELA:  I would say Chair because that is what they came back 
with after the negotiation and then we continued and then it was sent to 
Stan Vosloo who is responsible for drawing out the invoice.  And then 
he used what was revised by JM and then he asked me to confirm is 
this was the revised price.  So, to say who made that final decision will 
be to say, okay I said based on this, this was the final decision.  
Remember Chair, my duty as the HOD SCM is to run tenders and 
ensure that tenders adhere to the processes and this one it did not go 
on a tender because the Board had already made the decision. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no, I understand that. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see I think what Ms Hofmeyr wants is you have a 
situation where at the meeting of 21 June ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In 21 June? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At that meeting you have told me the price was not 
finalised. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have told me that JM was asked to go back and 
look at the price and then they came back. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they made an increased offer.  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  H’mm. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 86 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now at some stage somebody from SAAT had to say, 
this revised offer is acceptable.  And Ms Hofmeyr’s question is, do you 
know who that is? 
MS MEMELA:  I think Chair it would now be based on the invoice that 
was signed by the Acting CEO and myself co-signing as a witness.  But 
all I am saying is that because remember the line of questioning by Ms 
Hofmeyr was referring to the amount from the Asset Register that was 
included in the submission by Mr Arson Malola-Phiri and then now I 
also want to bring your attention to the fact that he actually signed the 
revised and final amount.  As much as he made that submission to the 
10 
Board because remember that is way – the reason why I said let us go 
back to the Minutes.  Because I know that during the discussion with 
the JM guys, we – they actually asked and said, okay we are aware that 
the GPU’s were used for other things ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay Ms Memela. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The question is simple. 
MS MEMELA:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were instructed to negotiate, is that right? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  When you negotiate you need to know what 
authority you have.  What you can agree to and what you do not have 
power to agree to. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what issues where you would need to refer it to 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 87 of 216 
 
your principles. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you can agree to.  Now did you have the 
authority to accept that revised offer on behalf of SAAT yourself? 
MS MEMELA:  I did not have the authority to accept that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not have.  Did you accept it? 
MS MEMELA:  I did not write an e-mail to say we accept the price. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  I think because now there are no evidence that shows 
that I had spoken to the Acting CEO. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  And gave him a feedback that, okay here is the amount 
that came back.  Because the fact that we have now the invoice Chair 
that states the amount that was revised and signed by the CEO shows 
that either was a discussion with the CEO that, okay here is the amount 
that they came back with therefore ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  But did you discuss the revised offer with this Acting 
CEO? 
MS MEMELA:  My understanding Chair as much as I do not remember I 
understand Arson as a person who would not sign anything until he 
20 
understands or until he knows that, okay here is the feedback.  This is 
what we did and then here is the feedback. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm, do you know whether the Acting CEO accepted 
the revised offer whether in writing or not in writing as did he 
communicate to you that this was an acceptable price? 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 88 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:  There is no written communication Chair except with the 
invoice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But verbally? 
MS MEMELA:  Sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Verbally, did he communicate to you that this price 
was acceptable? 
MS MEMELA:  As much as I do not remember I cannot – remember I 
said things that I cannot remember I cannot say ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  That were there but I am basing my assumption to the 
10 
fact that the fact that he signed the invoice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  For that amount. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Showed that we had a discussion verbally. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Before he signed the invoice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr, I know that you might wish to round off 
20 
the point. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do want to take an adjournment as soon as we can.  
So, but maybe you might be needing ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There are probably two points. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 89 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Two.  Ja, that is fine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If I may just follow up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, that is fine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela you were the only person on 21 s t of 
June at SAAT who was sent the reviewed price by JM Aviation, correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Chair, yes according to the e-mail yes, I was the only 
person who was sent the reviewed price by JM.  As much as on April 
also the Acting CEO and the Acting CEO Mr Zwane were the ones you 
were sent the proposal from JM. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  I was not part of that e-mail. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  But it is the reviewed price that SAAT 
sold the GPU’s on and you were the only person at SAAT who received 
the reviewed price, correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  I understand your testimony a moment 
ago to the Chair to be you did not have the authority yourself to agree 
to that reviewed price on behalf of SAAT.  Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes, I did not have the authority.  But when it was 
signed by the CEO it means I had a discussion with him. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right so, your evidence is you did not have the 
authority yourself but you do recall a discussion with the CEO about the 
review price and that is why you and he – well he issued the invoice 
and you signed it as a witness.  Is that your evidence? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes, that is my evidence. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 90 of 216 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  We can take the break Chair and then 
we will return if that is suitable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, that is fine.  As I indicated earlier on, we are 
going to take an extended lunch because of some commitment that I 
need to attend to.  We are at 12:20, we will resume at 14:20. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is something that I could not avoid.  We adjourn. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
10 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us proceed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela just before we broke for the lunch 
adjournment we were in your second bundle that is DD25B and we had 
been looking at those communications between yourself and Mr Vosloo.  
You will find that at page 746 of Exhibit DD25B.   
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Oh sorry. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There seems to be an objection. 
20 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Chair I am not objecting.  I just want to 
put in a reminder before we adjourned there had been a request from 
Ms Hofmeyr that Ms Memela should find the Original Minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no that is fine. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  They have been found. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 91 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  I just want to put that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Some of these – you can just make a note and 
give to her and she will then run with it.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela you will see at page 746, do you 
have that? 
MS MEMELA:  I have it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela if you will put on your – thank you – 
10 
your microphone. 
MS MEMELA:  Oh ja sorry. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So I just want to get the chronology right to 
recap where we left off.  Is it correct that on the 21 s t of June after your 
meeting with JM Aviation they sent back the reviewed priced and that is 
what is contained at page 747, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then it seems on the 7 t h of July Mr Vosloo 
is sent by Mr Aires the offer to purchase, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then you respond – he forwards that to you 
a few days later on the 11 t h of July and asks you whether you agree to 
this and that we issue the invoice and then you respond to him on the 
11 t h of July “yes Stan that was the review price”, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay which part must I agree on? 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 92 of 216 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just the chronology.  So what happens is they 
send the review price back on the 21 s t of June. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  They then send an offer to purchase on the 7 t h 
of July? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Vosloo engages you on the 11 t h of July to 
understand from you whether you agree to that price and that an 
10 
invoice be issued, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  That is correct Chair.  What I wanted to find out was – it 
was – she said the offer to purchase was forwarded to me so that is 
why I wanted to be clear what I am agreeing to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no she is coming to what ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What she wanted you to confirm. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then you confirm for him on the 11 t h of July 
at page 746. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  “Yes Stan that was the reviewed price”, 
correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then in your evidence just before the break 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 93 of 216 
 
you said you understood that you did not have the authority yourself to 
agree on the purchase price that would be paid and so you had some 
engagements with Mr Phiri about that, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes I did not have authority. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you did speak to him about it? 
MS MEMELA:  I did. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you speak to anyone other than him? 
MS MEMELA:  I would not remember Chair; I would not remember but I 
10 
am sure I would only speak to him since he is the one who actually 
instructed us. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  And in terms of the chronology can you 
place it in time?  Was it somewhere between the formal offer on the 7 t h 
and your confirmation on the 11 t h July? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay the e-mail from Ms Sokhulu was on the 21 June 
2016 where he was – she was coming back with the feedback on – on 
the price.  And you can see then Jules sent an e-mail to Stan on the 7 t h 
of July.  I think maybe a week or two after – yes.  So Chair Stan 
forwards the e-mail to me or maybe sends the e-mail to me with the 
20 
same subject on the 11 July 2016. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Correct. 
MS MEMELA:  And saying this is the only information I received on the 
sale of GPU’s.  Remember Chair there is nowhere in these e-mails 
where it shows that I had actually given Stan Vosloo a background on 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 94 of 216 
 
the sale of GPU’s.  Yet when he writes to me he says this is the only 
information I received on the sale of the GPU’s to Swissport.  Do you 
agree to this and that we issue an invoice as per below?  And I say, yes 
Stan that was the reviewed price.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes I was asking when you likely spoke to Mr 
Phiri about it?  Was it somewhere on the 11 t h, was it prior to that, what 
do you recall? 
MS MEMELA:  I do not recall.  But like I am sure that I spoke to him 
after I had received an e-mail from Ms Sokhulu. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  The reason for that Chair I do not know if you will allow 
because then it will ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  Give clarity to you in terms of the Minutes that I wanted 
to refer to earlier on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  Which will help me answer the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  Of Ms Hofmeyr. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine.  That will – those would help you to have 
20 
a better idea. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you might have spoken to him – would have 
spoken to him? 
MS MEMELA:  Exactly. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 95 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us do that.  What page are they? 
MS MEMELA:  I will give you the page just now Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MS MEMELA:  It is the file Exhibit DD25A Nontsasa Memela.  Chair it is 
page 193 File DD25NM page 193.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Yes can you pick up the part that reminds 
you – that helps you that will help you to say when you would have 
spoken to the acting CEO? 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. The part Chair it is not like really reminding me of 
the date when I spoke to the Acting CEO.  But it reminds me that I 
spoke to him based on what was discussed on the Board Meeting – in 
the Board – during the Board Meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so you – the Minutes help you confirm that you did 
speak to him? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But as to when you are not sure? 
MS MEMELA:  I do not remember.  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it would have been after you got the e-mail from 
20 
Ms Sokhulu? 
MS MEMELA:  After that.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Ms Memela one last point of recap.  
You indicated that there was no other correspondence between yourself 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 96 of 216 
 
and JM Aviation after you received the e-mail from Ms Sokhulu on the 
21 s t June, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  I said I do not remember if there was any communication 
but I do not remember accepting or accepting the offer as final.  
Because I do not have that authority to accept the offer as final. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can we go to in Exhibit DD25B page 616?   
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the page number? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  616 Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  616 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes of DD25B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  Page? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  616.   
MS MEMELA:  Is it DD25B, Nontsasa Memela? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies we are out of order again by one so 
please go to your page 615. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just tell her the Exhibit Number? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is in the same one. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  25. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   DD25B at page 615.  What is this document Ms 
Memela? 
MS MEMELA:  This is the disposal of South African Airways Technical.  
It is an operated Ground Power Unit. This is the document that is sent 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 97 of 216 
 
to either the bidder or the person who has won the bidder or – we 
finalised on. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And did you author this document? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes I am the author of it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what – who was it addressed to? 
MS MEMELA:  It is addressed to – Attention Khosi Sokhulu, JM 
Aviation. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And the date? 
10 
MS MEMELA:  The date is 22 June 2016. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The day after you got the review price from JM 
Aviation, correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Will you read into the record what you said to 
Ms Sokhulu in the first line? 
MS MEMELA:  “Dear Ms Sokhulu your proposal for the purchase 
of the GPU’s on behalf of Swissport was approved by the 
Board of SAAT that in accordance with the contract 
between SAA and Swissport.  Kindly note that the 
20 
approval is based in the latest price review by 
yourselves.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And carry on. 
MS MEMELA:  “We hereby extend our congratulations to both 
companies and look forward to a mutual beneficial 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 98 of 216 
 
business relationship.  Should you require any further 
information and clarification?” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Ms Memela your evidence this 
morning was that you did not ever understand JM Aviation to be acting 
on behalf of Swissport.  Why did you say in your letter to JM Aviation 
on the 22 n d of June 2016 then that you understood that they were 
purchasing the GPU’s on behalf of Swissport? 
MS MEMELA:  Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  I did not say I did not remember them acting on behalf 
of Swissport. The question was this morning from Ms Hofmeyr how did I 
know that JM was the agent of Swissport?  Did we raise that during the 
meeting?  And I raised that on the 21 s t of April 2016 before the Board 
Meeting the proposal was sent to the acting CEO where they were 
actually proposing the – what you call it? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The purchase? 
MS MEMELA:  Exactly.  And then when Arson was responding to them 
and saying, okay we will get back to you after the Board processed 
20 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Board Meeting. 
MS MEMELA:  And Exco process – once they get approval like they – 
got back to JM.  So I never said like I did not understand them as – I 
said like that was picked up from there because that is why I seen after 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 99 of 216 
 
the Board approval he gave us an instruction to negotiate. So I am not 
– I am not …(speaking over one another). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You also said I think had an issue with the term 
agent. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you said you understood them to be a BEE 
...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  BEE Company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Partner or component and so on. 
10 
MS MEMELA:    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes that is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela the transcript will reflect the 
evidence.  I recall the question being put to you by myself first and 
then the Chair in particular whether you understood them to be acting 
on behalf of Swissport.  That is after we had the debate about the 
agency.  Is your evidence now that you did understand them to be 
acting on behalf of Swissport in their negotiations with SAAT? 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Chair there was even a point that I made that we were 
not aware that they were going to resell to Swissport.  But we 
understood that like as their BEE or sub-contractor of Swissport they 
would operate them as the – SAAT was operating them at that time.  Ms 
Hofmeyr went as far as asking me about the 30% set aside that if I 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 100 of 216 
 
thought it was them did I then agree with the 30% set aside.  Since 
yesterday – on Friday I have said I did not agree with it legally.  So I 
am not sure.  Like I mean where exactly – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  Let us try and get clarification. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is your answer to the question whether you 
knew that they were acting on behalf of Swissport? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja did you – were you aware of that?  Were you not 
10 
aware of that at the time? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay Chair.  Remember after the Board Resolution was 
sent to us by Arson Malola-Phiri I even said he sent me a Board 
Resolution, he sent me the proposal that was sent to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  Hang on. 
MS MEMELA:  And then plus the third one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes hang on. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Memela. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I want us to go back to just before lunch where you 
were able to give very crisp answers. 
MS MEMELA:  Give straight – okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Answers yes, yes.  The question is, where you – what 
do you say now?  Were you aware or were you not aware at that time 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 101 of 216 
 
that they were acting on behalf of Swissport? 
MS MEMELA:  I was aware based on the proposal Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  Like I said before lunch. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you make any enquiries from them about 
what Swissport was willing to pay SAAT for the GPU’s? 
MS MEMELA:  I did not make an enquiry on that.  Because remember 
you made me read – oh in fact you read the provision before break that 
it will be sold to the Swissport BEE Company.  So ja. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela we do not need to have a legal 
debate about what 8.1 and 8.2 means.  It does not say in its terms that 
Swissport is going to procure the GPU’s through the BEE Company.  All 
that I am getting clarity on now is a matter of fact whether you ever 
engaged with JM Aviation as to what price Swissport was willing to pay 
SAAT for the GPU’s? 
MS MEMELA:  Chair I would not ask that question because Swissport 
did not make any proposal or I was never given an instruction by the 
acting CEO to discuss with Swissport. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then you go on in your letter and – to JM 
20 
Aviation the day after you have met with them to say: 
“Kindly note that the approval” 
That is the approval of the Board I take it that you were 
referring to in the previous sentence. 
“Is based on the latest price review by yourselves.” 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 102 of 216 
 
Do you see that? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Had you communicated with the Board about 
whether they agreed to this price review that you indicated to JM 
Aviation on the 22 n d of September they had accepted? 
MS MEMELA:  Have I – okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja I do not communicate with the Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  So I did not communicate with the Board. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But did you know whether anybody had communicated 
with the Board to establish that they were happy with the price? 
MS MEMELA:  According to the Board Resolution Chair the Board had 
never said like the price after it is finalised should go back to them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  That statement that Ms Hofmeyr is referring to where I 
said the Board had approved.  Remember Arson’s e-mail to Jules when 
he responded and said, I am going to go to Exco and the Board and 
20 
after approval I will get back to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  So like that statement is referring to that part.  Not to 
the Board.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well let us look at this letter if we may Ms 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 103 of 216 
 
Memela because the first sentence says: 
“Your proposal for the purchase of the GPU’s on 
behalf Swissport by approved by the Board of SAAT 
and in accordance with the contract between SAA 
and Swissport.” 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   The very next sentence says: 
“Kindly note that the approval.” 
What approval is that? 
MS MEMELA:  Kindly note that the approval is based in the latest price 
10 
review by yourselves. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes let us stop at Kindly note that the approval. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What approval are you referring to there? 
MS MEMELA:  I am talking about the approval of the reviewed price.  
The latest price that they put on the table that was discussed with the 
acting CEO of SAAT. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you discuss it with the acting CEO of SAAT 
20 
before the 22 n d of June? 
MS MEMELA:  Before the 22 n d June – I said like I discussed after the 
e-mail that was coming from JM. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes between that. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 104 of 216 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you had his agreement by that stage? 
MS MEMELA:  I have had? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  His agreement by that stage? 
MS MEMELA:  I am sure I did. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you not – you do not accept that the 
approval you are referring to here is the approval of the Board that you 
have been referring in the previous sentence? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay Chair.  I just need to give clarity for your 
understanding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  My understanding is that Arson Malola-Phiri when he 
was writing that submission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  To the Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  He was writing based on the proposal that was made by 
JM. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  And then his understanding or maybe the knowledge now 
that Swissport and SAA had concluded a contract.  Ja – so him 
20 
discussing and tabling this whole submission to the Board involved that 
we were going to deal with the BEE Company of Swissport being JM.  
Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let me just – I think what Ms Hofmeyr is trying to 
establish is that.  In the first sentence of that letter dated 22 June 2016 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 105 of 216 
 
addressed to Mr Sokhulu of JM Aviation. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say your proposal for the purchase of the GPU’s 
on behalf of Swissport was approved by the Board of SAAT.  And then 
in the next sentence you say, “kindly note that the approval”.  And that 
approval as I read and you must tell me if I am wrong. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That approval can only refer to the approval you talk 
about in the first sentence. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That approval of the Board was based on the latest 
price review. 
MS MEMELA:  Price review. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By yourselves. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now my reading of what you are saying here suggests 
that you are saying that there are – the Board provided its approval 
being aware of the review to price.  Is my understanding of what you 
are saying correct? 
MS MEMELA:  That was not my understanding or maybe the 
20 
interpretation when I authored this letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is not what you were conveying? 
MS MEMELA:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What did you intend to convey when you said, “kindly 
note that the approval is based on the latest price review by 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 106 of 216 
 
yourselves”? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay the approval – remember Chair the proposal by JM 
Aviation.  Let us go back to the date.  It was 21 April 2016 which was 
before the Board Meeting in the 15 t h of June 2016.  So when Arson took 
the submission to the Board to request them to dissolve these – or to 
sell the GPU’s it was in that understanding that it – the GPU’s will be 
sold to the BEE Company of Swissport.  Yes.  So when we were 
negotiating in terms of the price it was after the Board had approved.  
So we did not go back to the Board nor do I have any maybe 
understanding if whether the acting CEO went back to the Board or 
10 
maybe the Board or maybe the company secretary to confirm.  Yes that 
is why I said earlier on the fact that the acting CEO signed the invoice 
shows that he actually agreed with the price. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But tell me what your understanding of that first 
sentence is?  That second sentence I am sorry.  Because as I read it, it 
seems to imply that you are saying, the Board when it granted its 
approval of the purchase was aware of the latest price review by JM. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay Chair.  My understanding of this sentence is that I 
was trying to bind them to the latest price review.  Remember before 
Arson went to the Board they had proposed a different amount.  Right 
20 
and then after the Board approval we discussed with them, negotiated 
and they went back and checked and then came back with a reviewed 
price with R20 000 more.  So this was ensuring that when maybe we 
finalise or have the invoice or we will have the correct reviewed price.  
They will not go back to the previous price on the proposal on the – 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 107 of 216 
 
what April 2016.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So are you saying that you were not necessarily 
saying in this sentence that the Board was aware of the reviewed 
price?  You were saying the Board has provided its approval but you 
must know that when we talk about the approval we talk about the 
latest review. 
MS MEMELA:  The review yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And not the earlier price. 
MS MEMELA:  The price that they ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Price. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  They sent to the acting CEO. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Before the Board Meeting yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay Ms Hofmeyr do you want to take it further? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  When the Board met on the 
15 t h of June it was told that the GPU’s would be sold at their current 
asset value was it not? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes, yes Chair it was told that they will be sold at the 
current asset value. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm.  And now they were going to be sold at 
20 
R248 000 per unit which was not the current asset value, correct 
MS MEMELA:  Chair before I answer that then let – this is the part 
where I find it relevant that I read that provision of the Minutes that I 
kept on referring to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Is it a brief part? 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 108 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:  It is just a brief part Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay read it. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Could you give us the page again please? 
MS MEMELA:  Oh okay.  The page of the Minutes from DD25 it is 1 – 
sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  25B? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  A. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  Oh it is page 193.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Chair can I – before I go there can I read just for the 
court purposes who was in attendance? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  And present. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  During this Board Meeting held 15 June 2018 
present was Ms Yakhe Kwinana, non-executive Director Chairperson.  
20 
Dr J Tambi, non-executive Director.  Mr M Zwane, Executive Director 
acting Group CEO.  Mr D Eria, Chief Financial Officer.  In attendance 
there was Mr M Malola-Phiri, acting Chief Executive Officer of SAAT.  
Ms P Nhantsi, SAA interim Chief Financial Officer.  Ms U Figelephi, 
SAA GM Legal Risk and Compliance. Mr S Vilikazi, SAA Chief Audit 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 109 of 216 
 
Executive.  Ms M Makake, Deputy Company Secretary and apologies 
were from.  Ms R Ibuka.  So I just want to read Chair now where it talks 
about the depreciation of the GPU’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Which made me understood – understand that when 
Arson agreed to this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  It was because of this part of the Minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  “The submission proposed that SAAT should 
10 
...(intervenes).” 
CHAIRPERSON:  You ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Oh sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page are you reading from? 
MS MEMELA:  Page 197. 
CHAIRPERSON:  197? 
MS MEMELA:  Ja second paragraph. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  “The submission proposed that SAAT should 
consider whether to recover the difference between the 
20 
purchase value of the GPU’s and the current asset value 
from SAA.  The Interim Chief Financial Officer and the 
GM Legal Risk Compliance indicated that SAAT had been 
utilising the GPU’s whilst SAA was resolving its 
contractual issues with its ground handling service 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 110 of 216 
 
provider.  Therefore the reduction in value of the GPU’s 
was due to the depreciation and was not a loss.”   
This was during the Board Meeting Chair made by the Group 
CFO and the Group GM Legal Risk and Compliance.  So to respond to 
Ms Hofmeyr’s question where it says okay then you decided to sell at 
the – but 248 at the end. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not say roof of there? 
MS MEMELA:  Did I say? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you said Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Ms Hofmeyr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  So Chair the amount there that was signed for in the 
invoice between my – like between myself and the acting CEO Arson 
Malola-Phiri my understanding then – now that I am reading is that the 
reason why he agreed on that price instead of going back to what he 
had written on his submission is what was raised by Group CFO and 
GM Legal.   And there was that understanding that the shortfall of the 
20 
amount will be recovered from SAA.  Because remember the reason 
SAAT bought these GPU’s was to provide services to SAA.  They did 
not buy them like for the purposes that they were used for. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela the paragraph that you have drawn 
our attention to which is the same paragraph that was in the extract of 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 111 of 216 
 
the Minutes that we read into the record earlier. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is not comparing the current asset value of the 
GPU’s and the sale price that was eventually agreed with JM Aviation.  
It is comparing the purchase price at which SAAT bought the GPU’s the 
year before and the current asset value that had been communicated to 
the Board by Mr Phiri. 
MS MEMELA:  Oh did you make that calculation Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No I am saying the words say the submission 
proposed that SAAT should consider whether to recover the difference 
10 
between the purchase value of the GPU’s.  That is the price that SAAT 
paid for them a year earlier and the current asset value from SAA which 
is the current asset value that was set out in Mr Phiri’s submission to 
the Board. That is the difference between the purchase price of about 
R782 000 which is reflected on the invoice and the R648 000 which was 
the current asset value.  This is a debate between the Members of the 
Board because we have seen the record of the proceedings.  It is a 
debate between whether SAAT can recover from SAA because it is 
being forced to sell these units.  The difference between the price it 
paid when it bought them and the price that SAAT was going to be 
20 
selling them at the current asset value.  I put it to you Ms Memela that 
this paragraph has absolutely nothing to do with the difference between 
the current asset value that went before the Board and it agreed to sell 
these GPU’s at which was R648 000 odd and the R248 000 a few weeks 
later that was agreed with JM Aviation.   
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 112 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:  The current asset value ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you have a response? 
MS MEMELA:  The current asset value Chair based on what?  On the 
Asset Register that she rejected later or what? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No Ms Memela. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well what ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Based on the submission of the CEO to the 
Board of SAAT. 
MS MEMELA:  Do you know where the acting CEO got that amount? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well hang on Ms Memela. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr has put something to you. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just listen to her I am going to ask her to repeat and 
then tell me what you say about what she is putting to you? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela the paragraph that you have read 
from the extracts of the Minute refers to a comparison between the 
purchase price that SAAT paid for the GPU’s and the current asset 
value.  And whether that difference should be recovered by SAAT from 
SAA.  It has nothing to do with the current asset value at the time that 
20 
the Board met and the later review price that you agreed with JM 
Aviation should be paid.  Do you have a response to that? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay my response Chair will be that even Ms Hofmeyr 
does not know what the current asset value was at that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no.  Do you agree or do you not agree with 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 113 of 216 
 
her proposition? 
MS MEMELA:  I do not agree Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Namely that the paragraph you have read has nothing 
to do with the issue of the current value at the time of the assets to the 
price that they were going to be paid for by ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  JM. 
CHAIRPERSON:  JM Aviation.  That is the point she is making.  She is 
saying her interest is on something else.  You are referring her to a 
paragraph that deals with something else.  Not with what she is 
interested in. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  For me Chair ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  It is relevant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MS MEMELA:  That paragraph it is relevant and you will find out during 
re-examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let us deal with it now.  The submission 
proposed that SAAT should consider whether to recover the difference 
the purchase value of the GPU’s and the current asset value from SAA.  
That seems to support what Ms Hofmeyr says.  That sentence.  It says 
20 
– it talks about the purchase value of the GPU’s and the current asset 
value from SAA. 
MS MEMELA:  Chair, the ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the face of it seems to support what she is saying. 
MS MEMELA:  I was bringing your attention from the sentence where it 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 114 of 216 
 
says: 
“The Interim Chief Financial Officer ...(intervenes).” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  “ ... and GM ...(intervenes).” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  “ ... Legal Risk Compliance indicated that 
SAAT had been utilising the GPU’s whilst SAA was 
resolving its contractual issues with its ground 
handling service provider.  Therefore the reduction 
in value of the GPU’s was due to the depreciation 
10 
and was not a loss.” 
So now I am talking depreciation.  That is why I was actually 
asking if Ms Hofmeyr – I know.  Maybe she has not done that or maybe 
she had proof. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  That is why I was asking if she has proof like she had 
earlier this morning that there was that Asset Register which then we 
rejected, because it did not say who was it coming from.  So I am 
saying for us to actually agree that okay the current value of the GPU’s 
at that time were the amount that the Acting CEO had put there. 
20 
There shall be a document that supports that.  So that is why 
I am saying I do not agree to that, because she is saying current – 
based on the submission by the Acting CEO – only the Acting CEO can 
explain maybe when he gets a chance to come here and say I came up 
with this amount based on this and that.  If it is not here. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 115 of 216 
 
It is not helping us and it is not helping Chair to give you a 
proper answer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Hofmeyr, Chair – I am referring to myself.  I 
see that Ms Mbanjwa has her hand up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I do not know if she can ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Mbanjwa. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  I just want to point out something. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  The reason why there is a difficulty with 
that paragraph which appears in page 197. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Is because the questions that are put to 
Ms Memela ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Are based on a flawed premise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
20 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  If there is going to be an attack 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  On the review price to say the review price 
was below the current asset value. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 116 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Then we need to have certain inputs and 
the inputs come from the Asset Register. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  The Asset Register must say when were 
the GP Units acquired. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  How are they depreciated and what is the 
basis of the depreciation and with that depreciation having been 
applied then the current asset value is this amount.  What Ms Hofmeyr 
10 
now is doing is taking a floating paragraph and is insinuating that these 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Remember is it Ms Memela who referred to this 
paragraph. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA: 
 Yes. 
 The 
reason 
why 
Ms Memela 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not Ms Hofmeyr. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Yes Chair.  The reason why there is a 
20 
difficulty and why Ms Memela is dealing with this is because it is the 
line of questioning and I do not want to be critical.  This is a 
complicated matter in the sense that firstly it is an accounting Asset 
Register entry. 
MS MEMELA:  H’mm. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 117 of 216 
 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  It is for that reason why when Ms Memela 
objected to the Asset Register.  I supported that objection, because I 
knew for a fact that if the Asset Register is not validated as an 
evidential document.  Then it means the inputs are going to be 
incorrect or she is going to be cross-examined on inputs that are not 
really properly there. 
So what I suggest Chair is this with your permission and I am 
not shielding Ms Memela with asking questions.  Can we deal with two 
things concerning this question of the price?  Whether the review price 
was the correct, because related to this question is another question 
10 
that has been dealt with in a manner which is not satisfactory to us. 
It is the issue but Chair saw it and tried to analyse to say.  
Was Ms Memela empowered to determine this price?  So if we can be 
given a chance maybe – I know not today.  I want the matter to flow.  To 
deal with those two aspects, because they are directly related.  First 
who had the power to decide the price to dispose of the GPU’s? 
Secondly, where is the genuine Asset Register and where are 
the inputs in the Asset Register and what is the conclusion in the Asset 
Register insofar as what the actual current price was at the time the 
disposal was made ...(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  H’mm. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA: 
 
And 
lastly 
if 
the 
review 
price 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  That is the subject of the e-mails 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 118 of 216 
 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Was below or equivalent ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Or above ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  That price. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  As it pleases Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  That is fine.  Ms Hofmeyr, will deal with what you 
10 
have said, but if necessary later on – you can bear it in mind – later on 
at some stage we can come back to it if necessary, but if we can deal 
with it now.  It is fine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Memela, do you accept 
that Mr Phiri made representations to the Board of SAAT in his 
submission identifying what the asset value was according to the 
register at SAAT? 
MS MEMELA: 
 According 
to 
this 
submission 
Chair 
signed 
by 
Mr Malola-Phiri.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And do you accept that the Board made its 
20 
decision to sell the asset value – to sell the SAAT GPU’s at the asset 
value based on that submission from Mr Phiri? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  What did you to establish the book 
value of the GPU’s before they were sold? 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 119 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:  Chair, like I said earlier on this morning if I remember 
correctly.  I did say that as we were sitting there we discussed with the 
JM representative and asked them how did they reach the conclusion to 
put that amount to their proposal.  Can they actually go back and see 
and at the same time there was no way that we could have known for 
sure how much was the current value at that time based on the book 
value, because I said it was reliant on an outdated system being 
MEMIS. 
Everybody at SAAT knows that system.  It – the software has 
not been updated for years.  Even before I joined SAAT.  So everybody 
10 
who checks the price there Chair in terms of the price catalogue.  They 
were told to not rely on that because it could be something.  It could be 
maybe less or it could be more. 
So they should see if they cannot – they can get something 
else somewhere else.  You know.  So and the Asset Register being 
managed and controlled by finance.  So they are the ones who keep on 
updating.  That is why when I raise this to Ms Hofmeyr like my 
discomfort in terms of the document that she presented to the 
Commission. 
That it was the Asset Register.  It had the dates 2015.  Yet it 
20 
was written by hand 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the short answer is you did not do anything to 
establish the book value.  Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  We did not do anything to establish the book value 
Chair. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 120 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja.  We ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  We relied on the negotiation on the table. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  Based on the ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Initial proposal.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Remember I said I want us to go back to those crisp 
answers. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Crisp – yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what did you do to establish the fair 
market value? 
MS MEMELA:  Chair, I will try to give that crisp answer as much as I 
can. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Remember Chair, for me or maybe for SCM to give – to 
make – to be – to confirm or to be comfortable that the fair market 
value or what is out there at the market we should run a tender.  In this 
20 
regard a tender was not ran and remember Chair I can – we cannot run 
a tender after the Board had decided, because the Board had decided 
based on the submission – based on the proposal made by 
Mr Arson Malola-Phiri and based on the contract between SAA and 
Swissport. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 121 of 216 
 
So to answer Ms Hofmeyr it will be difficult to tell you what - 
what would have been a fair price, because ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No.  I asked what did you do to determine fair 
price. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay.  There was nothing ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  That could have been done ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  At that time, because the tender was not ran.  So there 
is no way that you can determine that without running a tender. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that is despite the fact that clause 8.2 of 
the agreement which is the whole basis for the sale required them to be 
sold either at book value or at fair market value.  Is that right?  You 
could do neither of those inquiries before you sold it? 
MS MEMELA:  Chairperson, the provision that Ms Hofmeyr is referring 
to of the Swissport and SAA Contract was concluded between – it went 
to the Board of SAAT.  You see if maybe the owner of the GPU’s – at 
that time when he actually was showing discomfort or maybe he was 
uncomfortable with selling all 12, but he wanted to sell seven.  Maybe 
he came to SCM. 
20 
Give the instruction or requisition request to go out on the 
market and test the market in terms of what could be found here before 
it went to the Board.  I would have understood, because like then I will 
have something that says there is a requisition form where I mean the 
owner of these GPU’s had requested a procurement to say okay. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 122 of 216 
 
Let us test the market.  Even if so Chair that he had – if he 
had maybe asked us.  Maybe he was going to be told again that okay, 
but this thing has already been decided on the Swissport/SAA Contract.  
Remember I said earlier Chair yes Mr Makaleng raised the fact that he 
was not happy with selling all GPU’s and I said Mr Malola-Phiri, Acting 
CEO, said our hands are tied. 
The Acting CEO said that our hands are tied, because this 
thing has been agreed upon to do this by the high powers.  There is 
absolutely nothing that he could have done and for me to run or test 
the market to get the fair price would have been before the Board 
10 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  And after the instruction Chair, because we do not just 
go out on a tender as we please. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela that letter of the 22 n d of June that 
you wrote.  Were you requested to write that letter to JM Aviation? 
MS MEMELA:  These letters Chair we usually write after we have 
spoken to the person who has given you instruction.  Hence I said I am 
sure after – as much as we do not have evidence.  You do not have 
evidence as well, but after receiving the e-mail from Ms Sokhulu 
20 
confirming that okay this now is the price ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Remember I think your answer is I was not 
requested. 
MS MEMELA:  No, no, no.  My answer is ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were not requested ...(intervenes). 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 123 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:  No.  You do not ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  To write the letter.  That is the question as I 
understood it. 
MS MEMELA:  We write the letter after the agreement Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not have to be requested by anybody? 
MS MEMELA:  You do not have to be requested by anybody. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  Once the approval is done ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that a short answer ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The evidence of Mr Cole of Swissport is that 
they were demanding repeatedly from JM Aviation that they get some 
letter from SAA confirming – sorry SAAT confirming that JM Aviation 
was SAAT’s selected BEE partner for this bid and for this purchase and 
what came back was this letter from you on the 22 n d of June.  Were you 
not requested to provide this letter by JM Aviation? 
MS MEMELA:  Chairperson, this is the letter either of award or when 
20 
the final decision has been made.  I would never write a letter based on 
the supplier requesting me to write it.  That is why I said after they had 
written that e-mail.  Of course it was discussed with the Acting CEO 
and then once it is discussed with the Acting CEO I am sure the 
understanding was to move forward and finalise and then give the letter 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 124 of 216 
 
of award. 
We have never given any letter of awards to people because 
they are asking for them.  We give letter of awards when we know that 
okay the process internally has been done which in this regard it has 
gone through the Broad.  Finalised, approved and we negotiated.  So 
...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  This is a – Ms Mbanjwa sent me a note 
helpfully.  Just to say could I give her the reference to where it is in 
Mr Cole’s affidavit.  I do not suggest we have to go there for present 
purposes, because Ms Memela has indicated she did not receive a 
10 
request, but for the record it is at DD25A. 
It is at page 267 and I will just read it into the record before 
Ms Mbanjwa makes her point.  This is Mr Cole’s affidavit to the 
Commission.  He says: 
“In terms of SAAT’s letter to JM Aviation dated 
22 June 2016 included in Exhibit 18 I wish to stress 
that Swissport South Africa was neither consulted 
on the content of the letter nor do we agree with the 
wording used therein.  The letter was forwarded to 
Swissport South African in response to your 
20 
repeated requests for evidence whether SAA or 
SAAT had officially appointed JM South Africa as a 
B-BBEE partner for the GPU transaction and if so 
whether the parties had reached agreement on the 
sale of the units.” 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 125 of 216 
 
That is what I was putting to Ms Memela. 
MS MEMELA:  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  As the background to why Swissport had 
requested the letter, but I understand Ms Memela’s evidence to be she 
was never told by JM Aviation that such a letter was required. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ms Mbanjwa. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Just very briefly Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Come closer to the mic. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Yes.  I would really beg ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
10 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  That this be this procedure so that I do not 
have to object. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Every time Ms Hofmeyr ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Refers to a document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  That document must first be put to 
Ms Memela ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
20 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  And we must be given a chance to place to 
the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  So that we can read the document and 
understand it for ourselves. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 126 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  It is not correct for her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  That is why I am making this strong 
objection.  To put a statement of a certain Mr Cole which we have not 
seen and cross-examine or ask questions from Ms Memela.  It is very 
prejudicial and we will ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Be forced to object. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no.  It is permissible for her to – for 
10 
Ms Hofmeyr to ask the question first and only go to a document on 
which the question is based later if necessary, because sometimes the 
answer does not make it necessary to go to the document, but 
sometimes the answer makes it necessary. 
So it is a question of choice – a preference.  She might start 
by referring to the document before asking the question or ask the 
question first and if the answer makes it necessary to go to the 
document.  Go to the document, but the answer might not make it 
necessary to go to the document. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  In that case ...(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You understand? 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Yes.  In that case ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Chairperson I will simply take comfort in 
the sense ...(intervenes). 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 127 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  That you said ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  If I feel acute discomfort I must I make an 
objection. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  No, no.  Definitely.  Definitely. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  As it pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair just for the record this is not a document 
that Ms Memela has not seen.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It has been in her bundle and she considered it 
closely before her evidence on Friday for that half an hour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So there is no sense in which she has not seen 
Mr Cole’s affidavit prior to ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  Chair, sorry. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Just to give correction to Ms Hofmeyr. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  This affidavit is the – is ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Am I hearing something that Ms Memela 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 128 of 216 
 
is not saying?  Why do I always hear something like hoof before Meyr? 
MS MEMELA:  Oh.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr. 
MS MEMELA:  Ms Hofmeyr. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  You say Hoofmeyr. 
MS MEMELA:  Hoofmeyr.  I mean ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hofmeyr. 
MS MEMELA:  Chair, ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  No.  It is Hofmeyr. 
MS MEMELA:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No.  I was just wondering whether I am hearing 
something that you are not saying or whether I am hearing something 
you are saying. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja.  She is lucky Chair ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  She is Ms Hofmeyr. 
MS MEMELA:  She is lucky Chair that my surname is quite 
straightforward and very simple. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  So that is why for her it is easy to say Memela. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA: Iif she was using my maiden surname we would be 
correcting every minute. Yes.  So Chair ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No, no.  No.  I just wanted to make sure that the 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 129 of 216 
 
record does not reflect that you called her something ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By a name that is not hers. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  Alright. 
MS MEMELA:  Alright.  Chair, I confirmed that for me I did not read in 
detail the affidavit of Mr Cole, because I never received any 3.3 – yes – 
I even asked Ms Hofmeyr if like this is for my attention and she said 
like it is just for my – what – ease of reference or maybe for 
information. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  So that 30 minutes there is no way that like with me 
applying my mind reading this document I would have finished by the 
time.  I was going through some additional documents where I had 
received ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  3.3.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You – in other words you say you did not understand 
20 
the document ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  I just ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  To be important ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  I just browsed through. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For any ...(intervenes).  Ja.  Okay. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 130 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:  I did not exactly ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  That is fine.  That is fine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Ms Memela, I would like to move 
off the GPU’s now to the components tender, but in just summing it up I 
would like to put to you some of the observations from your evidence so 
that you can comment on them if you need to. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Your evidence before this Commission is that 
you did not take any steps to determine the fair market value of the 
GPU’s.  Is that correct? 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Chair, I want to give you that crisp answer, but it does 
not allow me.  This question does not allow me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you can start by giving the crisp answer 
...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And see whether you want to elaborate, but just 
...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Say yes or no and ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  I did not test the market ...(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  Because the Board had already decided ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you did not check their book value either 
yourself? 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 131 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:  The book value like I said Chair we checked MEMIS 
which was outdated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  So we could not rely on that amount. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you were selling – you were concluding 
this agreement with JM Aviation for the sale price of the GPU’s about a 
month and a bit after JM Aviation had paid the 2.5 million towards your 
Bedfordview house.  Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  I was – sorry. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You were finalising the sale price of the GPU’s 
with JM Aviation. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  About a month and a number of weeks after 
they had paid 2.5 million towards your Bedfordview house.  Is that 
correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Chair, would I be problematic to ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I think you probably want to say when they had 
paid that amount ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  On behalf of your mother? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think that is the point you wanted to ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  That is the point you wanted to make 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 132 of 216 
 
...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Thank you.  It was ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in terms of the time frame she is correct more or 
less a month or so. 
MS MEMELA:  The amount was paid for the sale of the property of my 
mother ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  And towards the purchase of the - or the intention to 
purchase the sale – the property from Cove Ridge. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  So ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  This had nothing to do with the GPU’s and I wanted to 
ask Ms Hofmeyr. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  You see now I am conscience because I kept on saying 
Hoofmeyr.  So ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  Hofmeyr to direct me to the invoice ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Of the GPU’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  Because I would just like ...(intervenes). 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 133 of 216 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Which invoice? 
MS MEMELA:  The invoice of the – when SAAT was ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The sale from SAAT to ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  To JM Aviation. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  JM Aviation? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Not the invoice form JM Aviation to Swissport? 
MS MEMELA:  No.  Remember that has nothing to do with us. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is at DD25B at page 617. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Mbanjwa, I see you raising your hand, but you do 
– you feel apologetic about it and okay. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  I am Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  I just want to make a very quick 
conclusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  There is going to be a problem with these 
conclusions that are put ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
20 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  To the witness ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Because first they are patently incorrect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  We know there has been evidence here to 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 134 of 216 
 
say the 2.5 million was for the purchase of the property at Mpindweni. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Then secondly there is evidence here that 
the decision to dispose ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Of the GP use ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Was from SAA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Not even SAAT.  That is the main holding 
10 
company.  Yet the statement that comes from Ms Hofmeyr is that 
Ms Memela sold these things.  If Ms Memela can – if Ms Hofmeyr can 
just kindly be very careful about the manner in which she words the 
things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but you see all those concerns belong to your 
re-examination. 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  I ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Note them and when you re-examine you highlight 
what you believe is incorrect.  Whatever it is that you believe was 
incorrect which Ms Hofmeyr would have put to her. 
20 
MS LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela, did you share pricing information 
with a bidder about the prices that other bidders had bid for a tender 
while was still open? 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 135 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:  Oh.  Are we now – okay Chair I had the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay.  Just hang on. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was there not a question you had asked or 
proposition you had put to her ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which she was still in the process of answering. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies Chair if that was the case.  I had 
understood – my last question was ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That chronology. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Was the sale of price agreed with JM Aviation 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  A month and a bit after the ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Purchase price ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Had been directed to the Bedfordview house 
20 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And I understood Ms Memela to say after your 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 136 of 216 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Introduction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  HM. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes, but insofar as it was related to a purchase 
for her mother’s ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Property. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR: 
 
That 
had 
concluded 
my 
questions 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  On the GPU and so I was moving to the 
components ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  She said wanted to look at an invoice ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh, right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I do not think she ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  That is right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had made the point ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  She wanted to make on the invoice. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you find the invoice? 
MS MEMELA:  I found the invoice Chair and ...(intervenes). 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 137 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh.  Well where do we find the invoice? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  DD25B at page 617. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do I need to go to it? 
MS MEMELA:  You do not have to Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  I just wanted to check the date ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
MS MEMELA:  And confirm, because Ms Hofmeyr was referring to the 
letter that was sent to JM in terms of telling them that okay.  They – 
this has been approved and then I see that the invoice was signed on 
10 
the 11 t h of July 2016 which I am trying to now give clarity of like.  
These two matters like the payment of the property versus the 
Swissport being finalised and stuff – have absolutely no link in 
between. 
Other than what has been painted out there in the public that 
maybe the amount that was paid for my mother’s property could have 
been found from here.  That is my assumption, because I am trying to 
understand why is this question asked between like I mean.  Okay.  
This 
was 
finalised 
between 
– 
after 
the 
payment 
was 
made 
...(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  And Chair just to add one sentence now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  I remember I promised that I will bring the offer to 
purchase between ...(intervenes). 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 138 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  My mum and Mr Ndzeku ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  And if I remember correctly it was signed around 
November 2015 ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MS MEMELA:  But because I was supposed to go to Eastern Cape 
today to get these documents and stuff and ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  I could not go ...(intervenes). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MS MEMELA:  And I will provide that as soon as I get the chance, 
because I wanted to finalise with this ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  And then make sure that ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  I provide that information and then she is going to see 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA: 
 That 
actually 
this 
was 
signed 
for 
1 November 
20 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  The fact that like the payment for that purchase of that 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 139 of 216 
 
property to ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  To pleasing me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  Is neither here nor there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  Okay.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  I am indebted.  I had 
forgotten about that page.  If we can then move to the components 
tender and then ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  And we moving to the bundle that has got her 
10 
affidavit? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We are indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and where about ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And we will pick it up – I need first actually to 
refer to an aspect of Ms Sambo’s evidence.  So if I could – we do not 
have to go there ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But the response is actually contained in 
Ms Memela’s 
response 
to 
Ms Sambo. 
 
Ms Memela 
you 
recall 
Ms Sambo’s evidence was that you had provided her with a flash disk 
20 
containing pricing information at a point while a certain tender was 
open.  Do you recall that? 
MS MEMELA:  I recall the affidavit by Ms Sambo Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you have denied in response to her that 
you gave her that flash disk. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 140 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Correct. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Are you aware that she found the flash disk and 
provided it to the Commission? 
MS MEMELA:  If you have sent it to me – if you have sent that 
information then it means I have not received it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  I do – I did hear Chair from – comments from of course 
my friends and family that apparently there was a flash disk that was 
10 
shown that Ms Sambo conveniently found it.  After I had said for a 
person who was hell-bent to collect information about me.  To an extent 
where she went to Facebook and took my photos and stuff and then the 
memory stick that she refers to gets lost. 
So for me I – since I did not receive that and maybe 3.3 then 
that says okay.  Now she has found it  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I think let us ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  I did not ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think the brief answer  
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is you never received it prior to your coming to give 
evidence ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you did become aware in the past few days or 
last week from people who told you that in the Commission 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 141 of 216 
 
...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Sambo indicated she had – that she had found it. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So your evidence today is still to deny that you 
gave her the flash disk.  Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  I deny giving her the flash disk, because ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can we look at ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies.  Continue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Finish your answer. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay.  I deny giving her the flash disk, because first of 
all Chair.  There is no way that I will have those prices.  The only time 
that maybe I will give her prices or for instance maybe that information 
in terms of me naively helping a black owned woman and stuff.  It will 
be just the prices that is out there on the market. 
Not the price that is discussed by the CFST, because I do not 
sit in the CFST as I early indicated in 2015. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  After we received the flash disk 
20 
which was on the night before Ms Sambo began testifying.  We 
managed to analyse it.  Chair, I did indicate that there was going to be 
an affidavit from the relevant person in the Commission who did that 
analysis.  It has been included in Ms Memela’s Bundle DD25B at page 
653. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 142 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:  Page 65? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  3. 
MS MEMELA:  3. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes page 653 okay. 
MS MEMELA:   Chair when was this made available here? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well she – Ms Hofmeyr is going to indicate that but 
it’s a recent affidavit. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So you will see that it was deposed to on the 
5 t h of February 2020 you’ll see that at page 657 Bundle DD25B it was 
deposed to on the 5 t h of February 2020 ...(intervenes) 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can you see that Ms Memela, are you on the right 
page? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   On page 657. 
MS MEMELA:   657. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I’m getting to the last page of the affidavit. 
MS MEMELA:   Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   That’s the 5 t h of February 2020, that was 
Wednesday last week, it was then included in your bundle prior to your 
evidence on Friday.  So what Mr Sefumba who is the representative – 
Digital Forensic Investigator of the Commission indicates in this 
20 
affidavit is the circumstances in which it was obtained by the 
Commission and then he goes over to indicate that he took certain 
steps to image the USB and he extracted what is called the metadata 
from the file, you’ll find that at page 656 and then his Annexure A which 
is at 658 is a screenshot of the metadata which indicates who the 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 143 of 216 
 
author of the document was on – sorry I didn’t see that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well maybe let’s finish – let’s get to the question 
first, Ms Mbanjwa before we can interrupt or do you not have the page? 
MS MBANJWA:   No Chairperson I’m not even objecting to the 
questions, can I raise – it’s a very fundamental objection. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MBANJWA:   The very nature of the evidence, I understand, having 
read the rules that the Chairperson has a full discretion on what 
evidence must be submitted.  All I want to place before the Chairperson 
is how seriously prejudicial this evidence is going to be.  What has 
10 
happened is a document that went where we do not know and there is 
no chain of evidence to say that it left Ms Memela and went directly to 
the person who testified, it’s now being presented here as a fact.  So 
what we are asking is, because the Commission also had an expert to 
do this imaging, so what we are saying is, can we also have an expert 
and then we will also have an expert on this document, because I, as 
an attorney, there is no way I’m going to even be able to cross-examine 
or to even re-examine or even do anything about this document 
because I am presented now with this expert evidence of such a 
technical nature.  This is one of those situations where I am begging 
20 
the Chairperson to afford us an opportunity and we will ask our expert 
to sit with the expert of the Commission just to validate the veracity of 
whatever is there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no, no I understand what you’re saying but I 
think it’s not something that – I think the question should be finalised.  
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 144 of 216 
 
You will get an opportunity, I mean Ms Memela, I assume she is not a 
Forensic Investigator, I’m not sure, I don’t have the expertise.  She will 
be able to say I’m able to say something in response to this question or 
I’m not able to say anything in response to the question but you will get 
an opportunity if you apply in terms of the rules for leave to bring a 
witness – an expert to deal with this expert’s evidence, so that can be 
provided in due course. We should just hear what Ms Hofmeyr – what 
question she was putting to her and she is free to say, I’m able to 
answer or I’m not able to answer okay. 
MS MBANJWA:   Thank you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you will get an opportunity if you comply with the 
rules to bring your expert, yes Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you, we were at DD25B at page 658 and 
what Mr Sefumba explains there is that this is a representation of 
what’s called the metadata, it identifies the properties of the documents 
that are on the flash disk, the Excel spreadsheet, and what this 
revealed as metadata was that the author of the Excel spreadsheet was 
Leon Roberts and that the excel spreadsheet was last saved by, and 
the name there is Nontsasa Memela, do you see that? 
MS MEMELA:   I see that Chair. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Do you nonetheless persist in your evidence 
that you would not have had access to any such information? 
MS MEMELA:   Chair I’m not prepared to answer that until I know for 
sure ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   You get advice? 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 145 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:   Exactly, I know for sure where is this whole information, 
because I actually see that Mr Leon Roberts also wrote an affidavit 
mentioning me but I never was given the Notice or 3.3 from Mr Leon 
Roberts. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so you’re saying you are not prepared to say 
you stand by the answer you gave earlier on until you have got expert 
advice? 
MS MEMELA:   I’m saying I’m prepared to stand by that answer that I 
10 
gave to my statement earlier on with regard to Ms Sambo’s admissions 
that I had given her the memory stick with the prices ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay that’s fine. 
MS MEMELA:   For that tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s fine ja. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And just to be clear, so that I know where 
we’ve left off, your evidence after that that you would not have had 
access to this pricing information at all, you want to hold on confirming 
20 
that until you’ve had ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:   I want to hold on confirming to that, hence, I said Chair, 
the price that I could have maybe, it would be price from the market 
just changing what is out there on the market, not the spreadsheet from 
the CFST where it is voted on and signed by the CFST. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 146 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you, let’s move on then, I think to aid 
processes, we’ll await any further application and we can take this 
evidence forward after that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes that’s fine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Let’s move to your communications on the 14 t h 
of January 2016 with Ms Sokhulu ...(intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I think maybe just to conclude for now, the point 
you are making, you might want to put to Ms Memela what you make of 
this evidence. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then she will answer in whatever way but she 
will get – she will have an opportunity to consult an expert and they 
can apply for leave to lead the evidence of a different expert, that will 
be fine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As long as they comply with the rules, okay, but I 
think to conclude it, it’s important to state what it is that we 
...(intervenes) 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No absolutely, I’m indebted Chair.  So we were 
20 
focused on Annexure A which is indicating the properties of the Excel 
spreadsheet and what I’m indicating to you Ms Memela is that when our 
expert looked at the Excel spreadsheet, the information contained in its 
metadata was that you were the person who last saved that 
spreadsheet, do you have a response to that? 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 147 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:   I won’t have the response Chair because it’s something 
that was found from an expert that – and I was not notified of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No that’s fine ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And just for the record, that – on the same 
page as indicated as having been done on the 3 r d of August 2015 do 
you see that on page 658?  So this is useful because if there’s aspects 
that the expert needs to address, it will be whether in any respect, 
these facts recorded are wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And are you aware that the 3 r d of August 2015 
10 
was 16 days before AAR submitted its tender on the five-month 
components tender? 
MS MEMELA:   No I’m not aware, remember I don’t have the 
chronology. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Right. 
MS MEMELA:   But what I remember Chair, is that, Ms Sambo who 
made these statements was not party to the bid and that will be proven 
by her letter of aggrieve, like where he sent an e-mail to SAAT 
complaining that – in fact he sent this to ENY, Ernest & Young Forensic 
Investigators that he never bided with AAR, she never gave them the 
20 
authority to use her company and stuff. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MEMELA:   So that’s where I’m actually not sure that ...(intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MEMELA:   Ja when she said she’s got this here, like in the other 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 148 of 216 
 
letter she says she never got the – gave them the authority to do this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that’s fine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair, I was going to move to the 
communications between Ms Memela and Ms Sokhulu on the 14 t h of 
January 2016, Ms Memela you’ll find those in Ms Sambo’s affidavit that 
is Exhibit DD18, that should be next to you and available. 
MS MEMELA:   DD18 page? 
CHAIRPERSON:   She will tell you the page just now. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Have you got DD18 I don’t think we’ve taken it 
out yet today. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you got an Exhibit marked DD18? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   It’s the evidence of Ms Sambo. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It might not be there. 
MS MEMELA:   Oh DD18 is here Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And we’ll pick it up at page 339. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr are you going to need to – oh okay, not 
that’s fine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I’m actually realising in the chronology it 
would be better to start at 367 of that Exhibit DD18, so if you’ll just 
20 
turn up 367 because there were two communications on the 14 t h of 
January. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Let’s start, Ms Memela with the one at 637, do 
you have that? 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 149 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:   367? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  
MS MEMELA:   Yes Chair I’m here. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So that is the 14 t h of January 2016, can you 
tell us who sends the e-mail and to whom it is addressed, the one in 
the second half of the page? 
MS MEMELA:   Second half of the page it’s coming from Ms Sokhulu, 
14 t h January 2016 to Nontsasa, my iCloud account. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And what does the subject read? 
MS MEMELA:   “Hi cuz so here is the latest ...(intervenes) 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Sorry just the subject first if you don’t mind? 
MS MEMELA:   Okay, forward re: South Africa Draft Proposal. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And then the contents of the e-mail? 
MS MEMELA:   “Hi cuz, so here is the latest proposal, please let me 
 
know if it is acceptable”. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And then there’s a thanks. 
MS MEMELA:   And then there’s a thanks. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And then at 369 as I understand it is the 
proposal that was attached.  You’ve made the point that the only track 
changes on this proposal are those that are not from you, is that 
20 
correct? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Now on the 14 t h of January 2016, the bids 
were still coming in on the final five-year components tender, is that 
correct? 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 150 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   They were due to be submitted on the 19 t h of 
January 2016, correct? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And the allegation is that that communication 
with the bidder was in breach of the tender requirements, do you have 
a response to that? 
MS MEMELA:   Was in breach of the tender requirement, Chair if the 
person sits at the Evaluation Committee or Bid Evaluation Committee 
which is the CFST, so it is in conflict in that regard because you are 
10 
sitting there, you know all the information and you are the one who is 
going to vote, who is going to decide on this information. So the reason 
I say it’s not – I’m not sure maybe Ms Hofmeyr is going to direct me on 
the legislation or maybe provision that says, it’s against the tender 
requirement for a person who does not sit in the Bid Evaluation 
Committee to help or comment on certain proposals especially with 
regard to what I had stated on my statement. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, Ms Memela as I understand it your 
statement makes this very point, you say there’s untoward about the 
communication, because you did not sit on any of the decision making 
20 
bodies, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And let’s look at the second communication 
from that day, you will find it at 339. 
MS MEMELA:   Before we go to that 339 I wanted us to finish here 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 151 of 216 
 
Chair from ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MEMELA:   367 and its attachment. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, what would you like to say about the 
attachment? 
MS MEMELA:   I said on my statement Chair I am sure whatever that 
Ms Sokhulu sent me this for was to confirm and check if the Supplier 
Devlopment program or Supplier Devlopment proposal is in order as I 
have said that the Supplier Devlopment program was a new program at 
SAAT, we had never given an opportunity to Black-Owned Companies to 
10 
joint  ventures with SAAT.  The person who actually started that to 
empower black-owned suppliers in terms of these multinational 
suppliers. 
 
Now from what Ms Hofmeyr had referred to with which is my – 
the e-mail from Ms Sokhulu to me I see no evidence, maybe she is 
going to direct me to that, I see no evidence or e-mail that is 
responding to Ms Sokhulu and also on their comments because it does 
show that this was a draft and there were track changes.  There is 
nowhere where there are track changes where it says Advocate Memela 
...(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but she hasn’t asked questions about that, she 
wanted to move onto something and you said you wanted to look at 
something and I thought it was relating to the last question she had 
asked. 
MS MEMELA:   Okay Chair maybe my wrong, because this is the 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 152 of 216 
 
proposal and I thought the one in 339 is talking to the JV, but ja, but 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay no that’s fine. 
MS MEMELA:   But ja these are two different documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Given that you have drawn attention to it I do 
have a follow up question, you said you are sure that Ms Sokhulu was 
sending it to you to look at the supply development aspects, correct? 
MS MEMELA:   I think so yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   You think so, so did you have a conversation 
10 
with her about it? 
MS MEMELA:   Did I? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Have as conversation with her about it when 
she told you what she wanted you to look at was Supplier Devlopment? 
MS MEMELA:   No I don’t remember having a conversation in writing 
Chair, I may have had a conversation verbally, maybe saying I think it 
actually covers the supply development.  These are the communications 
that I have received from so many BEE companies Chair and as I 
mentioned in my statement that I even had an MOU from Kwane Capital 
being the BEE company of Air France, which I signed for, so I mean 
20 
those are the people that – it was the first time for the door to be 
opened for them to actually deal or maybe participate in these big 
companies and with these big multinational international companies.   
You know so it was my duty in terms of the job description and also in 
terms of the – I don’t know if Ms Hofmeyr I have sent you that but there 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 153 of 216 
 
is an enterprise development supplier program that was done in 2014, 
that actually gives us that obligation to promote the joint venture 
relationship between multinational companies and local companies. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So just let me get your evidence clear, you did 
have a conversation with her in which you responded to this e-mail on 
the 14 t h of January telling her that you thought the Supplier Devlopment 
aspect of the bid looked okay, that was your evidence? 
MS MEMELA:   I am saying – okay I am saying Chair I said I don’t 
remember if there is any written response from me, but I do know that 
when I receive these, like I receive from any other supplier, BEE 
10 
suppliers, I respond either by phone and say okay I think this is in line 
with what is required. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but she is saying do you recall whether you did 
have a conversation with her telephonically, or in a meeting with her. 
MS MEMELA:   I don’t recall Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You don’t recall? 
MS MEMELA:   I don’t recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So you have no other basis for thinking that 
she was just asking about Supplier Devlopment, unless you’d had a 
20 
conversation with her, correct? 
MS MEMELA:   I have no, sorry? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Basis for concluding that she was only 
interested in your input on Supplier Devlopment, unless you’d had a 
conversation with her. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 154 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:   The basis will be that Chair I would not have the 
information to discuss any other information of the tender, other than 
Supplier Devlopment with her, because I don’t sit in the Evaluation 
Committee, being the CFST as such, and the other basis is the fact that 
there is no way where I had helped them for them to win.  I corrected 
Ms Hofmeyr on Friday when she referred to Lufthansa as being number 
three bidder and I said Lufthansa was number one bidder, so that was 
the winning bidder in terms of the scoring points. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And Ms Memela do you recall considering the 
proposal that was attached to that e-mail when you received it? 
10 
MS MEMELA:   Considering it? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Looking at it, reviewing it? 
MS MEMELA:   I don’t recall Chair, I think it was – when was it, it was 
in 2016, so I don’t recall what happened, and Chair the reason why I 
would say I don’t recall as well is that the reason why Ms Sambo has 
these documents it was again for the same basis that made Ms Sokhulu 
send me the documentation, it was to assist her. 
 
Remember in 2016 in the final five year tender Ms Sambo what 
she did not mention here in the Commission when she was here, or 
maybe in her affidavit she did not bid in that tender, because she did 
20 
not have any partner to bid with, you understand, so – and the reason 
why I gave her because she was frustrated, she wanted to see if she 
can 
actually 
approach 
other 
multinational 
companies 
because 
remember in the five months period contract or tender they had not 
seen eye to eye where they are, exactly, so of course ...(intervenes). 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 155 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think I she mentioned that. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, so she couldn’t bid with them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MEMELA:   So the reason I gave her this was me saying okay 
remember you have been complainant about this ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay Ms Memela, okay, okay, the question is not 
about that. 
MS MEMELA:   I was giving the evidence for you Chair to understand 
the background yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no I understand.  Ms Hofmeyr? 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Let us go to the other e-mail on the 14 t h of 
January you will find that at 339 of the same bundle, Exhibit DD18. 
MS MEMELA:   Page 339. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, just tell us who the e-mail is from and to? 
MS MEMELA:   The e-mail is from Ms Nkosi Sokhulu. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And it is to? 
MS MEMELA:   It is to Nontsasa Memela on the same date as the 
proposal was sent. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And the subject this time? 
MS MEMELA:   The subject this time is joint venture draft agreement. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And what does Ms Sokhulu say in the first 
three lines? 
MS MEMELA:   “Hi Cousin, this is the first draft of JV so far, 
Jules did a quick review and noticed the following...” 
And then she states: 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 156 of 216 
 
1. Agreed 
participation 
JM 
5%, 
AAR 
95%, 
6 
participation interest JM 5% …” 
Do you want me to read the whole thing? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes that’s fine. 
MS MEMELA:   Okay. 
“As per the collaboration agreement JM is to receive 5% 
of any amounts received by AAR from SAAT.  This is 
linked to revenue not, profits for example if SAAT remits 
100 000 US Dollars to AAR then JM is to receive 5 000 
US Dollars.  The way the participation interest clause is 
10 
written states that JM will receive 5% of the profits, this 
is not correct.   We need to determine what will 5% of 
revenue equate to as a percentage ownership of the joint 
venture for JM.   Please let me know if there is anything 
else we might have overlooked.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Why would a bidder on a 
components tender that is still not closed be engaging with you as the 
Head of Procurement about the details of their JV agreement with their 
bidding partner? 
MS MEMELA:   Okay, Chair as I said it is just that you did not give me 
20 
that opportunity, maybe I will be worried that I will be my old self and 
take long, I wanted to give the full background. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well if you can. 
MS MEMELA:   It will give me, it will take me about two to three 
minutes, I promise. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 157 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is quite long. 
MS MEMELA:   Oh, one and a half. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MS MEMELA:   Okay Chair.  Chair as I mentioned on Friday SAAT had 
always used the international multinational companies to supply spares 
and everything else, and there has never been any participation 
between local companies and maybe joining ventures with international 
companies, and then we had the likes of Ms Sambo who had been 
knocking on SAAT’s door from 2012, I am sure you can see the 
evidence, where she started bidding with AAR, and from that moment 
10 
she had not had the JV that was protecting her from in case AAR runs 
away, like they did, you know and during that time when she actually 
introduced herself to me the first question I asked her do you have a JV 
with these guys, because like remember you will not have a formal 
claim or a legitimate claim from them if you don’t have a JV, so for me I 
was fully involved in terms of discussing the JV’s and supply 
development program and others, it was MOU between multinational 
company and versus local company like ...(indistinct) with Air France 
they had an MOU. 
 
So to answer Ms Hofmeyr’s question it is that the reason why 
20 
they had maybe sent it to me was also to check if they are doing it, 
because they were using their own lawyer, they were not using me, but 
maybe they just wanted me to check if they are not negotiating what – 
to their disadvantage, like Ms Sambo had done.  For the first time 
during her affidavit I saw that okay she had a contract with AAR, which 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 158 of 216 
 
she never disclosed to me because I would have told her there and 
then that that is not going to work. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay Ms Memela. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So Ms Memela they were coming to you for 
legal advice? 
MS MEMELA:   No they were not coming to me for legal advice, they 
were coming to me like for a JV and having the relationship with the 
multinational company, because remember that JV will be the basis of 
10 
what will be maybe accepted by SAAT in terms of like understand that 
okay there was no fronting, or maybe there was no they just like used 
these black people because they were available and stuff, so it will be 
something that will go for the remainder of the contract.    
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So it was to understand what would be 
acceptable to SAAT? 
MS MEMELA:   No it was to – remember the JV is an independent 
document from SAAT. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes that is why I am interested in why they are 
sending it to the Head of Procurement. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Ms Hofmeyr’s interest really is why would a 
bidder who is preparing their bid to the company where you are HOD of 
Procurement ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Be sending you their draft proposals and asking for 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 159 of 216 
 
your assistance? 
MS MEMELA:   I will think Chair they wanted to hear my view, if they 
are not negotiating to their disadvantage.  I mean even Kwane Capital 
and Air France during the five months tender they sent me the MOU 
between themselves and it was talking – now it was not as detailed as 
this but it was talking about the percentage that Kwane Capital is 
entitled to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But that would be strange, would it not be, because 
isn’t the position with regard to tenders that each bidder is supposed to 
prepare its bid to the best of its ability and put it in without sharing it 
10 
with another potential bidder for the same thing, put it in, the bidders 
shouldn’t know each other’s bids or proposals and the employer, SAAT, 
in this case would then on a certain day open them, look at them and 
see which one is the best and in the process as they prepared their 
bids they might disadvantage them, they might put in something that 
will count against them, they might put something that will not count 
against them but they have got to put their bid as they prepare them.  
MS MEMELA:   This JV Chair was not part of the bid, so I am trying to 
correct that part where they’re saying they should, they are the only 
one that was part of the bid it’s this proposal. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:   And I will go back to ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but remember that part of Ms Hofmeyr’s question 
is why are they – why were they giving you all of these documents 
asking you for assistance from you when one, they were at one of the 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 160 of 216 
 
bidders.  Two, the bid had not been closed. 
MS MEMELA:   Chair, in my reading of the e-mail, I do not see 
anywhere where they ask for my assistance other than they said please 
let me know anything else we might have overlooked.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well that is asking for assistance is it?   
MS MEMELA:   Okay, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes 
MS MEMELA:    And also, there is no e-mail that shows that I had gone 
back to them and given ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:    Now we – Ms Hofmeyr she is still simply at the point 
10 
where we know ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:    Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:    There are sending you documents including a 
proposal ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:    Okay 
CHAIRPERSON:    Tell us if this is fine. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So she is asking question, why would a bidder be 
asking the Head of Procurement of the company to whom to which they 
are going to submit a bid, to first check whether their proposal is 
20 
acceptable.  Why are they not simply putting their bid after preparing 
their bid to the best of their ability and then being judged on that? 
MS MEMELA:    For the proposal Chair that you are referring to, that is 
why I am saying I think they were asking me if their supply development 
is in line with what is required because as I said that was a new 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 161 of 216 
 
program at that time.   
So whatever was put on the table it was new and we were 
working together and since I was not sitting at the evaluation table I 
was the one who they could approach. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you Chair.  Ms Memela the one thing 
we have not noticed yet, for the record is what e-mail address of yours 
these requests for assistance were sent to.  Could you read into the 
record, what e-mail address they were sent to? 
MS MEMELA:    Chair if I read my e-mail address it will be known to 
10 
the public and I will receive insults and whatever ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no, no. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No, no, so I can ask it differently, thank you. 
They were not sent to your SAAT e-mail address, were they? 
MS MEMELA:   They were not sent to my SAAT e-mail address Chair.  
They were sent to my private e-mail, and I did mention on my statement 
that others would send me SMS’s on my private phone and then I will 
respond to that, as I had been also communicating with Ms Sambo.   
You will notice that I had communicated with her on the private 
side, you know not because like we were running away from anything 
20 
but I took that me, that I am actually guiding them.  To add there Chair, 
I will not take long, there is somewhere where it talks about the joint 
venture or shareholders agreement or Consortium on that five months 
contract or five months tender, where there were other Black-Owned 
Companies that I saw from Mr Human’s what file, that there was a 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 162 of 216 
 
Consortium also it is also in my file.   
 
There was a Consortium where it was listing certain people 
and Mr Human in his affidavit he said I agreed to meet with the BEE 
companies, like that were forming that what, shareholders agreement.  
Just to prove that I was I had not only communicated with maybe JM or 
maybe they were the ones who actually communicated with me.   
I am actually trying to prove that there were other people who 
were reaching me on the side to see, and then I remember on the 
Consortium one we did not agree because I told them that you cannot 
just come with something that has already been done and then when 
10 
this thing is run by SAAT. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So, did you use your I-Cloud e-mail address 
when you were providing guidance and your formal SAAT e-mail 
address when it was formal communications with entities? 
MS MEMELA:   When it was formal okay ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   You see, let me ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   She is asking when did you use your private e-mail 
address and when did you use the – your official e-mail address in 
communicating with these companies – BEE companies? 
MS MEMELA:   Okay Chair it depended if I was at work.  Some would 
20 
communicate with me via my work e-mail, but because I had had a 
problem with my connection at home and because I will connect only 
via my private e-mail.  So, if I am at home and people want to talk to 
me they would use my iCloud account. Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Right, thank you for that. I would like to take 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 163 of 216 
 
you to – oh before I do that – Ms Memela should we not take it as in 
any sense an indication that something was happening alongside this 
bidding process that your iCloud or private e-mail was being used.  I 
understand your evidence to be – you would regularly use that in your 
interactions with bidders? 
MS MEMELA:   I said I would use it when I am in the home, like when 
they cannot reach me on my work e-mail then I will let them use my 
private e-mail account. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So, were you at home at 16:00 in the afternoon 
of the 14 t h of January 2016?  Because that is when the e-mail came 
10 
from Ms Sokhulu to you.  
MS MEMELA:   I would not remember Chair where I was. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So, but do you remember specifically saying 
use my iCloud e-mail address because I am not at work? 
MS MEMELA:   Remember Chair if, for the fact that Ms Sokhulu sent 
that e-mail at 16:00 pm, does not mean I have read it at 16:00 pm.  It 
may happen that okay maybe I read it later or maybe I was – so I 
cannot really answer that, I was at home at that time. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No but ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did they, was the position that during normal 
20 
business hours if they wanted to send you an e-mail they would use 
your official e-mail, but during, but after hours they would use your 
home – your personal private e-mail address.  Is that the position? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, that is the position Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 164 of 216 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Ms Memela your previous evidence, this 
morning I think it was, was that as the head the HOD of Supply Chain 
Management, your role was to run tenders and to make sure they 
adhered to processes.  Is that your evidence before this Commission? 
MS MEMELA:   What I had said also on Friday Chair if I must repeat, is 
that the CFSTO maybe the Bid Evaluation Committee.  They bring the 
recommendation to me without any other administrative documentation 
to check if it is flowing and I will be able, we will be able to talk to it 
when we go to Exco to be AC and then when the CO goes to the Board   
So like she, Ms Hofmeyr asked me, if I am saying I signed as the Exco 
10 
member and I corrected and I said no, I sign as HOD SCM as I am 
signing in support of the Bid Evaluation Committee, based on what they 
had put on the table to me. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, and I understood your evidence to be you 
are one of the checks that the process has been properly followed is 
that correct? 
MS MEMELA:   Remember the duty to check the process if it is properly 
followed and stuff, it is partly mine but mainly by the BAC, as I said 
that the BAC will check all the relevant legislation on Friday.  I said if 
they check all the relevant legislation and whatever that they have 
20 
gone through CFST and see if everything was checked ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, your answer is that you check parts of it. 
MS MEMELA:   For instance, Chair, I said on Friday there is a 
recommendation that is made by the project manager.  In this regard it 
was Leon Roberts and then for the 2016 and when he brings the 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 165 of 216 
 
recommendation with the – what do you call this, summary of what they 
had discussed there and evaluated and whatever and then come with 
the proposal to say this is the highest scoring bidder in this regard.  
The initial highest scoring bidder was Lufthansa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but the answer – you answered to Ms Hofmeyr 
is that yes you are part of the people who check.  You are not the only 
one, but you are part of the people who check.   
MS MEMELA:   Yes but ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is right.  
MS MEMELA:   Yes Chair. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Were you aware that it was prohibited under 
this bid for there to be any communication between a bidder and 
somebody other than the project manager at SAAT? 
MS MEMELA:   I am aware of that.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Let us go to it if we may.   
MS MEMELA:   Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   It is in Human’s bundle.  You will find it at 
DD22E and it is at page 2052. 
MS MEMELA:   DD? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   DD22E at page 2052. 
20 
MS MEMELA:   Did you say DD22E?  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Correct, yes.  
MS MEMELA:   Of Mr Human ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Mr Human.  And then you will turn up page 
2052. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 166 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:   2052, okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Chair I have picked it up in the middle of the 
document just for records purposes.  The document begins at 2043, and 
that is the request for bid on the final components tender, that was 
eventually awarded for five years to the joint venture of JM Aviation 
and AAR, and Ms Memela your evidence was that you were aware of 
the provision in this tender that prohibited communications and I would 
like to take you to the relevant clause.  It is clause 1.6 at page 2052.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you got it? 
MS MEMELA:   1.6 communications surrounding the RFP, yes Chair.  
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So, 1.6.1 there records: 
“All queries or information relating to this document 
or surrounding the bid must be addressed to the 
Project Manager as stipulated on page 1 of this 
RFP in writing.   
Clause 1.6.2 provides: 
“Any queries addressed to individuals other than as 
stipulated whether verbal, telephonic, hand-written 
or in any other form, will eliminate the bidder from 
this process.”  
20 
Do you see that? 
MS MEMELA:   I see that. 
ADV 
KATE 
HOFMEYR:   Do 
you 
accept 
that 
JM 
Aviation’s 
communications with you on the 14 t h of January meant that they should 
have been eliminated from this process? 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 167 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:   I do not agree Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Why is that? 
MS MEMELA:   Okay.  The people or maybe the individuals that are 
referred to in this tender Chair, are the individuals that are sitting at 
the bid evaluation committee.  The people that sit and go through this 
tender, putting the specifications in this tender, a Specification 
Committee which form part of the CFST.   
 
So those are the people that are not supposed to talk or 
maybe get what – communicate with the bidder.  And I even made an 
example for the bid of 2014 ...(intervenes). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, before you make the example – what is the 
basis for your evidence that the individuals referred to in clause 1.6.2 
are there specific individuals you are talking about? 
MS MEMELA:   My basis Chair is the fact that the people who come up 
with the specification of the tender, are those people that sit at the 
CFST who know exactly what is required by SAAT. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. Let us do it this way.  Is there anything 
in this document where clause 1.6.2 appears, is there anything or any 
page on this document which makes you say the reference to 
individuals in that clause is a reference to the people who deal with 
20 
specifications, or there is nothing in this document? 
MS MEMELA:   In this clause it is not here Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, in the document as a whole? 
MS MEMELA:   In the document as a whole I have not gone through the 
document as a whole ...(intervenes). 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 168 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you are not basing what you are saying on the 
document ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:   But I know that Chair before this documents is put 
through, like I mean is put together there is a CFST Team that is 
responsible for specification and everything that is going to be part of 
this tender and this is usually referred to them because they know more 
about the tender information, that they are voting for evaluating or 
adjudicating.  So, I wanted to add Chair ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, the reason why I say this is referring to the people 
10 
that sit at the CFST, remember there was a point where Mr Human 
referred in his affidavit that during the bid of 2014 the Board was in 
discussion with AAR at that time.   
 
Remember like the bidder also was AAR but the Board was 
discussing with them in terms of the MOU and all that and then 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Ms Memela, we might have to come back 
to what you are saying but let me just draw your attention to this.  
clause 1.6.2 is clear, it says:  
“Any queries addressed to individuals other than as 
20 
stipulated” 
So it means it is very specific that if you are going to 
communicate, these are the only people you must communicate with, 
and your answer seems to suggest that this clause – you understood 
this clause not to restrict communication to individuals – to certain 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 169 of 216 
 
individuals. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, Chair because I think it will be referring to 
individuals that are directly making the voting and the evaluation 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but Ms Hofmeyr do you know where, as 
stipulated refers to? Let us go to that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, I can give you that.  It is at 2043, yes 
because what happens on 2043 is the Project Manager is identified.  
You will see it says as stipulated on page 1, let us just read it 
...(intervenes). 
10 
MS MEMELA:   Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry 2043. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, it is page 1 of the RFP.  If you look at the 
bottom it is page 144 right.  If I can just give the assistance.  What 
6.1.6.1 is saying is:  
“All queries or information relating to this document 
or surrounding the bid must be addressed to the 
Project Manager as stipulated on page 1 of this 
RFP.” 
So, then you go to page 1 of the RFP ...(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I am sorry Ms Hofmeyr, I cannot see 
where you are reading.  I am at 2043. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I do apologise, okay, so I was just giving the 
context for why I take you to that page. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 170 of 216 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   What we need to be looking at is 2052, which 
is where the relevant clause is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And I am just seeing what the clause provides 
is in 1.6.1.   
“All queries or information relating to this document 
or surrounding the bid must be addressed to the 
project manager as stipulated on page 1 of this 
RFP.” 
That is why I take you back to 2043 because that is page 1 of 
10 
the bid and you will see in that first block, RFP particulars, you will see 
on the left hand side there is a column saying bid queries, and across 
from bid queries in the second column is project managers.   
So, they are the project managers stipulated on page 1 of the 
RFP.  They are Mr Leon Roberts and Ms Evelyn Fallot.  So that is the 
cross reference I think Chair that you were looking for. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no that is the one I was looking for. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Apologies Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see the way I read clause 1.6.2 Ms Memela, is 
that it must be read with clause 1.6.1 and page 1 of the document and 
that it prohibits communication between a bidder and anybody within 
SAAT other than the people stipulated in terms of clause 1.6.1 and 
page 1. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 171 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:   Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja that is how I understand it. 
MS MEMELA:   That’s how, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MEMELA:   Chair, I will explain now to you that this is the 
document, as I said with a specification and the document that is 
compiled by the CFST right.  And the document is compiled for the 
bidders.  This document is not given to me as you can see that it is not 
assigned to me or maybe where I signed off right.   
So I am not trying to defend the fact that maybe I might have 
10 
not know, might have not seen the clause that is referred to that they 
should not communicate with anyone. Maybe they were aware, I was 
not aware and I even searched my statement.  Even Mr Nico 
Bezuidenhout being the Acting Group CEO of SAA at that time and with 
Mr Barakas.  They met with Air France.   
 
Air France went there to discuss the bid of the tender during 
the bid process and when I tried to check if after I find out, because 
Nisha came and notify me.  Remember I would not, okay Nisha Chair 
was the Senior Manager SCM at that time.   
 
She came and notify me because she was called in that 
20 
meeting and said Nontsasa these Air France people went to discuss 
with Mr Nico Bezuidenhout and Barakas.  And what they were 
discussing there, was exactly what the bidder has bided on the tender.   
So the reason why what you call this, I could not disqualify them from 
the tender after getting that information, after sitting with Mr Masimba 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 172 of 216 
 
Dau was the CPO of SAA of that time.   
 
We sat down with a legal and this was discussed and they said 
but this for instance Mr Nico Bezuidenhout and Mr Barakas does not 
have it, only the supplier has it.  Which is the reason why when I sent 
an e-mail to the supplier asking them, they must give me valid reason 
why I should not disqualify them and unfortunately that has not been.   
 
Open Water knows about it but the Team of the Commission 
did not bring that e-mail, but I am just going back there Chair.  The fact 
that this is written here, it does not necessarily mean that like the 
people who are not sitting there understand it because it is not given to 
10 
us before it is sent to the bidders. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay so your answer is you were not aware of this 
prohibition.  Your understanding was that there was nothing wrong with 
the communications, with the bidder, is that what you are saying? 
MS MEMELA:   The understanding is that there was nothing wrong, 
because I do not sit in the Evaluation Committee.  The only people that 
are not allowed to talk to the bidders, because they have all the 
information, they sitting there are the people in the CFST. The Bid 
Evaluation Committee Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Ms Memela the challenge I think that your 
20 
understanding presents and I want to put it to you in fairness is that no 
one at SAAT other than you knew that JM Aviation was corresponding 
with you on the 14 t h of January, to get input on their bid proposal, is 
that correct? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes.  There was no one. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 173 of 216 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So only you know that a bidder is currently 
asking for your input on their bid proposal, correct? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And then there is a provision of the RFP that 
says they cannot communicate with anyone other than the Project 
Manager, and if they do they will be eliminated from the bid.  You have 
indicated that you were not aware of that provision at the time, correct? 
MS 
MEMELA:   I 
was 
not 
aware 
of 
that 
provision 
because 
...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   If you had been aware would you have raised 
10 
the flag when you got the submission from CFST and said I see that 
you have evaluated JM Aviation and AAR but they should be eliminated 
from this bid because they have breached clause 1.6 of the RFP? 
MS MEMELA:   For instance Chair if there was certain policy that is 
know to all the executives for instance including even Mr Nico 
Bezuidenhout and Mr Barakas at that time which notifies the 
Management or maybe Executive that okay, should you receive any 
communication from the bidder even if it has nothing to do with the 
requirements of the tender.   
 
It is just about Supplier Devlopment, yes then I would have 
20 
notify Leon, the Project Manager.  And just to add there Chair, okay 
this is the part you said you will allow me to add with regard to Open 
Water report but like let me ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   I said later 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   If I may just have a follow up question? 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 174 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I said later, you must just not forget, make a note, ja.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Ms Memela your evidence a moment ago was 
that all that you were sent was something in relation to supply 
development by JM Aviation, correct?  
MS MEMELA:   That is my version. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, except that what you were sent was the 
entire bid proposal, is that not correct? 
MS MEMELA:    The entire bid proposal I said Chair the reason why, I 
just want to note this so that I do not forget later ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, note it, note it. 
10 
MS MEMELA:   The part that I want to raise at the end with regard to 
bidders communicating with people at SAAT. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Note it ja. 
MS MEMELA:   Okay Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you Ms Memela, you confirm that you were 
sent the entire proposal? 
MS MEMELA:   I confirm that this is an entire proposal but I said earlier 
on Chair that it probably because she was asking me, what could have 
been the reason for them to send, I said probably because they knew that 
I did not have the information for the tender as I do not sit in the Bidding 
20 
Evolution Committee so it was for me to check the Supplier Development 
part.   
 
And the reason why it was this I did not see anything wrong with 
me sharing with Ms Sambo.  It was to help guide her when she 
approaches other bidders, other suppliers to become their joint partner, 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 175 of 216 
 
her joint partner.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Ms Memela how will JM Aviation know that you 
were not sitting on the Bid Evaluation Committee?  
MS MEMELA:   How will they know? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MS MEMELA:   I mean every, we get the briefing sometimes.  Sometimes 
they going to sit, they know exactly that I do not sit in the CFST 
...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   You briefed them ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:   No, I do not brief them.  All the bidders know that I do not 
10 
sit on the Bid Adjudication Committee.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I am just trying to understand how they are given 
that information?  
MS MEMELA:   How are they given that information? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MS MEMELA:   Because I mean the HOD SCM has never seated at the 
Bid Adjudication Committee, ever.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Ja, but that is knowledge internal to SAAT, how 
do external parties to SAAT know who sits at the Bid Evaluation 
Committee? 
20 
MS MEMELA:   Chair, I do not know if you remember on Friday, I 
mentioned that one of the JM Directors, Mr Jules, has been the SAAT 
supplier since 1992.  They get to know about this internal information.  
What happens where.  Who sits at the Board. ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   On an official basis? 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 176 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:   No not on an official basis sometimes.  Sometimes like 
just through discussions ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do they get to know something they are not supposed 
to know? 
MS MEMELA:   No, not that like it is something that is hidden but like it 
has never occurred that an HOD or maybe a person at the executive level 
would sit at the CFST.  At the CFST ...(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, that is internal.  The question is, if SAAT did 
not officially inform the bidders who would sit on the CFST, how would 
they know? 
10 
MS MEMELA:   Okay, as I said Chair when I was talking about that 
proposal that the only reason I know that they would send me that 
proposal to check is for Supplier Development because I was open to 
them about Supplier Development.   
 
I was fully involved about Supplier Development because it gave 
points back to SAAT.  So, it was not about me saying they knew 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but that does not answer the question.  You 
remember Ms Hofmeyr is saying here are people, here is a bidder 
communicating with you at a time when they are preparing to submit their 
20 
bid and your answer is, there is nothing wrong with that because you did 
not sit on the CFST. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So her question is how would they have known that? 
MS MEMELA:   Okay Chair, I said that I would assume that since Mr Jules 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 177 of 216 
 
Aires had been at the database of SAAT since 1992, would have maybe 
known that information because it is not something that is critical to hide 
or whatever.   
Sometimes like I mean during the tender process there is a 
briefing session where the bidders would know who is part of the 
evaluation during that meeting where all their bidders are there.  All the 
CFST Team are there.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I do not know but if I was told that the identity of 
the Members of the CFST was not supposed to be disclosed to bidders, I 
would understand that.  It maybe that at SAAT there was nothing wrong 
10 
with that because it was believed that that could not compromise them in 
any way but you are not saying, or are you saying that officially the 
identity of Members of the CFST were made known to the bidders at some 
stage or the other. 
MS MEMELA:   Not really Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Not officially? 
MS MEMELA:   Not officially.  That is why I was saying sometimes during 
the briefing process they would meet all the CFST members, because 
they are there to answer their question in terms of the specification of the 
tender.   
20 
So they will see that okay maybe Ms Memela is not there, the 
CEO is not there or maybe all the GM’s are not there, the same as Mr 
Nico Bezuidenhout would not sit there.  So when they meet, when they 
ask for instance, Air France asked meet Mr Nico Bezuidenhout and 
Barakas, the understanding is that they would have find out somehow that 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 178 of 216 
 
these guys are not part of the CFST or Bid Evaluation Committee.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Ms Memela the other possibility is not that they 
found out, but that they trying their luck, is that not it? 
MS MEMELA:   Okay, the other possibility is that like ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So that they do not know who sits on the CFST 
and who does not, but they are communicating with somebody hoping 
they will get a response.  
MS MEMELA:   Trying their luck, I do not know, I would not agree.  That 
is your version.  
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And just to finalize, because I did not think I had 
a crisp answer to the question, if you had been aware of clause 1.6 of the 
RFP at the time, would you have raised the flag before or once you got 
the CFST recommendation and said, hang on we cannot possibly award 
this to JM Aviation and AAR because they were communicating with me 
during the bid.  
MS MEMELA:   Okay, Chair.  If I had known this document or as I said if 
there was a formal document signed somewhere that says okay 
Executives be aware of this.  Should anybody communicate with you 
please do not communicate back or just notify the CFST then we will 
20 
disqualify them.   
Then I would have raised a hand and called Leon and said okay 
Leon these people are communicating with me.  Leon knows that I did not 
hide anything from him.  I did tell him who was talking to me, in terms of 
Supplier Development and he did not have a problem with that.  AJ 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 179 of 216 
 
Walters like they had their own BEE company and they were talking to me 
about that like for guidance in terms of Supplier Development.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, except Ms Memela your evidence a moment 
ago was no one else other than you at the time knew they had 
communicated with you on the 14t h of January 2016. 
MS MEMELA:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think she is making a different point.  
MS MEMELA:   Yes, I was making ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, she is making a point that JM was not the only 
10 
one communicating with her. 
MS MEMELA:  The only BEE company. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies Chair.  And I picked up on the point 
that she said she had been communicating with Mr Roberts about the fact 
that there had been these other engagements on Supplier Development.  I 
guess in fairness I should be clear.  I just want to be certain that I 
understand your evidence in relation to the JM Aviation communications 
on the 14 t h of January.  No one other than you knew that they had had 
those communications with you prior to the bid closing on the 19 t h of 
January, correct? 
20 
MS MEMELA:  My recollection is that Chair that they have- they had 
communicated with me, JM Aviation. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  So of course, I did not say I have told Leon every 
communication.  I said I had shared with Leon some of the communication 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 180 of 216 
 
and some of the BEE. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
MS MEMELA:  Just to add there of course Chair like it would be added in 
the re-examination but this information was given to Ms Sambo in that 
notion that I am helping a black owned company to have an understanding 
of what is required in terms of Supplier Development.   
I heard her talking about NIP obligation and I could tell even 
from Mr Schalk Human that they both do not understand the difference 
between the NIP obligation and the Supplier Development.  They do not 
understand that a NIP obligation is actually managed and controlled by 
10 
the DTI and then Supplier Development gives SAAT that advantage to 
control what is happening within the contract within everything that has 
been agreed upon.  That way we are getting back the points for BEE 
status. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We will come to NIP in a moment but just before 
we go there.  Were you aware that it was a requirement of this bid that a 
NIP obligation be undertaken? 
MS MEMELA:  Remember Ms Hofmeyr, you cannot apply both 
Chairperson.  You cannot apply both NIP obligation and Supplier 
Development.  The only requirement that the DTI makes is that you must 
20 
make sure that whatever that you decide to apply is stated in the tender 
from – you see from this tender from the beginning so that the suppliers 
are aware exactly what they are putting themselves in.  So yes, in terms 
of the amount it fell within the NIP obligation but because we introduced 
the Supplier Development in the beginning of the program, NIP obligation 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 181 of 216 
 
fell away. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela my question was, are you aware that 
the request for bid made the NIP obligation applicable to this tender? 
MS MEMELA:  Made the NIP – so are you saying the NIP obligation was 
the requirement of the tender? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  Would you like me to take you to the 
page ...(intervenes)? 
MS MEMELA:  Please.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Where it was the requirement? 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let us go to that, it is in the same bundle DD22E 
at page 2083. 
MS MEMELA:  2083? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you there Ms Memela? 
MS MEMELA:  I am here Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  My question was, were you aware that it was a 
requirement of this RFP that the NIP obligation be undertaken by 
bidders? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you wanted to tell her to identify the part of the 
20 
page ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That has – I think that is 1.0, is it not? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  So, it begins by explaining to the bidders 
what the pillars of the NIP program are.  It requires them over the page at 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 182 of 216 
 
2084 at clause 3.1 to submit SBD5 together with the bid.  That is a 
document relating to the NIP obligation.  And then over the page at 2085 
at clause 4 it deals with the process to satisfy the NIP obligation.  Once – 
at 4.1 it reads; 
“Once the successful bidder or contractor has made 
contact with and furnished the DTI with the information 
required the following steps will be followed.” 
And then it indicates how satisfaction of the NIP obligation 
“Which the bidder undertakes to involve itself in when it 
submits the bid will then be followed.” 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Chair can I put this to Ms Hofmeyr for clarity of what is 
meant by the requirement of the tender?  This ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  What she means is it was obligatory that the bidders 
satisfy the NIP requirement.  That is what she is talking about. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She wants to check with you whether you agree that 
there was such an obligation ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the bidders. 
MS MEMELA:  As I said that the guidelines for the NIP obligation from the 
20 
DTI it says, what is applied on that tender shall be put on the tender as 
the requirement, right.  And then the bidders will be aware of what is 
expected of them when they bid.  And then Ms Hofmeyr takes me to this 
page, this page is a page coming from the DTI that usually the Team from 
SAAT that are running the tender, they copy and paste.   
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 183 of 216 
 
In this regard I will think maybe they did not think because this 
was the first contract that we had applied Supplier Development.  So, 
they did not take it out.  So no, it is not obligatory and it is not a 
requirement.  I want to take you through the requirement of the tender 
Chair and then hopefully that Ms Hofmeyr is going to understand 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well at this stage ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  How it works. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At this stage you say it was not a requirement. 
MS MEMELA:  It was not a requirement. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is your answer to her question. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ms Hofmeyr do you want her to refer to a page 
which specifies what the requirements were? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What I am just struggling with ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  I will not take long. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is this is Appendix 13 to the RFP. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right, we see that at the top of the page.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It indicates to bidders this document must be 
signed and submitted together with your bid.  And there is a signature 
page available at 2085.  And then it explains in addition to that that the 
bidders are required to sign and submit the standard bidding document 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 184 of 216 
 
SBD5 which is also a document dealing with the NIP obligation.  So, in 
fairness to Ms Memela I would just like to understand how it could be that 
despite this being part of the RFP, the NIP obligation was not undertaken 
by bidders. 
MS MEMELA:  The NIP obligation. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay.  Like I said Chair earlier on that the tender 
documentation is worked on by the Team that are sitting at the CFST 
Team and of course sometimes they would need if I was involved in this, I 
would have guided them in terms of the guidelines of the DTI.  What 
10 
should be here and I think I suspect although I am not aware, I suspect 
that they had put it here in case the Supplier Development program or the 
Supplier Development commitment from these multinational suppliers 
does not come through.   
Remember I told you on Friday that most multinational 
companies or maybe bidders or suppliers of SAAT, they have never 
adhered to the NIP obligation because that was the control and 
Management of the DTI.  So now I would just like to go through this, it is 
just two pages and I am not going to read everything.  I just want to make 
it clear for Ms Hofmeyr to understand what – when they talk about the 
20 
requirement of the tender ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on. 
MS MEMELA:  What elements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  When you – what you want to read is it part of the 
request for bid document? 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 185 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair, it is part of the tender document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  And then I am going to tell you which page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us go there. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  It is page 2062. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2064 – 62? 
MS MEMELA:  2062 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  You will see here Chair on this page it talks about 
evaluation criteria.  And it gives you phase one.  Phase one – ja, I said I 
am not going to read everything.  I am just listing the ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. Phase one talks to critical criteria.  The critical 
criteria are the part where if the bidders do not say yes or no, they get 
disqualified automatically.  So, this the critical criteria are the first phase.  
Phase two, in this regard I think the critical criteria was mixed with the 
functionality.  Sometimes the functionality does not apply if the critical 
criteria is here.  So, phase two talks to price and BEE evaluation.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  And then under BEE evaluation and price it talks to 
reciprocal work should amount to 10% of the value of the contract and it 
be based on the following.  And then it states what is required from them.  
And then there is a partnership joint venture 10%.  There is Supplier 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 186 of 216 
 
Development must form 10% of the contract value and it must entail the 
following.  It states what is required from the bidder. 
   
So, when – Chair when the CFST Team does the evaluation, 
these are the elements they are looking at.  They do not even look at the 
NIP obligation at that time.  So that is what I was trying to highlight to Ms 
Hofmeyr is that the NIP obligation does not apply when Supplier 
Development is part of the document and it has been made as the 
element of the bid. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
But 
you 
agree 
that 
the 
page 
to 
which 
Ms  
Hofmeyr referred you does or does say the NIP obligation was a 
10 
requirement? 
MS MEMELA:  Where – okay can – Chair can I ask Ms Hofmeyr 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was page – what page was that? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It commences at 2083. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2083. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is my understanding of that part of the page correct? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2083. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is where the whole Appendix dealing with the 
NIP obligation begins.  But I can give Ms Memela another reference that 
will make it absolutely clear it was an obligation of this RFP.  But before I 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 187 of 216 
 
get there just to clarify, you were not involved in the specifications for 
this bid, were you? 
MS MEMELA:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No.  So that is left to the CFST Team as I 
understand your evidence.  They put out the RFP and they define its 
criteria, correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  It is not up to the CFST members to decide what the 
criteria or maybe the requirements are in terms of the NIP obligation. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well your evidence suggested that actually you were 
saying when it comes to how they dealt with the matter, they dealt with 
the matter in a manner that showed that as far as they were concerned 
the NIP obligation – NIP was not – the NIP requirement was not an 
obligation.  That is how I understood your evidence. 
MS MEMELA:  The evidence earlier on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your evidence. 
MS MEMELA:  The evidence.  Remember the evidence Chair was talking 
about the requirements of tender.  So, I want to clarify that confusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but the question is this, page 2083. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I have just had a look and that first paragraph 
makes it clear in that after the cabinet decision referred to therein all 
state and parastatal purchases, lease contracts, for goods, works and 
services entered into after this date, that is 30 April 1997, are subject to 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 188 of 216 
 
the NIP requirements.  That is what it says. 
MS MEMELA:  That is what it says Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now something is not a requirement if you can do – you 
can dispense with it.   
MS MEMELA:  Chair this ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  That suggest that it is obligatory. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is how I read it. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, I want you to say exactly how you understand this 
10 
as well irrespective of whether in practice it was applied.  But is that how 
you understand this? 
MS MEMELA:  The understanding Chair as I said this is coming from the 
guidelines of the DTI in terms of the NIP obligation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  And it is copied and pasted on these things so it is 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you understand it to – do you understand it the way 
that I understand it? 
MS MEMELA:  I understand the way that you understand it when it talks 
20 
to the multinational companies alone with no application of Supplier 
Development. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay but do you agree that in this paragraph that we 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 189 of 216 
 
talk about ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No distinction is made between multinational companies 
and companies who supply development?  Do you agree with that? 
MS MEMELA:  In this document I agree Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You agree with that.  But you rely on something else to 
say ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  I rely on the proper legislation from the DTI that gives 
differences between Supplier Development program which is under the 
indirect NIP obligation versus the NIP obligation. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay alright.  So, Ms Hofmeyr can take it from 
there.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes, I will draw your attention to the earlier 
provision of the RFP that made it very clear that it was a condition of the 
proposal that bidders comply with a NIP obligation.  So, I am not relying 
simply on Annexure 13 which I understand your evidence to be is cut and 
paste from something from the DTI. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let us see what the people who specified the 
conditions of the bid required. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Which page? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is at 2043 – 47.  You will see there is a clause 
on that page 1.2.  Can you read the heading of that clause? 
MS MEMELA:  You said 2047, right? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  2047 and you will see it start with a heading, 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 190 of 216 
 
conditions and then there is a 1.1 and a 1.2.  Do you see that? 
MS MEMELA:  1.1 and 1.2 yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  What is the heading of 1.2? 
MS MEMELA:  Condition of the Proposal. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  And read 1.2.1, the first sentence please. 
MS MEMELA:  “This bid is subject to an offset obligation under 
the 
National 
Industrial 
Participation 
requirements 
mandated by the South African Department of Trade and 
Industry.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Direct – can I continue? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Because I mentioned direct NIP and indirect NIP Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh certainly. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.   
““Direct NIP” which is used in procurement where there is 
potential to develop or support direct strategic industries 
or indirect NIP which is used in procurement where there 
is no potential for local manufacturing or supporting 
strategic industries and is to be applied to this bid as one 
20 
of the four tiers of procurement.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes, so unless you tell me otherwise Ms Memela, 
I read this to make it absolutely clear to bidders.  This bid is subject to 
the offset obligation under the NIP and then that is followed up in 
Appendix 13 because the details of the NIP program are set out the 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 191 of 216 
 
obligations of the bidders are made clear.  You have to immediately alert 
the DTI after you are successfully awarded the bid.  So, in that whole 
conspectus of this RFP can you indicate to us why you still maintain that 
it was not a requirement of the RFP? 
MS MEMELA:  Chair I think either Ms Hofmeyr is not understanding what 
I am trying to point out.  In the provision that she asked me to read it 
talks about indirect versus direct NIP.  Direct NIP, that is where it is 
between the multinational company and DTI, SAAT does not get involved.  
And indirect NIP it could be under four tiers and it could be through 
supply development and through other elements that I do not remember 
10 
right now.   
But I am just trying to say still this does not say, okay the NIP 
obligation, the direct part of it should have applied here because they are 
actually saying to the suppliers either or and then go as far as giving the 
suppliers the link to the DTI.  This is when the suppliers is going to find 
out that you cannot apply both Supplier Development and NIP obligation 
both because like I said earlier the Supplier Development is managed and 
controlled by the SOC versus the direct NIP which is managed and 
controlled by the DTI.   
SAAT does not even take – in fact they deal with DTI 
20 
immediately after the tender has been given to them and then DTI is 
notified that, okay these guys are the ones that have been awarded.  
Then the DTI is going to deal with them.  Yes ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  But ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  So, I am hoping that I am clear this time Chair. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 192 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  The NIP provisions. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say there is a reference here to direct NIP and 
indirect NIP. 
MS MEMELA:  This is indirect NIP Chair.  So, the direct – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the provisions would be the same.  The difference 
would be which one is regarded as direct, which on is regarded as 
indirect. 
MS MEMELA:  The provision is not necessarily the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Because on the indirect NIP. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  It gives back the BEE points to the SOC where they now 
calculate that okay under – I actually mentioned this on Friday 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Supplier Development. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  Under Supplier Development, this is what the local 
supplier or black owned supplier is going gain or benefit ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Must do. 
MS MEMELA:  Out of this.  I even made an example Chair of the tier 
20 
agreement for instance that maybe it is shipped from Brussels to Durban 
and then they could agree or make and arrangement that, okay the local 
supplier to – what you call this – to benefit out of this contract.  They will 
be then be transporting the tiers from Durban ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Durban. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 193 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:  To SAAT right.  And I even added that other elements of 
the Supplier Development are through job creation and then also the 
others are transfer of skills, know-how and technology.  So that now is 
indirect NIP obligation Chair.  And then the NIP obligation is the one that 
is mentioned in the page where Ms Hofmeyr was reading for me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Exactly.  That one is direct and it is dealt with by DTI and 
the multinational companies.  SAAT has nothing to do with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  SAAT would be involved with an indirect NIP. 
MS MEMELA:  Thank you Chair. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But when we talk about a NIP obligation it could be 
either or.  It could be either direct NIP or indirect. 
MS MEMELA:  Or indirect, yes Chair.  Hence, I was saying 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether it is a direct or indirect. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It would be obligatory, is that right? 
MS MEMELA:  It will be obligatory. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Which in this regard remember I read for you the elements 
of this tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  Which involved the Supplier Development. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 194 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:  Which counted 10%. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  The direct NIP Chair, Ms Hofmeyr did not read that.  I do 
not know if it is in that document but the direct NIP charge is 30% of the 
contract.  Yes.  And then on the Supplier Development because I even 
mentioned to you that I did not apply or maybe my Team did not apply 
that 30% set aside therefore they were saying 10% that is where they will 
be evaluated upon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Are you aware that SAAT engaged with the DTI 
10 
after this agreement was concluded in about March of 2019.  Were you 
aware of that evidence of Mr Human? 
MS MEMELA:  March 2019 Chair, I was not at SAAT so I am not aware 
who and how DTI was approached but I do know that for the entire tender 
contract, I did approach DTI for the CCMA case and asked them the 
difference between the direct NIP versus indirect NIP.  I remember the DG 
of the NIP obligation actually took me through the processes that is 
followed and even explained that you cannot apply both.  You apply either 
or the other. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And Ms Memela are you aware from Mr Human’s 
evidence that the DTI responded to SAAT, asked for the bid – the RFP, 
asked for JM Aviation and AAR bids and concluded that either SAAT or JM 
Aviation ought to have immediately alerted the DTI after they were 
awarded the tender pursuant to tender obligations. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 195 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:  I am not aware of that Chairperson. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  There is an affidavit to that effect from the 
DTI included in Mr Human’s Annexures.  We will go there in a moment if 
we can.  But before we do that, I just want to complete on the RFP 
because we are in that document.  It is in Exhibit DD22E Ms Memela. 
MS MEMELA:  Chair, are we still – are we closing up on NIP because I do 
not want us to leave.  There is this part that you have raised that talks 
about Mr Human ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes, I – sure, I will take you to the DTI Annexure. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  So, I want us to close that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, she will take you. 
MS MEMELA:  So that whoever is watching this understands exactly how 
it works. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay so the DTI affidavit is in Exhibit 22G it is 
one of the files of Mr Human’s evidence. 
MS MEMELA:  22G? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  22. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  G. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Oh.  Page? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It commences at page 2972.  Chair that is where 
the affidavit of Mr October commences.  That is 2972.  The relevant 
paragraph to which I was making reference in my question to Ms Memela 
appears at 2975. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 196 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:  Mr October I must put it on record Chair that Mr Lionel 
October is the DG Department of Trade and Industry.  It does not state 
that he is the DG for NIP obligation.  So which page you said I must go 
to? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I am not sure what to make of that response.  Are 
we to disregard what he said in his affidavit? 
MS MEMELA:  No, I am not saying that.  I am not saying that 
Chairperson, I am saying remember for each and every department in our 
government there is a certain person deals who a specific subject. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, hang on hang on ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  So, I just thought I should put on the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Wait until you hear what question you are asked. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then if you need to emphasise that in answer to the 
question then you can emphasise.  But let us hear what the question is 
first. 
MS MEMELA:  Chair the question was, was I aware that Mr Human or 
whoever from SAAT had communicated with the DTI and then there is 
20 
communication that says JM Aviation should have notified SAAT or SAAT 
should have notified SAAT. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  So that was the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought that we are coming to this affidavit 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 197 of 216 
 
...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because Ms Hofmeyr wants to ask a question on this 
affidavit. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So the ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of Mr October. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh, Ms Memela had requested us to be taken to 
the affidavit which is why we are going there and the relevant paragraph 
10 
is at 2975 at paragraph 15.  There is some background that has been set 
out by the Director General of the DTI prior to that talking about NIP 
obligations.  How they work in the tender process etcetera. 
MS MEMELA:  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then at paragraph 15 Mr October says: 
“As advised in paragraphs 3 and 6 supra whenever a NIP 
obligation is created by virtue of a purchase agreement 
between a procurement entity and service provider as in 
the present instance between SAAT and JM Aviation, there 
is an obligation on both the procuring entity as well as the 
20 
successful bidder to inform the DTI of the purchase 
agreement.  In this regard one may note that the National 
Treasury Practice note is addressed to all Accounting 
Officers, all Accounting Authorities, all Chief Financial 
Officers, all Heads of Provincial Treasuries and all 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 198 of 216 
 
Provincial Accountants General. In paragraph 5.1 of the 
National Treasury Practice note Accounting Officers and 
Accounting Authorities are required to utilise the revised 
standard bidding document for NIP obligations SBD5 when 
inviting bids that are estimated to be in excess of 10 
million Rand.” 
Chair I just pause there because you will recall we were in 
Appendix 13 of the RFP there was specific reference to the fact that the 
bidders had to complete the SBD5 form.  Then it goes on to say: 
According to paragraph 5.1 B Accounting Officers and Accounting 
10 
Authorities; 
“Are required to furnish the DTI with the information 
listed in that paragraph after the award of any contract 
that is in excess of 10 million Rand.  The DTIs contact 
details are then set out”. 
And importantly, he says, paragraph 5.2 provides that the 
“information must be sent within 5 working days after award of a 
contract.”  So Ms Memela you asked to be taken to where it was that the 
DTI’s Director General had made it clear in his evidence before this 
Commission that there was an obligation on both SAAT and JM Aviation 
20 
within 5 days of the award of the tender to them to alert the DTI to the 
fact that the agreement had been concluded. 
MS MEMELA:  Chair? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Are you satisfied that that is his evidence? 
MS MEMELA:  Chair in his affidavit Mr or Ms October is addressing 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 199 of 216 
 
both direct and indirect NIP obligation as I was saying earlier and he 
goes as far at the end because like now before that he is talking about 
10 million or over 10 million and whatever.  But he goes as far as 
saying under paragraph 19. 
“In the present instance.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Of course he is not clear but like I mean remember we 
might interpret this differently based on what is written here. But for me 
this statement says, after he has stated exactly what is expected of the 
bidders, multinational bidders in terms of the direct NIP obligation to 
10 
notify the DTI or the Accounting Authority which is the Board, 
Accounting Officer which is the CO to notify DTI on the direct NIP 
obligation.  But on this instant in the present instance meaning now he 
understands that it is not the same NIP obligation because this one the 
supply development applies therefore he even says: 
“It was the obligation of JM Aviation being the local 
company 
that 
is 
benefitting 
from 
this 
supply 
development.  They should have notified DTI.”   
Not because DTI is going to manage or control them.  But at 
least they will have a record and of course this should be managed by 
20 
SAAT but they will have a record that the reason why the direct NIP 
obligation did not apply there was indirect NIP that involved Supplier 
Development.  So that is my understanding of the affidavit Ms Hofmeyr 
based on the background I have on the NIP obligation. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ja Ms Memela the difficulty is that nowhere in 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 200 of 216 
 
this affidavit does Mr October draw this direct / indirect NIP contrast.  
He does not refer to a Supplier Development.  What he says in 
paragraph 19 in fact and I will read it into the record is: 
“In the present instance despite the fact that there 
was a duty on JM Aviation to immediately inform the 
DTI that the particular contract was awarded to it, it 
failed to inform the DTI.” 
That is what he is saying in paragraph 18.  He has previously 
told us that there is an obligation.  He sketched what it is.  He said 
there are – it has to be done in five days.  And what he says at 19 is he 
10 
tells the reader what happened in this case.  What happened in this 
case is despite the fact that there was a duty on JM Aviation to 
immediately inform the DTI that the particular contract was awarded to 
it, it failed to do so.  Do you read it in a different way? 
MS MEMELA:  It looks like you read it in the different way in terms of 
understanding the NIP obligation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no. What she is asking ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Chair the ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  What she is asking is whether your reading of it 
differs from her reading of it? 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Yes it differs from her reading of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Not the legislation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Right. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  Or the guidelines that are guiding the NIP 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 201 of 216 
 
obligation. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Chair I think we have exhausted 
the NIP obligation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If we can go back to the RFP because there is 
another provision of the RFP that concern that was breached by JM 
Aviation. 
MS MEMELA:  Chair.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There seems to be a problem. 
MS MEMELA:  I want to add just one statement. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes okay. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  Remember I mentioned to you that we had at SAAT 
three big contracts.  The logistics, the tyre and components.  The 
component that you are talking about now.  And then out of these three 
the two components were provided by a multinational company with no 
involvement of local company.  The tyre was provided by Bridgestone 
being braced in Brussels without any involvement of local company.  
The NIP obligation had always involved them because they are dealing 
with that but the logistics it was provided for by KWE being the South 
African company.  By virtue of that them being the South African 
20 
company and having the BEE points and stuff they did not have to 
adhere to the NIP obligation.  And as a result there is proof that the 
DTI did not even approach or expect the KWESA to adhere to the NIP 
obligation because they were a local company.  So that is what I was 
trying to explain to Ms Hofmeyr the difference between direct and 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 202 of 216 
 
indirect NIP obligation.  We can close Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let us go back to DD22E if we may because 
that is the document that contains the RFP and ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  DD? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  E – 22E which had the RFP that we were 
looking at.   
MS MEMELA:  The one that we were looking at before? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.   
MS MEMELA:  DDB or E? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  E. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  E.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And pick it up at page 2054 if we may.  2054 of 
Exhibit DD22E. 
MS MEMELA:  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You will see there Ms Memela there is a clause 
1.13 headed Corruption. 
MS MEMELA:  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you see that? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And this was a provision of the RFP that said 
20 
the following: 
“If a bidder or any person employed by the bidder is 
found to have either directly or indirectly offered, 
promised or given to any person in the employ of 
South African Airways Technical any commission, 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 203 of 216 
 
gratuity, gift or other consideration South African 
Airways Technical shall have the right and without 
prejudice to any other legal remedy which it may 
have in regard to any loss or additional cost or 
expenses to disqualify the RFP bidder from further 
participation 
in 
this 
process 
and 
any 
other 
subsequent process in this regard.” 
And then it goes on and records: 
“The RFP bidder will be responsible for all and any 
loss that South African Airways Technical may suffer 
10 
as a result thereof.  In addition South African 
Airways Technical reserves the right to exclude such 
bidder from future transactions with South African 
Airways.” 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you see that? 
MS MEMELA:  I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Now what concerns me about this provision is 
that it prohibits bidders or any person employed by the bidder to either 
directly or indirectly give to any person in the employ of SAAT any 
20 
commission, gratuity, gift or other consideration. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And I would like to put to you in the context of 
that prohibition. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 204 of 216 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why it was not that when JM Aviation paid 
indirectly for your benefit because we traversed that on Friday.  You 
accepted that it was indirect benefit that R2.5 million.  And they paid 
that to you an employee of SAAT to purchase your Bedfordview house. 
MS MEMELA:  What? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why would that not be in breach of this 
provision? 
MS MEMELA:  Chair I still maintain and the reason why I corrected Ms 
Hofmeyr on Friday when she said direct and I said indirect.  I maintain 
that there was not benefit with regard to this tender.  The reason why I 
10 
say that is because the agreement to sell the property of my mother 
and look to Mr Ndzeku had nothing to do with me other than that the – 
some of the deposit being 1.5 was going to be paid to the Cove Ridge 
property.  Contrary to what Ms Hofmeyr keeps on referring to the 
Bedfordview.  Of course like that happened after I had changed my 
mind about the Cove Ridge property.  Now the reason why I am saying 
there was no benefit direct or indirect is the fact that I did not sit in the 
Bid Evaluation Committee.  I did not sit in the Board that made the 
decision to award to AAR and JM Aviation.  I did not reciprocate 
...(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well not sitting in the Board or in the Committee 
would not affect the question of whether there was a benefit or not to 
you and whether it was direct or indirect. Not sitting may be a point to 
say, there was no problem because I did not have decision making 
powers which you have said before. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 205 of 216 
 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think your answer you are supposed to deal with 
why was this not an indirect benefit to you? 
MS MEMELA:  Why it was not an indirect benefit to me it is because I 
had never reciprocated the JM to have a winning bid either in GPU or in 
component.  Ms Hofmeyr does have – Hofmeyr sorry ja.  Hofmeyr does 
have evidence that the submission that was made as a recommendation 
to Exco, to BAC initially it said, Lufthansa being the highest preferred 
bidder.  Remember Ms Sambo put it out there to the public that 
Nontsasa Memela helped JM to be the winning bidder.  I had to correct 
10 
that.  The winning bidder was Lufthansa because it was a highest 
scored bidder.  And because of certain risk that were picked by the 
Board or maybe the CFST it was written back.  And then the second 
one was Air France based on the points that were put by the CFST that 
okay the risk will be if we start with any other company that has never 
dealt with SAAT before so we would rather appoint or award to Air 
France and Kwane Capital at that time.  Now I said to you Chair I had 
signed in support of the recommendation by the CFST.  Meaning I was 
satisfied with what they had said to me that okay the reason why we 
are going for Air France is because of this.  So the reason why I am 
20 
saying there is no direct or indirect benefit or gratification towards me 
because I did not sign any tender that was giving AAR and JM in 2016 
saying they must win this.  We signed the recommendation for Air 
France and then the Board made its own independent decision to say, I 
see Management CFST you have recommended this but from us as the 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 206 of 216 
 
Accounting Authority of this organisation this is what we think should 
happen and then they overruled the recommendation by the CFST and 
Management of SAAT and awarded it to JM Aviation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair just one follow up question if I may and 
then it might be a convenient time to talk about logistics?  Ms Memela 
this particular provision of the RFP does not link the benefit to any 
possible influence that it may have on the recipient, do you see that? 
MS MEMELA:  Are you – okay can you ask the question again? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Sure.  I understood your answer to be it is not 
10 
a benefit because I did not reciprocate. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Was that your evidence? 
MS MEMELA:  That is the evidence. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I say this clause of the RFP does not require it 
to constitute corruption under this clause that the benefit then be 
reciprocated or the benefit result in an ability to influence decision 
making.  On its own terms it is a clear prohibition on any bidder directly 
or indirectly giving a gratuity gift or other consideration to any person 
in the employ of SAAT.  And I would like to know why if you contend 
20 
this provision was not breached by the R2.5 million that was used for 
your Bedfordview house why it is?  And let me just be clear. 
MS MEMELA:  Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Your answer until this point has drawn focus on 
reciprocation.  I am saying reciprocation has nothing to do with this 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 207 of 216 
 
provision. 
MS MEMELA:  Chair it is read very clear that it talks to gratification, 
gifts, gratuity gift or other consideration.  None of these apply to me 
because there was no gratification and I explained – the reason why I 
explained – why there was no gratification.  I was getting to this.  And 
there was no gift coming from the bidder directly to me.  So that like 
they can win the tender or do anything.  I did explain earlier on Chair 
that the offer to purchase like which the Commission will see eventually 
either from Mr Ndzeku or after I had gone to Eastern Cape to send it 
afterwards.  They will see that like that offer to purchase was signed 
10 
November 2015 and the fact that the – Mr Ndzeku through JM paid in 
May 5 does not make the gratuity it – the gratuity to me or the gift.  It 
was still paying for that property that was bought from my mother.  And 
secondly Chair the award was made by the Board I think on the 12 t h of 
May 2016.  Remember Ms Hofmeyr is trying to link certain dates 
because the payment was made on the 5 of May and then the award by 
the Board was made on the 12 May 2016 but she did not add the fact 
that the contract commenced in October 2016.  Where after the award?   
So in case like maybe there is a picture that is being put out there that 
okay they must have used the money from here that they received from 
20 
SAAT to pay for the property for my mother and stuff like – so I just had 
to gooi in the date when the contract commenced which is all the 
suppliers get paid after they start providing services. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair I am just mindful of the time.  We have 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 208 of 216 
 
hit 17:00 and you indicated ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes we are at 17:00. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That you were happy to sit late. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but we now have a good idea that Ms Memela 
may have to come back. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because she and her legal representative are still 
going to consult her next bet.  So we have – one option is that we stop 
and then when she comes back she comes back at a time when they 
have been able to do – to consult an expert.  And then she continues 
10 
and until she finishes that is one option.  Another option would be that 
we continue maybe for another 30 minutes but it may be that it will not 
serve much purpose to continue for another 30 minutes if she is going 
to come back anyway some other time.  But it may well be that in terms 
of your plan it might help you to close off something. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What do you think? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair I want to propose that there is maybe a 
third option. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If I may? 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Certainly the debate between experts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  May actually resolve themselves. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 209 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You know that is how the experts usually one 
side, one side ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  They look at – they give a report and then 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If there is not a dispute between them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because the expert’s evidence is very limited. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It simply does the metadata show what the 
Commission’s investigators has said it has shown. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  All that I am reluctant to do is delay all of the 
evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In completing of Ms Memela for a situation 
where there may be agreement between experts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We just do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So I wanted to say in relation to finalising her 
evidence but for the expert engagement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 210 of 216 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Which must certainly take place you had 
indicated that we could continue for 30 minutes.  My concern with that 
is that Ms Mbanjwa has already indicated that she would like to re-
examine.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And my sense is that that will not be completed 
this evening. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no, no that will not be completed – that might not 
be completed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So our proposal Chair is really the following.  If 
10 
it would be possible to start a bit earlier tomorrow we could then 
complete Ms Memela’s questions from our side.  We could then move to 
the re-examination that Ms Mbanjwa wishes to do.  And then once that 
is completed subject to other clarifications we would move to the 
evidence of Mr Ndzeku.  I have already spoken to Mr Ndzeku’s legal 
representatives and they indicated that they would be able to start 
early tomorrow.  I cannot recall whether I asked Ms Mbanjwa about that 
but we can get her views now.  Our proposal from the Legal Team’s 
side would be we reconvene a bit earlier tomorrow, we seek to conclude 
Ms Memela with the re-examination tomorrow and hold off on experts 
20 
because it may be resolved and she will not have to come back.  We 
then move to the evidence of Mr Ndzeku which Chair I am fairly 
confident we would complete tomorrow but possibly with a bit of use of 
the evidence on Wednesday.  We had been in touch about the 
possibility 
of 
slotting 
another 
witness 
in 
on 
Wednesday 
but 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 211 of 216 
 
unfortunately I can report to you that his Legal Team is not available on 
Wednesday.  So we actually do have Wednesday morning to the extent 
that you are available Chair to then conclude Mr Ndzeku’s evidence.  
And it would be our submission that we then conclude this aspect of the 
investigation and it would be in the interest of the Commission to do 
so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  Well let me check with Ms Memela and then I 
will go to Ms Mbanjwa.  Would your situation permit you to be back 
tomorrow?  I know that you made special arrangements to be available 
today. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Okay Chair after my lawyer had mentioned to me that 
she will need extra time to go through certain documentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Including the policy of the company, certain legislation 
and stuff so before she can start with her re-examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Re-examination. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes so I had already postponed my trip again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MS MEMELA:  To Eastern Cape so I will be available. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would be available? 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Tomorrow yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Tomorrow.  Oh okay. 
MS MEMELA:  But I am not sure about the early part of it yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, ja we will talk about that now.  Ms Mbanjwa 
what do you say to this suggestion? 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 212 of 216 
 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Firstly Chair I may have difficulties.  I do 
not know how early is maybe that should be ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well she is leaving it to me that is why she has not 
said. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  No, no it is just that …(indistinct) Chair is 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am thinking that well actually Ms Hofmeyr is 
listening.  If Wednesday’s witness is not going to be coming and 
therefore Wednesday morning is available for Mr Ndzeku to finish if he 
did not finish – if he does not finish tomorrow afternoon I wonder 
10 
whether there would be a need to even start early tomorrow morning.  
From your side how much more time do you think you might need to 
finish your part before Ms Mbanjwa re-examines? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair if it was only ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I know that ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It was only me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I know that Ms Memela will ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that is me in a room without the Chair, Ms 
Memela. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But she will be very crisp tomorrow. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Or Ms Mbanjwa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She will be very crisp tomorrow. 
MS MEMELA:  I will be crisp tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In her answers. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I should not be more than half an hour then 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 213 of 216 
 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Well in that event it does not look like Ms 
Mbanjwa you can come – it does not look like we should really need to 
start early so maybe we should just start normal time 10:00? 
MS MEMELA:  Ten o’clock.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would that be fine with you Ms Mbanjwa? 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Yes that – no that would assist. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That would assist? 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  That would assist Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  No, no that is fine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair sorry I have just had an indication from 
Mr Ndzeku’s lawyers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  They are a little bit concerned about how long 
Ms Mbanjwa anticipates the re-examination might be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just insofar as how much time we would lose 
tomorrow. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So maybe it would be useful if she could also 
give us an indication there.  I think they are quite keen to be able to 
conclude the evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ms Mbanjwa what is your estimation?  I will not 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210 
 
Page 214 of 216 
 
allow you to have as much as you might wish but what is your estimate 
of how much time you might need for re–examination? 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  I – we wanted a full day Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I will not give you a full day. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Then if we do not get a full day then we 
will just take it as far as we can be allowed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see ...(intervenes). 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  But what ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  The re-examination contemplated in the regulations 
as I understand it is meant to enable you to just clarify areas where the 
10 
witness might not have – her evidence might not be understood.  You 
know.  So that is why I would not give you a whole day. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  Too much time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I think if it helps you I can tell you that counsel 
who have re-examined their clients before I do not remember anybody 
who has gone beyond two hours if I recall correctly.  Mostly it has been 
under that.  If that helps to give guidance.  But let us say you get the 
message from me. 
MS MEMELA:  I get the message. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  I get the message. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So let us start tomorrow at 10:00, do the best you can 
to focus on really areas of clarification and then we will take it from 
there. 
MS MEMELA:  Thank you Chair. 
10 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 210
