20 
in front of you a file with a section open already for you 
against marker W16 and if you can look at the page 
number at the top left hand corner the last few digits 237 
you see that? 
MR DREVIN:  Yes. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 5 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Am I correct that this is the first page 
of your statement/affidavit? 
MR DREVIN:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  If I may take you now to page 251.   
MR DREVIN:  Got it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Do you see near the top there is 
signature above the typed name Mr Martin Drevin. Is that 
your signature? 
MR DREVIN:  That is my signature. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And is it correct that you signed this 
10 
in front of Commissioner of Oaths? 
MR DREVIN:  That is correct. 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
With 
taking 
the 
oath 
or 
the 
affirmation? 
MR DREVIN:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right thank you.  Have you been 
through this document and its annexures and can you 
confirm for the Chair please that you are satisfied with its 
contents and that those contents are true and correct? 
MR DREVIN:  I have been through it and I am satisfied 
20 
Chair.  Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you.  Chair we would then ask 
formally for your leave to admit the affidavit with its 
annexures starting at page 257 that is Denel Bundle 04 
Exhibit W16. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 6 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The statement/affidavit of Mr Martin 
Drevin starting at page 237 is admitted as Exhibit W16. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  With your leave 
may I lead the witness on what I believe is uncontroversial. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Issues relating to his background 
etcetera? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you.  Mr Drevin you currently 
employed at DLS is that correct? 
10 
MR DREVIN:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And what is your job title? 
MR DREVIN:  My job title is Program Manager Hoefyster 
Phase 2. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Hoefyster Phase 2? 
MR DREVIN:  Phase 2. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  You are en engineer by 
background? 
MR DREVIN:  Yes I am. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  A senior engineer.  You joined 
20 
as a senior engineer in 2008, is that correct? 
MR DREVIN:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Were you involved in relation to the 
Hoefyster Project Phase 1? 
MR DREVIN:  I was involved in the Project Phase 1 as a 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 7 of 310 
 
Systems Engineer. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now you then refer to in 
paragraph 13 to your being involved in – in relation to the 
contract variation order.  What did that involve? 
MR DREVIN:  The contract for Hoefyster actually right from 
the start included Phase 1 and Phase 2 the development 
and the industrialisation and production.  But with – before 
Phase 2 started off there were further negotiations that 
changed the contract. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right and then you… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Drevin.  I am going to ask you to raise 
your voice please.  Thank you. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Mr Drevin.  You then refer 
to your being moved in October 2011 to a newly created 
department in Infantry Systems.  Did this – did this mean 
that you were carrying on dealing with issues relating to 
Hoefyster or were you removed from that? 
MR DREVIN:  That means that I was – I was still involved 
in Hoefyster. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Still involved.  And then there was a 
20 
further change in your job functions in 1.5 where you were 
now tasked to concentrate only on Hoefyster. 
MR DREVIN:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  During the design and manufacture 
etcetera.  And then you refer to DLS being awarded the 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 8 of 310 
 
Hoefyster Phase 2 order and you then became responsible 
for the execution of the order and that was around October 
2013. 
MR DREVIN:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  And then you set out your 
previous work background.  Then you refer also once you 
became Program Manager for Hoefyster Phase 2 your 
responsibilities in 1.7.  Is that correct? 
MR DREVIN:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Alright thank you.  Now let us get to 
10 
the – the meat of your affidavit.  If you can turn please to 
paragraph 2 that starts on page 240.   
MR DREVIN:  I have got it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now here you are dealing with 
the platform hull request for quotation abbreviated as RFQ, 
is that right? 
MR DREVIN:  That is right. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And so there was a request for 
quotations issued in 2012 and if you then look ahead to 
paragraph 3 there was a request for quotations issued in 
20 
2014.  Were there two different separate RFO’s the one in 
2012 and the other in 2014 for the same thing? 
MR DREVIN:  The one in 2014 was a request for update. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Was for what? 
MR DREVIN:  A request for update. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 9 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  For updates. I see so it related to the 
same … 
MR DREVIN:  The same. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  The same subject matter.  Right.  Now 
you refer to the RFQ in 2014 I am in paragraph 3.2 being 
synced out as an updated request by Mr Henk Van Den 
Heever.  He will be the witness that follows you.  And then 
you refer to the specification.  You were not involved in it? 
MR DREVIN:  No the specification is actually comes from 
Patria the platform supplier. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  Who in fact had to draw up the 
RFQ? 
MR DREVIN:  That was Supply Chain. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Supply Chain.  Right. And you are on 
the technical side rather than the Supply Chain side, am I 
right? 
MR DREVIN:  Correct.  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay.  Alright and then you refer to 
input also from a quality assurance department. 
MR DREVIN:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And … 
MR DREVIN:  The RFQ has got this different annexures. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MR 
DREVIN: 
 
And 
different 
annexures 
were 
the 
responsibility of different departments. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 10 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Can I just please ask you 
again to try and speak a bit more clearly and a bit more 
loud so we can all hear and the recording can pick it up.  
Thank you.  Now you then refer in paragraph 3.6 to the 
updated request for proposals.  May I take you in the same 
bundle to one of the annexures – page 252?   
MR DREVIN:  I have got the page. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now 252 is one of the letters 
that you refer to with the name and signature of Mr Van 
Den Heever the Procurement Officer for DLS, correct? 
10 
MR DREVIN:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And 252 is a letter sent to LMT.  253 
is also a letter to LMT a longer letter.  And – and that is 
accompanied by certain emails.  Then I can take you 
please to 259 that is a letter from Mr Van Den Heever to 
VR Laser. 
MR DREVIN:  I found it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Another one at 260, is that correct? 
MR DREVIN:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And then a further letter – a series of 
20 
letters to DCD from page 264. 
MR DREVIN:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now so these were three 
entities LMT, VR Laser and DCD. 
MR DREVIN:  Yes. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 11 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  What was the purpose of this letter as 
you understood it? 
MR DREVIN:  This was the request to update their offers of 
2012. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Their offers.  So had they – had each 
of these three entities submitted proposals previously 
which were now being asked to be updated? 
MR DREVIN:  Yes before the – or during the negotiations 
for Phase 2 we priced some of the more expensive 
components we went out for RFQ to ensure that our price 
10 
basis was still in line. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But if they – my question is simply 
this.  If they are being asked to update proposals 
presumably they submitted original proposals prior to being 
asked to be updated. 
MR DREVIN:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And when did they do that?  Was that 
in response to the 2012 request or the 2014 request?  The 
original proposal. 
MR DREVIN:  2012 request. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  2012.  Now in that process in 2012 
had it been submitted – had it been advertised generally to 
the marketplace resulting in only three people responding 
or had they been specifically invited in 2012 to submit 
proposals just those three? 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 12 of 310 
 
MR DREVIN:  They were specifically invited. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Invited.  Why was it not put out as it 
were on open tender in 2012?  Are you able to answer 
that? 
MR DREVIN:  No. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay.  Alright.  Now if I can take you 
back please to your affidavit.  Paragraph 3.6 and we here 
now at page 241.  You refer to a request for the updates to 
contain a breakdown of prices, what were they being asked 
for now was the price for the armour hull – the armour hull 
10 
excluding 
mine 
protection. 
 
Then 
a 
price 
for 
mine 
protection only.  And then prices to exclude all jigs and 
fixtures as Patria was responsible for the supply of these.  
And then further – yes.  Now why were you as Denel Land 
Services wanting to have a split of the prices – a 
breakdown in the prices? 
MR DREVIN:  There was a thought that the work could be 
dished out to different suppliers and that we could give the 
contract for the mine protection to one company and a 
contract for the armour hull to a different company. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Alright then.  Thank you.  Now you 
then refer to responses having been received from these 
three entities, correct? 
MR DREVIN:  Ja it is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  May I just have a moment Chair.   
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 13 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  If I may take you now please Mr 
Drevin to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Drevin are you drinking tea?  It is not 
right that you should be drinking tea while you are giving 
evidence there.  I am going to adjourn for five minutes to 
allow you to finish your tea so that when we continue we – 
you will be done.  You can drink water but not tea or eat. 
MR DREVIN:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I will adjourn for five minutes. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
CHAIRPERSON:  All rise.   
HEARING RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   The legal team and other people must 
just make sure witnesses do not bring tea or food to drink 
or eat while they are giving evidence.  There is time for tea 
when we will all take a break and have tea.  Water they 
can have while they give evidence.  Okay let us continue. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair I must apologise I 
20 
had not noticed I have got bad eyesight and I am at an 
angle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Where I had not noticed so I 
apologise otherwise I would have dealt with it but we will 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 14 of 310 
 
bear that in mind for future witnesses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you – thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now the – if I can take you please to 
page 268.  Is this the revised proposal or response that 
you refer to in your affidavit as having been received from 
LMT? 
MR DREVIN:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And if I can ask you to turn now to 
10 
page 274 is this the response that was received from VR 
Laser? 
MR DREVIN:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And from page 282 is this the 
response you referred to in your affidavit as having been 
received from DCD? 
MR DREVIN:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now you refer in your affidavit to a 
bid evaluation committee in 2014 a cross-functional team.  
Were you involved in that? 
20 
MR DREVIN:  I was involved in that yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  In what way? 
MR DREVIN:  I was a member of the bid committee. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  And your affidavit sets out the 
various other members.  We do not need to go through 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 15 of 310 
 
those.  They include though your name as well as Ms 
Malahlela the Supply Chain Department Head from DLS 
together with her colleagues. 
MR DREVIN:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  And then there are various 
other people with technical and business roles.  Now you 
have referred in your affidavit to the three suppliers 
attending feedback sessions at DLS’s premises in its Eagle 
board room and these were seen individually for the 
feedback session VR Laser, DCD and LMT.  They were 
10 
seen at different times that you have set out in your 
affidavit.  Did you take part in those feedback sessions? 
MR DREVIN:  I signed one of the registers so yes I did. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I am sorry just speak clearly. 
MR DREVIN:  I signed one of the registers so I would have 
been there. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  You would have been there?  Okay 
yes you have referred to the attendance register and then 
if I can take you please to page 389.  It is Annexure MD10.  
It is headed Meeting with VR Laser.  And then there are a 
20 
number of questions that are put and responses that are 
filled in in the last column.  What is this document please? 
MR DREVIN:  There was a questionnaire that was drawn up 
for each of the suppliers and this was a record of their 
responses in this clarification meeting. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 16 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  And so was this the 
questionnaire with the responses that were given during 
the feedback session with the relevant respective supplier 
in this case it was VR Laser? 
MR DREVIN:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And was the same process followed in 
relation to the other two? 
MR DREVIN:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  DCD and LMT and you refer to that in 
your affidavit and you have attached the – the list of 
10 
questions and the answers in your further annexures, is 
that right? 
MR DREVIN:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  May I just ask before we proceed to 
the next item in your affidavit did it strike you as 
significant that each of them was dealt with separately in 
private question and answer feedback sessions rather than 
them all being in the same room at the same time? 
MR DREVIN:  No it did not strike me as unusual.  The 
questions were different for the different suppliers. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now – and the process to be followed 
from a Supply Chain Management process that was not 
your responsibility – am I right? 
MR DREVIN:  That was not my responsibility no. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay.  Alright thank you.  And then 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 17 of 310 
 
you refer in your affidavit to something that happened after 
these feedback meetings.  They were given an opportunity 
to submit revised proposals based on the issues during the 
meetings.  Now they had already submitted proposals in 
2012 which they were then asked to update in 2014.  Is 
this now a further opportunity for them to update their 
proposals again? 
MR DREVIN:  That was a further opportunity. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  Who decided on that?  Was that 
the cross-functional team of which you were a member? 
10 
MR DREVIN:  No it was Supply Chain. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Was that Supply Chain itself? 
MR DREVIN:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Was it unusual in your experience for 
Supply Chain to be asking parties who have submitted 
proposals and then revised proposals to be given a further 
opportunity to revise their proposals further? 
MR DREVIN:  No it was not but this was the first time I was 
involved in such a process. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay.  Now were further revised 
20 
proposals 
then 
received 
from 
these 
three 
interested 
parties? 
MR DREVIN:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Can I take you please to page 422.  
Sorry may I just have a moment I am sure that is a correct 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 18 of 310 
 
…[mumbling].  Apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is going to be quite difficult to read?  
422 you said? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I am sorry Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say 422? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Ja I said if you can just hold on I 
think that that is – that is in fact a wrong reference. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I apologise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.   
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes may I take you rather to page 
393?  You have that? 
MR DREVIN:  I have got that – I found it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now you refer to that in your affidavit 
as being the further revised proposal received by LMT in 
response to that invitation.  Is that correct? 
MR DREVIN:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And then at 401 is that the further 
revised proposal from VR Laser? 
MR DREVIN:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And then 40 – 410 is that the further 
revised proposal from DCD? 
MR DREVIN:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now you have referred in your 
affidavit for the Chair ’s assistance it is paragraph 4.16 of 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 19 of 310 
 
the affidavit to the bid evaluation committee reconvening to 
do final scoring.  Was that part – or were you part of that 
process? 
MR DREVIN:  I was part of that process yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And what specifically were you 
required to assist in for scoring? 
MR DREVIN:  We did the scoring for the technical 
component of the bid evaluation. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Can I take you back in your 
affidavit to page 245?  You refer in paragraph 4.20 to a 
10 
consolidated evaluation sheet which we are going to look 
at in a moment.  There was a weight allocated to each 
category of items. Price was 25%, Functionality 45% and 
BBBEE 30%.  Now you were looking at the technical side. 
MR DREVIN:  The functionality. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I am sorry. 
MR DREVIN:  The functionality. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  The functionality yes.  So it was the 
functionality with a 45% weighting for the scoring? 
MR DREVIN:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  We – you were not involved in looking 
at price and what score to give to each – each of the 
bidders in their revised proposals, is that correct? 
MR DREVIN:  That is correct we did not look at the price or 
the BBBEE score that was populated by Supply Chain. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 20 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay thank you.  And then if we can 
just for completeness look at the document you referred to.  
Can I take you to page 422?  Is that the evaluation… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the one that I think… 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes that is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I cannot read. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  That is where I was confused earlier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  422 this time is the 
correct reference Mr Drevin as I understand it but I would 
10 
like you to confirm. Is that the consolidated evaluation 
sheet that is referred to as being the one that was 
populated through the scoring that was given by the team 
of which you formed part? 
MR DREVIN:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay and you – you were presumably 
responsible 
for 
advising 
on 
what 
score 
would 
be 
appropriate 
for 
the 
functionality 
element 
when 
you 
compared the one – the one bidder with the others? 
MR DREVIN:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you able to read what is written there 
Mr Drevin?  Oh is there a better copy somewhere or can it 
be made or can this be enlarged? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  It can be enlarged Chair.  We will… 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 21 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  It can be enlarged. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Make sure that that is done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Would you struggle to read 
it Mr Drevin? 
MR DREVIN:  That is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  As it is? 
MR DREVIN:  This is correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay no that is fine. 
MR DREVIN:  I can recognise it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  If it can be enlarged then this can 
10 
be replaced with the one that is enlarged. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you we will… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  We will attend to that.  Thank you 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I am afraid some of the annexures in 
some of these affidavits do suffer from the same problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes well.. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But I do not believe that I need to 
20 
take the witness through it subject to your guidance as to 
the different components of the contents of this particular 
page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine as long as we will 
have an enlarged one. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 22 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  We will certainly attend to this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In due course. I had said last year or 
even the year before to the legal team that they need make 
sure that they identify beforehand copies that are not 
legible and take steps to get legible ones or … 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Get them – get them enlarged but I think 
it does not always happen. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I am afraid not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But at least if they can attend to that 
10 
even after then that will be better. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  As you please Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you.  Now may I take you back 
to page 246?   
MR DREVIN:  I am there. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  You refer to the scoring that was then 
done and in 425 you refer to the scoring that shows that 
LMT came second in line by receiving an overall score of 
64.78% which was 0.76% less than VR Laser but in relation 
20 
to the price I am here now reading from your paragraph 
4.25.2: 
“LMT’s financial offer was R165.6 odd million making it the 
cheapest out of the three suppliers.” 
MR DREVIN:  That is correct. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 23 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  If we compare that with VR Laser you 
deal with that in 4.23 and we see there in 4.23.1 that their 
price was in fact R262.4 odd million which is almost R100 
million more than the LMT offer. 
MR DREVIN:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Despite that VR Laser was able 
because of the weighting presumably of the factors to beat 
LMT in terms of scoring by 0.76%.  Now you then deal in 
4.26 - 4.26 with BBBEE credentials and scoring.  Was that 
part of your duties and responsibilities? 
10 
MR DREVIN:  No it was not. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay.  And we have heard evidence 
from previous witnesses dealing with this. Now you refer in 
the next paragraph to a supplier audit having been done 
for the platform hull previously by Patria.  Were you aware 
of that at the time and what did this involve? 
MR DREVIN:  The supplier audit was part of the tasks that 
Patria were contracted to and I know about – I knew about 
the report. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And was this an issue that related to 
20 
your interest in functionality? 
MR DREVIN:  No I did not take that into account. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay.  Now there was then a 
recommendation made 4.28 – made after the consolidated 
– consolidated evaluation template was done that we have 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 24 of 310 
 
looked at.  There was a submission to EXCO of DLS 
recommending that VR Laser should be awarded this 
Hoefyster contract for the platform hulls because it was the 
highest scoring bidder.  Were you part of that – of that 
process making that recommendation?  Was that part of 
the cross-functional team that you were a member of? 
MR DREVIN:  No our work stopped at finishing the 
evaluation. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  The evaluation – right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Drevin can I ask the question what is 
10 
your recollection of how big the gap was in terms of 
functionality between LMT and VR Laser in terms of 
scores? 
MR DREVIN:  I am sorry Chair can you just repeat? 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is your recollection of the gap 
between the points you gave to LMT and the points you 
gave to VR Laser in terms of functionality?  How big was 
that gap in terms of scoring them? 
MR DREVIN:  It was quite a significant gap. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was quite a significant gap okay 
20 
alright.  Thank you. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  In favour of VR Laser? 
MR DREVIN:  In favour of VR Laser. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And can you just give very briefly a 
summary of why you scored them higher – VR Laser? 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 25 of 310 
 
MR DREVIN:  We had different questions to answer in the 
evaluation sheet each which had its own score and going 
through that process of answering each of these points 
that was the end result. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in terms of scoring functionality a 
bidder ’s experience would not count would it?  In other 
words if LMT had done this quite – this type of job for 
some time and had experience but VR Laser did not have 
any such experience but maybe in terms of its responses in 
regard to functionality questions on functionality you might 
10 
be satisfied that it should get higher scoring compared to 
LMT who might have some experience but maybe have not 
responded to questions on functionality in a certain way? 
MR DREVIN:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Mr Drevin your affidavit then goes on 
to – in paragraph 431 to refer to your becoming aware of 
press articles referring to links with the Gupta’s and that 
you raised.. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry – I am sorry Mr Kennedy.  Mr 
Drevin you might not be able to answer this but you will tell 
me.  One would have thought that experience should count 
for something in this type of competition.  You do not know 
whether 
it 
counted 
for 
anything 
not 
necessarily 
on 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 26 of 310 
 
functionality but on everything that was supposed to be 
taken into account. 
MR DREVIN:  No as far as I remember when we did the 
scoring it was not known that VR Laser had a link. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but what I am asking is would you 
not agree that experience in doing a particular job should 
count for something when bidders compete to do a job you 
know.  Somebody who has never done the job that should 
be something to take into account compared to somebody 
who may have a track record of doing the job in a certain 
10 
way whether good or bad. 
MR DREVIN:  It would depend on if those resources were 
still available that had built that had experience. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
MR DREVIN:  It would depend on if the resources were still 
available the knowledge was still – most of the knowledge 
is imbedded in the people. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I am just speaking now in general.  
I am just saying I see that in terms of scoring here there is 
no reference to experience you know.  There is just the 
20 
price, functionality and you said that functionality here did 
not include history or experience you know.  So I am just 
wondering why there would not be a factor or some points 
that should go to experience.  But as I say it might be 
something you are not able to answer.  I am just thinking if 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 27 of 310 
 
somebody says I have experience of driving a bus for the 
past fifteen years without any accidents and somebody 
says I just got my licence to drive a bus yesterday that it 
should count for something when you say who do you give 
this job to and it looks like here that there was no room for 
that. 
MR DREVIN:  There was no question for that in the 
evaluation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I just find it strange.  Okay alright.  
Thank you. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  If I might just 
pursue this for a moment? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Mr Drevin did you not find it strange 
that if – that there was no question or scoring attached to 
the experience of a particular perspective contractor 
relating to its experience?  Because as the Chair points 
out is that not a relevant issue that you should consider 
when evaluating bids to see not only is for example do they 
have a factory and do they have technicians and so forth.  
20 
But do they actually have experience not just skills on 
paper or resources on paper but actually a track record?  
Did you not find it strange that that was not being looked 
at? 
MR DREVIN:  There were certain aspects of that covered 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 28 of 310 
 
in the questions. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  That covered in the questions. 
MR DREVIN:  Ja certain aspects. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Was that… 
MR DREVIN:  That we could – that would cover that 
indirectly. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But – indirectly? But would it – would 
it be taken into account when you actually determining the 
scoring?  Because it is the scoring that ultimately is what 
gave VR Laser by a marginal difference a superior score to 
10 
that of the others? 
MR DREVIN:  The – I think the relevant question in that 
regard 
was 
one 
about 
the 
capability 
– 
the 
current 
capability and the current… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but capability is not the same as what 
Mr Kennedy is asking.  If you produce a driver ’s licence 
that says you are permitted to drive a bus and you got it 
yesterday and I produce a driver ’s licence that says I am 
permitted to drive a bus but I got it a long time ago.  I have 
been driving for a long time.  We are not on the same basis 
20 
I have – if I – if my experience as being – I have doing that 
job well that should count for something when I am 
compared to you who has no track record. Even though we 
both have the ability to drive a bus and we are permitted 
to.  You understand? 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 29 of 310 
 
MR DREVIN:  Ja I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But now when you look at the scoring 
here it says you score for price, you score for functionality, 
you score for BBBEE and so I asked you earlier on whether 
when you score functionality the question of experience or 
track record comes in you said no.  And I could understand 
that.  But then obviously it cannot come under price and it 
cannot come under BBBEE.  So it means it seems to me 
that no provision was made for giving points to experience 
or a good track record of doing this job.  That is how it 
10 
seems to me.  Does that accord with your understanding of 
what it was at the time? 
MR DREVIN:  The questions on the – on the bid evaluation 
did not specifically cover experience but indirectly it 
covered the capabilities. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DREVIN:   Current capabilities. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes then Mr Kennedy’s question arises is 
he was asking whether you did not find that strange that 
there was no provision to give points in relation to 
20 
experience or check records? 
MR DREVIN:  No it felt like all the aspects were covered by 
the questions in the bid evaluation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you.  I think I have taken it as 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 30 of 310 
 
far as I can on this – on this aspect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  If I may proceed then Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Mr Drevin may I then take you please 
to page 476?   
MR DREVIN:  I found it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right now at the top of that page we 
see an email from you addressed to Ms Avishkar Govender 
who was she? 
10 
MR DREVIN:  He was the … 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Is it he I am sorry. 
MR DREVIN:  It is a he.  He was responsible for the overall 
program management on Hoefyster both phase 1 and phase 
2. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right we are going to look at in a 
moment at what you said in the email that you refer in that 
email to something that appears below.  There is an email 
below from Mr Govender and then below that he appears to 
be forwarding what appears at the foot of the page which is 
20 
an email that originated from Heyns Van Der Merwe 
addressed to Mr Steyn, Mr Cartwright, Mr Kok, Mr Lubbe, 
Mr Klapper, Mr Govender and Mr Van Den Heever.  Did you 
come into possession of this email?  Were you aware of 
this one at the bottom that refers to a media article? 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 31 of 310 
 
MR DREVIN:  I received it – my superior Mr Govender cc’s 
it to me.  If you look at the middle of the page. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MR DREVIN:  I am part of the PCPO group. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  That is if you look at the email from 
Mr Govender on the 7 July.  It is addressed to Infantry 
Systems Management PCPO and Celia Malahlela.  So you 
are part of PCPO? 
MR DREVIN:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now we can read for ourselves 
10 
the media article and the heading is – appears in bold at 
the foot of page 476. It says:  Gupta’s and Duduzane Zuma 
are hidden stakeholders in a strategic locomotive sub-
contracting company bought well the main tender process 
was on-going.  And then it refers in the text under the 
photograph of the chairperson of Transnet’s board Tender 
Committee Mr Iqbal Sharma.  But then in the text of the 
article refers to the VR Laser Services company and 
connections with the Mr Rajesh Gupta and Mr Duduzane 
Zuma.  Now is this the article - was that the reason that 
20 
jolted into sending your sending your email at the top of 
page 476? 
MR DREVIN:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And may I just read of the brief 
text that you set out in our email.  You say: 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 32 of 310 
 
“I have this fear that if we go with VR...” 
 
Now that is VR Laser, is that correct? 
MR DREVIN:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
“...that at the end, we will still be forced by Denel to 
change 
the 
LMT 
possible 
after 
the 
TOT 
has 
happened.” 
 
What does TOT mean? 
MR DREVIN:   Transfer of Technology. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Transfer of...? 
10 
MR DREVIN:   Technology. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Technology.  Thank you. 
“...has happened which will make it even worse.” 
 
Now when you say:  If we go with VR Laser.  Are you 
referring to what we have just been discussing about the 
scoring of the proposals received in relation to the Platform 
Hull Contract for Hoefyster? 
MR DREVIN:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Then your emails says that: 
“The below input...” 
20 
 
Is that the emails and the press article that we see 
below? 
MR DREVIN:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
“...that the below input and the low price LMT 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 33 of 310 
 
quoted...” 
 
We have dealt with that earlier.  Was that the 162... 
R 160 odd million compared with VR Laser almost a hundred 
million higher?  Is that what you were referring to? 
MR DREVIN:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, let us continue. 
“...brings me to a point where I get the feeling that 
we go with LMT.” 
 
Were you suggesting that rather the decision should be 
taken by the senior management and instead awarding it to 
10 
VR Laser it should go to LMT? 
MR DREVIN:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  You were not in your job vested 
with the power to make that decision but this was a 
recommendation, was it to your colleague, Mr Govender, that 
it should be reconsidered the award to VR Laser? 
MR DREVIN:   No, it was not within my power. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It was what? 
MR DREVIN:   It was not within my power to ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It was not within your power.  But you 
20 
could still express your views, correct? 
MR DREVIN:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And that is what you were doing here? 
MR DREVIN:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that right? 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 34 of 310 
 
MR DREVIN:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And then you say apart from... 
“...that we go with LMT, avoid fallout from Denel.  
Avoid possible fallout from this potential debacle...” 
 
What debacle were you referring to there? 
MR DREVIN:   The one that is the Transnet transaction. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
“...and spend the difference in price to get LMT up 
to standard with sufficient space facilities and 
resources 
to 
handle 
the 
Platform 
Hulle 
10 
manufacturing.” 
 
This last part, what were you referring to there?  Just 
expand on that, please? 
MR DREVIN:   LMT at that stage did not have sufficient 
space.  They had moved to a smaller facility.  So they would 
have needed to get more space to be able to manufacture 
the Platform Hull and then outfitted so that it then becomes a 
facility. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And you were suggesting that 
the difference in price be used to help LMT get up to 
20 
standard.  Was that the difference in price between VR Laser 
at R 260 odd million compared with LMT, about a hundred 
million less than that? 
MR DREVIN:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  And then you just conclude: 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 35 of 310 
 
“Just a thought.”   
 
Now was there any response to that from Mr Govender 
or anybody else in management? 
MR DREVIN:   We discussed it in the corridor and asked the 
question that should the whole process go ahead because at 
that time, the contract was not yet awarded.  It took a long 
time for the contract to be awarded. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR DREVIN:   And what came out of those discussion was 
that we cannot just take them out of the equation without 
10 
then being blacklisted. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Sorry?  Without them being...? 
MR DREVIN:   Blacklisted. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Blacklisted.  I see.  Alright thank you.  
Now I would like to proceed to the next topic that you deal 
with in your affidavit and that deals with a different contract.  
We have already dealt with the Platform Hull contract for the 
vehicles.   
 
Now we are going to move to the single source supplier 
appointment to provide for turret FCM’s and related armour 
20 
steel components.  Now you have referred in your affidavit to 
an instruction you received from Mr Teubes.    
 
It is Reenen Teubes who prepared a motivation.  Mr 
Teubes – how did he fit into the organisation compared with 
you? 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 36 of 310 
 
MR DREVIN:   Mr Teubes was the – if I remember correctly – 
the COO at the time and he was Avishkar Govender’s 
superior.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And mister...  So and he was 
the COO, Chief Operating Officer, correct? 
MR DREVIN:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Of which entity?  Would that be still 
Denel Land Systems, DLS? 
MR DREVIN:   That would be. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Not the corporate head office but DLS 
10 
as the division? 
MR DREVIN:   DLS. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  And what was his instruction to 
you? 
MR DREVIN:   That I should prepare a justification for the 
single source supplier of this limited basket of critical 
components where the interfaces are very critical and 
problematic. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Were these components something in 
addition to what was dealt with in the Platform Hull contract, 
20 
it was separate from that? 
MR DREVIN:   It was separate from that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay thank you.  Now can I take you 
please to page 484? 
MR DREVIN:   [No audible reply]  
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 37 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   484 and following.  Could you please 
tell us what these documents are? 
MR DREVIN:   Page 484, that is my email to Celia with the 
draft of the motivation. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  The text of your email run about 
the middle of the page 484 reads: 
“Hi Celia.  Find attached the motivation for single 
source supplier of Hoefyster Turret Farmer Steel 
Fabrications and Components.” 
 
And you referred to a signed copy being sent and 
10 
delivered.  And so was this what you prepared in response to 
the instruction that you got from Mr Teubes? 
MR DREVIN:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Were you aware of how it came about 
that he gave you that instruction and why it was now being 
considered appropriate that a single source supplier should 
be appointed? 
MR DREVIN:   No, I was unaware of the processes behind 
the screens. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now I need to take you back 
20 
please to your affidavit where you summarised your reasons 
for the motivation.  If I can take you to page 248? 
MR DREVIN:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Paragraph 5.2.  Do you have that? 
MR DREVIN:   Yes. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 38 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You say: 
“I have prepared the motivation, emailed it to 
Ms Celia Malahlela.  Those can be noted from the 
attachment, the justification for the single source 
supplier included the following.” 
 
And then you refer to a number of technical aspects and 
features 
of 
the 
components 
and 
why 
there 
was 
a 
recommendation.  Do you confirm these were your reasons? 
MR DREVIN:   These were my reasons. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright.  And then you say, 5.2.2.  As 
10 
one of the reasons, you referred to certain processes being 
specialised and you recommended that the supplier to be 
chosen should have all of these processes in-house.  Is that 
correct? 
MR DREVIN:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then your further recommendation 
in 5.2.3 was that: 
“The chosen supplier has an in-house machining 
facility or a close relationship with a supplier of 
such services as DOS has in the past experienced 
20 
lengthy delays and result in schedule overruns 
because of the lack thereof.” 
 
Were you referring to a particular supplier or suppliers in 
recording your concern about bad experiences in the past? 
MR DREVIN:   These were the first of the engineering 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 39 of 310 
 
development models where there was a delay from finishing 
the welded structure in having that machine. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Was LMT involved in that? 
MR DREVIN:   LMT was involved in that.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And then you say 5.2.4. 
“It was highly recommended that a supplier be 
chosen with a proven track record of manufacturing 
armour steel structures e.g. hulls, delivering on time 
to the required quality standards.” 
 
Now were the reasons that you were putting forward 
10 
here, 
especially 
the 
last 
two, 
were 
you 
in 
any 
way 
suggesting that LMT should be eliminated and that VR Laser 
should be favoured? 
MR DREVIN:   No, I specifically wrote the motivations so that 
the supplier that as open ended. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Had you been asked by Mr Teubes or 
anybody else to write the motivation in a way that favoured 
one supplier rather than another? 
MR DREVIN:   No, these were my reasons. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now you then deal in 5.3 with 
20 
particular aspects being focussed on only addressing the 
interfacing components and you give the explanation but I 
think we can move rather to 5.4 where you say that: 
“The motivation was limited to the real technical 
risks 
of 
which 
you 
had 
real 
concerns 
about 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 40 of 310 
 
beforehand.” 
 
Just explain to the Chair what your real concerns were?  
Was it the concerns about the capacity and experience and 
track record and so forth that you already dealt with or is 
there... was it a different point? 
MR DREVIN:   The main concern was that these components 
fit together in a proper way.  Being all welded structures, the 
pollens is a big problem ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
MR DREVIN:   ...to maintain between these assembles.  And 
10 
in the past with other types of assembles where this was a 
factor.  If something does not fit then it is always a question 
of who is responsible. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
MR DREVIN:   Which takes quite a time to sort out.  So if 
you have it at one place then that one supplier is responsible 
no matter what. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now you continue then to say 
this: 
“The motivation did not recommend the appointment 
20 
of a specific supplier to attend to the work, more 
specifically, the appointment of VR Laser and with 
written such that to the best of my knowledge did 
not exclude the use of another supplier.” 
 
Why do you mention here that you were avoiding VR 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 41 of 310 
 
supply and rather trying to keep it open for any potential 
supplier?  Had VR Supplier’s name come up in relation to 
the single source project? 
MR DREVIN:   No. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   No.  So why is it that you mention it 
here? 
MR DREVIN:   This was just my motivation behind writing the 
motivation.  It was not.  I specifically wrote it not to specify 
the supplier. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
10 
MR DREVIN:   Because I did not feel comfortable in 
specifying a supplier. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And in fact, you continue: 
“I felt uncomfortable in recommending a specific 
supplier.  I did not have direct first-hand experience 
with such as quality of supply to date of applicable 
suppliers, et cetera.  This was echoed by the then 
Supply Chain Executive, Ms Malahlela who is of the 
opinion that the requirement goes out on tender.” 
 
And did you think that was a good idea going out on 
20 
tender? 
MR DREVIN:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  And then you explain 5.5 how it 
came about that you have identified specific technicalities.  
But we then come in 5.6 to your later learning that the 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 42 of 310 
 
motivation that you had prepared – that is the document that 
we had just been looking at, correct?  
MR DREVIN:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That that became used as a basis to 
conclude a memorandum of agreement between DLS and VR 
Laser Services where it was appointed in May 2015 as a 
single source supply for the provision of all fabricated steel 
services and goods such as fabrication of hulls, turrets, 
FCM’s and fabricated armour steel structures.   
 
Now there are a couple of issues I need to question you 
10 
on that.  You refer to VR Laser Services being appointed on 
the strength of your motivation.  Correct?  That was used 
that your...  Your motivation that you used by others to justify 
the appointment of VR Laser. 
MR DREVIN:   Yes, it was part of the motivation. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You just told the Chair thought that in 
your motivation you specifically did not recommend anybody 
whether VR Laser Services or anybody else.   
MR DREVIN:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you raised some concerns with 
20 
Ms Malahlela that we have already dealt with.  And she then 
as the head of Supply Chain Management within DLS felt 
that it should go out to tender. 
MR DREVIN:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Do you know whether it went out to 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 43 of 310 
 
tender? 
MR DREVIN:   I do not know but I doubt it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You doubt it? 
MR DREVIN:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   She has given evidence in relation to 
that.  The Chair has already heard.  Were you...  How did 
you feel?  Did you feel surprised?  Was this something you 
accepted that VR Laser was appointed, apparently, on the 
strength of your motivation? 
MR DREVIN:   I was especially surprised that the... to the 
10 
extent of the MOU. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   MOA or MOU? 
MR DREVIN:   MOU and/or MOA. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   MO... 
MR DREVIN:   Because I was just focused on just specific 
components. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now if the contract had in fact 
been put out to open tender as Ms Malahlela had suggested 
would be done, would you have been involved in evaluation 
of the tender once they came in, at least, from the technical 
20 
side? 
MR DREVIN:   I do not know. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You do not know? 
MR DREVIN:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It could have involved others. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 44 of 310 
 
MR DREVIN:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now the other point that I would like to 
look at here is, that you refer in this paragraph 5.6 to what 
VR Laser Services was appointed to do as a single source 
supplier.  It would provide all fabricated steel services and 
goods such as the fabrication of hulls, turrets, FCM’s.  Just 
remind us what FCM mean? 
MR DREVIN:   The FCM is the Fighting Compartment Module 
but it is a term that also refers to sometimes what we call the 
turret hull and I think you would have run across another 
10 
term, Trunnion(?) machining.  That is basically the same 
component.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Trunnion machine? 
MR DREVIN:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Thank you.  And then the other 
example that you give is fabricated armour steel structures.  
Now was this the same scope of different components that 
was the subject of your motivation, the written motivation 
that we looked at earlier? 
MR DREVIN:   In terms of armour steel components, yes. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Did i...  Was it exactly the same as the 
range of components or products that you dealt with in your 
motivation?  Was it less than or more than? 
MR DREVIN:   It was more than. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   More than? 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 45 of 310 
 
MR DREVIN:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So you saying then...  Are you saying 
that VR Laser Services was given the contract for single 
source supply of components that went further than the 
components that you had looked at in your motivation? 
MR DREVIN:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  Do you know how that came 
about? 
MR DREVIN:   Well, unfortunately, I listened to the testimony 
of Celia ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR 
DREVIN: 
 
 
...on 
Monday. 
 
So, 
then 
I 
became 
...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You became aware of her evidence? 
MR DREVIN:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  But you do not have your own 
knowledge as to what others may have done, why they used 
your motivation to dealt with products, A, B and C that then 
was used as a basis to award VR Laser, a contract for sole 
supplier of A, B, C, D, E and F as well? 
20 
MR DREVIN:   No, not before Monday.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Not before Monday.  Thank you.  And 
were you ever consulted by Mr Teubes or anybody else to 
say:  Mr Drevin, I want you to analyse and motivate by way 
of an additional motivation document for the additional 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 46 of 310 
 
products? 
MR DREVIN:   No. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Did they ever come back to you? 
MR DREVIN:   No, I was not.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Are you aware whether they asked 
anybody else to do that? 
MR DREVIN:   I am not aware of anybody else ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Do you believe that...  I am sorry? 
MR DREVIN:   I am not aware of anybody else being asked. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Being asked.  Would there have been 
10 
anybody else who could potentially be asked or were you the 
only man in the or the only person in the organisation who 
would have been appropriate to ask? 
MR DREVIN:   There is a slight possibility that the 
programme manager on the other programme AV8 could have 
contribute. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  But you would have expected 
because you have done the motivation for the first lot of 
products, that you would have been approached to deal with 
the second or the further products as well, the additional 
20 
items? 
MR DREVIN:   Yes, I would have. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  Now thank you.  Still on your 
affidavit.  Page 250, paragraph 6.  Sorry, before.  I should 
have just asked this final question on the last topic Chair.  If 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 47 of 310 
 
I may just go back to that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Are you able to tell the Commission to 
what extent the additional items made a difference?  In other 
words, was it just a couple of very minor items in addition to 
those items that you have dealt with in your written 
motivation or was it a substantial, a major or a minor add-on, 
as it were, to the original items you dealt with? 
MR DREVIN:   The value of the separate components was 
minor. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Was minor. 
MR DREVIN:   But the whole basket would have added up to 
quite a bit.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Quite a lot.   
MR DREVIN:   Ja, 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Thank you.  Now we come to 
the value of the orders placed on the VR Laser from 2014 to 
date under the Hoefyster contract.  Now which contract are 
you referring to, the Single Source Supplier contract or the 
earlier one for the Platform Hulls? 
20 
MR DREVIN:   Under the breakdown of the orders that VR 
Laser received before the... our contract was placed, the 
Platform Hull contract and then in the interim from the 
Platform Hull contract up to the MOU and then after the 
MOU. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 48 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So it says in fact the entire range, is 
it? 
MR DREVIN:   It is for the entire range. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Thank you.  May I ask you 
please to turn to page 538? 
MR DREVIN:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Again, Chair.  I am afraid, for those of 
us with eyesight problems, the printing is a bit small.  I think 
one can make it out.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It is not ideal.  If you like us to replace 
these pages with enlarged copies? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, enlarged.   
MR DREVIN:   Okay I found it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   We do not need to go in the detail of 
this but these are pages that go on for many, many pages in 
the bundle.  It runs from 538 to 599 and there are tables that 
have in pretty small print various columns, amounts, items 
and so forth.  Can you just tell us in broad outline Mr Drevin 
what is this document? 
20 
MR DREVIN:   This is a financial report from the VL System. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And what does it tell us?  What is the 
purpose of the report? 
MR DREVIN:   This was the report from which I extracted the 
information.   
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 49 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And what information were you able to 
extract? 
MR DREVIN:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   What does it tell us?  Was this for 
purposes of responding to a request from the Commission to 
give a value as to the business that was given to VR Laser 
Services in relation to these contracts from 2014 to date? 
MR DREVIN:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And are you able to tell us what 
the total is?  It appears, if I am right, to be set out at page 
10 
598.    
MR DREVIN:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   For that particular schedule there.  
There are separate schedules that set out the various prices 
but can you just give us the totals on page 598? 
MR DREVIN:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Are you able to see that? 
MR DREVIN:   Not clearly. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   No, I am afraid it is difficult for me.  
And you have not spelt out in your affidavit what the total is.  
20 
But Chair, may I give you the reference that we will provide a 
legible copy of that.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   As soon as possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 50 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  May I just have a moment? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   My learned colleague, Ms Molefe, has 
drawn to my attention a point in the papers that relates to 
the question that was posed by the Chair earlier about 
experience. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   May I take you please Mr Drevin to 
page 392? 
MR DREVIN:   [No audible reply]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Mr Drevin, are you there? 
MR DREVIN:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   In fact, this appears to be the 
questionnaire relating to questions raised with LMT.  Am I 
right? 
MR DREVIN:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  And if I may direct your 
attention to paragraph 4?  It is 9.1.   
“Taking LMT track record into consideration, what 
20 
has LMT done to improve?” 
 
And then the response is.   
“The Patria data pack is fixed and will not have any 
reason to cause delay as for the previous DLS 
contracts.” 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 51 of 310 
 
 
Did you receive that response from them as recorded or 
summarised in that column? 
MR DREVIN:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And what does this relate to?  Just 
explain, please?  What did you understand this to be? 
MR DREVIN:   With previous order that was placed on LMT 
and I take this to be the AV8 turret hull order.  There were 
changes from Denel’s side as well as reasons from LMT side 
why the project overran its schedule. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Were you satisfied with that 
10 
answer? 
MR DREVIN:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Did you believe that they gave a 
proper explanation that reassured you, that explains the 
previous... that the previous problems already expense 
would not recur would not happen again if they were to get 
the new business? 
MR DREVIN:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And of course, we have already seen 
...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Was that answer no or was it 
yes? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes said yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that correct Mr Drevin?  You said 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 52 of 310 
 
yes? 
MR DREVIN:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And I took you earlier to your 
email where you commented about the allegations that have 
been made in the media article.   
 
You remember your email to Mr Govender and you had 
then suggested that LMT should in fact be awarded that 
contract because although they had previous issues. 
 
And they now had moved to smaller premises, you could 
perhaps do a deal with LMT where, at least, using the 
10 
difference in price between VR Laser and LMT that that 
could perhaps be used.   
 
You could perhaps increase their price to allow them to 
expand their operations, et cetera. 
MR DREVIN:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  Thank you.  Chair, those are the 
questions from the team for this witness.  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  Just to complete the issue 
that we talked about earlier Mr Drevin.  Am I right to say, on 
the one hand there were three factors which was supposed 
20 
to be scored, price, functionality, BBBEE?  But the questions 
that were asked seemed to have gone much wider than those 
factors.  And it seems to me that if you got a certain answer 
on a question that did not relate to price or functionality or 
BBBEE, whether you were satisfied or not satisfied with it.  
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 53 of 310 
 
In the end, it would not count for any points that you would 
allocate because you are only allowed to allocate points for 
the three, namely price, functionality and BBBEE.  And in 
your case, your concern was functionality and nothing else.  
Is my understanding right? 
MR DREVIN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you.  Thank you very much 
Mr Drevin for coming to assist the Commission.  We 
appreciate it very much.  If we need you, we will ask you to 
come back again.  Okay.   
10 
MR DREVIN:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Would this be a convenient time to 
take a short adjournment if that... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, we will take the tea adjournment.  It 
might not be as short as it usually is.  It might be extended a 
little bit because there is something I need to attend to. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   As it pleases Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So we might be 25-minutes or so. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if I get ready before that, you will be 
told.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 54 of 310 
 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have taken much longer than I thought 
I would but are you ready, Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, we are ready, thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Chair, I know that you have issues 
later in the day as you have indicated previously, other 
commitments.  May we just indicate we will be as quick as 
we can and we are still optimistic we can finish by five. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, well I can tell you that I think if 
10 
need be we can over five, maybe half past five. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  This witness will 
take some time but I hope not too long. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then the next witness should 
actually be fairly quick. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So with your leave, Chair, may we 
then ask leave to call our next witness, Mr Hendrik 
Johannes Christoffel van den Heever? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, thank you.  Please administer the 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 55 of 310 
 
oath/affirmation.  Just place on the record that the 
interpreter has been sworn in. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
HENDRIK JOHANNES CHRISTOFFEL VAN DEN HEEVER:  
Hendrik Johannes Christoffel van den Heever. (through 
interpreter) 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
10 
your conscience? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, we will have to start afresh.  
Mr van den Heever, do you need the oath to be interpreted 
or you can understand English sufficiently? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   I can... 
CHAIRPERSON:   In terms of the oath because it is very 
important, we cannot take a chance that later on you might 
say you did not understand parts of the oath. 
MNR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Ek verstaan, ja. 
20 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Hendrik Johannes Christoffel van 
den Heever.  
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 56 of 310 
 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give  
will be the truth the whole truth and nothing else but the 
truth.  If so, please raise your right hand and say so help 
me God. 
HENDRIK JOHANNES CHRISTOFFEL VAN DEN HEEVER:  
So help me God. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much.  Mr Kennedy, do 
you want to just place on record what is going to happen 
about the interpreter and so on? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, may we do so?   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  May I then place 
on record that we had a consultation with Mr van den 
Heever a week or so ago.  It was conducted in English, 
virtually over Zoom or Teams and we are aware that Mr van 
den Heever does not have English as his first language, 
20 
Afrikaans is his first language and we are aware that 
sometimes he has to be a bit careful with understanding 
the English but overall he has, if I may say so, Mr van den 
Heever, a pretty good workable command of English and 
you were helpful to us and we appreciate that.  At one 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 57 of 310 
 
stage, Chair, it was indicated to us that Mr van den Heever 
would prefer an interpreter to be present to interpret and 
we engaged in discussions with his legal team, particularly 
Mr Pillay of the attorneys firm who represents Mr van den 
Heever, who are actually present, Mr Pillay and Ms 
Wilsnagh, and we reached an agreement, as I understand 
it, that the interpreter will be here not to interpret every 
word of every question or every word of every answer but 
the interpreter can be used if Mr van den Heever does not 
understand anything in particular that is put to him in 
10 
English.  He will also, as far as he is able to, answer the 
questions in English but if he struggles he will call on the 
interpreter and so that is what we have arranged with Mr 
van den Heever with his attorneys’ assistance.  And may I 
just place on record our appreciation to the attorneys who 
have played a professional role in this and in all other 
regards.  Thank you, Chair.  It that is acceptable to you we 
would like to proceed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine with me, maybe his legal 
representatives should place themselves on record and 
20 
then confirm that arrangement?  Ja, you can do so from 
where you are, if you just switch on the mic. 
MR PILLAY:  Good morning, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning. 
MR PILLAY:  I confirm what Adv Kennedy has conveyed to 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 58 of 310 
 
you this morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, thank you. 
MR PILLAY:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you represent Mr van den Heever. 
MR PILLAY:  Mr van den Heever, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, thank you. 
MR PILLAY:  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair, and we appreciate 
…[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And, Mr van den Heever, you confirm as 
well that you understand the arrangement? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Hundred percent, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you.  If you struggle, you 
have a problem, just say so and the interpreter is 
available, will assist, but if you are able to understand and 
you are able to answer in English it is fine. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Thank you, I will do so, Chair.  
Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Thank you, Mr Kennedy. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  May I add 
something to the Chair ’s points to you now, Mr van den 
Heever?  I will try to be careful and clear in everything that 
I put to you but if you do not understand anything either 
because you did not hear or your mind was racing ahead 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 59 of 310 
 
with something else or you did not understand the English, 
please just immediately say can you repeat it, can you 
explain it and I will then try and explain it and if that is not 
possible then Ms Oosthuizen, the interpreter is here to 
assist.  So please take comfort from both reassurances.  
Okay?  Thank you. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Thank you. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Mr van den Heever, do you confirm 
you did in fact consult with the legal team that I am part of 
with my learned colleagues behind a week or a couple of 
10 
weeks ago? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And is it correct that we consulted 
with you in respect of two affidavits that you have helpfully 
provided to the Commission? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And that was after you were asked 
questions by the investigator ’s team of this Commission. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Before you you should have a 
20 
file.  Yes, I see you do.  And your two affidavits appear in 
the file but I am going to ask you to confirm that in a 
moment.  Can you please – Chair, may I just place on 
record we are now referring again to Denel bundle 04. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 60 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And here we are going to deal with 
EXHIBIT W14 and W14, Chair, we will take the witness to 
this in a moment, includes two affidavits.  The one appears 
- Mr van den Heever, will you just follow with me on this 
sheet, just look on the top left hand side, there are 
numbers, I am going to just refer to the last digit. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Number 5, page 5, that is your one 
affidavit, is that correct? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That is in divider A and then if you 
turn to page 83 you will find your other affidavit, is that 
correct? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now may I take you in the first 
affidavit to where you signed it and if I can take you please 
to page 23? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Yes, I am there. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that your signature at the foot of 
the page? 
20 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is my signature, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You signed it in front of a 
Commissioner of Oaths, we see that on page 24.  Do you 
confirm that? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 61 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now before we ask you to confirm 
that the affidavit that we have just looked at is correct, 
may I just ask you, is it correct that during the consultation 
you alerted us to   I am sorry, may I just have a moment?  
Is it correct that you in the consultation that we recently 
had you alerted us to some errors that you have picked up 
that you wanted to place on record? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Sorry, M’Lord, may I just – 
Chair, may I just have a moment?  Yes, it is at page 14, do 
10 
you have that? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   I have got it, ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Paragraph 24. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Just to get our thoughts on this, you 
say: 
“I submit it was obvious during this time that DLS 
was in negotiations with LMT on providing financial 
assistance to LMT.  I say so because in some of the 
email trails appeared discussions pertaining to the 
20 
financial 
challenges 
they 
sought 
to 
eliminate 
through the prepayment.  It was apparent that DLS 
was to provide the financial assistance through a 
prepayment that I had to structure under the 
trunnion machining contract.”

Page 62 of 310 
 
Now do you recall you raised a problem with this and you 
asked us to note a correction?  Do you remember what the 
correction was that you asked us to do? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Just tell the Chair please? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   I would like to change that to 
state that the prepayment had to be structured and not I 
had to structure it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   So you want to delete the word 
10 
“I” and you want to insert the word “be” before structure 
and you want to amend the word “structure” to read 
“structured.”   So this line will read: 
“Payment that had to be structured under the 
trunnion machining contract.” 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then, Mr Kennedy, just a small 
supplementary affidavit can we done to say – to effect the 
corrections because …[intervenes] 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   We can do that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because one cannot amend an affidavit. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   We will attend to that. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 63 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  Mr van den Heever, I do 
not recall that in this affidavit – I am not talking about the 
other affidavit.  As I do not recall any other corrections 
that you felt needed to be made are you able to tell the 
Chair is there anything else in this affidavit you feel the 
need to raise for correction? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Currently not, thank you.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Do you confirm that you have gone 
through this affidavit?  You know what is in it and you 
10 
confirm that it sets out the facts as you know them. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  Chair, we will then ask 
for this affidavit formally to be admitted.  We will deal with 
the other affidavit in a moment but may we ask then for the 
formal admission of this affidavit?  It is in bundle Denel 04, 
EXHIBIT W14 from page 5. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We will have to have a different exhibit 
number of the other one so we must consider whether we 
should make this one EXHIBIT W14.1 or W14 and the other 
20 
one W15. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, W15 has already been allocated 
by those responsible. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So we should make this one 14.1, the 
other one 14.2. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 64 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   As you please, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The statement/affidavit by Mr Hendrik 
Johannes Christoffel van der Heever starting at page 5 is 
admitted and will be marked as EXHIBIT W14.1. 
STATEMENT/AFFIDAVIT 
OF 
MR 
VAN 
DEN 
HEEVER 
STARTING FROM PAGE 5 HANDED IN AS EXHIBIT 14.1 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Now, Mr van den 
Heever, the other affidavit should be found at the marker 
10 
B.  If your file has a marker B and you will find it at page 
83. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   I have got it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Am I right in understanding 
this is the second affidavit, the front page bearing your 
name? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And turn please to page 113.   
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   I am there. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that your signature again at the 
20 
top of the page? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And again you signed in front of 
Commissioner of Oaths? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 65 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And is it correct that you have raised 
both in our consultation and since a few issues that you 
want to correct? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   If I can ask you please to turn to 
page 101?  Is it correct that you alerted me to an error that 
you had picked up in paragraph 55.5? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   55, just to give the context, is you 
gave a list here in your affidavit of the people who formed 
10 
the BEC, the bid evaluation committee, correct? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you alerted us, as the legal 
team, to an error in paragraph 55.5. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is it Mr or Ms Khoza? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   It is Mr Khoza. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And what was the error? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   It states that he was from 
infantry systems department but he is actually from finance 
20 
department. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, thank you.  And then on the 
following page, 102, is it correct that you alerted us to a 
spelling error in 55.8?  It should read Mr Rakadukwe.  With 
a k before the w.  His name appears in other documents. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 66 of 310 
 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   I am not sure if it is Rakadukwe 
or Rakaduwe.  I think it is Rakaduwe, I am not… 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay, thank you.  And then if I can 
ask you to turn to page 111. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   In paragraph 93 you say the 
following: 
“Attached 
hereto 
as 
annexure 
HVD036 
is 
a 
spreadsheet containing the list of purchase orders 
that 
I, 
as 
a 
buyer 
within 
the 
supply 
chain 
10 
department of DLS had issued in favour of VR Laser 
from the years 2009 until 2018.  Total value of 
orders placed on VR Laser for this period was 
R345 849 877.82.” 
That is what your affidavit says. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is it correct that we, as the legal 
team, have been alerted by your – through the kind 
assistance of your attorneys to the fact that you wanted to 
correct that by way of a supplementary affidavit? 
20 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Ja, I was requested to amend the 
spreadsheet to indicate the value up to the end of March. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   March of which year? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   2014. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   2014? 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 67 of 310 
 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So in fact that came at the request 
from who? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   I think was Carole, if I am not 
mistaken. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, by members of the legal team.  
Thank you.  And is it correct that you have provided a 
supplementary statement. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   I have, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And we are going to deal with that a 
10 
little later, if we may, Chair.  That is not currently before 
you in the file. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That only came to us this morning 
and it has not taken a form of a commissioned affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   There were some problems in that 
regard. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I have to burden you with other 
20 
problems that have burdened us, Chair, but we hope we 
can deal with them.  May we just indicate …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, we shall share the burden. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, we shall share the burden. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 68 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Unfortunately, it 
emerged only yesterday from the bundle that has been 
provided and handed to you, Chair, that some of the 
annexures in the photocopying process or the packaging of 
these bundles, for some reason, we are not sure, there was 
a slip up …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   They were left out or something. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And they did not find their way into 
the bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Chair, there are two ways that we 
proposed dealing with it.  We do not believe that it should 
pertain us in asking questions of this witness because only 
certain annexures are going to be referred to in the 
questions at least as I am anticipating and the annexures 
that I would have liked to have taken to Mr van den Heever 
to comment on happened to be annexures to the affidavit 
of Mr Drevin, the witness who you just heard who deals 
with some issues that overlap with that of Mr van den 
Heever.  Those happily are to be found in the same file.  
20 
So with your leave may we then refer to those pages? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, that is fine. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Where it is relevant. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:    But the second solution that we 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 69 of 310 
 
propose is this, that a complete copy of the affidavit as 
provided by Mr van den Heever with all of the correct 
annexures will be provided by the secretariat.  In fact I 
believe that they are dealing with that now but we do not 
want to detain your further in this regard. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So we apologise on behalf of our 
team and the secretariat. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But, with your leave, may we 
10 
continue on that rather complicated basis? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is fine, let us continue on that 
basis. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you very much.  I would like – 
so I think I just need to ask you, Chair, I do believe I have 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do I need this affidavit? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes if you would accept the second 
of Mr van den Heever’s affidavit from page 83 of bundle 
Denel 04 which should be admitted, we would suggest, as 
20 
EXHIBIT W14.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Point 2, ja.  The statement/affidavit of 
Mr Hendrik Johannes Christoffel van der Heever starting at 
page 83 is admitted and will be marked as EXHIBIT W14.2. 
STATEMENT/AFFIDAVIT 
OF 
MR 
VAN 
DEN 
HEEVER 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 70 of 310 
 
STARTING FROM PAGE 83 HANDED IN AS EXHIBIT 14.2 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  And then I have 
mentioned the supplementary statement that is not in the 
form of an affidavit, we are going to deal with its contents 
a little later, if we may, and then ask for at least the 
statement to be handed in provisionally to you but we will 
do that at that stage.  I am told by our learned friends who 
appear for Mr van den Heever that apparently there was 
some 
logistical 
problems 
but 
they 
have 
given 
an 
undertaking that they will ensure that that is transformed 
10 
into a commissioned affidavit as soon as possible and that 
will then be introduced into your own bundle, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But we do not believe that – if we 
should have a difficulty subject to your decision in taking 
him through what is currently an unattested statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, that is …[intervenes] 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It can then be confirmed in due 
course. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that will be fine after all he will be 
20 
testifying under oath. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But just for convenience it would be 
good to have that commissioned. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair, that will be done. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 71 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And may we propose that that, when 
that is included in the bundle, should – in an attested form, 
would included as EXHIBIT 14.3? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, it will be admitted as 14.3. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Actually, EXHIBIT W14.3. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright.  Now, Chair, with your leave 
10 
may we then ask questions of this witness, first with his 
second statement that appears in the bundle?  It just 
seems to flow nicely from some of the earlier evidence that 
you have heard. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, that is fine. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  Mr van den Heever, may 
we take you first to your affidavit?  It starts at page 83. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   I am there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe I should say, Mr Govender – I am 
sorry, I am terribly sorry, Mr Kennedy, it is quarter to one 
20 
now.  Maybe we can proceed up to quarter past one. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So we have about 30 minutes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before we take the lunch break. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 72 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That would help, thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright, thank you. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright, Mr van den Heever, this 
affidavit deals mainly with the platform hulls contract which 
was given to VR Laser, is that right? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  Now your current employer is 
Denel, the division DLS, is that right? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   When did you start at Denel? 
10 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   January 1982. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Before it was even called Denel.  
What was it called then? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER: It was called Lyttelton Engineering 
Works at that stage.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And what was your job title 
when you started in 1982? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   I started as an artisan – ag, 
firstly as an appie trainer and then as artisan and worked 
my way up. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And then you moved up the 
ranks in Denel, is that right? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You refer in paragraph 5, page 84, to 
working in the planning office at one stage? 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 73 of 310 
 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then you moved to the supply 
chain management department as a buyer where you had 
22 years experience as a buyer. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Or a senior buyer and then other 
titles, commodities specialist and procurement officer.  
What is your current title? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   I am currently with production 
planning, I have moved on back to production planning 
10 
again. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright, so you left supply chain 
management after 22 years and now you are in production. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  Now you referred to your 
training on page 85, is that correct? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Correct, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Paragraph 7 and then you set out in 
paragraph 8 your duties in supply chain. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Because your affidavit is dealing with 
issues relating to the Hoefyster contract for platform hulls 
given to VR Laser at the time that you were in supply 
chain. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 74 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that right?  Thank you.  Now may I 
take you to page 86?  After setting out the purpose of this 
statement which was to respond to specific issues raised 
by the Commission’s investigators, you then set out in 
paragraph 10 the standard procurement procedure at DLS 
at the time, is that right? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And were you in fact running the 
process from the day-to-day point of view for procurement 
in relation to the contract that we have just mentioned? 
10 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Can you just explain that to me? 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
 
What 
was 
your 
involvement 
particularly in the supply chain management department 
dealing with the Hoefyster project? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   I was just responsible for placing 
the 
order 
according 
to 
the 
procedures, 
prescribed 
procedures and stuff. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And did that include the Hoefyster 
contract that was awarded to VR Laser for platform hulls? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright.  Now if we can turn to page 
89, your paragraph 12 deals with the delegation of 
authority and this was a delegation of authority applicable 
you say in paragraph 12 at DLS after 27 November 2012. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 75 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright.  And it gives the range of 
different prices that the value of particular contracts within 
specific ranges.  There were have to be specific levels of 
authority and 12.5 you say: 
“All purchase orders above R5 million threshold 
required 
approval 
by 
the 
Exco 
procurement 
committee.” 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now we have heard evidence 
that DLS was a division along with other within Denel 
10 
Group, correct? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And is it correct that Denel Group 
had its own procurement policy? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Ja, but I think ours was derived 
from it, I am no hundred percent sure. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, yes.  In fact we have heard 
evidence that it was based on that and that the Denel 
Group Policy imposed a requirement that above a certain 
value contracts had to be approved by certain levels and 
20 
are you aware that the Denel Group policy required that a 
contract over the value of 200 million would require 
approval by the Denel Corporate Board? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   It became known to me. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  So what you are referring to 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 76 of 310 
 
in 12.5 is simply that within the division a contract for a 
purchase order for more than R5 million would require 
Exco procurement committee’s approval. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But you became aware that in 
addition to that the board would also have to approve a 
contract above 200 million. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Okay, in the next section of 
your affidavit and with your leave, Chair, I am going to go 
10 
through it very selectively. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So we do not waste time because 
you have a fair bit of evidence about the background. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I have heard a lot of evidence. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  You refer to Armscor 
awarding DLS a contract for the 217 hulls, correct? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then you explain the process the 
rest of the page and then you refer at the top of your next 
20 
page 91 in paragraph 17 to a situation in 2011 when DLS 
sought to contract a supplier to manufacture and deliver 
the platform hulls, the platform hulls contract.  So this was 
one element of what needed to be provided by Denel to 
Armscor, is that right? 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 77 of 310 
 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.   Now you then refer to LMT 
and LMT had - a majority shareholding was bought by DLS 
in LMT at a certain stage.  What was your understanding 
as to what LMT - which would participate in work such as 
this in general, before we get to the specific contract.  LMT 
was now a majority owned and controlled by Denel, 
correct? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Ja, I think it was still in process 
at that stage, it was not – I am not sure if they were 
10 
already part of this. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay, was there any need from what 
you understood to give LMT this work for the 2017 Platform 
Hulls? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   The fact that he is part of Denel I 
felt that the money is kept in Denel if it was given to them. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   But the going out on the three 
quotations that we did as we will see later on changed the 
route of what was happening.  
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay we will get to why that route 
was followed and where it led you to.  You refer in this 
paragraph to this you say: 
“LMT had been acquired to make it a more complete 
manufacture of an armoured vehicle.  However due 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 78 of 310 
 
to various factors such as concerns was the quality 
of services rendered by LMT, DLS management 
decided to do something.” 
We will deal with what they decided in a moment.  Were 
you aware that there were concerns about quality on the 
part of LMT?  
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   I was aware of issues, yes.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Am I right in understanding that you 
are not a technical person in the sense of for example 
being an engineer who would know the ins and outs of 
10 
quality issues? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   No, I disagree.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I beg your pardon, tell us? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   I am a trained artisan so quality 
and the fact that I have been with Supply Chain for 22 
years going out – and I was responsible for half of that 
time for the quality myself I knew what the standard was 
for the quality that we required.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, thank you for correcting me.  
So you in fact did have knowledge in this.  So the quality 
20 
issues that were raised about LMT were those that you 
personally had identified or did other people in other 
departments raise that with you?  
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   No the quality department did 
raise it but I also had the “ondervinding”. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 79 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Experience.  
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   The experience that is correct, 
ja.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright thank you and then we now 
get to what DLS management decided.  You say here: 
“That they decided that a normal procurement 
process 
be 
followed 
to 
secure 
a 
supplier 
nevertheless LMT was still considered a potential 
supplier even though it did not enjoy any preference 
by DLS.” 
10 
Now as I understand your evidence and correct me if I am 
wrong what you’re saying here is that it might have been a 
good idea to get the work done by LMT but there were 
some concerns about quality.  It would have been a good 
idea because it was within the Denel stable or group, 
correct? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You would have kept the money 
within the group, was the point you made earlier but 
instead of doing that it was decided no let us go out on an 
20 
open 
procurement 
process 
because 
we 
have 
some 
concerns about LMT’s quality. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But LMT would still be in the race, it 
would still be a horse in the race it could tender if it 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 80 of 310 
 
wished to do so. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now you then set out in 
paragraph 19 and 20 variance of the particular combat 
vehicle, correct? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Then you deal specifically at page 
92, just remember the page numbers is top left from 
paragraph 21 was the process that was followed by the 
procurement of the Hoefyster Platform Hulls supplier.  Now 
10 
you referred to a three quotation basis and you mentioned 
a moment ago to the Chair three quotations were in fact 
received.  This was not an openly advertised public tender 
where everybody out in the marketplace could tender.  Is 
that right?   
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Ja, we have been working on 
three quotes all our lives, tenders only started coming in 
since I think 2014/2015 they started talking about tender 
processes.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
20 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   But we have been using three 
quotes system basically my whole 20/22 years that I was 
there. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right and this was around 2011 that 
this started you say in paragraph 22 for the Hoefyster 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 81 of 310 
 
Platform Hulls.  
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, ja.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, now you mentioned a 
budgeted price per hull of being R950 000,00 per hull 
exclusive of VAT and the total budget would then have 
been in the region of R206million.    
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now then you refer to the fact that 
there was no previous supplier or last purchase price 
information.  Why was that? 
10 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is well basically because we 
have not bought any hulls on previously and only after stuff 
has been bought then you start get the system use to on 
the system which give you a last purchases prices and all 
that kind of information.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, and then you explain why – 
how you went about choosing who to send the request for 
proposals to, just explain to the Chair briefly what that 
involve? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Ja, basically we had a supplier 
20 
database and with the experience and backing that I had 
plus my colleagues could determine which supplier is 
currently in the database has got the ability and capability 
to manufacture these heavy structured hulls and working 
through that and getting the inputs it was decided on four 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 82 of 310 
 
suppliers which was then LMT, VR laser, BA Systems and 
DCD-Dorbyl. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Those are the entities you refer to in 
paragraph 27? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay, and then you deal with their 
background how they had been dealing with DLS or 
Mechem, is Mechem or Mechen? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Mechem. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Mechem, what is Mechem? 
10 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   They were doing landmine lifting 
and clearing, the landmine clearing department and dog 
training. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, now may we turn to page 94 
paragraph 30.  You referred to an RFO, a request for office 
specifically for the hull manufacturing on the Hoefyster 
Project or contract.  Did you then send out the RFO?   
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   I did. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Was that your personal action to 
send it out? 
20 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   No, I got an email from Mr Riaan 
Badenhorst with the attached RFO that I was supposed to 
send to the three suppliers. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And did you in fact send it to them? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   I did, yes. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 83 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Was it to the four suppliers that have 
been mentioned or to three?  
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Only to three as BA Land 
Systems at that stage was sort of competition for part two 
and they requested us not to give them their IP.  So they 
were removed from the list. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, so it was sent to LMT, VR 
Laser and DCD, am I right? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then you refer to their responses 
10 
that each of those entities sent in a response in response 
to the RFO, is that right?    
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you give the dates in paragraph 
32 to 35 and you attach them as annexures and we 
apologise to you for some of the annexures being missing 
from the file in front of you due to the slip up in a 
photocopying process but that will be fixed but we thank 
you for providing all of those documents so they will be 
provided as you have heard in due course to the Chair in 
20 
the way that we have discussed it.    
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now can we deal on page of 95 with 
a visit by Patria to the suppliers just briefly what is this 
relating?   
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 84 of 310 
 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Okay that as far as my knowledge 
on that is that Patria came to visit – the identified 
suppliers in South Africa that DLS has identified and to 
give us there input due to their background and the fact 
that they have manufactured so many of them already of 
who will be according to them will be the best supplier and 
with the best capabilities…[intervene] 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   To manufacture the hull.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now on page 96 the next heading is 
10 
updated request for office.  Now you referred to an email 
from Ms Malahlela who was the Head of Supply Chain at 
DLS, is that correct? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Did you report to her? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   I had a line manager between me 
and her. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And who was the line manager? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   At that stage 2014 I think it was 
either Mr Dupree or Cindy Minnaar I am not sure which of 
20 
the two. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   But there were a line manager 
between me and Celia. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then there is reference to a 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 85 of 310 
 
request made to LMT to update their proposal.  Did you 
attend to that request made to LMT?   
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Just explain by attending to it? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Well let me get straight to the letter.  
Chair this is an example of where the annexure that Mr Van 
Den Heever helpfully attached to his affidavit has not come 
in the photocopy but fortunately we have another copy of 
the same letter elsewhere in the same bundle.  So Mr Van 
Den Heever if I can take you to page 253 in attached to Mr 
Drevin’s affidavit.  We do not need to look at his affidavit, 
10 
if I can just ask you to look at page 253 to five.  So Chair 
again this is just for the record it is in Bundle Denel 04 on 
page 253.  
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Yes, that is correct.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   This is a letter that bears your name 
on page 255 as the procurement officer DLS Mechem, is 
that right?  
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct that is actually the 
RFQ but, ja.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that the RFQ itself? 
20 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am sorry I had the wrong page 
number given, so is that the actual RFQ the request for 
updated proposals.  
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct.   
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 86 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay, thank you.  It appears my note 
was wrong it is apparently 252 is the one that I should 
have drawn your attention to.    
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Ja, now this 252 is the letter from 
Celia. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, thank you so this was the 
request for an update of LMT’s proposal. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now why were they being requested 
to update? 
10 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Because the previous quote that 
we received was I think in 2012 and then in 2014 the 
request came through to update their quotations. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   So after two years you would 
expect a change in price so that is why we request the 
update. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then in the letter the ticks to the 
letter you say: 
“Denel Land Systems, DLS, hereby request LMT to 
20 
submit an urgent update of your proposal number 
received on.” 
And here is the answers to your point earlier about when it 
was received 2012 that is confirmed, 9 t h of February 2012.  
“We do however require you to amend the quotation 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 87 of 310 
 
as follows when updating armour hull breakdown a 
price for armour hull excluding mine protection. B, 
price for mine protection only and C, prices should 
exclude all jigs and fixtures CFI which will be 
contracted separately.” 
And then you refer to a tender representative visiting 
Patria in Finland etcetera.  So as I understand it when they 
were updating their proposals they were expected to break 
it down into various elements, is that right?    
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes.   
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay thank you.  Now this letter was 
sent to LMT was there similar letters sent requesting an 
update to the other two that you had received proposals 
from that is VR Laser and DCD?   
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, and did they in fact respond 
all these three potential suppliers? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Yes, they did just one thing is we 
first sent the updated request to LMT and then a week later 
we got confirmation from Patria of which we were waiting 
20 
for to say that we can continue with the rest of the 
suppliers in South Africa that we have identified and we 
received those letters, that letter on the 6 t h of I think it was 
June 2014 and then we sent exactly the same RFQ’s to all 
three of the suppliers and informing LMT that there 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 88 of 310 
 
response date is also extended to the same as the other 
two suppliers.     
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, and the Patria point is 
mentioned in your affidavit paragraph 45 page 96, is that 
correct? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Top left paragraph 45.   
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, ja.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now why did Patria have to give you 
the go ahead for parties other than LMT?   
10 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That was like where we identified 
the four suppliers and where they came back and they said 
sorry if OMC is not acceptable or if BA Land Systems is not 
an acceptable supplier.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   And we just had to confirm with 
them that this is now the three suppliers that we going to 
and get confirmation from them that we can go to them.  So 
we got the letter back from them that said that they happy 
with the suppliers.  
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   The Commission has already heard 
evidence that Patria was the original manufacture of this 
type of equipment.  
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That had some intellectual property, 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 89 of 310 
 
they had patent rights.  
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And is that why they were saying we 
are not happy if you do business with BAE because then 
they could get our intellectual property and you had to 
check with them that the rest of the list was acceptable.    
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Have they already approved LMT? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Ja, because LMT was part of 
10 
Denel they had no problem with them.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, now if we can turn to the next 
page 
97 
paragraph 
50 
you 
referred 
to 
the 
revised 
proposals or their responses that you received is that in 
response to the request for an update?  
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay and that you set them out in 
paragraph 50.1 to 50.3.   
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You have referred to the relevant 
20 
attachments.  Then you deal with paragraph, in paragraph 
51 with the pricing that you received in terms of these 
updated responses, is that correct?      
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then just to get to the sort of 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 90 of 310 
 
bottom line or the points that you have highlighted in bold 
print in LMT 51.1.3 there total price that LMT quoted was 
R159million plus a few thousand.  
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, and the VR Laser their bottom 
line the total price 51.2.2 was R262million and some 
thousands.  
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct.   
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
 
So 
they 
were 
more 
than 
a 
R100million more expensive than LMT, correct? 
10 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And DCD you have set out a 
schedule and their total price for the contract we see at the 
top of page 101 was R301million and some thousands.   
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes.    
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So it ranges from the cheapest was 
LMT R159million, VRL R262million and DCD R301million.   
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, then you refer on page 101 to 
the bid evaluation committee which was also known as the 
20 
cross-functional team and is it correct that Ms Malahlela as 
the 
Head 
of 
the 
DLS 
Supply 
Chain 
Management 
Department 
organised 
for 
a 
BEC 
a, 
bid 
evaluation 
committee or cross-functional team to be appointed?  
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes.   
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 91 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you were one of those members.  
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And those members are set out in 
paragraph 55.1 to 55.10, is that right? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you are the person mentioned in 
55.10 and you have already made the correction of 55.5 
and we have dealt with Mr Rakadukwe’s spelling issue.  
Right, now you mention in your affidavit that the committee 
was Chaired by Ms Malahlela, correct? 
10 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And its purpose was to evaluate the 
responses from the three suppliers, is that right? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And these responses were not simply 
the responses you had received in 2012 they were as 
updated in 2014.   
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, with the total cost that we 
have seen already from 159 to over R300million.   
20 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, now Mr Van Den Heever you 
then deal in paragraph 57 with a feedback session on the 
26 t h of June and you refer to an attendance register which 
was signed for VR Laser ’s feedback session but you say in 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 92 of 310 
 
paragraph 58: 
“We neglected to have it signed when DCD and LMT 
appeared before the committee.”   
I do not think anything would turn on the register not being 
signed.  What I am interested in Mr Van Den Heever is this 
was there a single feedback session for all three to attend 
or was there a separate feedback session for each of them 
separately?  
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Ja, there was a separate 
feedback on the same day different slots.  
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, if I might just have a moment.  
Yes, can I take you to page 387 Chair again just to explain 
this is an annexure that we find attached to Mr Drevin’s 
affidavit for the same reason discussed earlier.  Page 387, 
do you have it?   
CHAIRPERSON:   No that is fine.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you Chair.  
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Yes, I have got it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And this is the one for VR Laser and 
you see the names and signatures of the various people 
20 
including Ms Malahlela at the top there.    
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And is that your name if you look at 
the handwritten portion the 6 t h person to write and sign 
appears to be your name and is that your signature?  
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 93 of 310 
 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay thank you and then what 
follows is a list of a number of people from VR Laser.   
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, now what was the purpose of 
this feedback session? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Okay, the process like I said it 
was something near to us on the 25 t h when we received the 
quotations the BEC got together and they worked through 
all the quotations and as they work through it they were 
10 
looking 
at 
some 
stuff 
that 
needed 
clarity 
they 
had 
questions about it was painting included.  So there was 
various questions working through the quotes and working 
through them we drew up a list of questions that we need 
to ask the suppliers just to clarify on their quotations.   
So the next day on the 26 t h they were invited to 
come and give clarification on their quotation.  So each 
supplier came in at a certain time and we asked them the 
questions that came up in there quotes and they gave us 
the answers and they were each then asked to update their 
20 
quotes with that latest information, with that explanation 
for that, ja.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.        
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   I hope that makes sense? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you it certainly does Mr Van 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 94 of 310 
 
Den Heever.  May I just ask one further question before we 
take the adjournment that you proposed for one, fifteen, 
Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.    
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, may I take you again as 
an annexure to Mr Drevin’s affidavit although it should 
have been attached to yours as well because of the 
problem in house here.  Can I take you to page 389.  
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Yes.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   What is that? 
10 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That was the list – this specific 
list on 389 was the questions that was raised with VR 
Laser regarding clarification required on their quotation.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then at the following page 390, 
is that a similar questionnaire? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Similar questionnaire but on top 
you will see that is for DCD.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, so it is different questions 
specific to your queries about their proposal. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is it and it indicate what 
20 
time they were supposed to be in.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, thank you Chair would this be a 
convenient time to take the adjournment? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, it will be I think I must just say I 
agree with you Mr Kennedy that Mr Van Den Heever ’s 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 95 of 310 
 
command of English is very good so…[intervene]   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It is.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So I think it is good that he agreed to 
testify in English there are no glitches and we understand 
him very well.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So can I fire her? 
CHAIRPERSON:   We will not complain.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But may we as the legal team just 
express our thanks to Mr Van Den Heever for his attitude 
on the day and everything else.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And his attorney, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And his attorneys, ja thank you.  Okay 
we will take the lunch adjournment we will resume at 
quarter past two, we adjourn.     
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  May we give you an 
20 
update on the solution to the problem about missing 
annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  The Secretariat has very helpfully 
sorted out the problem. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 96 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  By copying the missing annexures and 
slotting them into my file that is the witness and we have 
taken the liberty after first checking with – with your – with 
the Chair’s associate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  To uplift your file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Chair and all of those annexures have 
now been slotted in in their appropriate places. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So it is now comprehensive and we 
must thank the Secretariat for fixing up the problem that 
arose yesterday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  We apologise to you Chair for the 
difficulties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine.  That is fine.  Thank 
you. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you.  Mr Van Den Heever let us- 
20 
let us deal if we may with the last few sections of your – of 
this particular contract that is the – that is the platform hulls’ 
contract procurement.  You have already taken us to the – 
you already explained what happened and why at the 
sessions – the feedback sessions. And then your affidavit 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 97 of 310 
 
refers to a further request that was then made by DLS to 
revise prices – revise their proposals.  You indicate in your 
affidavit based on issues raised during the meetings.  Now 
can you tell us what that relates to? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  Which page are we on now? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  On page 103 that is your affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay the changes that we requested 
was according to the clarification questions we had like for 
instance LNT did not include paint in their price that they 
quoted so they had to add the painting cost to the quotation.  
10 
But there was various like according to the questions that we 
asked that we needed clarity on they had to amend their 
quotations that they sent to us with the new information and 
then resend it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And then on page 104 most of that 
page is devoted to the information contained in the revised 
proposals of 27 oh sorry 27 June 2014 can be summarised 
as follows.  That is a reference to their response to your 
request for further revised proposals? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  That is correct yes. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  As I understand it LMT tried to explain 
its pricing did they actually make any change to the pricing? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  Yes their price changed from 
736 534 to 763 191.  That was due to the paint included. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  And then DCD made no 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 98 of 310 
 
changes. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  Ja they just confirmed I think there 
was a bond – the bond – raising a bond – performance bond 
– the cost of it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And VR Laser sent in a response but 
there they did not revise their pricing either. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay.  Now you then deal page 105 
with the evaluation sheets and the bid scoring.  May I just 
check were you part of the process – were you involved in 
10 
the process of actually scoring the bids in question? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  Yes I was part of the bid BEC they 
did the 
scoring but I 
was not involved in the final 
consolidation of everything. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Just explain to us please why you were 
involved in part but not the final part?  What actually 
happened? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  I cannot give you the reason but 
after the BEC got their – did the evaluations and the 
scorings and stuff all the documentation was collected and 
20 
then taken by Rolland Rakhaduwe and I do not know who 
helped him or who was involved in it but they did the final 
reconciliation and consolidation and everything and then I 
just received the final results at the end. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  You what?  Just repeat the last bit. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 99 of 310 
 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  I just received the final result at the 
end. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right thank you.  Did they change any 
of the scoring that you had agreed to in the bid evaluation 
committee when they did that process? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  Not – not that I am aware of 
anything. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Not to your knowledge right.  If I can 
please take you to page 132.39 and just to explain for the 
record the reason why the point 39 appears is that this is a 
10 
document that was missing earlier and has now been 
inserted as it should.  So in order not to disturb the overall 
pagination that is why it has been done Chair. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  What page again 132? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  132.39. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  I am there. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now admittedly we saw the same 
document in a different annexure to Mr Drevin’s affidavit 
earlier when he gave evidence.  But – and as the Chair 
pointed out there are two as here I am afraid Chair the – the 
20 
photocopying is meant that is very small letters printing but 
can you confirm is that your name and hand – your name and 
your signature with the date 27 June 2014? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And what is this document?  At least we 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 100 of 310 
 
can read consolidated evaluation sheet.  What does it tell 
us? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  This one is where they – where the 
consolidation…his 
one 
is 
where 
they 
– 
where 
the 
consolidation… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Kennedy.  I am sorry.  Is this 
the one that is supposed to be better? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Supposed to be? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is this the one that is supposed to be 
better?  This is the one which is supposed to be legible? 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  No, no.  We are not suggesting that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  As I was saying earlier it is has got the 
same problem as the one we looked at earlier for Mr Drevin. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So that has not been done yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh we have not got a larger one or a 
clearer copy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Not yet so far we have only achieved a 
resolution to the one problem is that it is present.  It is now 
20 
not absent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But now we need a bigger copy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh just that – then I am relieved because I 
was thinking if this is the better copy then … 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 101 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I am sorry – I am sorry to disappoint 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are in trouble. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  It was the first problem not the second 
that we have thus far been able to remedy with the 
assistance of the Secretariat thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But – but does this reflect the scoring 
that was done in the evaluation of the bids? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  That is correct yes. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay.  Then to go back to your affidavit 
because there at least the font is big and the copying is 
clear you deal with the evaluation back at page 105 
paragraph 65 you refer to the – split the price points for 
technical and BBBEE the percentage for each of those and 
then you refer to how there was discussion within your 
committee about how the weighting would be – would be 
dealt with.  Is that right? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And there was agreement by the 
20 
committee as to how the scoring would be done. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Then you deal at page 106 with the 
topic we need to spend a few minutes on and that is the 
BBBEE requirement.  Now at page 106 you mention that 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 102 of 310 
 
there was a problem in relation – that you had – that – that 
was due to an error on your part.  You did not include a 
requirement in the original invitation.  Tell the Chair please 
what – what did you erroneously omit? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  Okay when I sent out the RFQ I did 
not request each supplier to submit a BBBEE certificate or a 
valid BBBEE certificate but that was requested during our 
clarification session that we had with each supplier and we 
asked them to submit the certificates for us. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now you refer there to the – this is 
10 
apparent in the RFQ invitation – you refer to the annexure 
number HVD28 and now fortunately it has been now located 
and put in the bundle.  If I can turn – ask you to turn please 
to page 132.102. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  Okay I am there. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  In fact the doc – the first documents at 
the previous page 132.101 that is the update request and 
then 132.102 is that the original request for offer 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now is this the document where you – 
20 
where you should have put in a request for a BBBEE 
certificate? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And you say that that was omitted – 
why was that?  How did that come about? 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 103 of 310 
 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  I just – well during that stage it was 
almost standard for a supplier to submit a BBBEE certificate 
and a tax certificate with their quotations that they submit to 
us.  And I just forgot to request that or put it in the request. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  But the – but the certificate was 
important was it? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  Well that was a standard I could not 
place any orders without BBBEE certificate and a tax 
certificate – tax clearance certificate. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now then to go back – you – did 
10 
you 
then 
request 
suppliers 
to 
submit 
their 
BBBEE 
certificates? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  That is it during that clarification 
meeting we had with each supplier on the 26t h June. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  The feedback – sorry the clarification 
meetings that you held separately with the three on that 
day? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  That is correct each supplier was 
asked to submit the BBBEE cert. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Did they then supply them? 
20 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  Yes I think they were given fourteen 
days to submit if I could remember correctly. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  If we can – if I can take you 
please to – sorry Chair if I can just have a moment you 
would indulge me?  Right now you refer in your affidavit to 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 104 of 310 
 
expiry of LMT certificate.  Just explain what in fact was – 
was there a problem and why? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  We were in June 2014 at that stage 
and their expiry date on their certificate was 20 May 2014 
which was just over a month expired.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  If I can take you please to page 
132.113.   
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  I am there. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And what is that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  132? 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  132.113. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  That is a letter received from 
Empower Logic stating that LMT is in the process to do their 
BE verification and that it will be done within four to six 
weeks.  It will take till six weeks to complete. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So this letter refers to Empower Logic 
having been engaged by LMT to perform their BBBEE 
verification 
and 
they 
indicated 
that 
process 
was 
still 
underway but the verification would take another four to six 
20 
weeks. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Did – did you in the BEC or did 
anybody else give a score to LMT in relation to BBBEE? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  No that was not part of the scoring 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 105 of 310 
 
process done by them – by the group. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  That information was done on the 
next 
level 
where 
Mr 
Rakhaduwe 
collected 
all 
the 
documentation and did the finalisation. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Thank you.  Let us move if we 
may for a moment to – yes page – page 109 of your affidavit. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  I am there. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  You refer to a consolidated evaluation 
sheet and that you refer to as being Annexure HVD031.  Just 
10 
turn for a moment to page 134.   
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Is that the evaluation sheet that you 
referring to? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Here I must point out to the Chair 
although it will be perfectly obvious to him but I am afraid 
the print is even smaller here and that will be remedied to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am still trying to get there.  Did you say 
134? 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  134 Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let me just get there.  You know 
when you see 132 you can think you are close to 134. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because of… 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 106 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Logic is changing Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You find yourself travelling a long distance 
before you get to 134.  Yes I have got 134. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  Can I just say that I receive – at 
that stage I received a whole file with all the evaluations and 
final scorings and consolidations in one file given to me in 
my office telling me there is the results or the VR Laser is 
the winning bidder and we are going to place the order on 
VR Laser. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. And the way in which it was done 
10 
when you were just presented with that as a – as a result did 
you find that normal?  Did you find that acceptable in terms 
of process or did you find it unusual and disturbing? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  Well as mentioned in my affidavit is 
that we have never done this BBE or this scoring and I was 
not 
sure 
how 
it 
worked 
and 
what 
the 
– 
where 
the 
percentages and stuff came from so I had no background on 
it, no training.  The whole team had no training it was a first 
for all so I could not find any fault in what was happening. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right thank you.  Now although at that 
20 
page we have just looked at the print is very small you have 
helpfully in clear print on your – in your affidavit on page 109 
set out the important features.  And here you refer to VR 
Laser receiving the highest score – received a total of 
65.54% and then  you give the breakdown.  10.39% for price, 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 107 of 310 
 
50.15 for functionality or technical and 5% for BBBEE.  And 
you have referred here to the price of VR Laser in 81.1 of 
being R262 406 000.00 etcetera. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And which was – which is of the same 
order as the previous – previously submitted quote, correct? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Then you refer to LMT coming second it 
received an overall score of 64.78%.  That is very slightly 
less – in fact less than 1% it is 0.76% less than the VR Laser 
10 
score in percentage terms, is that correct? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  That is correct. 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
And 
their 
financial 
offer 
was 
R165 612 000.00 odd.  So still there was a difference of not 
quite but almost R100million between LMT and VR Laser. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And then DCD came third their price 
was still over R300 million.  Correct? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now then you refer to your preparing a 
20 
submission to EXCO to be reviewed and signed off by Ms 
Malahlela.  Now if I can ask you please in the bundle to go 
to the document page 136.   
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  I am there. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  That appears to be an email from you 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 108 of 310 
 
to Ms Malahlela saying hope I have captured most of the 
points required this morning and was it – was there attached 
to that email the document that then follows at 137. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And following.  And what is this 
document? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  That is the executive – Chief 
Executive Supply Chain submission requesting the approval 
of the order. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  And so we see at page 141 
10 
paragraph 7 a recommendation.  Correct? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now this is what you have said – you  
prepared this document is that right? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  As you can see from my mail that I 
have sent to Celia where I said I hope I have captured most 
of the points required this morning.  She basically told me 
what to put in the document. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay.  Now what the document says in 
7 is the following: 
20 
“The following is hereby recommended 711 
that a contract can be negotiated and an 
order placed on VR Laser Services for Phase 
2 presumably of the Hoefyster contract with a 
total 
value 
of 
R262 
million 
and 
some 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 109 of 310 
 
thousands of rands.” 
7.1 sorry that is the price that had been tendered in terms of 
the further revised proposal received from VR Laser.  
Correct? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  But then the document 
continues 712 this is a ceiling amount as further negotiations 
with VR Laser Services will take place to obtain a price 
below DLS budget.  Now you referred us earlier in your 
evidence to DLS having a budget – what was that budget 
10 
amount? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  If I remember correctly it was I 
think R206 million or R209 million I am not sure. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And what was here being recommended 
was a contract to be placed on VR Laser for a value of R262 
million which clearly is considerably above the maximum – 
the budget maximum amount that is available. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  If I cannot remember correctly but 
this was – I was told by Celia to put this in with the 
negotiations – putting in the ceiling amount for further 
20 
negotiations I think she said there was some sort of a – a 
mandate that we had for R1million and 50 or R1 million or R1 
million and 50 per vehicle that we need to negotiate so that 
is – I think that is why this was put in. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  So – but – so this point about it is 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 110 of 310 
 
going to be for R262 million but if that is the ceiling amount 
it would be subject to negotiation to try and bring that down. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  To bring it within the budget maximum. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And… 
CHAIRPERSON:  What – what – sorry – what did it mean to 
say it was going to be a ceiling amount?  It did not mean that 
there will be – there would be negotiations to try and bring it 
– VR Laser down on the price but if there was no agree – if 
10 
they did not agree then that would stay as the price.  The 
ceiling amount would remain as the price? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  Well that is basically what it is 
saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  Ja that is the ceiling amount that 
will not go above that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  It could stay the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  But … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But – but  
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  But its idea was to negotiate it 
down ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what does this reference to a ceiling 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 111 of 310 
 
amount add to the meaning of this thing because if there is 
an agreement that your price is R262 million obviously that 
cannot be increased without agreement?  So what is this 
whole thing about it is – saying it is a ceiling amount?  Is it 
just to mislead people to think there is some value it will not 
increase?  So they must find comfort in that. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  Ja it basically comes down to you 
can approve this it will not go higher than that but it can 
lower.  So that is what it is basically saying ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. But what it represented is 
10 
they accepted this price but just said we will try and 
negotiate them down. But obviously if they do not agree to 
go down this will remain as the price. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  Ja at this stage it was on 
management level for their decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  Of what could happen and what the 
plans will be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair and just arising from 
20 
those questions Mr Van Den Heever.  If VR Laser was 
approached to negotiate a reduction below the R262 million 
and they would not agree to any reduction it would stay at 
262 you have said that to the Chair but then that would still 
be above the budget – what would the result of that be?  
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 112 of 310 
 
That they would get the contract for 262 even though you 
were way exceeding your budget or that the contract would 
not be awarded to them?  What was your understanding? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  Well if you look at the document if 
they approve that amount of 262 you have got the mandate 
to go and place the order for that but you still need to prove 
that you tried to negotiate the price down. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right and then if I can take you at page 
137 the first page of this document.  It is addressed to 
EXCO.  Would that be EXCO of – of DLS. 
10 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  DLS yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Not head office? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Not the Group EXCO? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  This does not indicate unless I 
have missed it.  Anything is to who should approve it outside 
DLS.  If I can take you to page 142 there is provision for 
various signatures. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  Ja you see the process that we 
20 
normally follow there is a DLS Supply Chain Committee that 
we take this to them.  They sort of approve or recommend it 
and then it goes to EXCO.  Then once EXCO sees it and 
recommends it then to DCO.  That is the process that we 
follow. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 113 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  So this was – this was simply 
for the first – it was for the approval within …. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  DLS. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  DLS and if approve – was approval 
required outside DLS?  In other words at head office level. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  As far as you are aware. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay and that would then be dealt with 
in a separate document presumably? 
10 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  That is it ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  You were not involved in the 
preparation of any document for them? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  No.  It gets done on EXCO level. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now Mr Van Den Heever you 
refer in your affidavit to disciplinary proceedings happening 
against you.  If I can take you back to 110.   
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But as I understand your affidavit that 
does not relate to the procurement process of scoring and 
20 
awarding the contract to VR Laser or does it? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  No but it was during that process 
that a communication with the suppliers that I made LMT 
aware of that there was other suppliers also in the running 
for the contract. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 114 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And were you disciplined for alerting 
VR Laser – sorry alerting LMT to the fact that VR Laser was 
also bidding for this contract? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  That is correct yes. 
ADV 
KENNEDY SC:  And it appears that you were 
suspended, is that right? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And subjected to a disciplinary hearing 
that lasted five weeks. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And you do not say whether you were 
found guilty or not guilty but a sanction was imposed so I 
assume that you were found guilty? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  Ja and a final written warning was 
given. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  Alright.  Now finally in your 
affidavit I would like to take you to page 111.  Purchase 
orders issued to VR Laser and here we come to paragraph 
93.  Now here you – we as mentioned earlier but we did not 
go into – into a full detail of it.  I mentioned earlier to the 
20 
Chair that you have at the request of the team updated 
certain figures and you have prepared a supplementary 
statement that is the one that I mentioned earlier Chair that 
is with - well, that you have indicated earlier to be filed as 
Exhibit 14.  Sorry. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 115 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   W. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   W14.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   14.3. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Point 3.  I beg your pardon.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Chair, again, we have had some 
logistical constraints but with your leave, may I hand up the 
signed supplementary statement as indicated to you earlier 
Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   This has not been yet attested but that 
will be attended to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  That is fine. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   May I, with your leave, then hand up to 
you Chair, subject to the arrangements that will be put in 
your file in due course, properly marked and then replaced 
by the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is fine. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am afraid we have not had enough 
copies for everybody to be made. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I think perhaps...  Unfortunately, the 
witness does not have the supplementary statement in front 
of him.  Perhaps my copy should just be made available with 
your leave.   
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 116 of 310 
 
 
And 
I 
would 
just 
put 
a 
few 
questions 
to 
Mr Van den Heever as to what the effect of the amendment 
is.  May I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, it looks like that maybe today is one 
of those days when there is always going to be something 
that is goes on somewhere.  Well, it is signed by him but not 
by the commissioner or oaths. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That is right.  There is just a 
logistical...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   ...yesterday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  [laughing]  No, that is fine.  I am 
sure it will be fixed.  I was just saying, you know, sometimes 
just everything goes wrong.  [laughing]   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am afraid this particular body of the 
evidence has had all these hiccups. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But hopefully been able to get to the 
end of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   With that sorted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So we apologise for all these issues 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Are you going to be asking 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 117 of 310 
 
questions on that one now? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Just if I may then ask the witness to 
explain why it was done and what was done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And what the outcome of it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Mr Van den Heever, would you help us 
with that?  You have indicated earlier to the Chair that you 
were requested by my colleague, Ms Sibiya, to update the 
figures.  Is that correct? 
10 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And those are the figures that appear 
in your paragraph 93.  Now what are the figures show?  This 
is a spreadsheet but you have now given the updated 
spreadsheet, correct? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And what does it show?  Does this 
reflect payment or value of purchase orders? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Ja, it is the value of orders placed 
by me on VL Laser for a period from August 2008 to the 
20 
requested date of 30 or 31 March 2014 with the reasoning 
that that was when VR Laser ownership changed to the 
ownership. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright.  Thank you.  Then to return to 
your affidavit that we have been looking at 111, page 111, 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 118 of 310 
 
paragraph 94.  It says you confirm from the period 
12 August 2009 until the signature of the memorandum of 
agreement with VR Laser Services in 2015.  I issued 
purchase orders to the value of R 232 959 000,00, et cetera 
on VR Laser.   
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright.  Now does that relate to orders 
placed under the hull contract? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is hull contract, everything or 
armour plate work that VL is required.  It was plate based on 
10 
VR Laser by me.  It comes to that version for that period. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.   
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   I am not sure.  I think...  Ja, the 
whole price could be included in...  No, the whole price was 
not included in this one.  I cannot remember but we will have 
to have a look on the spreadsheet. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  And then at page 112, you refer 
to the facts that is common cause that all the other 
witnesses 
have 
confirmed 
that 
there 
has 
been 
a 
memorandum of agreement signed between VR Laser and 
20 
DLS on the 16t h of April.   
 
That is where VR Laser was appointed as DLS’s single 
source supplier of all fabricated steel services and goods.  
And were you involved in the procurement for that contract? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Which are you referring to here? 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 119 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Single source supplier. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   No, I was not involved in that at 
all. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright.  So your affidavit does not deal 
with that process but your affidavit does deal with the rest of 
this page 112 for certain figures that relates to payments.  
Oh, sorry not payments but the total value of orders in R 97, 
R 102, R 112.8 million. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   H’m. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now that relates to the single source 
10 
supply contract. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay thank you.  And then you refer to 
the outstanding order lines, at the time was closed.  There 
was a directive that all outstanding order lines be closed.  
Why was that necessary?  Do you know? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   The directive that was issued by 
Denel SOC stated that all business relationship with VR 
Laser must be separate(?) on 1 June 2018.  And that was 
due...  Well, when the State Capture or investigation.  All 
20 
work with VR Laser was ended.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I see.  What was the R 56.1 million 
represent?  Is that orders that have been placed that were 
then put on hold? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Ja, what I am saying.  The 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 120 of 310 
 
R 56 million...  Okay, the periods run from R 112 million was 
the amount that was placed based on the MOA. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   And after that directive, open lines 
was closed which telling us that R 56 million, of that 
R 112 million was already delivered and completed. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And then you explain that in the 
next paragraph.  Right.  Thank you.  Alright.  Thank you.  
May I just have a moment to confer with my team Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Sorry, Chair.  May I just... 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   May I just ask that the file be returned 
to us for just a moment? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  May I return the file, 
please Chair?  Sorry about the interruption. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That is my team just giving me 
valuable input. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now the amount we are referring here 
Chair 
and 
Mr Van den Heever 
to 
your 
supplementary 
statement.  You give at the foot of that page that has been 
presented to you a figure of R 3.5 million approximately.  
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 121 of 310 
 
Correct? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That is the value ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What page is that on the supplementary? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am afraid I do not have a file in front 
of me but I think ...[intervenes]  
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Page 2. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   ...it is on the supplementary. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page?  Page 2? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Page 2 of the supplementary. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Thank you, Chair.  Sorry.  At the 
foot of the second page of that affidavit you give a figure of 
R 3.5 million.  Is that correct? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And was that the value of the orders 
placed on VR Laser prior to the change of ownership in VR 
Laser? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct.  By myself, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am sorry? 
20 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   By myself, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That you have put... that you had 
placed? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Yes, correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Were there other colleagues 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 122 of 310 
 
within the organisation who were also placing orders? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Or were you the only one who placed 
orders? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   There were other colleagues as 
well. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I see.  But from your knowledge, from 
your own involvement it was R 3.5 million before the change 
of ownership in VR Laser that provokes so much media 
interest and subsequent investigation by the Public Protector 
10 
and this Commission? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  And then, if we can 
compare that with the value that appears in the affidavit that 
you have presented of the R 345 million.  Was that before or 
after or at the same as the change of ownership? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   If you look at page 111, your affidavit, 
paragraph 93.  
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   No, that was for the whole period.  
20 
That includes the hulls, everything, up to 2018. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And then, if we look at 
paragraph 94.  There you refer to a period between 2009 and 
2015.  The purchase orders then amounted to the value of 
R 232 million. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 123 of 310 
 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Ja, that is correct.  That was 
before the MOA period. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Perhaps if...  I am sorry for the 
interruption.  Perhaps if I can ask the question, really, in this 
way?  Before the ownership in VR Laser, what sort of amount 
was placed by way of the value of purchase orders compared 
with what happened after the change of ownership in VR 
Laser? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Well, there is a magnificent 
different but we did not have it, the contract at that stage 
10 
and it will explain the change in figures. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So it was a big difference once there 
was a change in ownership? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes.  
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
 
Right. 
 
Thank 
you. 
 
Right.  
Mr Van den Heever, I am done with this affidavit.  We are 
going to deal with the other affidavit.  It should not take that 
long.  But before we leave this.   
 
Is there anything else you want to raise that you feel is 
significant to be brought to the attention of the Chair in 
20 
relation to the Platform Hulls issue? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Nothing that I can think of now. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  With 
your leave Chair, may we then turn to the other affidavit that 
has already been submitted. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 124 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is Exhibit W14.1 starting at page 
5. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  If you have that in front of 
you Mr Van den Heever? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Thank you.  Some of the initial 
pages are pretty much stuff we have already dealt with.  So 
we do not need to go into that.  This affidavit, as I 
10 
understand it, deals specifically with an earlier contract 
which is referred to as the Trunnion Contract awarded to 
LMT. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you deal with that from page 12. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Where? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   The heading is the Trunnion Contract 
and the R 12.7 million prepayment.  Now you have set out on 
pages 12 and 13 the procedure that was followed.  Various 
entities were asked for quotations.  Is that right? 
20 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   LMT was one.  ELCA and IAD for the 
others referred to in paragraph 15. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then you refer to a proposal or a 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 125 of 310 
 
quotation received from of these entities such as LMT.  
Paragraph 17.  That from IT, D and 18.  And then you deal 
with your interactions with colleagues, Mr Teubes, Mr Burger 
and Mr Knoetze and others.   
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now if we can just to what appears to 
be the main focus of the affidavit from here on page 14.  You 
refer to, in paragraph 24 that: 
“It became obvious that DLS was in negotiations 
with LMT on providing financial assistance to LMT.” 
10 
 
And you refer to your picking that up in relation... in a 
trial of emails, there were discussions relating to financial 
challenges that LMT was trying to address.  And DLS was to 
provide some financial assistance.  What did you understand 
was actually going on and why?   
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Well, my understanding was that 
LMT had a cash flow problem and that they needed the 
assistance of DLS. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But that stage, was LMT owned by 
parties other than Denel? 
20 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   I think so, ja.  They were not part 
of us yet. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  But they later...  There was 
later selling of 51% shareholding in LMT to Denel? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Ja, my understand was that due to 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 126 of 310 
 
this contract, which was not paid or something, resulted in 
becoming or getting the ownership in LMT.  That is my 
understanding of it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay thank you.  Page 17 refers to a 
suspensive condition in relation to this contract.  What did 
this relate to? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   It is basically that if you do not get 
Phase 2 of the Hoefyster Contract from Armscor... 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Are you meaning that if you did not 
complete Phase 1, you would not get Phase 2? 
10 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct.  Ja, and then you 
deal with the suspension conditions because the suspension 
condition refers to that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And did they in fact complete 
Phase 1, LMT? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   No, DLS did not even, at this 
stage, has not completed Phase 1. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And then you deal with the 
termination of the contract, paragraph 41 and following.  Was 
that the contract with LMT still, the same contract? 
20 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And did you give the notice of 
termination that is referred to in paragraph 43? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   H’m.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Who is... you say there, you received 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 127 of 310 
 
the notice of termination.  It was signed by Dr Nel and 
Mr Burger. 
MR 
VAN 
DEN 
HEEVER: 
 
 
Ja, 
I 
think 
it 
was 
a 
Mr De Bardien(?) that requested that documentation.  It is 
somewhere in my statement.  Let me just see.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Page 18, paragraph 42.  Perhaps that 
helps you. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Do you know why it was 
cancelled? 
10 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   I am not sure.  I think it was due to 
the fact that... the money was paid or whatever.  I do not 
know.  But there was no need for the contract ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Can I take you ...[intervenes]  
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   ...any longer, I think.  I am not 
sure. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am sorry to have interrupted you.  If I 
may take you to pages 45 and 46? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   This is an email from Mr Dabiedeen(?) 
20 
(De Bardien(?)), Veron(?) Dabiedeen of DLS Financial 
operations.  Is that right? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And he attaches a signed cancellation 
letter.  And is this the letter of cancellation that is referred to 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 128 of 310 
 
in your affidavit on the following page 46? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   If I can just read it into the record?  
Second and third paragraphs.   
“It is recorded that the said contract number has not 
yet come into effect as a suspensive condition as 
set out in Clause 6.3.1.2.   
The contract has to date not been fulfilled.  It is 
further recorded that Denel (Pty) Ltd has recently 
acquired a majority shareholding of LMT Holdings 
10 
that in light of the above, the parties have elected to 
evoke Clause 7.6.1 of the contract, hereby effecting 
a 
consensual 
cancellation 
of 
the 
contract.  
Cancellation 
notes 
will 
come 
into 
effect 
upon 
signature of the dully authorised representatives of 
both parties.” 
 
And then we see there are signatures below that on the 
21s t of September 2012 by Mr Burger for Denel Land 
Systems and Dr Nel the then CEO for LMT Holdings. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   [No audible reply]  
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now you then deal with another 
issue in your affidavit which I am going to try and deal with 
very briefly Mr Van den Heever and that is LMT purchase 
order.  Can I take you back to page 18 of your affidavit? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   H’m. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 129 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You refer to a Malaysia transaction.   
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now you were asked to evaluate the 
feasibility of facing the manufacturing of the Malaysia LCT 
30 turrets on LMT.  Was the client there Malaysia?  Were 
these turrets to be supplied to Malaysia? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Not Armscor?  This is different from 
the Hoefyster contract? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And had Denel got that 
business to supply armoured vehicles to Malaysia? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Ja, it was just turrets. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Just turrets? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Which they delivered to Malaysia 
that was fitted on an Indian fabricated vehicle. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And so this was business that 
could be given to LMT, is what your affidavit refers to.  And 
then if I can take you to page 19, paragraph 47.  Mr Teubes 
indicated that DLS had to contract with LMT in this regard. 
20 
“It was in the process of being acquired by DLS 
where DLS became a major shareholder but its 
business strategy had to change.” 
 
Were you informed of this by Mr Teubes? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 130 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And was this the reason why you 
understood the Malaysia turrets business must be based on 
LMT? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Well, it makes sense to me, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that what you were instructed to do? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then you refer in paragraph 50 to 
an instruction from Mr Van der Linde to create urgently 
requisitions for the purchase order to be placed on LMT. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And that was to the value of 
R 10 million and you have attached to your affidavit the 
relevant documents.  We do not need to go through that I 
believe Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC:   Now 
what 
interest 
me 
Mr Van den Heever is, at the top of your next page 20, you 
say: 
“Considering the deviation from normal procedure as 
stated above, the urgency attached, I was reluctant 
20 
to execute the instructions of management.” 
 
In what way did you believe that this was a deviation 
from normal procedure to place urgently the purchase order 
on LMT? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Okay firstly, the procedure is to go 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 131 of 310 
 
out on quotation and...  In other words, compile an RFT(?).  
Send it out to the supplier, get your quotations or to the 
three suppliers which is part of your purchasing file that you 
need to have.  And this was not followed.   
 
I was just given a quotation that came from LMT and 
requested to place the order to that value of which Mr Van 
der Linde... the requisitions that are used, to place the order.   
 
And then the approval of the order to that value of 
R 10 million normally takes two to three weeks for approval.  
And this only took about two days for all the signatures. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   In relation to the ordinary procedure 
which would have required going out for quotation.  That 
would have been the RFQ process of inviting three suppliers 
that you knew were suitable to invite them. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is the answer... is a possible answer to 
that concern about the fact that the process did not follow 
the RFQ process, is a possible answer that:  Well, Denel was 
in the process of acquiring LMT.  This was to improve the 
business strategy of Denel.   
20 
 
And it would then make sense to Denel for its own 
purposes to try and give business LMT entity that it was 
about to acquire a majority shareholding in. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Well, according to me, you still 
need to follow procedure. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 132 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  So procedure still required that 
there would be a measure of competitive process? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Not just with a company that of course 
are being acquired but also to get benefit to Denel. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then you deal on page 21 with tax 
invoices an advanced payment.  Please explain to the Chair 
what the significance is of the advance payment that was 
made in this regard?  Who made what payment to whom and 
10 
why? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Well, the order was loaded by me 
and sent to LMT for signature. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   And it was returned on the same 
day and invoiced the next day for payment of R 5.7 million 
and payment went through.  So I do not know. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Was this according to standard 
procedure? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   No, not according to me. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And was there a good business reason 
that you were aware of for such a prepayment to be made? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Only what was told to me by 
Mr Teubes that the money will be paid back once LMT get 
their money from somewhere in the Middle East.   
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 133 of 310 
 
 
I am not sure what country it was but they were 
expecting an amount from UAE or somewhere and then they 
will refund this money.  And if they do not refund it, then we 
will have the 51% ownership. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now you deal from pages 22 to 
23 to steps after the invoice was received from LMT and then 
you had dealing with a Ms Liz Laveshnee Chetty from your 
Finance Department.  Correct? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Who was wanting a copy of the 
10 
agreement.  You told her there had been no agreement 
except for the purchase order. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Were some purchase orders issued in 
terms of standard procedure without needing an agreement 
or was there a contract actually required in each case for 
this type of transaction? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Sometimes.  Depending on the 
value.  But on this R 10 million there should at least be some 
sort of agreement but there was no agreement.   
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Except for the order that was 
placed on LMT. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then you refer to a number of 
communications, I think all by email with Mr Jurie Human, 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 134 of 310 
 
Mr Du Preez, Mr Wynand Meiring.  And they referred to a 
need to close the order and make the... and in paragraph 66, 
Mr Du Preez responded that you could close the order and 
make the quantity and price zero.  What is that about 
Mr Van den Heever? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Okay.  When the order was loaded, 
the requisitions that was generated by Mr Van der Linde 
were used to create the lines in the purchase order. 
 
And that comes from a note where the project stores 
their money.  And all the payments that was done on this, 
10 
never went through on that requisitions.   
 
It went through on advance payments and on different 
accounts.  So those requisitions are basically unused and it 
was just connected to the order.   
 
And then the project manager needed that money 
because he, well, I assumed he paid some of the money from 
these advanced payment accounts. 
 
It was taken out of his notes.  So he wanted us to close 
the orders that those requisitions... the money that was... 
that R 10 million that was allocated to that order become 
20 
available for his project again.  If that makes sense? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Are you saying that there was an 
irregularity here? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Normally you should have – get a 
delivery against an order, a delivery note stating this is 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 135 of 310 
 
what we deliver which then goes through the stores for 
receipt 
and 
invoice 
to 
finances 
to 
pay 
against 
the 
requisition that is linked to the order.  This, we just 
received invoices and it was paid out of advanced payment 
account. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now in paragraph 70, page 23, you 
refer, 
after 
giving 
the 
background 
facts, 
to 
getting 
information from finance department showing that out of 
the R9.698 million – was that the value of the order itself? 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   I think that was what was paid 
10 
out on that order of R10 million, R9 698 370 was paid to 
LMT. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   And …[intervenes] 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Then you make a point about of that 
9.225 million, a the shortfall of 472 000 appeared.  What is 
the point that you are trying to make there?  There is a 
difference and you said finance department could not give 
you a difference. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:  Ja, if you go back I think to point 
20 
69. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Finance verified that they  - LMT 
paid the full amount back to LMT on the order and when I 
got the information and did the calculation I saw that there 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 136 of 310 
 
was – not all the money was received back but 472 971 
was still outstanding but they could not give explanation 
why. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, may I have a brief moment, 
Chair?  Mr van den Heever, thank you for your help.  Those 
are the questions that I have.  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much, Mr van den 
Heever, for coming to assist the Commission.  If we need 
you we will ask you to come back but thank you very much, 
you are now excused. 
10 
MR VAN DEN HEEVER:   Thank you,  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  Thank you, Ms Interpreter, 
you are also excused. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair, we are ready with 
our next witness.  As I indicated, I do not believe that she 
will be that long. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   She is available, may we ask leave 
to call her? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Her name is Carene Geldenhuys. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is fine. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And while she is coming forward and 
before she is sworn in may I just for guidance refer to her 
affidavit in the same bundle, Denel 04, it appears from 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 137 of 310 
 
page 148 and we will be asking for it to be admitted as 
EXHIBIT W15.  You should find the tab there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, thank you.  Yes, are you ready, Mr 
Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, thank you, Chair, may we ask 
that your learned associate swear the witness in? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, my registrar. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Your registrar. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The Labour Court technology has stuck 
with you. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Old habits. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, thank you. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Carene Geldenhuys. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   No, I do not. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes, I do. 
20 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give  
will be the truth the whole truth and nothing else but the 
truth.  If so, please raise your right hand and say so help 
me God.

CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, you may be seated, Ms 
Geldenhuys.  I think you will need to sit on the other chair 
otherwise you will be too far from the microphone.  I think 
the other microphone does not work.  Okay, alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you may continue. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Good afternoon, Ms Geldenhuys.  
You have a bundle in front of you, a file.  I hope it has 
been opened at page 151, if you look at the numbers on 
the top left. 
10 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes, I do. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, thank you.   Can you confirm 
that your name appears on this page which is the first page 
of a statement? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Which you have in fact signed before 
Commissioner of Oaths.  If I may take you to page 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just one second, Mr Kennedy.  Just pull 
the mic closer to you.  Ja.  Okay, alright. 
20 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
 
Thank 
you. 
 
May 
you, 
Ms 
Geldenhuys, turn to page 165?  Is that you signature on 
page 165? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And is it correct that as seems to 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 139 of 310 
 
appear from the foot of the page you signed that in front of 
Commissioner of Oaths? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So this is in fact an affidavit.  Do you 
confirm that you have been through the contents of this 
affidavit? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes, I have. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And that you confirm that in fact the 
contents of the affidavit are correct according to your own 
knowledge? 
10 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, thank you.  Chair, we would 
then move formally for you leave to have admitted this 
affidavit, statement/affidavit with its annexures as an 
exhibit in bundle Denel 04 as EXHIBIT W15. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The statement/affidavit of Ms Carene 
Geldenhuys 
starting 
at 
page 
151 
together 
with 
its 
annexures is admitted as EXHIBIT W15. 
STATEMENT/AFFIDAVIT 
OF 
CARENE 
GELDENHUYS 
STARTING AT PAGE 151 TOGETHER WITH ANNEXURES 
20 
HANDED IN AS EXHIBIT W15. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You may proceed. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  May we just for the 
record 
indicate 
– 
no, 
in 
fact 
you 
were 
previously 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 140 of 310 
 
represented by attorneys were you …[intervenes] 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes, I was, when I was still employed 
by Denel. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Was that Mr Pillay and his team? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   No, it was Diale Attorneys. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Diale Attorneys. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  But you are no longer 
10 
represented by them. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   No. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  When did you leave 
Denel? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Then end of March – no, the end of 
April, sorry, 2020. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  When did you start there? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   August – it was – when I started it 
was still BAE Systems, Land Systems South Africa, that 
was in 2006 and then in April 2015 we were acquired by 
20 
Denel, our business in South Africa. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And the business previously owned 
by BAE that was now acquired by Denel, did that then 
come to form a division within Denel? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   No, it was a standalone entity. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 141 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   With its own board but fully owned by 
Denel SOC. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So it is a separate company. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   What is the name of it? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   It is Denel Vehicle Systems (Pty) Ltd. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  If we can refer to it from now 
on as DVS as everybody seems to do. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So it was DVS under its previous 
name and then under the DVS name it was your employer 
while you were employed in the Denel Group. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay, thank you.  And what was your 
job title? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   I was legal and commercial executive 
on the DVS executive team. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now in – now we must bear in mind 
your affidavit was signed on the 15 January 2020.  We see 
20 
that on page 105.  So when we go to your first paragraph, 
page 151, obviously that was representing the facts as 
they existed in January 2020.  You were still then 
employed at DVS, correct? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 142 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And you there refer to the fact 
that you were employed as the legal and commercial 
executive of DVS.  You were not involved, or were you, in 
anything to do with DLS? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   No. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now on page 152 you refer to 
the area of business of DVS, that it has its own three 
divisions and you described that in some detail in 2.2, 
correct? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  Chair, with your leave, I am 
leading the witness on matters that are believe are not 
controversial. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, non-controversial matters. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you and then you set out in 
2.4 your key responsibility areas. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  You referred to legal advice in 
241 that you would provide the CEO and business. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Where warranted and then also your 
functions including as part of your key areas drafting and 
reviewing legal documentation and agreement. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now, Ms Geldenhuys, the 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 143 of 310 
 
Commission has already heard some evidence in relation 
to an agreement that was concluded between DVS and VR 
Laser.  Is that – you deal from page 153 with an instruction 
that you received to prepare a Memorandum of Agreement 
between DVS and VR Laser services. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And what sort of services were to be 
provided or goods were to be provided in terms of this 
agreement by VR Laser to DVS? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   At that stage we got an instruction 
10 
through Mr Ntshepe who was the Acting CEO of Denel at 
that stage to enter into an agreement with VR Laser.  We 
were not – because it was not something that came from 
within the business as a requirement that we have 
identified VR Laser as to be partner with us, we were not 
quite sure what it is that we need to contract with them, 
what type of arrangement it was. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   We then took guidance from Mr Jan 
Wessels who was the COO of Denel at that stage.  When 
20 
he guided us to enter into a very high level nonbinding 
noncommittal type of agreement wherein we will agree that 
we will explore avenues to maybe in future collaborate 
together. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 144 of 310 
 
MS GELDENHUYS:   And that was then the agreement that 
was drafted. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay, thank you.  Now you 
mentioned Mr Ntshepe who was then Acting Group Chief 
Executive.  We know that he took over then as the fully 
fledged Group CEO.  When Mr Saloojee left Denel he was 
the previous Group CEO.  Was Mr Ntshepe, when he was 
acting, 
was 
at 
the 
time 
that 
Mr 
Saloojee 
was 
on 
suspension?  Do you know? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   I believe so. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   I am not one hundred percent in 
terms of the timeline. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Alright.  
MS GELDENHUYS:   But this was – we – I know that Mr 
Saloojee was suspended at the end of September 2015, 
this is in the beginning of November, so I doubt it very 
much if there would have been a formal appointment 
already. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.   Now referred to the 
20 
instruction coming from Mr Ntshepe and your affidavit says 
that that went through Mr Steyn.  You refer in 322 to Mr 
Steyn as being Chief Executive Officer of DVS. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now did it strike you as normal or 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 145 of 310 
 
unusual that an initiative to enter into a contract with an 
outside entity such as VR Laser should come from the 
Group Chief Executive rather than something that was 
generated within the division itself? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Like I have explained, we just became 
part of Denel.  In the previous way that we did business 
under the BAE System’s flag it would have been very 
strange because the business would identify who they need 
as a partner and they would substantiate why they need 
that partner.  It was strange that it came from the 
10 
corporate office that we have to enter into an agreement 
but it was also well, maybe this is the Denel manner.  We 
were too new in the group to one hundred percent say this 
is not the way that it is done.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So were you instructed by Mr Steyn 
to perform some duty? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes, I was. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And that was to prepare an 
agreement? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes, so I got a basis of the agreement 
20 
from Mr Wessels which you will see in the pack where he 
said well, he has used this type of agreement before and 
he suggests we use it as a basis.  We then took that 
agreement, which is nonbinding, noncommittal and we just 
amended it so that it fits into the current circumstances in 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 146 of 310 
 
terms of the type of business that we are doing and then 
talking that we will then investigate further if there is 
indeed collaboration opportunities for the two businesses 
to work together. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now you refer to in your affidavit to 
two agreements being signed initially.  The one is a 
confidentiality agreement and the other a memorandum of 
agreement, your affidavit says, but may I take you to page 
171?  Do you have it? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes, I do. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   This is a memorandum – the title is 
Memorandum of Understanding and it is a five page 
document running to 175.  Are you familiar with this 
document? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes, I am. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is this the document that you 
referred to in your affidavit as the nonbinding agreement? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright.  Did you draft this? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes I did but it was from – with input 
20 
that I received from Mr Jan Wessels. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.   And was that then finalised by 
Mr Steyn signing it on behalf of Denel, page 175? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And it was signed on behalf of VR 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 147 of 310 
 
Laser by Mr van der Merwe. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:    Alright.  Now can we go now to the 
confidentiality agreement, that starts it seems at page 166.  
Again an agreement between Denel and VR Laser. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Signed on the same date as the 
memorandum of understanding. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
 
Right. 
 
Did 
you 
prefer 
the 
10 
confidentiality agreement? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes, I did. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now what did you understand 
the purpose of these agreements to be, the confidentiality 
agreement and the MOU?  Let us start with confidentiality 
agreement. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   So as it is reflecting in clause 3 of 
the 
confidentiality 
agreement 
it 
was 
discussions 
and 
information to be exchanged that relates to the exploration 
of possible future collaboration between the parties to 
20 
exploit  the complementary capabilities there is between 
the parties. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And then there is a reference 
to patent rights in clause 9 on page 168. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 148 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then if we go back to page 166, 
above clause 1 in the preamble it refers to the parties and 
the addresses and so forth and then on the fifth line in the 
top paragraph that they desire – the parties desire to 
protect certain proprietary or confidential information which 
may be disclosed or exchanged between them both prior to 
and during the term of this agreement. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So was the purpose of this 
agreement?  If we are going to do business together this 
10 
agreement is going to ensure that VR Laser keeps 
confidential what we entrust to them in confidence. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now if we can turn to the 
MOU, 
the 
memorandum 
of 
understanding, 
page 
172.  
Perhaps the easiest point by way of the overall objective is 
page 172 in the preamble.  It refers to Denel and VR Laser 
and then it says:  Whereas.  Do you have that? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes I do. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  “Whereas DVS has as its main  
20 
capability 
the 
development, 
manufacture 
and 
refurbishment of landmine protected and armoured 
vehicles, which vehicles are sold to the local and 
international 
market, 
whereas 
VRL 
is 
a 
local 
supplier of armoured steel and has experience in 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 149 of 310 
 
the fabrication of armoured capsules inclusive of 
laser cutting and welding.  VRL is an existing 
supplier of DVS, performs laser cutting and the 
supply of armoured steel under subcontract of DVS.  
Both 
parties 
realise 
that 
its 
capabilities 
are 
complementary to each other and requires further 
investigation 
into 
possible 
collaboration 
to 
the 
mutual benefit of both the parties.” 
Right.  So this was a memorandum of understanding, as 
you have it, nonbinding, it was really, as I understand it, 
10 
and correct me if I am wrong, it was really a framework for 
the parties to agree to as a concept to move forward then 
to negotiate a binding agreement.  Is that right? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And it would be an agreement that 
ultimately would give business from DVS to VRL for VRL to 
provide specialist laser cutting and other requirements for 
armoured steel relating to armoured vehicles. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   I think at this stage that we entered 
into this agreement it was not the intention of the business 
20 
to give some of the DVS business to VR Laser at that 
stage. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   We entered into this agreement to 
see if there is something that is not part of our core 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 150 of 310 
 
capability that we can give to them but we will need to 
have discussions with them to figure out what is there that 
we can give to them.  It was never from the beginning the 
intention that we will give our main work to VR Laser. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And then if I can refer you to 
clause 2 on the next page, 173.  That sets out the general 
intention. 
“The intention of the parties is to explore the 
feasibility to strategically collaborate and develop 
their relationship relating to future opportunities 
10 
and 
the 
contracting 
models 
relating 
to 
such 
opportunity 
exploitation. 
 
The 
parties 
have 
identified 
the 
following 
as 
possible 
areas 
for 
collaboration noting that this is not an exhaustive 
list. 
(a) 
The 
possible 
future 
local 
manufacture 
of 
specialised steel structures in the RSA. 
(b) 
The supply of steel products by VRL to DVS on 
a preferential basis, and  
(c) 
The 
future 
optimal 
fabrication 
of 
armour 
20 
vehicle hulls.” 
That was really  - we are going to now explore the way 
forward to see whether we can do business with each.  Is 
that a fair reflection of what …[intervenes] 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is a fair reflection. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 151 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And even the items in (a), (b) 
and (c) showed the sort of business that was going to be 
explored but it was not an exhaustive list, as you put it. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay, thank you.  Now if I can take 
you back to page 154.  You refer to – you deal in 
paragraph 3.7, page 154, paragraph 3.7, you say: 
“Following the execution of the agreement on 2 
November it became apparent that Mr Ntshepe was 
not satisfied with the contents.” 
10 
Just explain to the Chair please what the issue was. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   We understood that Mr Ntshepe 
contacted Mr Steyn and said to him that this is not the 
instructions that was given, what we have entered into is 
nonbinding agreement without agreed work share and this 
is not what was requested.  It is requested that we entered 
into a binding agreement guaranteeing that there will be 
some work going to VR Laser. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, who was saying that? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   As I understood it, it was – this was 
20 
communicated to us by Mr Steyn, which was the CEO of 
DVS, who was my boss and he was conveying it to his 
executive team being the information or being told by his 
boss, Mr Ntshepe, that this is not – this agreement is not 
what they want. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 152 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you have any impression as to 
whether, whoever came up with the idea to put up this 
nonbinding agreement, was actually trying to avoid getting 
into a legal binding agreement because he or she could 
see that there could be trouble here? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Well, as the executive team we all 
knew about it and this was with Mr Wessels, it was our 
plan, we are going to kick the ball into the future, we are 
going to do an agreement, it is not going to be binding and 
we will see what it is that we can do, we have got the 
10 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
You 
could 
say 
you 
did 
sign 
an 
agreement. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   …the powers to be from our backs 
and we are going to go forward with our business as usual, 
it did not work. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you could always say to Mr Ntshepe 
you did sign an agreement. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   We did say to him we signed an 
agreement.  He received the agreement, as far as I recall, 
20 
and then a day or two later …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   This is not what I wanted. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   No, he was angry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You and your team were caught out. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   We were cheeky that way. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 153 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  But just so that I 
understand fully.  Was the intention never to take the 
matter forward from the executive point of view as far as 
you understood with the MOU or was it a genuine intention 
to negotiate further with VR Laser once the MOU was 
signed? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   We did not really understand what it 
is that we need to contract with them for. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
10 
MS GELDENHUYS:   I mean, it was uncomprehendable 
[sic], we have got our business, now we are asked to enter 
into agreement with another business and – but for what?  
I mean, it was – so you will see throughout my affidavit 
there is various actions we took and brainstorming we did 
and feedback, that we kept on getting and say but this 
cannot work and this is why it cannot work.   
So we were told enter into agreement and we 
entered into agreement.  It was not binding and – but let us 
see if there is something that we can do that is not giving 
20 
away our core capabilities and our main business.   
And yes, there was a real intention to see if there is 
on the side something that we can give to them but the 
intention was never to give our core capability or our core 
business to them. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 154 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And did you contemplate that if at all 
possible you wanted to postpone for as long as possible 
the day when you might have to make – to tell them but we 
have a problem with this? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is exactly the way the contract is 
structured.  You will – and I might be jumping now into the 
– what you will lead me to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   So what we did is we first entered 
into a nonbinding agreement and then it was said no, 
10 
better you go for a binding agreement.  There was various 
– and we will most probably go through it, iterations how it 
ended up, what the binding agreement looked like. 
 
But there is a little rider that we put into the 
agreement where we kept on – where we were saying okay, 
we will do that but on condition that we need to look at a 
couple of things.  
 And in our mind if we get there one day, we will 
fight the fight again, that it will not make sense for us, as a 
business, to give our work to VR Laser. 
20 
 
So 
as 
the 
executive 
team 
under 
Mr 
Steyn’s 
leadership we felt that we were keeping our backdoor open 
a little bit although we are not upsetting our leadership in 
the Denel Group too much. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 155 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So you were trying not to upset the 
leadership, the Acting Group CEO in particular at that time, 
but you – but am I right in understanding you were saying 
you are saying felt uncomfortable from the beginning? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   We were extremely uncomfortable. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  One thing I omitted to take 
you to and I apologise for this, Chair, is that when we refer 
again to page 175, the signature page of the MOU, your 
affidavit refers to the signature having happened at the 
offices of DVS when the representatives of VR Laser were 
10 
present. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Were you yourself present when this 
was signed? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   I was not present in the meeting but 
the meeting took place in Mr Steyn’s office which is 
directly opposite my office and it is glass offices, so I 
could see the meeting happening although I was not in the 
meeting. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now you are aware who actually 
20 
attended for VR Laser, it seems to be signed by Mr van der 
Merwe. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But your affidavit refers also to a 
person being present known as Kamal Singala? 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 156 of 310 
 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  How would you know if he was 
present if you weren’t there? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Like I said my office is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, she said it is a window, she could 
see. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   ... it is over ja, and Mr Steyn giving – 
this instruction came to entering into an agreement like in 
the day before, they were in his office while I was sitting 
across the aisle drafting and finalising it, so he would walk 
10 
in and out in my office to find out how far am I with the 
agreement already, and I know they were in there, I might 
have walked in there ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But what – sorry to interrupt – what I 
am interested in is how do you know that – you knew some 
people were there, and you knew what they were there and 
how did you know it was Mr Singhala did Mr Steyn tell you 
or were you introduced to 
Mr Singhala or 
did you 
see…[intervenes]. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   I think I was cc’d on the invitation, 
20 
the business invitation, the outlook, and that says Singhala 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Fine thank you and then your 
affidavit refers to a Rumour Mill informs you – you found 
out through the rumour mill that Mr Singhala, in fact has a 
fuller name, it’s Kamal Singhala Gupta. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 157 of 310 
 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes, only later on. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay, alright, now you’ve mentioned 
that Mr Ntshepe was unhappy, you deal with that in 3.7 and 
one of the points that he was unhappy with was that it was 
an non-binding agreement, it was not yet a binding 
agreement and there’s reference also, to his complain that 
– about a single source supplier.  What did you understand 
Mr Ntshepe’s requirements to be? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   I want to come back to my evidence 
earlier on, we were quite new in the Denel stable so the 
10 
PMFA and the PPPMA – we weren’t accustomed to it yet. 
So, at that stage, when the words, single source supplier 
was used in our environment it was just exactly the same 
what the layman will say, single source supplier.  So, it 
was not linked back exactly to how we would from, a supply 
chain perspective from the state-owned entity look at a 
single source supplier.  So, to us it is team with these 
people and you can have a type of exclusive agreement 
with them to work with them. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, so you will procure something 
20 
exclusively from VR Laser? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   What would that something be, that 
you understood Mr Ntshepe desired? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   We still did not know at that stage.  
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 158 of 310 
 
So, it only, later on panned out that they were talking about 
that they want us to do all our hull manufacturing at VR 
Laser. So, throughout this period that we were entering 
into 
new 
agreement 
or 
entering 
and 
discussing 
agreements, it came out that they are talking about hull 
manufacturing at VR Laser. Although we started off, let’s 
see what there is that’s not part of our core capability that 
we can give to VR Laser. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, now your affidavit then goes 
on to talk of email and other communications involving 
10 
yourself and Mr Steyn and Mr Steyn with Mr Ntshepe, is 
that right? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That’s correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And Mr Wessels was also involved at 
a certain stage, we’ll get to that in a moment but what did 
management feel – what did you at the Executive level of 
DLS feel once it was clear that what Mr Ntshepe wanted 
was, firstly – immediately rather than through a MOU and 
some negotiation and exploring the way forward, rather go 
straight for an actual binding agreement, secondly that it 
20 
be a sole supplier, single supplier and thirdly, that what 
needed to be supplied included construction of hulls? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   I just want to correct you, it’s DVS 
not DLS. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I beg your pardon. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 159 of 310 
 
MS GELDENHUYS:   No, it’s fine.  So, we were, at this 
stage being told that there is already agreement that was 
entered by DLS with VR Laser and that they would suggest 
then that we mirror the type of agreement that DLS has 
entered into with VR Laser.  So, there was then stages 
where they said, well let’s combine DVS and DVS become 
a party of the DLS and VR Laser agreement.  That posed 
various issues in terms of the amendment of the agreement 
because it’s – DVS is not a division of Denel, it’s a 
separate legal entity and then it was decided, well the best 
10 
and the fastest route for us to go is to enter into a similar 
agreement that DLS had with VR Laser. Yet again, that’s 
where we did a little bit of changing, sort of giving 
ourselves the opportunity to get out of this agreement 
should we – the business case mean that we are not bound 
by this agreement. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But your position seems to have been 
clear that your position at DVS, that you had no need to go 
into any agreement with VR Laser, you were fine. 
20 
MS GELDENHUYS:  That’s correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now, your affidavit refers, at the top 
of page 155 to DVS having the necessary fabrication 
capacity and that it was required to run pre-production 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 160 of 310 
 
pilot fabrication to industrialised hulls for specific vehicles.  
So, what Mr Ntshepe asked you or instructing you to do to 
move from a non-binding agreement about talking about 
the future is something that is binding which would include 
fabrication of hulls.  Was this something that could be done 
in-house by DVS itself? 
MS 
GELDENHUYS: 
 
 Absolutely 
that 
was 
our 
core 
capability. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It was your core capability? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Absolutely. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, and then you refer to Mr Steyn 
in 3.10 informing you about a meeting earlier that day 
where the strategic intent of the Denel Landward Business 
was conveyed to VR Laser and it was explained that a 
signature would follow after the approval of the Board.  
What does this relate to, the Landward Business Strategic 
Intent? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   After we have been acquired – the 
DVS business by Denel there was a lot of talk, let me 
rather say, after the – if I recall correctly, after the 
20 
suspension of Mr Saloogee there was a lot of talk that the 
Landward business will consolidate, which will mean that it 
will be the LS, DVS and LMT that we will consolidate but 
there wasn’t a proper manner in which we were going to do 
it and there wasn’t a real direction what the type of legal 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 161 of 310 
 
entity would be, it was just this cluster that will have a 
joint vision and this is then talking to the cluster being 
those three – or two divisions and our business’ joint vision 
as it is envisaged by the DCO teams. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, so are you saying this, and 
correct me if my understanding is wrong, within Denel, you 
had various entities that included LMT that was controlled 
by Denel with a 51% shareholding, you had DVS that was a 
company on its own but fully owned and controlled by 
Denel. 
10 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That’s correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   LMT had certain core business of its 
own, you had core business of your own which had 
previously been conducted when it was owned by BAE, 
correct? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That’s correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It had now been brought within the 
Denel Group, you had capacity and what was now being 
intended in terms of the Landward Business Strategy, was 
to try and enhance the in-house capability for such 
20 
products.  That you would work together and maybe, 
ultimately, restructure. So, the focus was to carry on your 
respective core businesses in a coordinated in-house way, 
is that correct? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That’s correct. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 162 of 310 
 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
 
Right, 
now, 
the 
proposal…[intervenes]. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   I just want to add here, this was very 
early stages, very high level.  The detail was never flushed 
out, so it was very much blue sky statements that was 
being made. Definitely for us in the business unit, there 
was no tangible plans at that stage, understanding how it 
will work, how it will flush out into the day-to-day of the 
businesses. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I understand, so it was, at that stage 
10 
just a broad strategic vision? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right and did you understand that, 
that broad strategic vision is what had been decided on at 
the Executive level even above you? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Absolutely. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   At Board level of the Group? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Absolutely. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, and…[intervenes]. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Board, Executive level at the Group, 
20 
I’m not sure where. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, so although you hadn’t got 
into the nuts and bolts of how this was going to be 
realised, this vision, that was where the Group wanted to 
move? 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 163 of 310 
 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That’s correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now, how did you find that the 
instruction from Mr Ntshepe at the level of Group CEO or 
acting Group CEO, that now some of your core business 
should be contracted out on a sole supplier basis to VR 
Laser? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   It did not make sense to us. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, now your affidavit in 3.10 at 
page 155 refers to Mr Steyn giving you feedback on a 
meeting that he seems to have had with – that day with VR 
10 
Laser Services where he was trying to explain to them, VR 
Laser, that this approach had to be subject to the 
Landward Business Strategy.  Do you understand why he 
was explaining that to VR Laser because they’re outside 
the Group, isn’t it an issue that he should have had with Mr 
Ntshepe? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   I think at that stage, and I don’t want 
to put words into Mr Steyn’s mouth, I think he was very 
much aware that, through the VR Laser channel it – there 
is feedback into the Executive level in Denel.  What I was 
20 
referring to in this paragraph is – and it’s supported by the 
emails that I attached hereto, is where Mr Steyn explained 
to Mr van der Merwe that we cannot just enter into an 
agreement and say, okay we’re going to give you some of 
the work, we are a business, we’ve got an integrated 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 164 of 310 
 
business plan that we’ve prepared for a five-year period 
where we committed that we will give a certain return to 
our shareholder.  If it is that we need to change and take 
some of our core capability and our core work out of our 
business plan then we will have to change our business 
plan and go back to the Denel Board who is the authority 
that approves our business plan, they then need to see 
what is the impact of us taking out our business, out of our 
own business plan and they need to authorise it. So, this is 
the reason why we kept on – or they kept on referring, it 
10 
needs to be approved by the Board because the Board 
needs to see the impact, financially, what it will mean to 
the DVS business if we take the business that rightfully 
belongs then to DVS and we place it on VR Laser. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now did Mr Steyn or van der Merwe, who 
was the CEO of DVS? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Mr Steyn. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Steyn, did he ever tell you or his 
team that he had confronted Mr Ntshepe and say, but I 
don’t understand what you are asking us to do, tell me 
20 
what I – I don’t understand the logic, why do we need to 
give some business to these people and if he said he did, 
what answer was he given because from what you have 
said, it’s clear you and the team at DVS which must include 
Mr Steyn, didn’t see the need for DVS to give some 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 165 of 310 
 
business to VR Laser but did he confront him and say, give 
me a rational reason, I don’t understand why you want us 
to do this and did he give him any reason? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   I cannot answer that question, what I 
can answer is that, continuously, Mr Steyn, through 
correspondence which is added to my affidavit and from 
our business we continuously conveyed to DCO and Mr 
Ntshepe why this cannot work.  So, we reiterated why it 
cannot work, I do not bear knowledge whether he asked, 
why must we do this. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no my question was whether Mr 
Steyn 
ever 
reported 
to 
you 
that 
he 
had 
asked 
Mr 
Ntshepe…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You don’t recall? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But from what you are saying, are you 
suggesting that there were meetings between yourselves 
from DVS or some of you, with Mr Ntshepe, maybe other 
people, where you did tell him this or…[intervenes]. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Where we did tell him this cannot 
20 
work for our business? 
CHAIRPERSON:   In a meeting. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   I do believe, not where I was present 
but I do believe, if I look at the correspondence which I 
was copied in to, it does look like there have been 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 166 of 310 
 
meetings where Mr Steyn was present and some of them 
where Mr Wessels was also present wherein they explained 
or tried to explain to Mr Ntshepe why this cannot work and 
does not work for our business. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And there is no indication that he had an 
answer for them, a proper answer. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Not to my knowledge. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you Chair.  On this point may I 
take you to an email that – as you point out is referred to 
10 
in your affidavit, can I take you please to page 185. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   I’ve got it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It’s referred to as Annexure CG4.1, I 
see in your affidavit you refer to CG4 but is this the CG4 
that you’re referring to…[intervenes]. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That’s correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Correct, thank you.  Now this is an 
email – let’s leave aside the top section because it seems 
to be forwarded at a later stage but the actual email starts 
about a third of the way down, do you see under in bold 
20 
print 13 November, then there’s a little table which shows 
the subject of the person who’s sending it and date and so 
forth, the usual email heading? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And that is sent from Johan Steyn, 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 167 of 310 
 
that’s your CEO of DVS. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That’s correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And it’s addressed to Piet Kruger. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Who was he? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   He was the – he was from DVS and 
he was the Operational Executive. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay and then it refers to yourself, is 
that right, Colette Geldenhuys? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That’s correct. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Percy Indaba also a DVS colleague? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Also, a DVS colleague, he was, at 
that stage, I believe the General Manager of Gear Ratio 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay, and then, is it, RP du Plessis, 
was copied in? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That’s correct, he was the Director of 
Programmes and IT at DVS. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   At DVS? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So, he was on the DVS Board? 
20 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Executive team, so both Kruger, 
myself, Indaba and du Plessis was part of the DVS 
Executive team. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay, then it’s also copied to Johan 
Wessels. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 168 of 310 
 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That’s correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   He was the Group COO, at the time, 
is that correct? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That’s correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So, he wasn’t working within DVS, he 
was above that at head office. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That’s correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   At Group level reporting to Mr 
Ntshepe? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That’s correct. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right and then who’s the other 
person, Odwa Mhlwana? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Odwa Mhlwana, Obo was at that 
stage the acting CEO of Denel after Mr Saloogee and 
Ntlontslo …[? 17.58] were suspended.  I need to say that 
Odwa came with us from BAE Systems. So, there was a 
close, at this stage, a very close relationship between us 
because it was one of our colleagues that was now pulled 
up to head office. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So, although, he was a bit distant 
20 
now in a sense that he was elsewhere within the Group, no 
longer in the DVS…[intervenes]. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That’s Correct. 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
 You 
still 
had 
that 
historical 
connection? 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 169 of 310 
 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That’s correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, now this appears to be a 
report back from Mr Steyn about a meeting. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That’s correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   He refers – he says, 
“Apologies for the lengthy email, I got stuck on the 
RG21 on my way back to the office from DCO.  Due 
to the urgency of the matter this cannot wait until 
Monday”, 
 
So as far as you, as an Executive team, within DVS 
10 
were concerned, was this viewed as something significant 
and important? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes, it was. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Then he says, 
 
“Following Zwelakhe’s [?] request two weeks ago”, 
 
Is that Zwelakhe Ntshepe? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That’s correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, 
“To formalise an agreement with VRL for the 
fabrication 
of 
our 
hulls 
in 
future, 
several 
20 
interactions take place between DVS and VRL to 
start 
the 
process. 
 
Evaluate 
VRL’s 
capability.  
Looking 
into 
the 
negative 
effect 
of 
such 
an 
agreement on our fabrication workshops, recoveries 
etcetera, I had a follow-on meeting with Zwelakhe, 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 170 of 310 
 
Jan and Odwa yesterday on the progress and next 
steps”. 
 
He seems to be saying, we received this instruction, 
we’re trying to deal with it and take it forward, one of the 
things we have to look at is the negative effect that such 
an agreement would have on our business. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That’s correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Did you understand there to be some 
interaction between Mr Steyn, who was the head of the 
Executive of DVS with his superiors at head office? 
10 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Acting Group CEO, Group COO and 
CFO? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That’s correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right and then he says, 
“Attached, a few slides originally drafted by Jan, 
updated 
following 
the 
meeting 
yesterday 
to 
illustrate 
our 
intent 
and 
clarifying 
current 
opportunities for VRL. Zwelakhe asked that Jan and 
I meet with VRL today and share this with them, 
20 
Pieter van der Merwe, the CEO”. 
That’s VR Laser ’s CEO, is that right? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That’s correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Then he says, 
“At our meeting, Jan and I explained that DVS has a 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 171 of 310 
 
fabrication capability”, 
 
Now is that confirming what you said earlier, you 
could make these things in-house? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Absolutely. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   “And that we are required to run pre- 
production pilot fabrication to industrialise hulls of 
specific 
vehicles. 
Pre-production 
quantities 
can 
vary depending on customer requirements etcetera.  
Then the next line, in the end we agreed that a 
more appropriate way to approach an agreement is 
10 
to use the DLS/VRL agreement”, 
 
That’s the DLS, that’s your sister entity – well 
you’re a separate company but DLS was an operating 
division of Denel itself. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That’s correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And so the agreement reached, it 
seems, between Mr Steyn, Mr Wessels and Mr Ntslontlo  
with VR Laser is that, to accommodate the concern about 
the giving of business to VR Laser, despite the fact that 
DVS had an in-house capacity was to follow, as an 
20 
example, another agreement which had already been 
entered into by DLS with VRL? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That’s correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And that would be to – yes, ending 
up with a Denel Landwards VRL agreement excluding LMT. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 172 of 310 
 
“Jan’s request is that we draft the appropriate 
clauses, 
principles 
and 
potentially 
amend 
the 
DLS/VRL agreement, incorporate the DVS part and 
finalise it by next week Friday, Pieter will forward 
the version”, 
 
And then there’s discussion about Jan explaining 
how it would be done by way of Denel Board of approval on 
the 7 t h of December then he says, 
“This is the background leading up to what needs to 
be done now. 1. Finalise the detail of fabrication 
10 
workload over the budget period, five years, based 
on our current budget, Percy will complete this.  2.  
Calculate the negative effect on recoveries”, 
 
Now what are the recoveries that are referred to 
there? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   So, we’ve got a baseline for the 
amount of people that we’ve got and we have to sell a 
certain amount of vehicles or product, whatever it is to 
cover the amount of people and the overhead cost that 
we’ve got. So, if we don’t sell enough, we have got under 
20 
recoveries or we’ve got over recoveries. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay, and then 3, at the top of page 
186 is, 
“The next step is to draft the additional clauses 
required to cover DVS’s part in the current DLS/VRL 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 173 of 310 
 
agreement to include the principles and outline very 
high 
level 
on 
the 
last 
slide, 
herewith 
some 
guidance”, 
 
So, he’s giving you some pointers as to what you 
should do in drafting the clauses based on the DLS 
agreement with VR Laser, is that right? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That’s correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And one of them is in, 
“a) Other than in the DLS case the preamble should 
include the fact that DVS has a world class 
10 
fabrication facility capability.  DVS requires a high 
quality 
hull 
fabrication 
supply 
department 
to 
manufacture hulls for production that meets the 
requirements of Government’s Black Industrialist 
Programme initiated by DTI and in our opinion VRL 
meets such requirements”, 
 
Now that seems to raise two issues.  The one is 
that mention would be made that DVS has its own 
capability but now needs somebody that is a top-class 
supplier of particular items. Now, had your view changed or 
20 
were you persuaded that DVS couldn’t provide all of this 
in-house? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   No, at that stage there was – and this 
is exactly what he referred to, a white paper, if I recall 
correctly, about Black Industrialist Programme that the 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 174 of 310 
 
Government wished to roll out and it was then decided that 
we will use this Black Industrialist Programme at least as 
some sort of justification why we are entering into this 
agreement because we can’t just follow the DLS agreement 
because they say in their view they don’t have the 
capability to do it.  We’ve got the capability, we have to 
state that we’ve got the capability but now you have to 
rationalise, if you’ve got the capability, why is it that you 
need to outsource it and this is the best and the close to 
getting to somewhere wherein you look then at the Black 
10 
Industrialist Programme.  I have to say I know there were 
talks about it, I can’t recall the detail of the programme so 
unfortunately, I can’t comment further on the programme. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You must have been in a difficult 
position at DVS? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   We were in an extremely difficult 
position. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because it seems to me that you could 
see that there was something untoward into this whole 
thing.  You had discomfort associating yourselves with it, 
20 
you had discomfort being party to any agreement that 
would give VR Laser some business in these circumstances 
where you were satisfied you had all the capacity to do the 
work that you were doing but at the same time you seem to 
have had some pressure and you had to try and walk quite 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 175 of 310 
 
a tight rope between having to incur the wrath of your top 
leaders and – or lose your business, your core business, 
you had to try and say, how do we strike a balance and 
still, not do what seems to us to be wrong but at the same 
time, still be there or not lose, does that reflect, more or 
less what you think your situation was? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   It was definitely what our situation 
was in – hindsight is always a perfect science but when we 
were in the happenings, I think the business rationale for 
this does not make sense for us.  We are an old business, 
10 
we know what we do, we’ve shown profits, we are good on 
what we are doing. It does not make business sense for us 
to give our business away to anybody else.  That was a 
bigger drive for us than whether it was VR Laser, whether 
it was for DLS, whether it was LMT, the drive for us is, why 
must we give our business away. So, at that stage the big 
– the red flags was definitely on our level, not what we 
know now it was more, why do we – business principles, 
this does not make sense. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes, 
so 
it 
was 
based 
on 
your 
20 
assessment of your business? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To say we don’t need to do that but 
obviously if somebody keeps on saying do it and you can’t 
understand why, your thoughts have got to start wondering. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 176 of 310 
 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you Chair.  Ms Geldenhuys so 
this email correspondence that we’ve just looked at wasn’t 
copied into Mr Ntshepe, according to the email address list 
but it was copied into Mr Wessels as COO, Group COO. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That’s correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And he reported to Mr Ntshepe, then 
acting Group CEO. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes, so both Mr Wessels, Mr Mhlwana 
10 
and Mr Steyn reported to…[intervenes]. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Mr Mhlwana as well? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   At Group head office level? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, now just – the slide 
presentation that he’s referred to in the email, is that the 
set of three slides that we see, or four slides that we see. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And what did this – did this depict what 
20 
the objective was for this landward – landward objective to 
incorporate the VR Laser that they had in mind 
MS GELDENHUYS:  According to Mr Steyn yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  So this was very high level it was not on 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 177 of 310 
 
the executive level of the business discussed or – it was for 
information for us. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now to the extent that an email 
earlier suggested that if you followed the V – sorry the DLS 
single source supply – single supply agreement with VR 
Laser that that might somehow bring it within the landward 
strategic objective of Denel to try and keep things in-house.  
In your view would it – was that possible – was that 
feasible? 
MS GELDENHUYS:  Just repeat the question please. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Just – sorry I am – I was not very clear.  
You gave evidence earlier about this landward strategic 
policy. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  That Denel board had already adopted.  
They brought in what was previously owned by BAE. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But then became DVS your company. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  They already had a – their own 
20 
capacity and other divisions as well. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And they had bought a majority 
controlling share in LMT. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  That is correct. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 178 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And all of your entities and businesses 
had certain core capabilities. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And capacities and in your case that 
included as part of your core business the ability to 
manufacture hulls of armoured vehicles. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Correct. And you said earlier the 
strategic objective was to try and enhance the in-house 
capability. 
10 
MS GELDENHUYS:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  I – I also just want to say the – the 
direction or the strategic intent it changed quite often. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  So – so I would not know at this stage 
what it was; where it was. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  Whether it was let us consolidate and 
be one company and we bring you in and we divisionalised 
20 
you whether you going to stay on your own but we just going 
to manage. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  Whether it was very fluid. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes you testified earlier that how it 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 179 of 310 
 
would be achieved would be something that would still 
developed. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But at this stage were you under at 
least the understanding that that broad objective was still in 
place? 
MS GELDENHUYS:  Yes it was. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  But there was also an understanding 
that there was a strategic agreement that was being entered 
10 
into a VR Laser. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MS GELDENHUYS: For what I do not know. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I am really just asking… 
MS GELDENHUYS:  For the bigger – for the bigger part of 
the business. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  yes. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  I mean we knew we did not understand 
for our part of the business why we need to do it so the 
rationale why it was there for the bigger part of the business 
20 
was they have shared with us. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  But that – what I am suggesting 
to you and just ask you to comment on one way of looking at 
it perhaps is that if you have an objective that  tries to keep 
in-house it does not make sense to go out of the Denel’s 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 180 of 310 
 
divisions and companies. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  No. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Including DVS to now start getting 
some of your core business done by VR Laser. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  No it does not. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Is – do you share that concern? 
MS GELDENHUYS:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Or do I express – do I summarise what 
your concern was? 
MS GELDENHUYS:  It is 100% correct because if we would 
10 
have done that it would have meant that DVS would have 
ended up in a systems house and not with the manufacturing 
capability and that was not what our main business was.  
Our main business was physically manufacturing. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay.  May I ask you then please Mr 
Geldenhuys to turn to page 191. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  The email half way down seems to be 
an email from the 13 November 2015.  And it appears to 
come from – is it from Mr Steyn to Mr – from Mr Steyn yes? 
20 
Is that right? 
MS GELDENHUYS:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And it seems to be addressed in 
confidence to Jan that Wessels and Odwa that is Mr 
Mhlontlo. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 181 of 310 
 
MS GELDENHUYS:  No Mhlwana. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I beg your pardon Mhlwana yes. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you.  I beg your pardon.  And 
then Mr – I do not want to go through all of this but you have 
mentioned this in your affidavit as being an email that Mr 
Steyn shared with you to show that he had expressed 
concerns with Mr Wessels and Mr Mhlwana, is that right? 
MS GELDENHUYS:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay.  And then if we look at the top 
10 
email that is from Jan Wessels back to Mr Steyn again their 
colleague – or Mr Wessels’ colleague Mr Mhlwana was 
copied in and it is headed Pitfalls and concerns fabrication 
outsourcing to be VRL.  And then he says: 
“Refer my email response to your earlier 
wider email that is the best response – 
approach I can advise.  Present sober and 
professional delta business impact plus and 
minus of such potential scenario to board 7 
December that is why no decision can be 
20 
finalised before that point when shareholder 
made his choice.  Important to quantify every 
parameter fairly and objectively, the plusses 
and the minus deltas and doing so not to be 
seen against change in principle though.” 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 182 of 310 
 
Now what did you under – if I may just mention Mr Wessels 
himself has been providing evidence to the commission but I 
just want to ask you from your discussions with Mr Steyn and 
your colleagues in executive management at DVS what did 
you understand was happening between Mr Steyn and Mr 
Wessels? 
MS GELDENHUYS:  So… 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Was Mr Steyn raising concerns along 
the lines that you have raised with the Chairperson today? 
MS GELDENHUYS:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  With his colleague who was his 
superior in the group Mr Wessels. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And his colleague also his superior Mr 
Mhlantla. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  Mhlwana. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Ms Mhlwana I beg your pardon. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I do beg your pardon. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  That is correct and then the – the 
20 
coming back yet again we were new in the groups so Mr Jan 
Wessels was the COO. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  So Mr Steyn at that stage leaned quite 
on him because it was guiding into the group. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 183 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Ja. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  As the COO I mean with him as well. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  And Johan kept raising the concerns 
that we have got.  We have drafted lists; we have 
calculations; we showed what our concerns is and then Jan I 
do believe that he tried as well to convince Mr Ntshepe that 
this is not the right and you will see it from the emails that 
this is not the same scenario as the VR – DLS scenario 
because they do not have capacity or capability to do hull 
10 
manufacturing and that it cannot be seen as exactly the 
same that Mr Wessels eventually said well the best thing 
that you can do now is the board needs to decide.  You will 
have to tell the board what is the impact of this agreement.  
If you enter into this type agreement what is the impact?  
You will show it in your business case and your business 
plan for the next five years on the board meeting that was 
scheduled for the 7 December and then the board needs to 
decide what is it that they want to do.  Does the board want 
you to enter into an agreement like this or not? 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  This is what I understand from this 
email. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay.  Thank you.  And then I would 
like to refer again to the email from Johan Steyn to Mr 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 184 of 310 
 
Wessels and Mr Mhlwana at the foot of this page 191.  We 
dealt with that but what I am interested in is the following 
page immediately after the heading or the conclusion 
regards Johan.  There is a heading Fabrication outsourcing 
considerations in my copy I assume that everybody has the 
same copy – colour it is in brown, light brown or tan.  And 
there are 15/16 points that are considerations relating to the 
outsourcing of fabrication.  Who do you understand these to 
be considerations – who do you understand to be the person 
listing these considerations? 
10 
MS GELDENHUYS:  So… 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Was that Mr Steyn or who? 
MS GELDENHUYS:  So how this list came about was Mr 
Steyn requested myself, Abrie Du Plessis, Piet Kruger and 
Percy Ndaba to brainstorm if we go through this agreement 
what the impact would be on our business.  And this was – 
we had off site strategic session and we just in 10/15 
minutes compiled this list to indicate what we see as the 
executive team or a core part of the executive team why this 
agreement would be problematic.  And you will then see in 
20 
the email on the previous page where he then actually 
informed Mr Wessels and Mr Mhlwana that this agreement 
was drafted by his team and there was no influence from his 
side.  I think it – at this stage it must be said that Mr Steyn 
was now obviously at this stage seen in the group as being 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 185 of 310 
 
blocking all the agreements because he just did not – he 
kept on coming back and saying no this cannot happen, this 
cannot happen.  So it was seen or it was – he was seen and 
most probably then the executive team have – of DVS was 
seen as being a – a little rock in somebody’s shoes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay if we can look at – as you point 
out the email itself refers to what you have said about him 
not giving the input it was from a collective team effort.  I am 
back at page 191.  Email at the bottom and the first sentence 
– first paragraph: 
10 
“At our exec team off site early this week I 
asked Abrie, Piet, Percy and Carene – 
Carene that is yourself, correct?” 
MS GELDENHUYS:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   
“To form a small team and brainstorm all the 
issues/angles 
concerns 
with 
respect 
to 
outsourcing our fabrication work.  Below an 
unedited version of the list I have received 
an hour ago.  We will use this list to ensure 
20 
we cover most of the potential pitfalls in the 
agreement with VRL.  Most notably of it all is 
the general view not influenced by me that 
this would not be the right thing to do.” 
Right thing to do from whose perspective? 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 186 of 310 
 
MS GELDENHUYS:  From DVS’s perspective. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  From DVS’s perspective and then he 
puts in brackets items 1 and – item 1 and 2 and then he puts 
four explanation – exclamation marks I beg your pardon.  
Then if we go to look at items 1 and 2 on your list at page 
192.  The first two items are: 
“DVS will lose a core competency a real 
competitor will be created.” 
Was this is a serious concern on your part and your 
colleagues part? 
10 
MS GELDENHUYS:  Absolutely. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  And then 3  
“The outsourcing of all fabrication will rob 
DVS of the opportunity to develop fabrication 
QSE’s 
and 
EME’s 
for 
a 
purpose 
of 
empowerment.” 
What is QSE’s and EME’s? 
MS GELDENHUYS:  It is micro enterprises and qualified 
enterprises.  It is part of the – the BBBEE score card and 
how you develop. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  The industry. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  As well as previous disadvantaged 
individuals. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 187 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  What about the possible counter 
argument that well if you giving it to VR Laser if they have 
black empowerment credentials are you not achieving the 
same thing? 
MS GELDENHUYS:  Ja but I do not think that they were – or 
they were the qualified enterprises or the micro enterprises. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I see.  And then the fourth point.  Hull – 
I am sorry. 
“Hull fabrication is critical for protection and 
the accountability and reputational risk will 
10 
remain with DVS but the responsibility will be 
with another party.” 
Just explain that to us please? 
MS GELDENHUYS:  So when he is referring to protection.  
He is referring to landmine protection. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  So the fabrication of the hull is critical 
for landmine protection and the accountability will remain 
with us but the responsibility to ensure that there is landmine 
protection is now outsourced to another party.  So we will 
20 
take the risk but we are not 100% in control of the risk. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So you would be accountable? 
MS GELDENHUYS:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  If for example soldiers are blown up in 
a – in an unsafe armoured vehicle you would have to be 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 188 of 310 
 
accountable but you have not manufactured it.  You have got 
somebody to do it and you… 
MS GELDENHUYS:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  You leaving it to them to achieve the 
standard. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay.  Thank you.  And then – and then 
I am not going to deal with all of the other issues but I just 
want to highlight a few. 
7. Consider PFMA requirement.  That is the Public Finance 
10 
Management Act that an entity must preserve and protect its 
IP and capability. 
And then highlighted in yellow Carene to check. 
That is yourself. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  And then the other point that I 
would highlight is paragraph 10 Retrenchment or reallocation 
of current resources in fabrication must be considered.  So 
one of the various other items that you were concerned 
about is that there could be implications for having to 
20 
retrench people who were employed in fabrication in the in-
house capability if no longer were they doing the fabrication. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Do I understand you correctly? 
MS GELDENHUYS:  That is correct. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 189 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you.  Now I would like you to go 
to another chain of emails that we find immediately following 
that that is page 193 to 195.  Let us start at the email in 
November on page 194 from Jan Wessels 17 November 2015 
that is an email from Mr Wessels to Mr Ntshepe. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page is that – I heard 193? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Sorry Chair 194. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  About a third of the page down you see 
10 
from Jan Wessels sent on Tuesday November 17, 2015.  You 
with me Ms Geldenhuys? 
MS GELDENHUYS:  Yes I am. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And it appears and I am not going to go 
through this all but it appears that Mr Wessels was raising 
some of the concerns that had been raised by Mr Steyn. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And he refers to a meeting on the 13 
November which had included Mr Van Der Merwe from VRL 
and Mr Steyn and Mr Wessels himself.  And then he says – 
20 
do you see a number of bullet points? 
MS GELDENHUYS:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes in fact before we get that.  I think I 
should read into the record if I may Chair the next sentence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 190 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   
“I have to repeat again that the process and 
complexity differs from when DLS appointed 
VRL 
as 
preferred 
single 
source 
hull 
fabricator.  DLS had no in-house capability 
anyway and used a variety of outsourced 
fabricators from now with DVS with DVS 
having a strong in-house capability which 
needs to be converted in an optimal way.” 
Am I right in understanding he was raising the point that you 
10 
have gone into some detail with the Chair to say in DLS’s 
case they did not have an in-house capability so it might 
make sense to have an outside provider on a single source 
basis being VR Laser.  But you were different.  Here DVS as 
opposed to DLS had its own in-house capacity so why 
contract it out? 
MS GELDENHUYS:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Is he referring to the same point as 
yours? 
MS GELDENHUYS:  Exactly. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Alright thank you.  And then he says: 
“The following were discussed in detail on 
Friday the 13 November at the meeting.” 
And again Chair I am not going to go through everything but 
just focus on a few.  
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 191 of 310 
 
“The 
model 
of 
strategic 
cooperation 
envisaged between DVS and VRL in the 
context 
that 
DVS 
has 
a 
big 
in-house 
fabrication 
capability 
including 
people, 
facilities, infrastructure that will need to be 
migrated to VRL partially or fully when and 
agreement is reached.” 
Again it seems to be raising at least some of the points that 
you have also mentioned as problem areas that – that rang 
some alarm bells. 
10 
MS GELDENHUYS:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And then there is reference to  
“Discreet programs, practicalities, timelines 
and 
then 
the 
fifth 
bullet 
point 
is 
acknowledged by both sides that the DVS 
business plan budget for 2016/2017 plus four 
years will be affected.  DVS becomes more 
of a systems company than a manufacturer.” 
Did you understand that that was where DVS would be 
heading if it entered into this agreement with VR Laser 
20 
where a lot of your core business was now – was 
manufacturing which was now to be done by VR Laser? 
MS GELDENHUYS:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  And it says: 
“As such Denel board will have to sign off the 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 192 of 310 
 
partnership 
by 
virtue 
of 
approving 
the 
revised budget.” 
And then he refers to the way forward  
“A 
draft 
binding 
agreement 
will 
be 
constructed and then it will be referred to 
various parties etcetera.” 
Now – so – and then we get a response from Mr Ntshepe at 
the top of this page but can we start at the foot of page 193 
where we just see in the last three lines – do you see from 
Zolake Ntshepe? 
10 
MS GELDENHUYS:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Sent on the 17 November at 8:44 am to 
Mr Wessels copied in Mr Mhlwana as well as Stephan B and 
Johan Steyn and this is what he says: 
“Hi Jan your email is too long and as you 
usually say some of the issues you put on…” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry – I am sorry Mr Kennedy I have 
lost you. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  It is the top of page 194 line 3 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh the top – the top one. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So this is an email from Mr Ntshepe 
replying to the lengthy and detailed email that Mr Wessels 
had sent him raising inter alia the concerns about the impact 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 193 of 310 
 
this would have on DVS’s core business. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay.  So Mr Ntshepe comes back with 
a very brief email he says: 
“Hi Jan your email is too long and as you 
usually say some of the issues you put on 
paper can be discussed.  You forgot to 
mention that I showed you Johan Odwa and 
now a Stephan I am not sure exactly what 
that means a letter coming from the chairman 
10 
instructing me to divisionalise and optimise 
DVS and DLS and show savings whilst the 
process is being carried through.  I have 
asked Johan and Stephan to do just that 
because we were taking too long to come to 
a final conclusion on this matter.  This 
process would of course involve you as a 
third independent party.  We are required to 
present a plan for the board and I have 
asked Stephan to take the lead on this.” 
20 
Were you made aware of this response from Mr Ntshepe? 
MS GELDENHUYS:  Yes we were. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  We see that he criticises Mr Wessels 
firstly for being too long in the – in his email and secondly 
for raising issues that perhaps require rather discussion 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 194 of 310 
 
presumably not discussion by email but face to face and then 
he – the rest of his email seems to be saying he is under 
pressure from the chairperson to make structural changes 
within Denel and the matter was accordingly urgent.  Were 
you aware that – whether Mr Ntshepe and this email or 
anywhere else actually got to grips with giving a response of 
substance to the concerns that Mr Wessels had raised in his 
email concerning for example the impact on DVS’s core 
business being taken away? 
MS GELDENHUYS:  No I am not aware. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And that was one of the concerns that 
you had raised that then went to Mr Steyn, that then went to 
Mr Wessels and Mr Wessels then was conveying it by way 
his email below the one that we have just looked at. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know whether the reference to 
chairman in that email is reference to the chairman of the 
Denel board? 
MS GELDENHUYS:  It is indeed. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Corporate. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  It is indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And at that time who was that? 
MS GELDENHUYS:  Mr Mantla. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Mantsha? 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 195 of 310 
 
MS GELDENHUYS:  Mantsha yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So this is not a reference to the 
chairperson of the DVS board? 
MS GELDENHUYS:  No. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  It is a chairperson of the Denel SOC 
Limited board SOC Limited board to whom Mr Ntshepe 
reported. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  As Group CEO.  Was that your 
10 
understanding? 
MS GELDENHUYS:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you must just think it through carefully 
because there are boards for different entities and then there 
is the overall board for Denel … 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  SOC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  Yes so… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes SOC. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  So this was talking to the Denel SOC 
20 
board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the chairman of that board. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  The chairman of that board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  What I understand from this email was 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 196 of 310 
 
what happened was that Mr Ntshepe indicated that the 
chairman said DVS must be divisionalised meaning we 
cannot be a stand-alone business anymore we must be 
pulled into Denel group and not be a stand-alone company 
anymore and that real cost savings must be shown which I 
read between the lines as a subtle threat in if we need to 
show cost savings you have got two businesses, the work is 
there but the only thing that is duplicated is the executive 
teams. So some of the executives need to go that is the real 
cost saving. He also then goes further when he said and 
10 
Stephan will take the lead on this which in effect will then 
mean that Mr Steyn’s authority level is taken away from him 
and he is moving underneath Mr Stephan Burger from DLS. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right thank you.  May I then proceed to 
page 193.  That is an email – if you look at the table 
including subject and who it comes from and to whom.  It is 
an email sent on the 20 November from Johan Steyn, is that 
correct? 
MS GELDENHUYS:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  It is addressed to Mr Mhlwana, Mr 
20 
Kruger, Mr Du Plessis, yourself Ms Geldenhuys and Mr 
Ndaba and copied in Stephan Magabolo. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And what Mr Steyn says is this: 
“All 
since 
Zwelake 
surprising 
instruction 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 197 of 310 
 
given to me a few weeks ago to enter into an 
agreement with VRL we have made good 
progress.” 
Now did you understand Zwelaki to mean Mr Ntshepe and did 
you understand the instruction to mean that you must 
proceed with the single source supply agreement with VR 
Laser? 
MS GELDENHUYS:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Did he explain to you why or did you 
understand why that instruction was – came as a surprise to 
10 
Mr Steyn?  Was it the point that your raised earlier? 
MS GELDENHUYS:  Because it was not driven by our 
business. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  And then he continues we have 
made good progress with Jan Wessels’ help and oversight.  
We had several discussions with VRL and DCO about this. 
DCO meaning? 
MS GELDENHUYS:  Denel Corporate Office. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Corporate Office that is head office? 
MS GELDENHUYS:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Headed by Mr Wessels reporting to Mr 
Ntshepe? 
MS GELDENHUYS:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  The process evolved mainly 
around OMC – what is that? 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 198 of 310 
 
MS GELDENHUYS:  So it is stands for Olifant Manufacturing 
Company.  It is an old legacy name of one of the divisions of 
DVS. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I see.  So mainly around that division’s 
fabrication capability how we protect it not to increase risk in 
the business and we utilise it in the future.  And then says 
he:  
“I had a brief review of revision 3 attached to 
the draft agreement with Jan Wessels and 
Stephan Burger yesterday at DCO and both 
10 
were happy with it.  Since Zwelake instructed 
Stephan to take the lead in this see below 
email from him he, Stephan will now discuss 
and finalise this agreement with VRL.” 
Now Stephan Burger was the CEO of DLS. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  At that stage. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But the DLS already had its own single 
source supply agreement with VR Laser? 
20 
MS GELDENHUYS:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Is that correct?  You were a separate – 
in fact not only a – not a separate division in fact a separate 
company from DLS which was a division of Denel itself. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  That is correct. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 199 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Is that correct.  What did you – do you 
have any comment or feeling about why suddenly now Mr 
Stephan Burger from a separate entity is now becoming 
actively involved in negotiating and finalising the agreement 
with VR Laser? 
MS GELDENHUYS:  Mr Steyn was resisting too much and his 
executive team. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  And like I said earlier on in effect him 
and his executive team was moved one layer lower than the 
10 
authority then that sits with DLS. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay thank you.  And then it 
continues.   
“I will keep you posted if and when I get 
feedback.” 
Am I right to read or do you also read into this a measure of 
unhappiness on the part of Mr Steyn that he was not 
necessarily being kept in the loop? 
MS GELDENHUYS:  Ja I definitely read it that he will not be 
part of discussions because he is resisting too much. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Did he express that to you Mr Steyn? 
MS GELDENHUYS:  I cannot recall it was so many words. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  You cannot recall. 
MS GELDENHUYS:  But we all knew this is what is 
happening. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 200 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   
“And then my understanding is the Denel 
board approval is required before DCO can 
enter into this agreement. See Jan’s email 
below.  We – that is Jan, Odwa and I 
discussed and agreed this with Zwelake last 
week so until then and after the agreement is 
signed no – and until after the agreement is 
signed 
in 
other 
words 
no 
onward 
communication please.” 
10 
What did you understand that to be instructing you to do? 
MS GELDENHUYS:  So we have to wait for the board 
approval and let us first see if there is approval before we 
communicate within the business to the people in the 
business that there is an agreement being entered into. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And then his next paragraph reads: 
“I pointed out to Jan and Stephan yesterday 
that we are making progress with determining 
the effect of this agreement on the DVS 
business and that it will completed soon.” 
20 
And then the final paragraph I will not read out that seems to 
refer to his colleagues and superiors in relation to some of 
the financial data.   
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  I am sorry Chair.  May I 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 201 of 310 
 
just find the reference? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  I just need you to confirm.  There 
is a draft agreement at page 196.  In fact, not a draft.  This 
is a signed agreement.   
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Were you involved in the drafting of 
this agreement? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   No, this is the agreement between VR 
Laser and DLS. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   DLS? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Oh, so that was the one that was 
actually concluded.  It seems at pages 291 and 220 on the 
18t h or the 14t h and then the 18t h of December 2015.   
MS GELDENHUYS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that correct? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Just repeat again, please? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   The signature was in December.  Page 
219. 
 
The 
signatures 
happened 
on 
the 
14t h 
and 
20 
18t h of December. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But that is, as you pointed out, was the 
agreement between DLS as the ...[intervenes]  
MS GELDENHUYS:   No.  You... there... the one agreement 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 202 of 310 
 
starts on page 209. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am sorry.  I beg your pardon.   
MS GELDENHUYS:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you very much.  I do beg your 
pardon Chair.  It is actually at page 203.  It is what I was 
looking for.  Thank you very much.  Is the 19t h of May 2015.   
MS GELDENHUYS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that correct? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Ja.  So I was not part of this 
agreement. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   So this agreement starts on page 196 
which is with VR Laser and the DLS.  And I was not privy to 
this agreement.  I was given this agreement afterwards. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But you were told to use that? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   As it were, to copy ...[intervenes]  
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   ...and paste to do a similar agreement 
for ...[intervenes]  
20 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Ja, on that basis.  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then the DVS agreement is from 
page 209. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now apart from the initial 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 203 of 310 
 
drafting that you were involved in.  Were you involved in the 
finalisation of the drafting of this agreement? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes, I was. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And was that according to 
instructions from anybody? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes.  So we were then told to complete 
the agreement.  It was then given to DLS and some of the 
senior people at DLS, reviewed the agreement as well.  And 
when they said they are happy with the agreement, we then 
concluded that we are in a position for Johan Steyn to sign 
10 
the agreement. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright.  And did he in fact do that? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   I believe, if I recall correctly, that VR 
Laser signed it first. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright.  Let us just take a look at 219. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That was the reference that I confuse 
myself with earlier.  That was the 14 t h of December. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Signed by Mr Van der Merwe.  I see 
20 
there is a witness who has signed there  Geldenhuys.  Is that 
yourself? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is but I was not present at the 
signature. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I see.  And then on the following page 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 204 of 310 
 
220, it was signed in Pretoria on the 18t h of December by 
Mr Steyn. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that your signature again as a 
witness? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes, and I was present here. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You were present this time? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   How did it come about that you signed 
as a witness? 
10 
MS GELDENHUYS:   I cannot recall.  I was now shocked 
when I saw this.  [laughing] 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   [laughing]   
MS GELDENHUYS:   I do not know whether I maybe have 
signed on the wrong line.  I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And was this a binding one? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   This is a binding agreement.  Yes.  
[laughing]   
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]   
MS GELDENHUYS:   But not a binding witness.  [laughing]   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   [laughing]  And does this in fact mirror 
in substance the earlier agreement between DLS and VRL? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   In the sense that there was a 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 205 of 310 
 
commitment by the Denel entity to appoint VR Laser, 
obviously for different things to do, but it was on a single 
source supply basis. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And what was the period? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   It was for a period of ten years. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Similar to the DLS agreement, 
which was also for a period of ten years, correct? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Did you and in fact...  Yes, did 
10 
you have any view on that specific point?  Leave aside 
whether the issue of whether it was a good business 
decision to give away a lot of DVS’s core business to an 
outsider.  Did you have any views as to whether it was 
appropriate to enter into an agreement for ten years? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   I cannot say that we have given this a 
lot of thought.  At this stage, we were so... we tried 
everything ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You ...[intervenes]  
MS GELDENHUYS:   ...to enter into this agreement.  We 
20 
just... we had a couple of sentences that would give us an 
out but we stopped the fight.  We could not proceed with it 
anymore.  I mean, it ended up that, like I said earlier on, that 
the business was sort of restructured because we were 
resisting too much.   
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 206 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   So I cannot tell you that at that stage, I 
even thought about the duration of the agreement because 
this is the agreement we are going to enter into.  We will 
enter into it and we have given ourselves a caveat in certain 
circumstances, we will not proceed with this agreement and 
let us fight the fight when we get there, when we were 
supposed to place orders on VR Laser. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But this agreement, was it signed after 
you have gone to the board, Denel Board?  Because I heard 
10 
earlier on the idea that well you would have to go and tell 
the board and see what it says?  Had that happened by the 
time this agreement was signed? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   I do not know if it happened.  In the 
evidence it is that Mr Steyn asked Mr Ntshepe if it indeed 
happened, if the board gave authority for us to proceed with 
the agreement.  And then in my pack there, there is an email 
back from Mr Ntshepe that said this is approved, go ahead to 
sign the agreement.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
20 
MS GELDENHUYS:   So whether it happened in front of the 
board, whether the board ever discussed it, we bear now 
knowledge.   
CHAIRPERSON:   In terms of the emails exchanged, it is not 
clear whether when Mr Ntshepe said this is approved, he 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 207 of 310 
 
meant that that had been approved by the board or whether 
he meant as acting Group CEO, he was approving it? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   No, I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You cannot ...[intervenes]  
MS GELDENHUYS:   I just want to look at the emails again.  
I... 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   The email trails specifically referred to, 
there is a board meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
MS GELDENHUYS:   This need to go to the board meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   What happened now... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   So if it was not said physically.  Did the 
board approve it?  It is definitely alluding to it that the board 
approved this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Oh, okay alright.  Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, thank you Chair.  May I just have 
a moment?  I have just been drawn... my attention has just 
20 
been drawn. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   If I can just pick up a point that has 
just been drawn to my attention?  If we can go back for a 
moment to page ...[intervenes]  
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 208 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, maybe you are able to assist me in 
terms of the question I was asking? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Exactly Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am and I hope to get with the 
assistance Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But just before I get to the emails that 
Ms Geldenhuys has just referred us to, that we will get to.  
May I just ask to go back to page 194?  That very brief email 
10 
that came from Mr Ntshepe.  Mr Ntshepe said, page 194.  
Remember the email that said: 
“HI, Jan.  Your email is too long.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And as usual, he refers to a letter 
coming from the chairman, instructing to divisionalise.  That, 
of course, was not an instruction from the board.  It seems to 
specifically approve the VR Laser contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Correct? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay but now if I can take you ahead 
to page 207? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   [No audible reply]  
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 209 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You will see this is a trial of emails. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I would like to start at the foot of the 
page.  The one from Mr Steyn on the 15t h of December to 
Mr Ntshepe, copying in Mr Wessels and Mr Mhlwana.  You 
have it? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes, these are the emails I referred to 
earlier on, to the Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  Then what he says here.  Ja, I 
think it is with reading it into the record Chair.   
10 
“...following your instructions a few weeks ago to 
sign the 
agreement 
with 
VR 
Laser for 
DVS’s 
fabrication work, we had several discussion with 
them, initially, with Jan involved and recently with 
Stephan Burger.   
VRL how now signed the agreement attached with 
minor adjustments of the DLS, Stephan and Denise 
have reviewed it as well, DVS’s legal, Carene...” 
 
That is yourself, is it? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
“...also checked it from a legal point of view.” 
 
Now if I can just stop at that point just to get some 
clarification. 
 
His 
email, 
we 
note, 
is 
dated 
the 
15t h of December and we have noted a moment ago that VR 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 210 of 310 
 
Laser, in fact, signed it on the 14t h of December.   
 
So he seems to be referring to the very agreement we 
looked at a moment ago.  To say to Mr Ntshepe:  VR Laser 
have already signed it.   
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   With a few minor amendments.  And 
then to continue.  He says: 
“I am not sure about the delegated authority in a 
case like this.  My information is that it needs board 
approval or you might want Fortune to review it but I 
10 
am not sure.” 
 
So Wessels expressed ignorance about whether the 
board approval is actually required, although he says he has 
told it.  It seems to be required.  Who is the Fortune, the 
person referred to as Fortune there? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Fortune was the Legal Manager at 
Denel Corporate office.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Corporate? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Ja.  Unfortunately, I cannot remember 
or recall her surname. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  And then: 
“I am looking forward to your further instructions.” 
 
So he has updated Mr Tshepe to say the agreement has 
now been signed by the other side.   
 
That there has been checking done by people like 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 211 of 310 
 
yourself to check that it is legally okay.  And then he refers... 
but he flags the issue of whether, in terms of the delegation, 
board approval is required.   
 
And then the email immediately above it, comes from Mr 
Ntshepe back to mister...  addressed this time to Mr Steyn, 
copying in Mr Wessels and Mr Mhlwana.   
“Hi Johan.  It is approved.  You can go ahead.” 
 
So that one-liner expresses... it says that it has been 
approved.  Are you aware whether it had been approved at 
this or at any other stage by anyone other than Mr Ntshepe 
10 
himself? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   No.  But I understood this to be, there 
was a board meeting and it is approved at the board. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MS 
GELDENHUYS: 
 
 
The 
tone 
throughout 
the 
correspondence was, it needs to go to the board on the 
7t h of December.  And this email is after the 7t h of December. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   So whether the 7t h of December, this 
board meeting took place, whether this was an agenda item 
20 
on the board meeting, I bear no knowledge. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see, what stands out here is, that it 
does not answer the question raised by Johan to say who 
has the authority to approve this and because he says he 
thinks it is the board but he says he is not sure.   
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 212 of 310 
 
 
So Mr Ntshepe does not say:  Yes, it is the board and 
the board has approved it.  He says, it is approved, you can 
go ahead.   
 
He gives himself room later to say:  I did not mean it had 
been approved by the board because it did not need the 
board approval, according to me.  It needed my approval and 
I granted the approval.   
 
Or if the board had approved, he might say:  Well, the 
board had approved and I was telling him, he must not worry 
about other things.  It has been approved by the board.  It is 
10 
just that I did not say so expressly.   
 
But the...  Ja, the answer is not categorical.  Of course, 
the other emails that you referred to, where the... which you 
were saying the board is going to have a meeting and so on.   
 
It may well be that, when one looks at that whole email 
trial, then one might give his answer a certain meaning.   
Okay.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Now I just want to 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  We are at five. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How does it look like in terms of how 
much time do we need? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I hope about 30-minutes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You think we will finish at half past? 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 213 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I hope so, yes.  I think that is 
probable. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Maybe let us just take a 
short adjournment.  Maybe five minutes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ten minutes.  Maybe let us say ten 
minutes because five minutes is going to finish while you are 
walking if you are going out. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us take a ten minute break and 
10 
then we will come back. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So by the time of the agreement that we 
are talking about now, the binding one, had the instruction 
to divisionalise DVS been carried out or not? 
20 
MS GELDENHUYS:   It never actually came to fruition. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   So we were working towards it but it 
did not come to fruition. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Were you working towards it in the same 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 214 of 310 
 
way you were working towards a nonbinding agreement? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   We were leading the nonbinding 
agreement, somebody else was leading the – working 
towards divisionalising. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Yes, Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Could we turn to 
page 159 of your affidavit.   You deal there in paragraph 6 
to the next few pages with an item that you have headed 
the outsourcing of the 40 outstanding N35 hulls to VR 
Laser 
and 
the 
termination 
of 
the 
Memorandum 
of 
10 
Agreement. 
 
Now 
is 
that 
the 
termination 
of 
the 
Memorandum of Agreement we have just been looking at, 
that was concluded in December 2015? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now can you just – I do not 
propose, Chair, unless you guide me otherwise, to go into 
the detail of this, this affidavit is there for the Chair to 
read. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, no, you do not need to. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Can you just sum 
20 
up for us before we get to the actual termination of the 
agreement, what did these 40 outstanding N35 hulls and 
their outsourcing to VR Laser, what did they involve?  Were 
they hulls covered by the agreement that was concluded, 
the single source supply or was that something separate? 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 215 of 310 
 
MS GELDENHUYS:   They would have been covered by the 
agreement but there was more than this 40 hulls, if I recall 
correctly, and now I might be wrong on the amount of 
numbers.  We designed this vehicle and then we built 30 
preproduction units.  Now part of the – you recall that we 
said that there is pilot runs that needs to happen before 
you can outsource your fabrication so that you get to a 
certain maturity level.  We built the vehicles in-house to 
get to the maturity level. 
 
Then there was a follow on order on – or it was part 
10 
of the same order, but there was 40 vehicles to be built 
which was now in a state that it is really to be outsourced 
and it is now past the certain maturity state but then we 
decided that this 40 vehicles and this is – we kicked the 
ball to – from 2015 to February 2017.  So now we are in 
February 2017 and we did our sums and we said it is not 
worth our while to outsource this, we need to build these 
40 vehicles within DVS and then Mr Steyn informed Mr 
Ntshepe and Mr Mgwana that we are going to build - the 
executive team and himself decided we are going to build 
20 
these vehicles within DVS. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right and that took place in 2017. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you were not very confrontational or 
not but you knew what you were trying to do. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 216 of 310 
 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then you refer – if I can take you 
perhaps to page 230. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   230? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   230, yes.  At the foot of page of page 
230 is an email from Pieter van der Merwe who was from 
VR Laser, is that correct?  
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And he was addressing your Mr 
Steyn and yourself, Ms Geldenhuys and others.  What was 
10 
this email relating to?  What was he requiring?   
MS GELDENHUYS:   So for …[intervenes] 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Was this relating to these additional 
items to be fabricated? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   I am not hundred percent sure if it 
was only to that specific order but it is indeed to all the 
work that has happened in DVS.  So what happened was, 
in the binding agreement we kept that caveat for ourselves, 
if it makes financial sense for us, we will look at it to 
contract VR Laser but what we kept on doing is we did our 
20 
business case each and every time before we placed the 
order and what we did is we did ask VR Laser to quote and 
we did ask other people to quote as well and then based 
on information that we got we figured out what it is that we 
can do ourselves and then we decided.   
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 217 of 310 
 
 
So this email that was written in July 2017 by Mr 
Pieter van der Merwe – and I have to just qualify that I was 
not deeply involved in the supply chain process and the 
various programmes and opportunities that was running at 
that stage which he is referring to.  He came to us and he 
said but we have entered into agreement, we are seen in 
the market that we are quoting, you are never coming back 
to us and saying whether we are successful.  We thought 
we have got a single source supplier agreement with you 
but we do not see orders coming to us, do you still think 
10 
that we have got a single source supplier agreement or do 
you not agreement anymore?  Which is in effect his email. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Which is then? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Which is in effect the contents of his 
email. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, thank you. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   We have got an agreement but we do 
not get work from you so what is happening? 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is VR Laser? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   VR Laser, yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And by the time of this email you recall 
how long the agreement had been in place, for how long it 
had been in place? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Since December 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So this was about a year and a half? 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 218 of 310 
 
MS GELDENHUYS:   I can bring it under the Chairperson’s 
attention that there was indeed one order that we did place 
on VR Laser for fabrication of hulls in this period but our 
business case at that stage, where we were in our 
business, it would have been more to the business’s 
profitability if we outsourced it because we did not have 
enough people at that moment.  We had to ramp up and 
everything and it made sense.  At that stage VR Laser was 
cheaper than us then what we could have done it inside. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
MS GELDENHUYS:   So it made financial sense to us.  I 
think, if I recall correctly, it was for 9 RG32 vehicles that 
we placed the order on them. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright, then if I may take you to 
page 232 and 3.  These are two letters that you sent.  The 
one 232 is dated 8 March 2018 addressed to VR Laser 
CEO and that refers to a termination that relates to Denel 
invoking.  The second paragraph: 
“We have no alternative as to herewith invoke DVS’ 
termination for convenience right that forms part of 
20 
the terms and conditions on which the specific 
orders 
were 
placed 
on 
yourselves. 
 
The 
aforementioned orders is thus herewith cancelled.” 
So you are here cancelling particular orders. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 219 of 310 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   This does not say you are cancelling 
a complete agreement though. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   No, it was the orders. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And does the same apply to the 
subsequent letter of 3 April page 233? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   The subsequent letter is actually the 
– the order number was incorrectly – so the subsequent 
letter was just fixing the incorrect quoted order number. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I see.  So it was really just clarifying 
something from your previous letter. 
10 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Again not a termination of the 
agreement itself. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   No, I understood that the strategy 
agreements with VR Laser, according to my knowledge, 
was cancelled at a corporate level at a certain stage. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Were you involved in that? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   No. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now I just want to go back to a 
comment 
that 
you 
made 
earlier 
that 
Mr 
Steyn 
was 
20 
expressing perhaps in diplomatic terms in the emails that 
we looked at earlier to a feeling that he was being 
sidelines or kept out of the loop and Mr Burger was now 
taking the lead in dealing with VR Laser, etcetera.  Your 
own position, as a member of the executive team at DVS, 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 220 of 310 
 
was there a change in what you understood to be the 
attitude of others in the Denel organisation in relation to 
how you were being treated in particular when one looks at 
how Mr Burger was now taking the initiative, Mr Steyn was 
no longer kept in the loop to the same extent.  Did this 
affect you also as an executive team in relation to these 
matters? 
MS GELDENHUYS:  Yes, during divisionalising discussions 
there was a new structure for the landward business.  Like 
I explained, show cost savings, there is just two executive 
10 
teams one needs to end up and there was discussions with 
various executives members as to where you will fit in, who 
you will report to and – ja, so we had to compete for our 
positions again to be in this landward structure on the 
executive team. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I may have missed something.  I 
understood the idea of restructuring and maybe Mr Burger 
taking over and the DVS CEO being under him if DVS was 
divisionalised, 
as 
you 
put 
it, 
but 
if 
DVS 
was 
not 
divisionalised and remained legal entity on its own, I do 
20 
not see how that talk would fit in unless the talk may have 
been meant to intimidate the DVS executive or soften them 
up because they were being difficult.  In other words, to 
make – to kind of threaten them, you know, if you continue 
like this, this is what may happen, you had better behave. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 221 of 310 
 
MS GELDENHUYS:   From a legal point of view I agree 
with you, the structure cannot work like that, it is two 
separate legal entities and you cannot now just dissolve a 
legal entity by a piece of paper overnight.  Somebody that 
is not your employer now decides – that we know and that 
we have, myself particularly raised numerous times to Mr 
Burger and saying but this cannot happen this way and it 
was ignored.   So whether it is a combination of a bit of 
threats going on or whether there was a, in my mind, as a 
legal person, legally that could not happen, it just cannot 
10 
happen.  They do not have legal stance but from a 
business perspective from divisionalising and consolidating 
and Mr Burger being the head of our business, in terms of 
the Denel Group that happened and he has got authority 
over us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you had a de facto restructuring? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But not a de jure restructuring. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But from a certain point you at DVS and 
20 
the executives knew that from now one we are under Mr 
Burger, or whatever. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   From that email where Mr Ntshepe 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 222 of 310 
 
said:  And Mr Burger will lead from now on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   So there was a meeting – he referred 
in that email, I showed an email to everybody from the 
Chair where he said:  And Stephan will lead. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   From that moment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it was from that moment. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   From that moment, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Yes, Mr Kennedy? 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Ms Geldenhuys, I 
just want to take you through a couple of – the final 
paragraphs in your affidavit.  Some of those we have 
touched on already so I do not propose to go into those.  
In paragraph 9 you refer to the prescribed procedure in 
identifying a single source supplier.  When did your 
company move into the Denel Group?  At what stage was 
that?  How soon before this agreement took place? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   So it was, if I recall, 28 April the 
transaction closed. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Which year? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   2015. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   2015. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   So it is five, six months prior. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Five, six months prior? 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 223 of 310 
 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You indicate your lack of knowledge 
of particular processes within the Denel Group at the time.  
Just explain that to the Chair please? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   So when we – obviously, from the 
regulatory framework for a state owned entity is vastly 
different from what it is for a private company and we 
understood and we were informed that for the first year 
while we are part of the Denel stable we will not be subject 
to the PFMA.  So we updated our processes, we started 
10 
with integration and everything whilst we are doing our 
day-to-day work but there was no real knowledge for us 
during that period of exactly the PFMA and what is 
required 
from 
us 
because 
the 
integration 
was 
not 
completed and we did not know that – or we were told that 
the PMFA was not applicable to us. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now may I just go back to one point 
that my learned colleague has drawn to my attention which 
I think does indeed need reference.  Just go back to page 
185.  Yes, this is the email we looked at earlier, 13 
20 
November, from Mr Steyn to inter alia yourself.  The 
second – the third after greeting Piet, Carene and Percy, 
he says: 
“Following Zwelakhe’s request two weeks ago to 
finalise a formal agreement with VRL for fabrication 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 224 of 310 
 
of our hulls in future, several interactions took 
place between DVS and VRL to start the process…”’ 
And this is the important part: 
“…to evaluate VRL’s capability.” 
Now that must be seen against your evidence earlier that 
DVS had its own in-house capability and one division in 
particular might be heavily hit.  So Mr Steyn refers to a 
discussion about a process which would involve, amongst 
others things, evaluating VRL’s capability.  In other words, 
to ensure that if VRL was going to get business that DVS 
10 
was already doing in-house it would have to at least be 
sure that VRL could do the work. 
 
Now if I can take you to page 211.  This is part of 
the agreement that was actually signed in December 2015 
that you witnessed and at page 211 in clause B – B is part 
of 
clause 
A, 
which 
deals 
with 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
Memorandum of Agreement, it reads: 
“VRL with its proven capabilities and quality is 
considered to be a key supplier and a strategy 
partner to DVS.”’ 
20 
So Mr Steyn’s email, sometime before said we need to 
evaluate VR Laser ’s capabilities, the agreement then says 
well, it is already proven that it has got remarkably good 
capabilities.  You have already given evidence that VR 
Laser had already been for some time a supplier to Denel 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 225 of 310 
 
but are you aware of what steps, if any, were taken in fact 
to carry out Mr Steyn’s feeling that before such an 
agreement is concluded VRL’s capability specifically in 
relation to this type of work that you could do in-house, 
whether that was actually tested and established? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   I know that Mr Steyn requested Mr 
Kruger and Mr Ndaba to visit VR Laser to go and sort of do 
an inspection or to go and see what their capabilities is 
and what is happening there and I know that was, if I recall 
correctly, that was also met a couple of days later from Mr 
10 
Ntshepe to Mr Steyn in a very unfavourable tone wherein 
he said that your people are jeopardising Denel’s business 
going to VR Laser.  So that is what I recall that happened, 
I do think …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who said your people are jeopardising 
Denel’s business going to VR Laser? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   It was Mr Ntshepe that said that to Mr 
Steyn. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So in other words saying they should not 
be going there? 
20 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is quite a telling remark.  Yes, okay. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   I also think that the reference to 
capabilities that Mr Steyn made in his email that you 
referred to is also referring to maybe there is additional 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 226 of 310 
 
work that we can sent to VR Laser that would not be the 
hull fabrication.  So go and see what it is that they can do, 
maybe we can send them other work and not our core 
business. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But ultimately they in fact concluded 
a single source supply agreement for all the work? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes but the wording in this single 
source agreement was a – we gave up.  We gave up. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Chair, may I conclude with just one 
more very brief topic?  On page 163 you deal with the legal 
10 
status of the Memorandum of Agreement and you refer to 
certain litigation that was initiated, brought by VR Laser 
against DVS.  Were you still the legal executive at DVS at 
the time that was started? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Yes, I was. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And just very broadly, what does the 
litigation relate to?  What is VR Laser asking the court to 
against Denel Vehicles Services? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   So I referred earlier on that there was 
indeed an order that was placed on VR Laser that made 
20 
sense to us and we received goods from them.  We never 
paid them.  When the – there was a combination of 
activities between – Denel ran into financial difficulties, we 
got a new board, allegations of state capture, allegations 
of state capture with VR Laser, it was you are not paying.  
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 227 of 310 
 
Let us first look at what happened here and let us see if 
the agreement is tainted and how we are going to deal with 
it further.  And now I do not want to testify anything further 
because then I will… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, no, we understand. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   It is sub judice. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, certainly. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   I cannot testify …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:    We understand, ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
10 
MS GELDENHUYS:   On this point. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  And then in 11.3.4 on 
page 164 you refer to an intention by DVS to review and 
set aside the Memorandum of Agreement.  Notwithstanding 
that, it paid an amount of R2.7 million to VR Laser. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Had that been started, that review 
application, before you left office as legal executive of 
DVS? 
MS GELDENHUYS:   If I recall correctly, the review 
20 
application has not started.  What happened in this 
circumstances, DLS owed VR Laser a lot of money as well 
because DV – or Denel was in financial difficulties, there 
was a lot of work that was with VR Laser, that the moment 
that it is released, DLS would get money, to make a sale, 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 228 of 310 
 
and they could get money in for the business.  So the 
payment from DVS of half of R2.7 million was sort of to 
secure that VR Laser release some of DLS’ goods that was 
work-in-progress so that DLS can sell it so that they can 
generate 
more 
cash. 
 
So 
it 
was 
a 
group 
type 
of 
arrangement to get more liquidity into the business at that 
stage. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, thank you.  Thank you, Ms 
Geldenhuys.  Chair, we have no further questions from the 
legal team. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  Thank you very much, Ms 
Geldenhuys, for coming to assist the Commission, we 
appreciate it very much.  If we need you to come back we 
will ask you to come back but thank you very much, you 
are now excused. 
MS GELDENHUYS:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  Mr Kennedy, tomorrow your 
estimate of how much time we need for your witness is 
what? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   My estimate is still probably three 
20 
hours, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So I hope that we can finish 
comfortably. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We can start at nine.  Should we start at 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 229 of 310 
 
nine? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I believe so.  That would assist, 
thank you, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   We want to finish at twelve. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, thank you, Chair, that should be 
feasible. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   As I have indicated to your 
previously we plan to call only the one witness, Mr Teubes.  
He will in fact cover quite a lot of material but we think that 
10 
we can finish it comfortably within three hours. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   May I just draw to your attention one 
logistical thing?  You have previously been given a bundle 
of his documents, his affidavit and annexures.  We have 
been given at a late stage a supplementary affidavit.  I 
have in fact not yet had a chance to work on it, I will 
tonight, but may I just indicate to you that you should 
expect a supplementary affidavit coming tonight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Which I understand will be sent by 
your registrar. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine, so tomorrow we will start at 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 230 of 310 
 
nine then. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, we will adjourn for the day and 
tomorrow we start at nine.  We adjourn.

with our programme for this part of the year where we are 
trying to finish the hearing of oral evidence within the time 
that we have been given so some of the evenings we are 
going to sit during the day, finish at four or five, take a 
20 
break, come back, continue so this is one of those 
sessions and in next week and the weeks to come we will 
be having more of those so we will have day sessions and 
evening sessions to try and finish the work of the

Okay, thank you.   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe you will - it might help for – to 
just recap where we are so that the public can follow. 
ADVI SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Mr Tsotsi has given evidence a few 
times before, he is here because he needs to finish, there 
was some – there’s some issues that had not been dealt 
with when we had to adjourn last time he was here. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you Chair.  When we 
10 
adjourned last time Chairperson, Mr Tsotsi, we were at the 
point where I had just asked you a question about the 
meeting of the 16 t h of March 2015.  The meeting which was 
testified about by firstly by Mr Nick Linnell, you added to it 
also as a result of my questioning, and you had testified in 
response to the question I asked as to who the persons 
were who attend the meeting, that you had been informed 
it was Mr Romeo Khumalo and Mr Zithembe Khosa.   Is that 
correct? 
MR TSOTSI:   That is correct. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So we had gone through extensively 
also the affidavit of Ms Dudu Myeni in regard to the events 
that took place at the meeting of the 8 t h of March 2015, do 
you recall that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes I do. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 233 of 310 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And we gave you the opportunity to 
respond to her version of events and also to interrogate 
your own version, do you remember that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So I would like to pick it up on the 
meeting of the 16 t h of March and what remains thereafter 
Chairperson is to put further versions of other witnesses to 
you Mr Tsotsi and I think that should then wrap up your 
evidence in regard to the suspensions, and that version 
ultimately 
includes 
what 
they 
have 
said 
before 
the 
10 
Chairperson in regard to the grounds for your what they 
call disciplinary action or whatever steps they were 
subjecting you to as the Board. 
 
Do you follow that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Now you did confirm as I 
recall, because I did watch the video of your testimony, 
that this meeting that you were in fact informed that the 
meeting did take place on the 16 t h of March 2015, you can 
confirm? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   And as I recall your recollection was 
that you were informed by Jabu Maswanganye about this 
meeting?  
MR TSOTSI:   Correct ja. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 234 of 310 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, can you tell the Chairperson what 
was said to be the purpose of this meeting? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair I really did not know, I wasn’t 
expressly told what the purpose of the meeting was, even 
what was discussed so I was not aware of neither the 
content of the meeting, nor the reason for the convening of 
the meeting, to that extent yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Tsotsi were you invited to that 
meeting? 
MR TSOTSI:   No, I was not invited. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you know that the meeting was 
going to take place? 
MR TSOTSI:   No, I didn’t know. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now I have also gone back to listen to 
the evidence of Mr Linnell and towards the end of his 
evidence he testified on the 5 t h of October and on the 6 t h 
of October, he couldn’t finish on the 1 s t because there was 
a lightning interruption.  On the 6 t h towards the end of his 
testimony he says that he was also informed that the 
Minister did attend the meeting of the 16 t h of March, were 
20 
you aware of that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes I was aware of that yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You had learnt that the Minister had 
attended the meeting, is that what you are saying you were 
aware of? 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 235 of 310 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I had learnt that the Minister had 
attended the meeting yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Okay, okay, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now Mr Linnell he has since, he is in 
touch with the Commission, with us in the work stream, and 
he will be providing the Commission with a supplementary 
affidavit on this issue, because as he explains to us, and 
maybe you can confirm this because he says he sent an 
email to your legal team back on the 30 t h of March 2015, 
seeking to propose certain questions that your legal team 
10 
should ask the persons he said should be called as 
witnesses to your disciplinary action, do you recall that? 
MR TSOTSI:   I don’t expressly  recall that particular 
email, I will have to check with the legal team Chair but I 
don’t recall it myself. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Okay, now we will show when Mr 
Linnell has provided us with that, because he mentions 
names of certain board members who he said should be 
asked questions why attended the meeting of the 16 t h of 
March. 
20 
 
Now let me paint the picture for you sir that we 
move a little faster.  Mr Linnell, this is on the 16 t h of 
March, on the 17 t h of March he receives an email from a 
gentleman called Thulosilele, and he receives this email he 
said at ten to five, early in the morning, 4.50 am.  
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 236 of 310 
 
Chairperson Mr Linnell’s affidavit is found on page 158 of 
Eskom Bundle ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just for the record we are using Eskom 
Bundle 07A, is that right? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   07A, thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and what page will I find that? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 158. 
CHAIRPERSON:   158? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you.  Yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And I – this is the evidence already 
testified about Mr Tsotsi from paragraph 42, and 158 it is 
the black pagination ...[intervenes]  
MR TSOTSI:   What page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   158. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And look at, remember the black 
numbers as opposed to the red numbers. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Use the black numbers. 
MR TSOTSI:   Oh, okay. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In the left hand corner. 
MR TSOTSI:   Okay, got it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You have the, you have that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 237 of 310 
 
ADV SELEKA SC: Now I am not going to read from it but I 
will tell you, because the evidence has been testified 
about, so Mr  Linnell testified on the very day of the 16 t h of 
March 2015 he had a meeting he thinks he recall with Ms 
Mabude at your house to plan the way forward in regards 
to the terms of reference.  Ms Mabude was the Chairperson 
of Audit & Risk Committee, you recall that?   
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now he testifies that there was an 
agreement with Ms Mabude for them to meet further the 
10 
next day but on the 17 t h of March 2015, the early hours of 
the morning, he receives an email to the effect that he is 
no longer needed at the Audit & Risk meeting to which he 
had been invited and he thinks this was the turning point, 
and he reads that together with the attitude of Ms Mabude 
the night before or the day before which he refers to as a 
cooling of enthusiasm in regard to what he had been 
assigned to do, Mr Linnell. 
MR TSOTSI:   I see that yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So he then says this – he read this 
20 
email, and linked it to the meeting which was said to have 
taken place on the 16 t h of March, a secret meeting, a 
private meeting where some Board members were present 
together with some suspended executives.   Did you hear 
that? 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 238 of 310 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now obviously this has to be tested 
before the Chairperson by those who are coming, we have 
to put this version to them because we have only so far 
heard the one side of the story from Mr Linnell and from 
yourself, because if indeed some Board members met with 
suspended executives on the 16 t h of March, if indeed that 
is the case, and you might not know, Mr Baloyi was 
removed from the Board for having made communication 
with a suspended executive.  Did you know that? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes I recall Mr Baloyi’s testimony to that 
effect yes.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   So these board members if the facts 
are established to be true, they were – they “charged”, and 
I use the word in inverted commas “charged” Mr Baloyi and 
found him guilty of an act they themselves had committed 
way back on the 16 t h of March, fresh after the suspension 
of the executives, five days after the suspension of the 
executives.   You follow that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But we will test that with them when 
they are here, because you have alleged two names, Mr 
Sithemba Khoza, and Mr Romeo Khumalo. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now what then develops Mr Tsotsi is 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 239 of 310 
 
that on the 18 t h however, and you see that further in the 
affidavit of Mr Linnell, he says he ignored the – he 
interpreted the email to the effect that he is no longer 
needed. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But nonetheless he disregarded that 
and he proceeded to prepared the terms of reference, 
which in paragraph 46 of his affidavit he forwards them to 
you and to Ms Mabude.  
MR TSOTSI:   Right. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because – and you know why they are 
forwarded them to Ms Mabude because the Board had 
delegated the power to Audit & Risk to oversee the inquiry, 
so Ms Mabude was the Chairperson of the inquiry, is that 
correct? 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And on the next page, page 158, he 
says also – well he touches on what’s the terms of his 
reference, the essential terms of his reference were he 
recommended 
that 
a 
retired 
judge 
be 
appointed, 
he 
20 
recommended that a law firm be appointed together with, I 
think that was ENS, together with an auditing firm, Grant 
Thornton, and that you see in paragraph 50 of the affidavit.  
And remember paragraph 45, sorry 49, that is – those 
terms of reference are also emailed to Ms Dudu Myeni and 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 240 of 310 
 
then there is a meeting again at your house in the evening 
of the 18 t h of March.  Do you recall that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because you indicated in paragraph 52 
he says the Chairman contacted me and informed me that 
he had spoken to Ms Mabude and she had undertaken to 
come to his house as soon as she was able to discuss the 
documents sent.  He asked that I also attend.  And by mid-
morning there was no further response from Ms Mabude 
and I called the Chairperson and I suggested I visit him as 
10 
the media were asking for comment.   
 
And I want to skip some of these paragraphs – if 
you go to paragraph 64 on page 160, because that’s where 
he says I was later informed – this is still on the 18 t h, later 
informed by Mr Tsotsi that members of the board had met 
with the Minister on Friday, so I skipped a paragraph which 
I want, because you meet with the two of them and there is 
a discussion that ensues and there is a debate about the 
acceptability or otherwise of the terms of reference and I 
remember he says you interjected and said cut it out 
20 
because the two of them were becoming angry with each 
other.  Can you recall that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But the nonetheless he says he gets 
invited to another meeting of Audit & Risk that was to take 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 241 of 310 
 
place on the 19 t h of March.  Now Chairperson that email 
there is an email in fact that shows that Ms Mabude did 
have a meeting with Mr Tsotsi and Mr Linnell at your house 
and she advises members of the Board that I have agreed 
with Mr Nick that he must come to our meeting and meet 
with us as Audit & Risk, that email Chairperson is found in 
Eskom bundle 10, Exhibit U20.  Exhibit U20 is Mr Baloyi’s 
bundle, and he provided the Commission with a couple of 
emails, the one I am referring to now is on page 330. 
MR TSOTSI:   Page? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   330.   Page 330 it is the second – it is 
technically the first email from the top Chairperson but the 
second in this case, which is from Chwaita Mabude, it is an 
email sent on Wednesday 18 March 2015, at 22:20, twenty 
past ten in the evening, do you see that Mr Tsotsi. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, 22:20? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   22:20. 
MR TSOTSI:   18 t h March? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   18 March yes.  It is an email sent to all 
the Board members, the company secretary, you were also 
20 
there, Tsotsiz@eskom.co.za, and the email reads: 
“Good evening ...” 
Well the subject line is: 
“Re Eskom Board Media statement 18 March 2015” 
So it reads: 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 242 of 310 
 
“Good evening, 
I had a meeting with the chairman Nick.  We have 
agreed to take this to the ARC meeting to further 
discuss and resolve.  The meeting will be in the 
afternoon depending on the availability of members. 
Regards 
CHM” 
Do you recall this email? 
MR TSOTSI:   Not explicitly no, I don’t recall the actual the 
email, but I recall the event of the meeting at my house. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Just say that again, you recall? 
MR TSOTSI:   I recall the meeting at my house. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   At your house, thank you.  Do you 
recall that the agreement was to this effect? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, absolutely. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well according to Mr Linnell even 
though the meeting was scheduled to take place the 
meeting was subsequently cancelled.   Do you recall that? 
MR TSOTSI:   I recall Nick complaining about that yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, and it is interesting that now that 
20 
I have read the subject line, dealing with a media 
statement I would like to go back to that affidavit of Mr 
Nick Linnell in your bundle, the paragraphs that I have – 
that I had skipped.   
MR TSOTSI:   Ja. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 243 of 310 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that is back to page 158. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you back to Mr Tsotsi’s bundle. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Tsotsi’s bundle Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   158? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 159, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Continue.   Of course Mr Seleka in 
putting to Mr Tsotsi other witnesses’ versions where they 
don’t contradict him, his version, or don’t implicate him in 
10 
any wrongdoing you don’t have really to go through that 
unless you want him to confirm something. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is fine Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja and I take it he has had a chance to 
read all of these emails. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, if there is a particular one here he 
feels he would like to comment that you don’t touch he may 
do so but the ones that you need to focus on the evidence 
you need to focus on ...[indistinct] where they either say 
20 
something that is inconsistent with  his version or they 
contradict him or they implicate  him in some wrongdoing 
or if you are wanting to confirm a particular version. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair, I am with you.   Let 
me approach it this way Mr Tsotsi.  Thank you Chair, 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 244 of 310 
 
because that helps me expedite it.   Let me approach it 
this way Mr Tsotsi, the involvement of Mr Linnell is 
apparent from the facts, the involvement of Mr Linnell by 
the Board, in matters pertaining to the intended inquiry, 
you can see that from the documentation, correct? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, and I want to then accelerate to 
the charges that get brought against you by the Board, 
because that is decided in the meeting of the 19 t h. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And one of those charges is that you 
had commissioned the drafting of a media statement which 
went without the Board approval, let me see that you find 
in the reference bundle, Chair I will quickly read it.  
Charge 3 says: 
“The director authorised the Commission with a 
media statement in relation to an inquiry into the 
affairs of the company with the assistance of the 
consultant without the knowledge and/or consent of 
the Board.” 
20 
That 
charge 
goes 
on 
to 
say 
this 
media 
statement 
consequently 
fell 
into 
the 
public 
domain, 
the 
media 
statement 
contained 
numerous 
inaccuracies 
and 
misinformation which may lead to the company facing 
potential legal action from third parties named therein. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 245 of 310 
 
 
Now we know that you have dealt with this at this 
meeting, and maybe you could open to the reference 
bundle for Mr Tsotsi so that we can quickly deal with this 
particular allegation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I don’t know what you have in mind 
Mr Seleka, but I do recall that I think Dr Ngubane it would 
be fair to say to a very large extent he struggled to explain 
at least some of these charges.  I do remember that I 
asked him whether he agreed that they could not charge Mr 
Tsotsi for involving Mr Linnell in the affairs of the Board 
10 
and Eskom and the role he was to play, because they had a 
chance to tell him we don’t want this man here, you have 
to follow procedures and my recollection is that Dr 
Ngubane could not defend that part of the charge and he 
sought to say something else, I can’t remember what he 
said and – which my impression is might not have been in 
the charge sheet, in the first charge. 
 
So where, whatever they have said it doesn’t really 
contradict seriously what Mr Tsotsi has said, we don’t need 
to spend much time on it and the best – one thing you can 
20 
do is just mention to Mr Tsotsi what they said and if he has 
comments he can comment and move on.  It is only in 
regard to those where they may have sought to resist or 
justify their decision to charge him with the various charges.  
Now I know that on the one about the media statement both 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 246 of 310 
 
– certainly Dr Ngubane I seem to say really struggled as well 
in the face of questions to defend that.  But you might have 
a better recollection and you might have a recollection that 
is different from mine.   
All I am simply saying is where – where we do not 
need to be detained where they did not come up with – they 
were not able to defend the charges.  But there may be one 
or – that they seemed to defend I am not sure but even with 
that I am struggling to remember which one.  But you are 
young I saw you – you – and your junior is even younger so 
10 
you might have a better memory than me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja Chair thank you.  Then that is exactly 
the reason why I left charge 1 and 2 and I went to 3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because 3 that is where they seem to be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You know like a dog holding onto a bone 
and I did not want to let go. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Tsotsi. 
MR TSOTSI:  I am in the worst position memory wise Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I can understand Mr Tsotsi. 
MR TSOTSI:  Ja. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 247 of 310 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  The first part of charge 3 I agree 
with the Chairperson in neither here nor there because we 
can see from the documentation the evidence led that they 
engaged with Mr Linnell in the drafting of the statement.  But 
they say the statement was leaked and they want to – you 
will know that you leaked the statement.  And they are 
hanging onto that.  You want to respond to that quickly? 
MR TSOTSI:  Chair like I said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  Clearly that I deny my leaking the statement.  I 
10 
am – it makes me wonder what will be the purpose of my 
leaking the statement in the first place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no I think Mr Seleka on that one.. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is also the problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We have a problem because I asked Mr 
Tsotsi – Dr Ngubane why the Chairperson would have wanted 
to leak a media statement when he knew that all he wanted 
is to get the board to approve and you remember what Dr 
Ngubane’s response was.  He said something like about a 
ego or something like that. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so continue but really… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No that is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, no we will not belabour the point but 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 248 of 310 
 
that was just to give you a chance Mr Tsotsi to put your – 
your response to that on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If other board members come and tell us 
something different then you know we might bring you back 
you know.  There are some board members who must still 
come. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Like Mr Romeo Khumalo but… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  There was not… 
CHAIRPERSON:  There are those that have testified on this 
10 
I think there were some challenges. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Thank you Chair.  Chair let me then 
– let us test this one.  They also Mr Tsotsi mentioned 
something about you having proposed to the board – to the 
board members that one Mr Malesela Sekhasimbe who was 
at that time on suspension the fact which they say you did 
not disclose to the board.  You proposed that he be 
appointed to one of the acting positions of those who were 
suspended. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think did they not say CEO – acting CEO 
20 
or maybe not acting CEO but ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Tsotsi will… 
CHAIRPERSON:  What do you say to that? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes Chair.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  May I say that as you answer Mr Tsotsi.  
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 249 of 310 
 
I am aware that that is not one of the charges but I am aware 
that they have said they were unhappy about that as well.  
You understand what I am saying? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes I do understand. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  I just want to without belabouring this issue 
Chair just to put it in perspective.  The issue regarding Mr 
Sekhasimbe and Sumitomo dates back to 2008 for it is an old 
issue.  And I just want to confine myself with what they are 
concerned with meaning that I suggested someone who is 
10 
suspended should act in a position of the Group Executive of 
Technology and Commercial.   
Now the situation Chair is that after the said incident 
for which Mr Sekhasimbe was suspended I spoke and this 
happened at the end of February 2015 around end of 
February 2015 somewhere around there if not very early 
March 2015.   
I then raised this issue with the Chief Executive Mr 
Matona and I said – I asked Mr Matona to look into this 
because I think at the time I said to him I felt that Ms 
20 
Sekhasimbe was – was being hard done by because he 
really has nothing to do with the charges that is being laid 
against him and that he should see to it that Mr Sekhasimbe 
is taken out of suspension because he is not involved in … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sorry Mr Tsotsi you may deal with that 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 250 of 310 
 
later when I put to you Mr Koko’s version.  But just address 
this one of whether or not you had suggested to the board at 
the time of the suspension of the executives that one of the 
acting persons should be Mr Sekhasimbe and you did not 
disclose to the board that he was in fact on suspension. 
MR TSOTSI:  Chair that is not correct, that is not true.  The 
fact of the matter is when I – when I raised the issue of – 
and queries the names of the people who are going to be 
suspended – I mean who are going to be taking the places of 
the people who are suspended I said to the board in regard 
10 
to Mr Sekhasimbe he – he would have been the person 
appropriate to act in the position of Mr Matshela but he has 
been suspended and I even commented that I was very 
unhappy with the suspension because I did not believe that 
he merited to be suspended.   
And the name that was brought forward was that of 
one of the engineers who worked with Mr Matshela who then 
subsequently became the person who acted.  So I did tell the 
board or the members of the PNG committee at the time that 
Mr Sekhasimbe was under suspension and therefore could 
20 
not act.  I merely brought up his name because I felt he the 
person who was appropriate for that position.  It is then that 
the name of the other person came up who eventually ended 
up acting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is that… 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 251 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I wonder Mr Seleka whether… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the minutes or in the transcript 
recording this part is reflected in any way… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I have the minutes right here Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So that is telepathic communication 
Chair.  That is – in the Reference Bundle Chairperson Mr 
Tsotsi the – the minutes of the 30 March 2015. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have I got the Reference Bundle here? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The Reference Bundle.  Eskom Bundle is 
it 12?  Yes Eskom Bundle 12. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and what is the page number? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The page number is 230. 
CHAIRPERSON:  230 okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  230. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can continue as soon as Mr Tsotsi has 
found the page in the meantime. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you will know whether we need to 
check or where to find it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And we can do without … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh ja. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 252 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  It just in [talking over one another]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Let me read it?  Let me read it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   
“Mr Tsotsi you are called to this meeting on 
the 30 March that is because you could not 
be removed on the 19 March.  On the 30 
March you have the charges given to you and 
now you are making your presentation to the 
board on each of the charges.”   
10 
And although Sekhasimbe issue is not one of the charges. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You did address it in that meeting.  At the 
bottom of the page of 230 the minute taker records: 
“In 
respect 
of 
the 
nomination 
of 
Mr 
Sekhasimbe as acting CE.” 
And this is what Chairperson recollected earlier.  
“Mr 
Tsotsi 
stated 
that 
although 
Mr 
Sekhasimbe was a good candidate he could 
not be considered as he was on suspension.” 
20 
So they record that you said this. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So this is – these are minutes of what 
meeting? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  These are minutes of the board meeting 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 253 of 310 
 
Chairperson page 226. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of what date? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  On 30 March 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so this is now Mr – they are recording 
what was said on that date. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About something that happened before. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it would be interesting now if there is 
anybody who said no, no, no but you said you want him to 
10 
act. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chair if you turn to page 232 these are 
the minutes that get to be signed more than a year later by 
Dr Ngubane on the 18 November 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And there is no indication of anybody who 
contradicted Mr Tsotsi to say that is not what you told us at 
the board two weeks back or whatever. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Not at all Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because in fact on page 231 the second 
20 
last paragraph it says: 
“The acting Chairman thanked Mr Tsotsi for 
his presentation and asked members if they 
wanted to clarify on any items.” 
And I put this to Ms Venete Klein that they were given the 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 254 of 310 
 
opportunity to ask questions on Mr Tsotsi’s presentation why 
did they not ask questions?  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I remember.  Okay no that is alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it looks like Mr Tsotsi these minutes 
seem to be consistent with what you are saying in terms of 
what you say you had told the board about Mr Sekhasimbe 
because you are saying – you had told them that although he 
would have been in your view the right person to act he was 
suspended and therefore could not which is what this says.  
10 
Ja okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Mr Tsotsi then related to this issue 
of Mr Sekhasimbe is the Sumitomo issue which is alleged 
quite extensively by Mr Koko; Mr Koko has provided the 
commission with an affidavit in which he says:  You signed a 
letter to Sumitomo a Japanese company committing Eskom 
to a payment to this company and when he discovered this I 
think the letter was either sent by Mr Sekhasimbe to 
Sumitomo or was it brought to you by him – he then took 
steps to suspend him.   
20 
You were unhappy about the suspension of Mr 
Sekhasimbe.  You asked Mr Matona to approach Mr Koko 
about the issue.  According to Mr Koko you said to Mr 
Matona tell Koko – Mr Koko to reverse the suspension and 
he said he will not reverse the suspension.  
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 255 of 310 
 
 And as a result of his refusal to reverse that 
suspension he believes that that is how he was suspended 
on the 11 March 2015.  Because Mr Matona said to him if 
you do not lift the suspension of Mr Sekhasimbe you and I 
are going to be suspended.  And he believes on the 11 t h that 
is how he was suspended. It is because of you. 
MR TSOTSI:  Chair that is a complete fabrication.  I think 
the corroborations of the other witnesses who have come 
before this commission for me are sufficient to dispel the 
idea that Mr Matshela is proposing to the extent that I recall 
10 
very specifically that Mr Matona himself does not accord with 
what is being alleged he is supposed to have done or said.  
So I am – I have to dismiss what Mr Matshela is alleging. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja well at least there seems to be an 
acceptance by many of the witnesses that the idea that he 
and the other executives should be suspended is an idea you 
got for the first time at the Durban meeting.  So there is that 
but he will give his evidence and we will hear.   
He might have genuinely believed that it was because 
of that and maybe by now he has heard a lot of evidence if 
20 
he is following about where the idea of the suspension of the 
executives seems to have come from.  So he will come and 
he will give evidence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair.  Chair I may just point out 
yesterday we received a supplementary affidavit from Mr 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 256 of 310 
 
Matona where he rebuts those allegations  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We have forwarded it… 
CHAIRPERSON:  To Mr Tsotsi. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  To Mr Tsotsi and Mr Koko. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That affidavit will find itself into the 
bundle of Mr Matona. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  In due course. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Now Mr Koko – Mr 
Tsotsi I beg your pardon.  Linked with that because you know 
it is important we have not touched on the sequence of 
events and you need to tell the Chairperson the sequence of 
events insofar as you recall.   
When 
I 
talk 
about 
the 
sequence 
I 
mean 
the 
chronology, the dates of the events.  Because then you get 
to the time when you meet with the Minister.  Where the 
Minister says to you Mr Chairperson I understand from the 
20 
management and from the directorate that you are interfering 
with the executives.  Now that is in 2015. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes that is in 2015 around the time of the- of 
the SONA. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The State of the Nation Address. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 257 of 310 
 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is in February 2015.  Because Mr 
Tsotsi alleges that the issue of Sumitomo arose during or 
about June 2014. 
MR TSOTSI:  Mr Matona. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Koko. 
MR TSOTSI:  Okay Mr Koko yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes I beg your pardon.  Mr Koko. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes.  That is about correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Now the Minister in her affidavit explicitly 
10 
says an executive came to her – one executive and 
complained 
about 
you 
interfering 
with 
management.  
Chairperson the same bundle of Mr Tsotsi page 450.   
CHAIRPERSON:  The Reference Bundle?  Not the Reference 
Bundle. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Not the one of Mr Tsotsi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh what page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Page 450. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Eskom Bundle 7[a]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Page 450 paragraph 1 – it starts at 100 
but I want to pick it up at 101.  Because at 100 the Minister 
refers to the question which we asked her and we put the 
version of Mr Tsotsi to her about the meeting in February 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 258 of 310 
 
2015 which she reproduces there.  Am I – you found it? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Tsotsi okay. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Then paragraph 101 the Minister says  
“The only related conversation I remember 
having with Mr Zola Tsotsi related to his 
interference with management for operational 
issues as opposed to directorate issues.  In 
his oral testimony before the commission he 
10 
confirms 
this 
referring 
to 
me 
he 
says 
whereupon the Minister had.  Well in this 
instance he was not happy about the fact 
that 
I 
was 
said 
to 
be 
interfering 
with 
management.  There have been complaints 
about 
Mr 
Zola 
Tsotsi 
both 
from 
the 
executives and the directorate.” 
Now she adds:  
“The directorate. What comes to mind in 
particular was that one of the executives 
20 
came to see me in person complaining about 
Mr 
Tsotsi’s 
interference 
with 
operational 
issues producing a letter allegedly penned by 
Mr Tsotsi to a Japanese company about 
buying oil or some other fuel I decided I had 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 259 of 310 
 
to intervene.  This is why I invited Mr Tsotsi 
reprimanded him and directed him to refrain 
from interfering with management.  As to the 
verbatim exchange I cannot recall.  I do 
recall that the meeting was tense.  The 
exchange could have been intemperate.  I 
must also say that I did not have the best of 
relationship with Mr Tsotsi.  We did not really 
get on well with each other.” 
Says the Minister.  She says.  Do you know what the Minister 
10 
is talking about there?  The Japanese company? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes Chair.  I must assume that when she says 
one of the executives came to her to complain about my 
interference in management she must be referring to this 
incident and hence consequently referring to Mr Matshela as 
the person who would have come to her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But – was it something acceptable for any 
executive at Eskom or any SOE for that matter other than at 
least the CEO Group CEO to bypass this Group CEO, bypass 
the board and go and speak to the Minister about issues at 
20 
work?  Was that something that was permitted; was that 
using the right channels? Was the position not that normally 
you would be the contact person for the Minister but 
obviously if somebody needed to complain to the Minister 
about you they would not ask you to speak to the Minister 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 260 of 310 
 
about it. But then one would have thought that any executive 
would speak to the Group CEO and it would be the Group 
CEO who one would have expected would first raise the 
issue with you or with the board.  But certainly if the Group 
CEO approached the Minister about a complaint relating to 
the board or to the chairperson one might be able to 
understand that compared to an executive lower than the 
Group CEO bypassing the Group CEO; going to the Minister 
to speak about the chairperson of the board. 
MR TSOTSI:  You are correct Chairman.  If protocol in the 
10 
organisation was very clear about how the communication 
should work.  The least I would have expected would be for 
the Chief Executive to have received such a complaint and 
put it to me and if he felt that he needed to pass it onto the 
shareholder because it involved the chairman then he had 
the opportunity to contact the Director General who then 
could process the issue at the level of the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Minister. 
MR TSOTSI:  That would have been… 
CHAIRPERSON:  The channels. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:  The channel yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  And the Minister does not 
seem to – does not say anything here about having taken 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 261 of 310 
 
objection to this executive whoever it was if it was not the 
Group CEO bypassing the Group CEO and going to – and the 
board and going to talk to her. 
MR TSOTSI:  Not only that Chair but to – just to elaborate 
some on this matter.  When she approached me about this 
particular issue and of course I knew what she was talking 
about she did not even ask for – from me what my side of the 
story is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  You know she did not say to what is 
10 
happening, can you explain to me what actually transpired?  
She decided that it was opportune for her just to reprimand 
me on the basis of what she had been informed by a member 
of the executives. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The executive ja. 
MR TSOTSI:  Without having – who did not follow – bother to 
follow any proper protocol. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Tsotsi I intended 
exactly to ask you the question. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:  Sorry Sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, no that is fine because although the 
Minister says what she is saying the question is did she 
mention that to you?  Did she say it to you this is the reason 
why I am speaking with you.  One executive has said to me 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 262 of 310 
 
you have written a letter committing Eskom to payment in 
respect of this Japanese company. 
MR TSOTSI:  No she never – she never addressed the issue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Well your version is up there.  The 
Minister has reproduced your version in her affidavit.  Do 
you see that?  And this is where the Minister says to you 
“Chairman I have received complaints from management and 
board members that you are interfering in management.  
Please refrain from doing so because if you do not I shall 
have to find someone else to do your job.” 
10 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But she later in her affidavit says: 
“As to the verbatim 
exchange I cannot 
recall.” 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it does appear on her version – on 
her own version it does appear like she did not give you a 
chance to – to respond to whatever the executive concerned 
or board members who might have spoken to her what they 
really said you had done wrong. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It does appear she on her version she had 
made up her mind whatever they have told her you have 
done. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 263 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And she was then reprimanding you and 
saying stop it otherwise I will find somebody else to do your 
job. 
MR TSOTSI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the impression one gets from her 
own version. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Then Mr Tsotsi there is another version 
of the Minister which I want to place to you.  Turn the page 
to 451.  This is now in regard to your removal Mr Tsotsi. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:  Chair I do not know if I am – I want to belabour 
this point but it is noteworthy that the individual who was the 
subject of all of this to her about my interfering with 
management went to the CCMA and was – what is the word 
now – what is the legal word?  Shall I say acquitted is that 
correct or was it?  The CCMA … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Vindicated. 
MR TSOTSI:  He was vindicated at the CCMA that he had 
been unfairly treated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:  By this action. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  Of suspension. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So his suspension was found to have been 
unfair? 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 264 of 310 
 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is now we are talking about Mr 
Sekhasimbe? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sekhasimbe. 
MR TSOTSI:  Sekhasimbe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Um. 
MR TSOTSI:  Sekhasimbe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Sekhasimbe okay. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you just making the point that your 
10 
views that you held about his suspension were vindicated 
because the CCMA found that the suspension was unfair. 
MR TSOTSI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Now Mr Tsotsi you will assist us obtain 
that information. 
MR TSOTSI:   I would gladly do Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Thank you.  Was he reinstated? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:  He – there was an instruction from the CCMA I 
gather that he was to be reinstated but the – the person in 
charge of the CCMA proceedings I gather indicated that it 
would be – he would be entering hostile environment – work 
environment.  He should – his entitlement should go back to 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 265 of 310 
 
work but the person felt that he would be entering a hostile 
work environment and may have to opt for negotiating his 
departure from the organisation.  But I think the ruling of the 
CCMA would make it clear as to what actually transpired. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Then in regard to your 
removal.  I have said page 451.  The minister deals with the 
removal of yourself as chairman of the board and she says in 
paragraph 108 that: 
“This was a vote issue and I did not interfere.  I did 
10 
not have any private discussions with Mr Tsotsi 
about this.   
I do know that eventually Mr Tsotsi and the board 
reached some understanding and settled the matter.  
As I understood the arrangement, he would resign 
so that his name does not tarnish as a director and 
so can continue serving on other boards.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, she was not there.  She is just 
saying this based on whatever reports she had received. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And that is what we want to test 
20 
Chairman.  That is exactly ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but I do not know whether you want to 
first check with Mr Tsotsi because not somebody who was 
there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 266 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you see?  So I do not think you 
should... raise that with Tsotsi. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The people who can speak about that, the 
board members.  She must have received certain reports. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She is interpreting certain things.  So I do 
not think you... I think you should move on to something 
else, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because she was not there.  She was not 
part of the board meeting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Should I ask him one question, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And that is that she did not interfere. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Tsotsi, are you able to respond to 
that allegation by the minister that she did not interfere in 
the issue between you – what she says is an issue between 
you and the board? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman, let me say what I know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   And want to make a judgment as well that 
constitutes 
interference 
or 
not. 
 The 
meeting 
of 
the 
19t h of March where I was first or where I first encountered 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 267 of 310 
 
these charges, that meeting finished in the early hours of the 
morning around one o’clock or something.   
 
And the same day, I knew and I was told that the board 
had requested – in fact, it is in the minutes – the board 
requested to have a meeting with the minister.   
 
Now when they asked that I should recuse myself from 
that meeting, it was blatantly obvious to me that they want to 
talk about me and the issue that they have raised with me in 
the previous meeting.   
 
Now I have consistently asked for minutes of that 
10 
particular meeting because for me that would have been very 
significant because I needed to know how the board 
presented the issue to the minister because that will 
determine their own role in terms of how that meeting was 
conducted.   
 
And I have persistently not been able to find those 
minutes.  I recall in Cape Town at the parliamentary hearing, 
I specifically pointed out the fact that those minutes are 
important for one to get a sense as to exactly what happened 
in that meeting of the 20 t h.   
20 
 
And I think it will be worthwhile to explore with members 
who were present in that meeting exactly what happened.  
So her presence there and the discussion that went on, 
culminated in now my formal – me being formally charged.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 268 of 310 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Ja, I think it is up to whoever who wants to 
make a determination as to whether the minister effectively 
interfered or not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you tried to get those minutes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The minutes Chairperson of the 19t h 
when Mr Tsotsi is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I think the one he is talking about 
is...[intervenes]  
MR TSOTSI:   The 20t h. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
...between 
the 
board 
and 
the 
10 
...[intervenes]  
MR TSOTSI:   And the minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...and the minister. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, those minutes he is talking about. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, no we do not have those minutes 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you asked for them? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair.  There is the minutes.  I see 
my investigator is signalling to me.  Yes, they did ask for the 
20 
minutes.  They were not given if those minutes exist. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But we know whether minutes were taken. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What... I do not know whether during your 
time, the board or members of the board had... ever had the 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 269 of 310 
 
meeting with the minister other than in a situation where the 
minister came to a meeting of the board in which case there 
would be minutes.  But if they went to see here, would 
minutes normally be taken?  Do you know? 
MR TSOTSI:   They ought to be taken Chair.  There is no 
reason why they should not be taken. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m.  If it is formal business 
...[intervenes]  
MR TSOTSI:   ...the minutes were available. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...because they are coming to discuss 
10 
formal business. 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct.   
[Parties intervening each other and cannot be heard clearly.] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But in terms of your experience, had there 
been such meetings between the board or members of the 
board 
delegation 
with 
the 
minister 
outside 
of 
board 
meetings?  And if so, would there have been minutes that 
were kept in the past?  Because you were a long-serving 
member of the board.   
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, I do not recall there be a meeting 
20 
with... Minister Gigaba, actually only attended, to the best of 
my recollection, a meeting when we have asked him or he 
has requested to address a particular issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   But that did not happen very often. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 270 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Well, at least what should be 
done is to get people who would know that about that 
meeting, such as the person who was the chair.  The person 
was the chairperson of the board at the time or who was 
acting as chairperson and the company secretary if her or 
she was there in that meeting with the minister. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To depose to affidavits to say:  Did the 
meeting take place?  Were there minutes?  What was 
discussed?  There should be affidavits by people.  The 
10 
minister herself should be – if she does not deal with that in 
her affidavit – should be asked to depose to an affidavit to 
say whether such a meeting did take place with her.  What 
was discussed.  As far as she knows were there minutes.  
Blah-blah-blah.’ 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Tsotsi, so you are saying there was a 
20 
meeting on the 20 t h of March? 
MR TSOTSI:   The 20t h of March, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you were not invited to that meeting? 
MR TSOTSI:   I was explicitly excluded from that meeting, 
yes. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 271 of 310 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Who told you that you are excluded? 
MR TSOTSI:   If I recall, I think it was Dr Ngubane who 
asked that I should recuse myself because he was acting 
chairman at the time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  No, we ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I do not know if the two are not 
talking at cross-purposes.  Were you asking him whether he 
was not invited to the meeting between the board and the 
minister? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Of 20 March. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of 20 March? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the meeting that we have been 
talking about? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And Mr Tsotsi, you said you were 
excluded from the meeting.  Were you saying that because 
the decision to go and see the minister was taken in a 
20 
meeting from which you were excluded?  Or was there 
specific decision or is there somebody who said:  No, you 
must not come along. 
MR TSOTSI:   I was specifically told by Dr Ngubane that I 
should recuse myself from the meeting. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 272 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, the meeting with the minister? 
MR TSOTSI:   With the minister, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that is fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay that is fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So he is there on the meeting – at the 
meeting on the 19 t h Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That meeting that takes place overnight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   They stopped at around – to one the 
next morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the meeting of the 19t h, is the position 
not that that is the meeting where they asked him to leave 
the meeting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And when he comes back, Dr Ngubane is 
chairing. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And suddenly he is just a director now.  
He is no longer chairperson.  From then on, did he ever 
come back to be a chairperson?  Mr Tsotsi, you never came 
back to be chairperson or did you? 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 273 of 310 
 
MR TSOTSI:   No, Chair I did not chair any meeting 
subsequent to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   After that, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is there anything further that you want  
to tell the Chairperson about the meeting of the 19 t h? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, something I thought I observed and I 
could not quite understand what to make of it, was that the 
10 
meeting of the 19 t h when I was chairing the meeting at that 
point in time, was in process and we were discussing Eskom 
business.   
 
And then, at some point, Mr Romeo Khumalo walked into 
the meeting.  And he whispered something to Dr Ngubane.  
And it is at that point I was asked to recuse myself from the 
meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Ja.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. I remember you mentioned that in the 
20 
past.  
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  So I got the impression, for what it is 
worth, that there was a message that must have come in 
from somewhere. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 274 of 310 
 
MR TSOTSI:   That it is time to deal with this person in this 
particular way. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   That I thought was rather unusual but that was 
the last time I chaired a meeting of the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   And incidentally, I also requested Chair the 
minutes of the discussion which took place ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   In your absence? 
MR TSOTSI:   ...on the 30t h now when I was now defending 
10 
myself in terms of the charges in the presence of my 
attorneys as well as the Eskom’s attorneys. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  
MR TSOTSI:   Because at the end of my presentation, I was 
asked and my team was asked to recuse ourselves.  And the 
board deliberated.  Up to now, I do not know what it was that 
they were deliberating on.  And I have not been able to find 
out.  And I have requested those minutes and I was never 
given those minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, has your team asked for the 
20 
minutes of those deliberations? 
MR TSOTSI:   Because I may add Chair just for ease of 
reference for Mr Seleka.  If you look at the end of the 
recordal of the minutes of the 30th, there is a statement 
there which says minutes of the – whatever they call it- 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 275 of 310 
 
minutes of in-committee or what – are kept separately.  I was 
very intrigued by that because ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   ...that minutes do exist...  Sorry, if you look at 
the minutes of the 30t h of March, the end of that minute, 
there is a statement at the bottom there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson, what we have in regard to 
the meeting of the 19t h. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We have on single documents which is 
the minutes of the meeting.  It records when Mr Khumalo 
comes in.  It records when the board takes a break and it 
resumes.  And at resumption, Mr Tsotsi is asked to be 
excused.  And you have a minute of what takes place in his 
absence to the end of that discussion when he is called 
back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And the meeting gets adjourned. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you have it in the same document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   That is for the 19t h Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 276 of 310 
 
MR TSOTSI:   That I accept. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is for the 19t h.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which is also important.  It is good that 
you have said that.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But he has added now something in 
regard to the 30t h, the minutes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He says after he and his legal team had 
10 
made a presentation, they were asked to leave for the board 
to deliberate, I guess on the presentation.  And he says he 
has 
asked 
for 
the 
minutes 
which 
would 
cover 
those 
deliberations. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But he says he has never been furnished 
with those. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Yes, no ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And he says the minutes of the 30 t h 
...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I am looking ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...reflect that those minutes of the 
deliberations were kept separate. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so which means they must be in 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 277 of 310 
 
existence somewhere. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, that is if they recorded them Chair.  
They do say, as Mr Tsotsi points out, just before closure the 
minute-taker had indicated in-committee minutes are kept 
separately. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I know that we do have some of the 
minutes of in-committee board meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But the investigators do not have... they 
10 
do not have the one which Mr Tsotsi is referring to where he 
was excused in that meeting.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So we will make a note of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think make a note and the company 
secretary must be asked for the minutes of the board’s 
deliberations after the presentation by Mr Tsotsi and his 
legal team ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...on the 30 t h. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay alright. 
MR TSOTSI:   Can I just on that point Chair because I think 
this is very important because that deliberation will tell us 
what motivated ...[intervenes]  
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 278 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   ...for them to discard my presentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   And in fact, opt for ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   ...my having to be struck off as a director. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Well, Dr Ngubane’s evidence – I do 
not know whether this is what may have emerged from those 
deliberations – his evidence was that somebody – I do not 
know if it was him – came up with the idea to say:  You know, 
10 
we must talk to Mr Tsotsi and say maybe he should resign 
because if we pass a vote of no confidence, that is going to 
impact negatively on him.   
 
And I think he said he was then mandated.  I do not 
alone or together with somebody else to approach you to put 
this idea of you resigning.  To say:  Look, if we... if the board 
passes a vote of no confidence, it is going to impact 
negatively on you.  Maybe it is better if you just resign.  That 
is what he said. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I do recall that Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  So it is just that I do not know 
whether 
he 
said 
that 
was 
discussed 
outside 
of 
the 
deliberations of the board or whether it was during the 
deliberations.  But we know that in the end, that is what 
happened. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 279 of 310 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   I also heard that Mr Baloyi was a sending 
voice in those deliberations. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  But it might be helpful to get 
those minutes if they exist. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Let us move on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, we will finish ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   We are at twelve minutes past eight. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  I have got...  Chair, we are 
finished.  The Chair is correct that that Mr Venete Klein’s 
evidence.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, that is Ms Klein’s evidence? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is Ms Venete Klein’s evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mister...  I have got three points Chair.  
Arising 
from 
the 
affidavit 
recently 
received 
and 
the 
20 
Chairperson has not seen that affidavit of Mr Zethembe 
Khoza.  Mr Tsotsi, which you... a copy of which you were 
favoured with.  Has it been included in the Reference 
Bundle?   
INVESTIGATORS:   [No audible reply]  
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 280 of 310 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, it has been included in the 
Reference Bundle.  But there is a paragraph there by Mr 
Zethembe Khoza.  Although he ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Do we know what page it is in the bundle? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But if you do not think I need to go to it, it 
is fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, it is the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe it is fine, I think. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is the smaller bundle. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   You can let me know later on.  You can put 
to Mr Tsotsi what you want to put. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Page? 
INVESTIGATORS:   [No audible reply] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 447. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   447. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the same bundle? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   From the Eskom Bundle 13.  It is a 
continuation of the Reference Bundle. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Mr Tsotsi, there is an allegation 
there regarding you ...[intervenes]  
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 281 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat the page for Mr Tsotsi. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   447. 
CHAIRPERSON:   447. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   On page...  That is the beginning page 
of the affidavit.  The specific paragraph I want to read from 
is, is 454.   
MR TSOTSI:   447.  I have got the wrong document.  What, 
what?  What document is that? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Eskom Bundle 13.   
MR TSOTSI:   [No audible reply]  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Eskom Bundle 13. 
MR TSOTSI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   You can have mine. 
MR TSOTSI:   Okay, I have got it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Just go straight to page 454. 
MR TSOTSI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Paragraph 34, Mr Zethembe Khoza 
writes: 
“I do not recall that the minister... 
 
No, it is not this one.   
20 
MR TSOTSI:   46? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, there is an allegation he makes 
about you regarding the pre-suspension letters. 
MR TSOTSI:   46. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   46.  Thank you.  Page 457 Chairperson. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 282 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am now at 454.  You say I must go back 
to 447? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To 457. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, 457? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   457. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Paragraph 46. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay yes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Mr Zethembe says: 
“I do not recall exactly when and cannot find the 
10 
record of same but Tsotsi sent me pre-suspension 
letters for Marokane, Molefe, Koko and Matona 
which alluded to their alleged misconduct.   
At the time, I thought that the letters would be 
prepared Linnell in order to assist the board.  
However, as the board did not charge the executives 
in any way, these letters were ultimately never 
utilised.   
As I was relieved from my role as chairman of the 
People in Governance Committee, I was transmitted 
20 
copies of these letters to Klein on 14 March 2015.  
The copy of the email is annexed hereto, marked 
ZK9.” 
 
Now Mr Tsotsi, I provided you with this affidavit and I 
believe you have had a chance to look at it. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 283 of 310 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Zethembe said you, although he 
cannot recall when and cannot find a record of same, he 
nonetheless says, he got pre-suspension letters from you.  
And might I add?   
 
That this pre-suspension letters are also talked about by 
Ms Venete Klein in her affidavit, although she does not 
mention you, nor does she mention Mr Zethembe Khoza in 
her affidavit.   
 
But when she testified here, she said that she recalls 
10 
she received these letters from Mr Zethembe Khoza.  Now 
Mr Khoza said he received them from you even though he 
has no record or recollection of exactly when.   
 
Now Chairperson, these are the letters that in the 
affidavit of Ms Venete Klein, she says that were authored by 
Ms Suzanne Daniels together with Mr Salim Essa.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I see Mr Khoza says that as well. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Says the same thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  He certainly says that at paragraph 
47. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He says: 
“While preparing this affidavit, I noticed that the pre-
suspension 
letters 
were 
actually 
prepared 
by 
Daniels and edited by Mr Salim Essa.” 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 284 of 310 
 
 
I think it is the same letters that in the previous 
paragraph he says he thought he got from Mr Tsotsi. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he thought that they had been 
prepared by Mr Linnell. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is what he says at 46 but at 47 he 
says: 
“While preparing this affidavit, I noticed that the pre-
suspension 
letters 
were 
actually 
prepared 
by 
10 
Daniels and edited by Mr Salim Essa.” 
 
He says: 
“The properties of the document show this as I have 
now discovered.  Again, I did not know how to check 
who has authored or edited the Word document prior 
to know.” 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Tsotsi, your comment on this? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, Chair.  First of all, I think, I do not know 
20 
where Mr Khoza got this from but without a doubt I never 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But I ...[intervenes]  
MR TSOTSI:   ...sadly ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I do not know Mr Seleka we should 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 285 of 310 
 
order to let him comment because in effect, Mr Khoza seems 
to be retracting that or is that not your understanding? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, that is exactly my understanding 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  He first says he thought he got them 
from Mr Tsotsi and after they had been prepared by 
Mr Linnell.  But the next paragraph he says:  No, actually, 
when now preparing this affidavit, I realised that they were 
prepared by Daniels and edited by Salim Essa.  So I do not 
think Mr Tsotsi needs to comment further on it because in 
10 
effect, he is withdrawing what he has said before.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Should we move on 
Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I am happy to move on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, move on.  Move on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  And then.  Mr Tsotsi, a minor thing.  
Well, I am going to leave that one.  There is a meeting after 
you have resigned.  You have resigned.  There is a meeting 
between you and Ms Molefe as she talks about in her 
20 
affidavit where you – she says apologise to her that she 
should not have been suspended. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You confirm that meeting? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, Chair.  I felt very aggrieved about in 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 286 of 310 
 
particular about her suspension and I just felt the need to 
say to her that I did not believe she should have been 
suspended.   
 
And I made this clear in the way I addressed the issue of 
the FD coming in as part of the list of the executives to be 
suspended.  I pretty much had a good sense of what is likely 
to happen.   
 
Let alone the fact that I did not believe that there was 
anything to investigate in the Department of Finance.  When 
I say I had a sense of what was likely to happen actually did 
10 
occur when I was confronted by a whole host of investors of 
Eskom who were asking these questions.   
 
And they particularly wanted to know what has the FD 
done.  Because she, I mean, the Financial Director is the 
custodian of the investment of the investors of the business.  
So I pretty much knew that there was going to be this 
problem.   
 
And incidentally, Mark Pamensky also mentioned that 
during the one of the – I think it was the PMG Meeting if I 
recall correctly.   
20 
 
So I am just, you know, connecting these issues 
because I ultimately felt that I needed to say to Ms Molefe 
she should never really had been suspended. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, that actually marks the end of my 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 287 of 310 
 
questions.  I have something on the composition of the sub-
committees but he has now dealt with it in one way.  We 
will...  I think we will test it with the minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if you want to ask him about that, 
you can ask him. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can I ask? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Mr Tsotsi, Nokholo(?) has provided 
us with an affidavit to which some of the emails exchanged 
between 
you 
and the minister are 
attached and this 
10 
specifically relates to the composition of the board.   
 
Then the emails are dated...  your email to the minister 
is 26 January 2015.  The minister respond to that by email 
dated 28 January 2015.  26t h, 23rd(?) [clearing of throat by 
witness]   
You first sent an email with the composition.  
Chair, for your benefit, I think you need to have a look at it.  
That is Eskom Bundle 10 and Exhibit U22. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And this is the last... I am exploring with 
Mr Tsotsi.  Eskom Bundle 2, Exhibit 22. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Number? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   10. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Exhibit 22. 
MR TSOTSI:   Page? 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 288 of 310 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 471.  And your email starts on 
page – thank you Mr Tsotsi.   Your email is below the 
minister ’s email.  So your email from Zola Tsotsi, date is 
26 January 2015 at 13.52.  You address the email to 
Lynne.Brown5@me.com and the subject is: 
“Deployment of nonexecutive board members to 
board committees.” 
MR TSOTSI:   My email is on what page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   472. 
MR TSOTSI:   472, okay. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you forward to the minister your 
email below.  So your email below reads: 
“Dear 
Minister, 
please 
find 
the 
revised 
board 
subcommittee deployment as follows:  
Audit and Risk...” 
You give the names and I believe we should read according 
to how you have almost tabulated them, is that correct?  
Under audit and risk is Chwayita Mabude and you go to the 
next page, Viroshni Naidoo, Nadia Carrim, Romeo Kumalo, 
Norman Baloyi. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you see that?  And the list carries 
on, under Tender and Procurement you have Ben Ngubane 
as the Chairperson.  At the next page, it is Chwayita 
Mabude, Zethembe Khoza, Nazia Carrim.  And then the 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 289 of 310 
 
IFC, Mapamenzi, Pat Naidoo, Zethembe Khoza, Venita 
Klein and so on.  There are some mistakes here in the 
names.  The spelling of the names.   
MR TSOTSI:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   For instance, Nazia Carrim, she is not 
Nadia, she is Nazia. 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Kumalo is spelt without an h. 
MR TSOTSI:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Khoza is not Zathembe, it is 
10 
Zethembe Khoza. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Were 
these 
your 
mistakes?  
Typographical errors?   
MR TSOTSI:   They must have been, Chair, typographical 
errors. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then the minister …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But are you sure that this was your 
composition? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, Chair, on the basis of this email it has 
20 
to be, yes.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Well, let me [indistinct – dropping voice] 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
You 
remember 
there 
is 
another 
composition that we are still looking for, I do not know if 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 290 of 310 
 
you found it in the meantime. 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, this email is a culmination of the back 
and forth that occurred on this issue between the minister 
and myself and I guess I should say between three of us, 
Salim Essa, minister and myself.  Now I would imagine that 
following the minister ’s insistence when we met at our 
house, where I said Tony Gupta was present and so was 
Salim Essa, this would have been ultimately what she had 
wanted to have.  So I am saying that this probably would 
not represent what I had wanted but the likelihood that it 
10 
would represent what the minister had wanted and together 
with whoever was – Salim Essa, in this instance, would 
have wanted.   
 
So I am saying – because I look at the date and I 
see that it is – we are communicating with the minister at 
the end of January and the back and forth with minister 
and Salim Essa started – would have started sometime in – 
conceivably in December, if not early January.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson, incidentally, we do have 
Mr Tsotsi’s email of December 2014 to the minister. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which is not part of the record and I 
am going to beg the Chairperson’s leave to hand it up. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   For the purposes of the Chairperson’s 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 291 of 310 
 
comparison and Mr Tsotsi’s benefit.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We will mark it accordingly for 
inclusion into the record and Mr Tsotsi could briefly then 
explain 
to 
the 
Chairperson 
how 
the 
two 
documents 
compare, one for the Chairperson, one for the witness.  So 
the email handed up, Chairperson, is an email from Zola 
Tsotsi sent on Tuesday 16 December 2014 at 14.02, also 
sent to Lynne.Brown5@me.com and the subject is also: 
“Deployment of nonexecutive board members to 
10 
board committees.” 
And it says: 
“Dear Minister, I trust you are well and enjoying 
some rest.  Please find below the preliminary 
deployment of nonexecutive board members to 
board committees.  The audit committee at Eskom 
has always been chaired by a CA.” 
I presume that means a chartered accountant, Mr Tsotsi? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it obviously means that, I would 
imagine. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Not a candidate attorney. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We may have to deal with media 
reaction to this change.  Are you contemplating limiting the 
board to 13?  The previous board had 14 members.  For 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 292 of 310 
 
those serving on three committees, depending on their day 
jobs, the workload may be quite taxing.  So would this 
have been the first email you sent, Mr Tsotsi?  And I notice 
the – sorry, can I give you a change to answer then, Mr 
Tsotsi?  Would this have been the first email you sent to 
the minister? 
MR TSOTSI:   I cannot recall whether this is the first one 
but certainly it was December which accords with what I 
recall was when the interaction was taking place. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And I also notice the errors in the 
10 
surnames 
of 
some 
of 
your 
board 
members 
there.  
Zethembe Khoza is spelt with an x. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, would not have imagined that you 
would spell Khoza like that, Mr Tsotsi. 
MR TSOTSI:   That is a gross error, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR TSOTSI:   That is a gross error. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Could this be in Salim Essa’s list, Mr 
Tsotsi? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I mean, I cannot imagine that you would 
20 
spell Khoza with an x. 
MR TSOTSI:   Ja, that …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Unless it was your secretary and your 
secretary was someone who could make this kind of 
mistake. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 293 of 310 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I see that [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then you did not check properly. 
MR TSOTSI:   His name has been repeated as Zathembe 
Xhosa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I mean it is... 
MR TSOTSI:   Ja, that is definitely an error. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But also, I see you were going to serve 
– you, being Chairperson of the board, you were going to 
serve as a member – as an ordinary member in various 
10 
committees, is that normal? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, in IFC? 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you are Chairperson of the board do 
you not chair just the board and you do not go to other 
committees and – because they must report to the board, 
those committees, and you are chairing the board? 
MR TSOTSI:   It has been a tradition at Eskom that the 
Chairman does participate in some of – in fact, the 
Chairman is limited – well, obviously, the Chairman would 
not serve in the statutory committee.  But the Chairman is 
20 
generally limited to the people in governance committee 
and the social the – it is the ethics?  Cannot remember, 
there 
is 
another 
committee 
that 
the 
Chairman 
is 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just looks very …[intervenes] 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 294 of 310 
 
MR TSOTSI:   But certainly not the IFC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It looks very strange to me because if 
the Chief Justice who chairs the heads of court goes to a 
committee and he is then just a member, an ordinary 
member of that committee, that committee is chaired by 
somebody else, it looks very awkward if the President, who 
chairs a cabinet meeting then goes to a subcommittee of 
the cabinet and then he attends as an ordinary member 
and that committee is chaired by somebody else, it is 
strange. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  I can accept that, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But is what you intended because one of 
the things I think Mr Seleka is looking at and I am looking 
at is whether this genuinely came from you.  But if it 
genuinely came from you, that is what you say and we 
accept. 
MR TSOTSI:   This would have come from me, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It came from you? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, alright.  In which case 
20 
obviously your secretary would not have put your name in 
certain committees unless you had said …[intervenes] 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Tsotsi? 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 295 of 310 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, do you not leave the Chairperson 
with the impression that it is your secretary who typed 
this? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, probably secretary typed but if she 
typed or he typed what he said she should type then it is 
not her fault or his fault.  I think what Mr Khoza - Mr Tsotsi, 
I am sorry, Mr Tsotsi has said is the composition reflected 
what he wanted. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, thank you, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Okay, alright, and 
you were saying that certainly not you, Mr Zola Tsotsi, 
chairman of the board on the IFC. 
MR TSOTSI:   Ja, well that is a bit odd. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   It would not have been a good idea. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  But it also still begs the question 
well, is this your list? 
MR TSOTSI:   Well …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, he has said it is his. 
MR TSOTSI:   I can only say it is mine because 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, he has said it is his. 
MR TSOTSI:   I am the one who sent the email to the 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 296 of 310 
 
minister.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So you accept that, ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   I cannot disassociate myself from it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is alright. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is alright.  Then, Chair, lastly on 
this, if you go back to the file, is the minister ’s reply to Mr 
Tsotsi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   About the composition? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That email – let me see, I think it is 
duplicated.  We can read it on the next page, which is page 
474.   
MR TSOTSI:   Which bundle? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The bundle where your email – Eskom 
bundle 10, EXHIBIT 22. 
MR TSOTSI:   Oh, the same one we were looking at. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The same one, yes. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   What page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 474. 
MR TSOTSI:   Oh, the next page. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, the next page.  So the minister 
responds to you 28 January 2015 at 8.21 and she copies a 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 297 of 310 
 
couple 
of 
people 
there, 
Matsietsi 
Makholo, 
Brandon 
Roberts and others and she says: 
“Dear Mr Tsotsi, thank you for the email below 
regarding the composition of board committees.  
Given that this is a newly appointed board it is my 
responsibility, as shareholder representative, to 
formally 
consider 
the 
composition 
of 
the 
committees.  I would therefore appreciate it if the 
composition of board committees is submitted under 
formal cover letter with the following supporting 
10 
information, a copy of the board resolution on the 
composition, a draft resolution for shareholder 
approval 
of 
members 
of 
the 
audit 
and 
risk 
committee, 
a 
draft 
shareholder 
resolution 
confirming membership of…” 
I think it is social and ethics committee. 
“…and sustainability, a draft shareholder resolution 
noting all other committees, list of all directors’ 
disclosure of interest including…” 
And the rest of it is there.  What I did not understand, Mr 
20 
Tsotsi, and maybe you can explain to the Chairperson and 
us is the minister’s statement that given that this a newly 
appointed board, it is my responsibility, as shareholder, to 
formally 
consider 
the 
composition 
of 
the 
committees 
because we have understood from the – some of the 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 298 of 310 
 
witnesses 
who 
testified 
here, 
that 
the 
minister’s 
responsibility would have only related to two statutory 
subcommittees. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, exactly.  Chair, that is correct, when 
they [inaudible – loud coughing] committees what would 
happen is that the – whatever proposal the board may 
make on those committees is subject, expressly subject to 
the approval of the minister so …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes because in regard to that committee 
or those committees she has the power. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now in regard to other committees has 
she got any power? 
MR TSOTSI:   No, no, Chair, she does not have the power. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So to the extent that she says in the 
email that the composition of all the committees of the 
board is subject to her power, she has the power to decide 
that that would not be correct. 
MR TSOTSI:   No, Chair, that is not correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   What the board is doing is giving the 
shareholder the courtesy of knowing how is involved in 
which committees. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but not because she has the 
…[intervenes] 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 299 of 310 
 
MR 
TSOTSI: 
 
 
Not 
because 
[inaudible 
– 
speaking 
simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   …to the decide that. 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  In her affidavit does she repeat 
this? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She deals with this, Chair, to some 
extent …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess we are wrapping up now, hey? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I am, I am, Chair.  I have in fact.  Let 
10 
me …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   There may be – there may be staff who 
might still need to go some long distances home who did 
not know they have to stay longer today.  It is all my fault. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, sorry, quickly – that is back to 
your bundle, Mr Tsotsi, and that is on page 444, page 444 
from paragraph 43 onwards. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What does she say? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She confirms that she is responsible 
only 
for 
the 
appointment 
of 
members 
of 
two 
board 
subcommittees. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Audit and risk and social and ethics 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 300 of 310 
 
committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then she goes into the process at 
DPE that she would be guided in appointing members of 
the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But then she does not stop at audit 
and risk and social and ethics.  In paragraph 47 she goes 
on about she would have followed the same process for the 
other subcommittees. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In respect of the two that she said she 
is responsible for.  But then she says: 
“I cannot recall offhand 
whether this is 
what 
happened regarding the 2014 appointment of the 
committees” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no that is fine, if her affidavit says 
she is only responsible for those two committees, that is 
fine.  When she comes she will give evidence about that 
email. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And she can provide clarification. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Mr Tsotsi, just right at the end 
now, there is an email in December 2014 you sent to the 
minister with the composition.  Then there is an email on 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 301 of 310 
 
the 26 January 2015 that you sent to the minister, with the 
composition. 
 
Now 
what 
informed 
the 
email, 
the 
composition, the composition, in the email of 26 January 
2015.  Now my question is, let me put it, is that the 
composition that the minister wanted in January when you 
sent it to him(?).   
MR TSOTSI:   That would be the case, Chair, because as I 
said, the back and forth occurred during the month of 
December primarily and what culminated in then the formal 
submission to the minister would then be the composition 
10 
as the minister had wanted it to be. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So is the position that for – that in 
regard to all the committees you or the board ended up 
basically letting her have or decide the composition. 
MR TSOTSI:   That is the de facto situation, Chairman.  
CHAIRPERSON:   That is what ultimately happened? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Because in the email she had said 
it is her, as the shareholder she would decide. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that means the minister went 
beyond the limit of the two subcommittees that she is 
responsible for. 
MR TSOTSI:   It would appear so by her own admission 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 302 of 310 
 
because she is saying that she needs the formal document 
for her consideration.  You will recall that is what you read 
earlier in the email. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, that is one thing.  That is one 
thing, yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But I am talking factually from the 
composition in your subsequent email, that that is what the 
10 
minister wanted you …[intervenes] 
MR TSOTSI:   That is what the minister had wanted 
…[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   How to compose. 
MR TSOTSI:   Ultimately, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So it went beyond just the two 
subcommittees. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You see, the reason why I was 
remarking on the – understanding the states is because the 
20 
Fundudzi report shows that a composition had been 
received by the DPE from businessman’s email info portal 
and the misspellings were like in your first email.  Mr 
Zethembe Khoza is spelt with an x. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 303 of 310 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And I thought that was remarkable.  
Coincidence?     
MR TSOTSI:   I think just a coincidence, yes.  It is a very 
interesting coincidence, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, unless – well, you remember your 
evidence previously. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was that you received a composition, a 
fax or email from Mr Salim Essa. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   With how the committees of the board 
should be composed of. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you were not happy with that.  You 
sent your own composition of the committees of the board 
to the minister. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then you said – you testified and 
you said the minister sent you her composition and you 
said her composition of the committees of the board was 
20 
exactly the same. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As the composition of Mr Salim Essa 
that you were not happy with. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, that is correct. 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 304 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You remember you said that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now it is possible – if you say your 
composition of the board committees of – is it 26 January? 
MR TSOTSI:   26 January, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you say that was the culmination of 
the to-ing and fro-ing involving you and the minister and Mr 
Salim Essa and if you say that that composition was what 
the minister wanted and if what the minister had previously 
sent you was the same as what you had received from Mr 
10 
Salim Essa, then it may be that the minister sent you a list 
with those spelling errors because those spelling errors 
maybe were included in Salim Essa’s list, composition, and 
what you did not do is to correct those spelling errors.  
That is one point of looking at it. 
MR TSOTSI:   It seems to be, yes.  Yes, that is quite 
possible, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because for you it really seems very 
strange that you would spell Khoza with an x. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, exactly. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But anyway, I think… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is the end, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was that your last question? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is the end, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   If there are any other questions you can 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 305 of 310 
 
always send them to Mr Tsotsi. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   With a request for him to respond to 
them by way of an affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that – ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Certainly.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Thank you very much, Mr Tsotsi.   
Sorry – oh yes… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You want to say…? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I looked for you here because I think 
– I thought last time you were sitting this side.  I may have 
been mistaken so I did not realise you are there.   
MR 
NGCEBETSHA: 
 
 
No, 
thank 
you, 
understood, 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR NGCEBETSHA:   I have just two points only. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Two questions? 
MR NGCEBETSHA:   Yes, just… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, yes. 
20 
MR NGCEBETSHA:   Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:   That is re-examination, hey? 
MR NGCEBETSHA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright. 
MR NGCEBETSHA:   Mr Tsotsi, you spoke at length 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 306 of 310 
 
regarding the meeting of the 30 March in which you first 
went to your presentation, there was an adjournment and 
subsequently you were approached by Mr Romeo Kumalo 
together with Dr Ben Ngubane which culminated in you 
going back to the formal board meeting and tendered your 
resignation.   
 
Now 
I 
just 
want 
first 
to 
confirm 
– 
tell 
the 
Chairperson in your own words whether the resignation 
tendered was voluntary or not. 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, that is a very interesting question and 
10 
not an easy question to actually answer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Because you recall that the state if mind I 
was in was one of someone who is being accused of things 
that were certainly very flimsy.  I made the point in the 
meeting with the board in my own defence to say that 
these charges were definitely spurious and were of no 
substance whatsoever and this was confirmed by my legal 
team that in fact what they were putting forward is really of 
no substance.  
20 
And I realised that if I was to challenge this 
situation any further, it is going to impact on the company 
and take away from the focus of what Eskom should be 
doing and that is to recover from the situation that it is in 
and I really did not want to be party to defocusing Eskom 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 307 of 310 
 
and bringing the focus upon myself. 
 
So my resignation in a sense was – in a sense was 
forced because I felt that I did not want to be an albatross 
around the neck of the company and I consented to then 
resigning for that reason not because I felt that I did not 
have a winnable case nor that I capitulated to the - you 
know, to the accusations that they were making.  Quite the 
contrary.   
As I say, it was really in the interest of making sure 
that the business does not have to have a fallout out of 
10 
this situation occasioned by my resistance.  So that is 
really the – to answer the question, I felt it was a forced 
situation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR NGCEBETSHA:   Thank you.  Now on going through 
that, 
I 
suppose 
it 
is 
common 
cause 
now, 
that 
the 
resignation was received and accepted.  There were 
certain commitments made to you by the board to meet 
certain obligations.  Without naming them, were any of 
those obligations that were made to you met by the board 
20 
or by the company? 
MR TSOTSI:   No, Chair, none of them were met 
altogether.  None of them were.  In fact I do not why you 
want to restrict me from commenting about what it is I 
should say what they are about but one important issue, 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 308 of 310 
 
has got to do with my legal fees. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you mentioned that last time. 
MR TSOTSI:   So I felt done by, by the attitude of 
[indistinct – dropping voice] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
MR NGCEBETSHA:   Now my next question is, what effect 
would your removal – or rather, what effect did your 
removal from the board as Chairman of Eskom have on you 
seeing that you had already testified that this pretty much 
10 
was the only job you could hold because of the enormity of 
the work that you had...? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman, I can only describe it as 
debilitating, to be quite honest.  I lost, you know, not only 
an income but I lost opportunities for further income.  It 
became 
very 
clear 
that 
people 
who 
were 
supposed 
associated or tainted with State Capture, if I may say so, 
were being shunned by you know prospective employers 
and there were all sorts of stories and rumours going 
around.  One in particular concerned me because it was 
20 
said that Gupta family went out of its way to draw up a list 
of all those people who should not be engaged by – 
certainly by the public sector, and my name apparently is 
one of them. 
 
So I am just saying I would not want to relive that 
29 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 294 
 
Page 309 of 310 
 
situation again. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR NGCEBETSHA:   Chairperson I think that concludes my 
questions, I just need maybe to place it on record that 
whilst we may receive from Tsotsi matters that confirm he 
is an implicated person by some of the witnesses, we have 
adopted an approach that says that we have been fairly 
satisfied with the manner in which the evidence leader 
poses the different version. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR NGCEBETSHA:   And instead of complicating and in 
the spirit of expedition of the work of this Commission we 
just 
want 
to 
formally 
record 
our 
reservation 
in 
the
