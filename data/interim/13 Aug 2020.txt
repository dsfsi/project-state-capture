PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 13 AUGUST 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Hulley, good morning 
everybody. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Good morning DCJ – sorry good 
morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Mr Chair this morning’s proceedings is 
in relation to the matter of Brigadier Ncube who was 
implicated as you may recall by Mr Robert McBride who 
was at – at IPID.   
10 
Mr McBride implicated Brigadier Ncube as part of 
what he referred to as the Mabula Team.  General Mabula 
is to testify next week on Thursday and quite coincidently it 
seems 
that 
Mr 
– 
General 
Mabula 
happens 
to 
be 
represented by the same firm of attorneys and the same 
counsel as Brigadier Ncube.   
Late yesterday I had a discussion with my learned 
friend who appears on behalf of Brigadier Ncube and who 
appears also on behalf of General Mabula – Mr Joubert of 
the Johannesburg Bar. 
20 
We discussed the convenience of postponing the 
matter until next week so that – because it all deals with 
mostly the same issues. 
As you might recall Mr Chair insofar as next week’s 
proceedings 
are 
concerned 
Brigadier 
Ncube 
– 
sorry 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 4 of 152 
 
Brigadier Mabula has been implicated not only by Mr 
McBride but also by General Booysen and the evidence in 
relation to Brigadier – sorry in relation to General Mabula 
will deal with that evidence as well in other words General 
Booysen’s evidence as well. 
What we – or insofar as todays’ proceedings are 
concerned we have agreed with the other side that it would 
make sense to postpone the matter until next week not 
only because of the convenience factor as far as the 
different witnesses are concerned and for the sake of 
10 
continuity of the evidence but also because of certain 
logistical difficulties that have arisen on the part of the 
commission’s preparation of the bundles and so forth. 
Some of the bundles may as we speak right now not 
yet have been made available to the other side but it is 
appropriate that they should consider the bundles and 
certainly do so in consultation with their client. 
In those circumstances Mr Chairperson with your 
leave we would ask that the matter be postponed until it is 
the 21 August, I believe next Thursday.  Mr McBride is in 
20 
attendance this morning and I have discussed the matter 
with him, I have discussed the matter with his attorney – or 
with his attorney and his counsel and it is convenient for 
everybody if we postpone the matter until next Thursday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let me hear from counsel from 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 5 of 152 
 
Brigadier Ncube.  They will just sanitise first.   
ADV JOUBERT:   We have no objection Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV JOUBERT:  With the arrangements and the proposals. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No thank you.  Thank you.  And – 
okay there was counsel for Mr McBride as well is it not?  
You confirm that you are fine with the arrangements?  Okay 
thank you.   
 
I would have preferred that we continue.  I was 
going to hear argument about it being convenient that we 
10 
postpone the matter to Thursday and I might have been 
persuaded that that is what we should do. 
 
But the fact that there have been logistical and 
administrative challenges relating to the bundles from the 
commission’s 
side 
counts 
strongly 
in 
favour 
of 
a 
postponement. 
 
I have been kept up to date about the challenge.  I 
know that it is not the fault of the legal team but it is 
unfortunate but it is going to be addressed.  It is a pity that 
we find ourselves in this situation.  
20 
 
I know that counsel for – regarding – they indicated 
that although their preference was going to be that the 
matter be postponed to next week if I decided that we 
should proceed they – they would do their best to proceed. 
 
So – but I think that the issue of the challenges 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 6 of 152 
 
from within the commission outweigh everything in regard 
to the bundles.  So I will postpone the hearing of the 
evidence of Brigadier Ncube and the cross-examination of 
Mr McBride that was going to take place today.  It will now 
take place next Thursday when another implicated person 
was going to – to give evidence and I think cross-examine 
as well – General Mabula? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So we will postpone the hearing of 
Mr Ncube’s evidence and the cross-examination of Mr 
10 
McBride to next Thursday at ten o’clock. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  I am going to adjourn but the 
commission will resume its sitting at twelve o’clock to hear 
certain evidence from witnesses whose identity at this 
stage is not to be disclosed.  So the commission will 
resume at twelve – twelve o’clock.  We adjourn. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.  
INQUIRY ADJOURNS

INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  I made some amendments to the draft 
order but I will read the whole order into the record and later 
on ...[indistinct] or that can be arranged.   
1. 
It is recorded that this application was heard 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 7 of 152 
 
without prior notice to affective parties and failure to 
give notice is hereby condoned.  
 
That is 1. 
1.1. 
It is recorded that leave was previously 
granted for the hearing of the application in private 
whereafter the application on behalf of the person 
referred to in these proceedings as Witness 3 was 
postponed pending the delivery of a supplementary 
affidavit and judgment in respect of the application 
on behalf of Witness 1 and Witness 2 was reserved. 
10 
1.2. 
It is recorded that the supplementary affidavit 
in respect of Witness 3 has now been delivered.   
2. 
Having previously heard argument on behalf 
of the applicant and considered the papers, the 
following order is made. 
2.1. 
Condonation is hereby granted that there has 
been no compliance with Rule 3 of the Rules of the 
Commission with regard to furnishing statements or 
affidavits to any person implicated by the evidence of 
the witnesses to be referred to as Witness 1, Witness 
20 
2 and Witness 3. (The three witnesses in Annexure A 
to the application.) 
2.2. 
The Commission’s legal team must, as soon 
as possible, after the evidence of the three witnesses 
has been heard, take necessary steps to ensure that 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 8 of 152 
 
the acting Secretary of the Commission, when she 
has all implicated persons with the appropriately 
redacted affidavits and the transcript of the evidence 
that will be heard from these three witnesses. 
In case you are looking at the draft order Mr Pretorius.  My 3 
would be the previous 2.1. 
3. 
The three witnesses are permitted to give 
evidence to the Commission in accordance with the 
following directives. 
3.1. 
The three witnesses will not present in the 
10 
hearing room at any time. 
3.2. 
For the purpose of the three witnesses, a 
separate location (the protected witness location) will 
be provided. 
3.3. 
The three witnesses will each give their 
evidence from the protected witness location. 
3.4. 
No camera will be permitted in the protected 
witness location. 
3.5. 
An audio link from the protected witness 
location will be provided so that the evidence can be 
20 
heard in the hearing room when the evidence is 
given. 
3.6. 
No persons, other than the Chairperson (if 
and when he considers it appropriate), the relevant 
evidence leaders, those necessary to assist or 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 9 of 152 
 
protect each of the three witnesses when they give 
evidence or any other person permitted specifically 
by the Chairperson will be permitted to enter the 
protected witness location.   
3.7. 
The 
Commission’s 
Safety 
and 
Security 
Advisor 
who 
is 
the 
Head 
of 
Security 
for 
the 
Commission, 
or 
in 
absence 
another 
person 
specifically designated by the Chairperson, will have 
the 
responsibility 
of 
controlling 
access 
to 
the 
protected witness location in terms of this order and 
10 
of ensuring that only the three witnesses and other 
persons permitted in terms of paragraph 3.6 above 
enter it. 
3.8. 
Subject to the usual rules applicable to the 
conduct of the Commission’s proceedings: 
a. 
Members of the public, including the media, 
may be present in the hearing room in such numbers 
as may be directed by the Chairperson. 
b. 
Sound reaching the hearing room via the 
audio link from the protected witness location may be 
20 
broadcast and the proceedings in the hearing room 
may be filmed and broadcasted. 
3.9. 
No photograph or video or other images of the 
three 
witnesses 
maybe 
taken, 
published 
or 
broadcast. 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 10 of 152 
 
3.10. 
No person may photograph or publish any 
photograph or other image of any person engaged in 
and/or responsible for the protection of the three 
witnesses when they give evidence. 
3.11. 
It is recorded that in the presence of the 
Chairperson, the oath was administered to each one 
of the three witnesses earlier today. 
4. 
To 
protect 
the 
identities 
of 
the 
three 
witnesses, the three witnesses shall be respectively 
referred to as: 
10 
4.1. 
Witness 1. 
4.2. 
Witness 2. 
4.3. 
Witness 3. 
5. 
The names and initials of the three witnesses 
shall 
be 
redacted 
from 
all 
affidavits 
and 
documentation and presented in evidence. 
 
No, I think 5 should read the names and initials of the 
three witnesses shall be redacted from all affidavits and 
documentation presented in evidence. 
6. 
Further 
redactions 
and 
corrections, 
when 
20 
necessary, shall be made to the affidavits of the 
three witnesses, which will serve to prevent members 
of the public from readily identifying the witnesses. 
7. 
During the course of the testimony of each of 
the 
three 
witnesses, 
their 
voices 
may 
be 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 11 of 152 
 
electronically distorted so that they would not be 
ordinarily recognisable. 
8. 
Nobody shall directly or indirectly disclose the 
identity of the three witnesses. 
9. 
Annexure 
A 
to 
the 
application 
shall 
be 
removed from the application papers and shall be 
placed in a sealed envelope and kept in safekeeping 
by the Commission and not be made available for 
public disclosure at all. 
10. 
Once the evidence of the three witnesses has 
10 
been given, a transcript of the evidence together with 
the relevant redacted and corrected affidavit of the 
witness, as contemplated in 5 above, will be made 
available to the implicated parties to the extent that I 
may have made an order covering this earlier on, this 
will fall away. 
11. 
This order may be amended or supplemented 
by the Chairperson at any time if, in his opinion, that 
is necessary to ensure the protection of the three 
witnesses or any other person in connection of the 
20 
evidence of the three witnesses or to ensure fairness 
to any implicated person. 
 
That is the order.  So. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you, Chair.  We will prepare a 
typed draft. 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 12 of 152 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And hand it up in due course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I am told that there may be one or 
two numbers that needed adjustment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But that would be in order. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja, no.  As I said also.  I think the 10 
may be a repeat of an earlier one. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...to the extent that it is... the numbering 
might have to change. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, but it will be consistent with 
what you have just put on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes.  Yes, okay.  Thank you.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Chair, may we then, in accordance 
with those directions, call Witness 1? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Good morning Witness 1.  Are you 
available? 
20 
WITNESS 1:  Yes, I am available Chair. [slight distortion 
present] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to repeat what I said earlier on.  All 
the three witnesses have taken the oath.  So there will be no 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 13 of 152 
 
oath administered now. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Just for the record then, 
Witness 1, you have identified yourself to the Chair and you 
confirm that you have taken the oath. 
WITNESS 1:  Yes ...[indistinct] [distortion present] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  Witness 1, you have before 
you an affidavit.  It is marked Exhibit BB14A.  Do you have 
that in front of you? 
WITNESS 1:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Will you go to page ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I wonder whether we should test whether 
we can hear clearly what he is saying.  I am not sure that I 
can hear quite clearly.   
 
I hear the voice but the actual words... I do not know 
whether you want to just ask him something and we listen so 
that if there is something that can be done to improve that, it 
can be done. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Witness 1, can you hear us 
clearly? 
WITNESS 1:  Yes, I can. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, that was better. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And if you would speak very slowly, 
please?  Because your voice has been distorted and for us 
to hear you, you would have to speak very slowly and 
clearly.  Is that in order? 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 14 of 152 
 
WITNESS 1:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Please go to page 21 of 
Exhibit BB14A. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Shall we first Mr Pretorius what bundle this 
will be called? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, Chair.  The three statements are 
included in a bundle marked Exhibit BB14 which is part of 
the sequence of that particular category of evidence.  The 
bundle is now Transnet 1. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I think let us call the bundle, Bundle 
Transnet 1 and then, of course, the statements will be 
exhibit... each one will have its own exhibit number. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Witness 1, will you please go to page 
21.  You will see a signature that has been redacted but do 
you recall attesting to this affidavit? 
WITNESS 1:  Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  As far as you are concerned 
20 
and subject to any corrections and redactions that we might 
make during the course of your evidence, are the contents of 
this affidavit true and correct? 
WITNESS 1:  Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Chair, may we then admit Exhibit 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 15 of 152 
 
BB14A? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The affidavit of the witness, Witness 1, 
appear in the bundle of Transnet 1 at page 1, is admitted 
and is to be marked as Exhibit BB14? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  As Exhibit BB14.  Ja. 
AFFIDAVIT OF WITNESS 1 IS ADMITTED AND MARKED AS 
EXHIBIT BB14 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Witness 1, you are employed in the 
Transnet Group in a senior security position.  Am I correct? 
10 
WITNESS 1:  That is correct, Chair. [distortion present] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And you have been employed in one 
or other capacity in the Security Division of Transnet since 
when? 
WITNESS 1:  1989 Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  1989?  Is that correct? 
WITNESS 1:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You have done relevant training, 
which we need not detail, but as referred to in your affidavit 
in paragraphs 4 and 5. 
20 
WITNESS 1:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  If we go over the page to 
page 1005, you will see there that the duties of a Close 
Protection Officer or the duties entailed in Close Protection 
are set out.  Briefly, will you tell the Chair what these duties 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 16 of 152 
 
are? 
WITNESS 1:  [Indistinct] [distortion present]  The duties of a 
Close 
Protection 
Officer 
is 
to 
provide 
security(?) 
...[indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on Witness 1. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  They are going to reduce the 
distortion Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If you will just pause for a moment 
Witness 1.  We are going to try and adjust the distortion so 
10 
that you can be heard at all. 
WITNESS 1:  [No audible reply]  
COMMISSION TEAM MEMBER:  Please try and speak with 
Witness 1. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Witness 1, if you would speak very 
slowly, please? 
WITNESS 1:  [Indistinct] [distortion present] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you want Witness 1 to say something 
so that you hear whether it is fine now or...? 
COMMISSION TEAM MEMBER:  [No audible reply]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Witness 1, just say something so that we 
can hear whether you are clearly audible. 
WITNESS 1:  Ja, I have just said that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
WITNESS 1:  [Indistinct] is to protect a ...[indistinct] 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 17 of 152 
 
[distortion present] and then it is to make sure that the 
principles takes place in a safe environment. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I do not know if that is sufficient 
Chair.  We are in communication with the technicians. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I think when he started the sentence, 
it seemed fine and then later one it was not fine. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, it did not improve at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The transcribers are making signs.  I do 
not know whether they want him to say something? 
COMMISSION TEAM MEMBER:  [No audible reply]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just say something Witness 1 again.  Just 
say one sentence.  Any sentence. 
COMMISSION TEAM MEMBER:  We are just trying to 
reconnect the call.  Chair, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
COMMISSION TEAM MEMBER:  There we go.  Witness 1, 
can you please say something? 
WITNESS 1:  [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Just say, “I am giving evidence today”. 
WITNESS 1:  I am giving evidence today. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It is a little better. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What I have done Chair is try to 
communicate with the technicians in order to lower the 
amount of distortions involved. 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 18 of 152 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  But I want him to just repeat because 
the first few words are clear but then towards the end of the 
sentence it seems to... 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just say again Witness 1:  “Today I am 
giving evidence”. 
WITNESS 1:  Today I am giving evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That...I think that was better. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, and again, Witness 1, as slow 
as you can manage. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Perhaps you could start again and 
tell the Chair what Close Protection involves? 
WITNESS 1:  Close Protection [distortion present] in all 
...[indistinct] [distortion present] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  No, Chair it is not sufficient. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If you would just pause there Witness 
1? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We either going to have to remove 
the distortion or lower it to a degree that you can be heard 
because you are breaking up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Chair ...[intervenes]  
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 19 of 152 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you want me to adjourn? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Let us take a five minute break. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I will take a five minute adjournment.  
We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   We will take the lunch adjournment just to 
allow whatever needs to be done to be done.  We could 
come back at quarter to but maybe we should just make it 
two.  Mr Pretorius? 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Quarter to two is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Quarter to two is fine? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I guess we could go beyond four 
o’clock as well. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Please if we could. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  We will resume at quarter to 
two.  We adjourn. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you.

INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have the problems been sorted out? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes so far so good Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Then we can – we can proceed. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes thank you Chair.  Witness 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 20 of 152 
 
number 1 can you hear me? 
WITNESS 1:  Chair I can hear you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Good thank you. If you would speak 
slowly please.  You were dealing with the meaning of close 
protection and what close protection involved.  Would you 
tell the Chair please? 
WITNESS 1:  Yes.  Close protection referred as for security 
and risk mitigation measures taken to ensure the safety of a 
VIP or individuals who may be exposed to elevated personal 
risk because of their employment. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And what do the duties involve? 
WITNESS 1:  The duties of a [indistinct 00:01:50] is to make 
sure that you do the advance which is called reconnaissance 
before you take your boss or your principle to the venue.  
You make sure that you have the alternative routes, the 
primary, the secondary and the contingency route in case of 
emergency. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The other duties very briefly? 
WITNESS 1:  The other duties is to drive the principle 
around to his or her meetings or to the other operational 
20 
venues.  The other duties of a protection officer is to make 
sure that the principles meetings take place in a safe 
environment. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  How many close protection 
officers are employed in the various divisions of Transnet? 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 21 of 152 
 
WITNESS 1:  At present we have 19 protectors. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes and as a senior protection 
person within Transnet you performed several duties, they 
are listed in paragraph 8 of your affidavit.  We need not deal 
with them now but if you would just tell us please in terms of 
the Transnet Group Executive Protection Policy who is 
entitled to close protection services? 
WITNESS 1:  The Group Chief Executive and the Group 
Financial Officer of Transnet they are entitled to the close 
protection unconditionally.  But with the other executives of 
10 
Transnet there will have to be risk around them and then the 
threat and risk assessment will be conducted to mitigate 
their risk or also to find out that there is a risk before we can 
deploy a close protector. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you.  Did you perform close 
protection duties and act as a driver for any Transnet 
executive officer? 
WITNESS 1:  Yes I have done that [indistinct 00:04:24] for 
the then GCE Mr Brian Molefe. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So did you act as a close protection 
20 
officer and as a driver or either one of them? 
WITNESS 1:  For both of them Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You mean both protection and 
driving? 
WITNESS 1:  That is correct Chair. 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 22 of 152 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And for what period? 
WITNESS 1:  For a period of four years – almost four – let 
me see – yes four years, almost four years because I started 
working with Mr Molefe in 2011 until July 2014. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And at that time where was the 
Transnet head office? 
WITNESS 1:  At that time the Transnet head office was at 
the Carlton Centre in Johannesburg CBD.

WITNESS 1:  In protecting and driving Mr Molefe I would 
pick him up at his residence every morning and take him to 
the office at the Carlton and also to the other venues of his 
meetings.  Then later I will take him home after the 
completion of his daily duty. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Would you receive any 
information from Mr Molefe’s office in regard to your duties 
for the following week or Mr Molefe’s diary for the following 
week? 
WITNESS 1:  Yes I would receive it from Mr Molefe’s PA. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
WITNESS 1:  The diary for the whole week.  That also helps 
me – it gives me time to plan for the week and to know about 
his whereabouts at least a day before. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  During the period that you 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 23 of 152

Mercedes Benz E350 registration number BH58HNGP.  And 
then 
the 
other

CR37NPGP.  All those cars – all those cars had logbooks, 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 24 of 152

CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That is correct we will refer to the

you were saying page 9 I was looking all over because I did 
not see the black numbers. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Okay Chair.  Yes apparently, I am 
aware of the fact that those must really be on the right-hand 
side but we did not have time to do it here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no, no that is fine.  It is just that for the 
reader of the transcript later.

ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.

10 
any other occasion to transport Mr Molefe to the Gupta

WITNESS 1:  No, no because we – I had another colleague 
joined to come and help me because the hours were very 
long for me so I had to request another [indistinct 00:24:44]

ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  This table that appears on 
pages 8 to 10 have you checked the information on this table 
with the records in your logbook which are annexed to the – 
to your affidavit? 
20 
WITNESS 1:  Yes.

very clear.  Are those in the right-hand columns? 
WITNESS 1:  They are.  They are clear.  We arrived at the 
Guptas at 18:00 and we left at 18:40. 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 37 of 152 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So you would leave the previous 
destination and you would arrive at 18:00 if that is the right-
hand column next to the name Saxon. 
WITNESS 1:  Next to ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And then you would leave at 18:40, 
which is the time you would start driving and that is in the 
fourth line.  Is that right? 
WITNESS 1:  That is correct, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  So you say you have 
checked all the entries on this table with the entries in your 
10 
log... they coincide.  And it is an accurate record in the table 
as reflected in the logbook? 
WITNESS 1:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If we move to paragraph 23 of your 
affidavit.  Did Mr Molefe tell you anything about the trips to 
the Gupta residence? 
WITNESS 1:  Paragraph 23? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
WITNESS 1:  Can you repeat your question Chair?

going to the Gupta’s residence or why he was going to the

WITNESS 1:  No, no, no.  He did not tell me. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Did he mention any names? 
WITNESS 1:  He only mentioned the name of a person that 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 38 of 152 
 
he was going to [distortion present] there because we on our 
arrival at the main gate, the security officers would ask me 
who are we visiting.  Then Mr Molefe will just tell them that 
we are here to see Ajay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Is that Ajay? 
WITNESS 1:  He never told me why? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  [laughs]  Sorry, the connection is not 
very good.  When you say AJ, can you spell it please? 
WITNESS 1:  Yes, it is Alpha ...[indistinct] Alpha Yankee.  It 
is A-J-A-Y.

ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you.  How long did these visits 
last, the visits to Saxon World?

WITNESS 1:  Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Who was he visiting? 
WITNESS 1:  He was visiting Mr Ajay Gupta. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  And what would happen at

sometimes carried something with him...” 
 
What was that?

ADV PRETORIUS SC:  ...shows the same backpack or a

Page 42 of 152 
 
describe it?  Or is there a picture of it? 
WITNESS 1:  It was a leather bag but it was a bit dark-
brown.  It was not a light-brown bag.  It was like... it was 
[distortion present] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Can you go to page 58, please? 
WITNESS 1:  Yes.  Chair, I am on page 58. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, do you see the picture on page 
58? 
WITNESS 1:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What is depicted there?  What do we 
10 
see there on page 58? 
WITNESS 1:  It is a leather light-brown... it is a leather 
brown bag. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
WITNESS 1:  The same as the bag as Mr Molefe used to 
sometimes come out when he [distortion present] of the 
Guptas. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Was the bag that he gave you to deliver to 
Mr Ajay Gupta similar to the one at page 58? 
20 
WITNESS 1:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
WITNESS 1:  And the [distortion present] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat that. 
WITNESS 1:  I am saying, even the sides is similar. 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 43 of 152 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Even the sides were similar. 
WITNESS 1:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If you look at page 60, please.  Then 
we are looking at the black numbers. 
WITNESS 1:  I am at page 60 Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  You see there is an extract from 
a logbook what appears to be an extract from a logbook? 
WITNESS 1:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Do you recognise this page? 
10 
WITNESS 1:  Yes, I recognise. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What entry is relevant to the 
evidence 
you 
are 
giving 
now 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
18t h of January 2012? 
WITNESS 1:  On my log sheet, I recorded that I delivered the 
bag at Midrand at Sahara offices. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  The last entry on the page 
against the date 18t h of January 2012, says Midrand Sahara 
as the destination. 
WITNESS 1:  Yes. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Is that correct? 
WITNESS 1:  Yes, that is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And then it says, “reason for use” 
and the entry there appears to be to deliver a bag.  Do you 
see that? 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 44 of 152 
 
WITNESS 1:  That is one.  That is correct.  Yes, I can see 
that.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And the other details, what are they? 
WITNESS 1:  On the same page? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, just straight along that line. 
WITNESS 1:  Oh, the other detail... okay the other details.  I 
went to... okay, to Centurion Standard Bank to collect his 
fuel card.  I was instructed by him to go and collect his fuel 
card. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Oh.  No, it is ...[intervenes]  
10 
WITNESS 1:  It is [distortion present] entry of Midrand 
Sahara ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
WITNESS 1:  ...at the back(?) [distortion present] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Okay and then the last entry, 
18t h of January 2012, Midrand Sahara to deliver a bag.  The 
number 31337, what is that? 
WITNESS 1:  Are the kilometres [distortion present] that I 
was using.  On my 
arrival, that was the 
kilometres 
...[indistinct] [distortion present] 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  And then the time? 
WITNESS 1:  The time of arrival was 11... was 11:13.  I left 
Centurion the Standard Bank at 10:50 and arrived in Sahara 
Computers in Midrand at 11;13. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  So those times reflect the 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 45 of 152 
 
time of the trip in question.  Is that correct? 
WITNESS 1:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Did you ever meet Mr Ajay 
Gupta at any other place or on any other occasion that you 
recall? 
WITNESS 1:  Yes, I did meet with him in 2012 at the ANC 
Conference in Bloemfontein. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  You see him there, did you? 
WITNESS 1:  Yes, I saw him there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Who was he with? 
10 
WITNESS 1:  He was mister... he was with Mr Brian Molefe. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  If you would go to page 62, 
please? 
WITNESS 1:  I am on page 62 Chair. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
Who 
is 
the 
person 
in 
that 
photograph? 
WITNESS 1:  The person on the photograph is Mr Ajay 
Gupta. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  During your visits to the 
Gupta residence, did you see any other members of the 
20 
executive ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  Witness 1, a lot 
of people have said that they could not tell the one brother 
from another among the Gupta brothers, especially Mr Ajay 
Gupta and, I think, Mr Atul Gupta.  Are you certain that the 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 46 of 152 
 
picture at page 62 is a picture of Mr Ajay Gupta and not Atul 
Gupta? 
WITNESS 1:  I am definitely sure Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  On the occasions that you drove Mr 
Molefe to the Gupta residence, did you recognise any other 
government officials or members of the executive there? 
WITNESS 1:  Yes, I have met with the former Public 
Enterprise Minister, Malusi Gigaba.  I have seen him at the 
Gupta residence one day.  And the other gentleman 
10 
...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Anyone else? 
WITNESS 1:  [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Anyone else? 
WITNESS 1:  Can you repeat?  And ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Did you see anybody else there 
besides Mr Gigaba? 
WITNESS 1:  It was Mr Siyabonga Mhlango. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Mhlango?  Yes.  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Mr Siyabonga who? 
20 
WITNESS 1:  Mhlango. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If one goes on then in your statement 
to paragraph 32, you describe an incident that happened in 
or near the main boardroom at the Carlton Centre.  Is that 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 47 of 152 
 
the main Transnet boardroom? 
WITNESS 1:  Yes, the boardroom is on the 49t h floor. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  What happened on that 
occasion that you described in paragraph 32 and following. 
WITNESS 1:  there was a meeting at the boardroom and my 
principal ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry, did you say paragraph 32 or 42?   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, 32. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  32.  Okay alright. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Did I say 42? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  32. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Continue Witness 1. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What happened on that occasion 
Witness 1? 
WITNESS 1:  Okay.  Usually when there are meetings in the 
... on the 49t h floor in the big boardroom, I would position 
myself next to the door so that I stop anyone who can come 
20 
in and interrupt the meetings. 
 
While I was standing there, Mr Molefe just came to me at 
the board to say, “No, look.  Go to my bag and go and collect 
my cell phone in my bag in the office”.   
 
As 
instructed 
[distortion 
present] 
his 
office 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 48 of 152 
 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  This was at the Carlton Centre or where 
was it? 
WITNESS 1:  It was in the Carlton Centre.  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Continue. 
WITNESS 1:  I went as instructed to go and collect the cell 
phone.  When I opened his light-brown leather backpack to 
take out a cell phone, I was surprised to see the bag that 
was more half with the bundles of two hundred notes.  I then 
...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  With R 200,00 notes? 
WITNESS 1:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
WITNESS 1:  I then called his PA [distortion present] PA and 
showed her the cash in the bag and said... I just said:  
“Look, you should make sure that nobody comes in here 
because should something get... should this money get lost, 
it will be me and you who will have to be answerable.  So 
just make sure”.  I called the PA.  The PA came and then I 
showed her the money. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  The light-brown leather 
backpack that you refer to ...[intervenes]  
WITNESS 1:  Yes? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  ...is that the same backpack that you 
mentioned earlier as a light-brown leather backpack or a 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 49 of 152 
 
different one? 
WITNESS 1:  It is the same one. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:    You mention in paragraph 32 about how 
much money you saw there in relation to the size of the 
bag.  Do you want to tell me exactly how much?  Not in 
terms of what the amount was but how much money was in 
the bag that you saw?  You do say in paragraph 2. 
WITNESS 1:   Difficult for me to say – to give you the 
exact amount but …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no, I am not saying say the 
amount. 
WITNESS 1:   It was …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was it like a quarter in the bag, was it 
full, was it half in the bag?  Are you able to …[intervenes] 
WITNESS 1:   It was half. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
WITNESS 1:   It was half a bag, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the bag we are talking about is the 
leather backpack similar one that we saw earlier on, is that 
20 
right? 
WITNESS 1:   That is correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And when you saw this money on the 
day was that still close to the day when Mr Molefe had 
instructed you to deliver a bag to Mr Ajay Gupta or this 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 50 of 152 
 
was a completely different day, on another day, if some 
other time? 
WITNESS 1:   It was a different day, I cannot call the 
period how far was that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
WITNESS 1:   But a different day, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Just to assist the Chair, if you 
were to take those 200 notes out of the bag and put them 
on a table without flattening the pile at all, how high would 
10 
that pile be?  You can just tell me in centimetres, more or 
less. 
WITNESS 1:   I would say 30 centimetres. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   20 centimetres. 
WITNESS 1:   30, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   30?   
WITNESS 1:   Yes, 30, 30. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay.  And the backpack you are 
referring to, that is the same backpack that you referred to 
in paragraph 26, am I correct? 
20 
WITNESS 1:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, the one depicted on page 
55. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not 26, ja.  Page 55, witness 1, is that 
the type of bag that had the money that you saw on that 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 51 of 152 
 
day? 
WITNESS 1:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Did Mr Molefe return from 
the meeting at any stage on this day and did you speak to 
him? 
WITNESS 1:   Yes, Chair, upon his return from the 
meeting, when he got into his office, I approached him 
about the fact that he was carrying that backpack I 
considered a safety risk for both of us. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say you approached him? 
WITNESS 1:   Yes, I asked him about the other cash 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
WITNESS 1:   I said it is – ja, it is risky for him to travel 
with that kind of money, it is risky for both of us.  Mr 
Molefe was visibly upset, sorry …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, he was? 
WITNESS 1:   He was …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Witness 1, you approached 
20 
Mr Molefe because you were concerned about the amount 
of cash that you had seen in the bag, is that right? 
WITNESS 1:   Yes and our safety, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because you thought it posed a threat to 
the safety of both of you. 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 52 of 152 
 
WITNESS 1:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what did you say to him when you 
approached him? 
WITNESS 1:   I just said I noticed that there is money in 
your bag when you asked me to go and collect your 
[indistinct – jump in recording] and I said I think it is a 
security risk to carry such amount because if we were to 
stopped at may the road block maybe, you know, the cops 
will ask us about this and then also it is a security risk 
because maybe where you got it from, if you got it from the 
10 
bank, you will never know, you might be marked, someone 
one to rob us, then that puts our life at risk and he was 
very upset with my comment. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did he say anything to you? 
WITNESS 1:   Yes, he said it is none of my business what 
is in his bag. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Did you ever have 
occasion to run errands on behalf of Mr Molefe to the 
banks? 
WITNESS 1:   Yes, yes, I deposit money for him at ABSA 
20 
bank, at the Carlton, Nedbank and Standard Bank at the 
Carlton Centre in various accounts. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And did these trips to the bank 
involve similar dates in the month? 
WITNESS 1:   Yes, usually I would make deposits between 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 53 of 152 
 
the 28 t h of the month and the – between the 28 t h and the 
5 t h. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  And what did you deposit?  
Cheques or cash? 
WITNESS 1:   No, I used to deposit cash. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Sorry, what did you deposit? 
WITNESS 1:   Cash. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Cash. 
WITNESS 1:   Not – yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And the amounts that you 
10 
deposited, what did they amount to, what were they? 
WITNESS 1:   The amounts were between 5 000 and 20 
grand. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, and who gave you the 
money? 
WITNESS 1:   At times you will hand over the money to his 
PA and ask the PA to give me the money and go and 
deposit to the bank but also at times he will call me and 
say just come through, take this money and go and deposit 
in the bank for me. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Now prior to your giving 
evidence, have you ever been threatened? 
WITNESS 1:   Yes, I have. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   On page 13 you describe what is 
called the first threat.  Tell the Chair about that please? 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 54 of 152 
 
WITNESS 1:   Yes.  I received on Monday 9 June 2019 at 
21.20, I received a threat, a message on my official phone. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Sorry, before you go there.  Go 
back to page 13 please?  Are you at page 13? 
WITNESS 1:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And under the heading:  First 
Threat you describe an incident that happened during 
2018.   
WITNESS 1:   That is correct, Chair, that is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Just very briefly, what did you do 
10 
at the time of the incident or what had you just done at the 
time of the incident? 
WITNESS 1:   It was after I was interviewed by the 
investigators from Fundudzi Forensic Services. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right you were interviewed by 
Fundudzi Forensic Services and what happened after that? 
WITNESS 1:    After that I received a telephone call and a 
male with an African accent – I received a call on Transnet 
cellular phone.  He stated:  We know where you live.  And 
then he dropped the phone. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you approach Fundudzi 
Forensic Services to ask them whether they had told 
anyone that you had been interviewed by them? 
WITNESS 1:   Yes, I did. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And what were you told? 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 55 of 152 
 
WITNESS 1:   The investigator said he has never shared 
my statement or my meetings with anyone. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did that particular matter end 
there? 
WITNESS 1:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Over the page on page 14 you 
refer and testified to what you say in the heading is the 
second threat.  What happened on that day that you have 
spoken about earlier, 9 June 2019? 
WITNESS 1:   On the 8 April 2019 and again on 4 June 
10 
2019 I was interviewed by investigators from the Judicial 
Commission of Inquiry and …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That is this Commission, the State 
Capture Commission, is it? 
WITNESS 1:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  And what happened on 
Monday 9 June 2019/ 
WITNESS 1:   On the Monday the 9 June 2019 at 21.20 I 
received a short message from …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is an SMS, is it? 
20 
WITNESS 1:   Cellular number. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right and did you keep that 
message or a printout of that message? 
WITNESS 1:   Yes, I did. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And what did the message read? 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 56 of 152 
 
WITNESS 1:   It said: 
“Witness 1, if you know what is good for you, I 
command you not to give any further evidence to 
the Zondo Commission or else just know that we are 
watching your every move.  We even know where 
you stay, so watch out and be warned.” 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now when you say Witness 1, as 
being part of the message service, I understand it was 
actually your name in the message, is that correct? 
WITNESS 1:   That is correct. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright. 
WITNESS 1:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you report that threat to the 
South African Police Service? 
WITNESS 1:    Yes, I reported the abovementioned threat 
at the police. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you go to page 64 what is that 
that appears on that page? 
WITNESS 1:   64.  Okay, I am just paging through, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Remember we are with the black 
20 
numbers. 
WITNESS 1:   Yes.  Oh yes, that is the message that I 
received. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That is the message you have just 
referred to is it? 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 57 of 152 
 
WITNESS 1:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And then you talk again at 
paragraph 45 of the third threat.  Briefly, what happened 
there? 
WITNESS 1:   In paragraph 45 I received a threat, it was 
on the 13 January 2020 in my first day back at the office 
after returning from annual leave.  I received a threat via 
SMS on my work cellular phone at 10.52. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And are you able to read the 
threat? 
10 
WITNESS 1:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you look at page 66, what is that 
on page 66? 
WITNESS 1:   Yes, the SMS that I had received reads as 
follows: 
“We are fully aware that you are about to give 
evidence at the Zondo Commission again and you 
have intimidated other CPO’s bodyguards to give a 
testimony as well.  As we are sorry to inform you 
that you are being used and you are on your own.  
20 
If you love your life I advise you to resign and 
disappear.  We have exposed MNS and Bobo and 
Bobo is next and who do you think you are?  You 
are on your own.  Stop it with your moronic 
Superman behaviour.  We are watching your every 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 58 of 152 
 
move, your conversations, so act sensibly and give 
this matter your most urgent attention.  When we 
are done with you, your family will not find a piece 
of you.” 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, did you again report that 
incident and threat to the South African Police Service? 
WITNESS 1:   That is correct, Chair, I did. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Then in paragraph 50 you relate 
and incident where you were followed by what you describe 
as suspect vehicles or you relate incidents, rather.  The 
10 
first incident being at paragraph 51.  It is not necessary to 
go to all the detail there but what did you see on the 24 
June 2019 when you were travelling on the M1 South? 
WITNESS 1:   I was followed by a Polo, a grey Polo – 
sorry, with no registration plates. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Just look at the heading, was it 
grey or white?  What is your recollection?  Look at the 
heading on page 16. 
WITNESS 1:   Yes, it was grey, it was a grey, the VW Polo. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So white is incorrect, is it? 
20 
WITNESS 1:   Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.  On page 12, 
paragraph 50. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No, look, we are on page 16, black 
numbers. 
WITNESS 1:   Ja.  Okay, on 15 …[intervenes] 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 59 of 152 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay, no, no, no, you are quite 
right, let me not interfere with your evidence.  You tell the 
Chair what you have in paragraph 50. 
WITNESS 1:   Okay, since I received and SMS discussed in 
paragraph 42 above: 
“I noticed on three occasions that I was being 
followed by two different vehicles, namely a white 
VW Polo twice.” 
And then page 16: 
“And a grey VW Polo once, both without registration 
10 
plates.” 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright and I do not think it is 
necessary to go into the detail but from the nature of the 
incidence incurred what did you conclude?  What did you 
think was happening? 
WITNESS 1:   You know, as a trained security person I 
thought 
that 
I 
was 
under 
surveillance, 
I 
was 
being 
followed. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, did you – will you go to 
paragraph 59, that is the second instance of being 
20 
followed.  Did you keep any notes or make any notes of 
that incident? 
WITNESS 1:   Yes, on paragraph – oh ja, yes, yes, I did. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And if we go to page  - just bear 
with me for a moment, to page 69, is there anything on this 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 60 of 152 
 
– what is this page, at page 69?   
WITNESS 1:   On page 69, I made a note on the official – 
on the logbook of the official vehicle that I am using for 
official duties when I was followed by the white Polo.  I 
made …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Where is that entry? 
WITNESS 1:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Where is that entry on page 69? 
WITNESS 1:   It is on the – it is the last line of the log 
sheet.  It was the 24/06/19 when I made a note, that white 
10 
Polo, that is when I was followed by the white Polo. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Is that in the bottom left hand 
corner?  You have got White P there. 
WITNESS 1:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And the next …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  The note you made does not 
say you were followed by a car but you made a note that – 
I do not know if there is VTH and then TE and then P.  Is 
that the note you are referring to? 
WITNESS 1:   Yes, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   That seems to me like a code, code 
language for something or an abbreviation.  Is it VTH and 
if it is, what does it represent?  Of course, if it represents 
– well, if you are able to say without… 
WITNESS 1:   Chair, I wrote White P, meaning the white 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 61 of 152

Page 74 of 152 
 
translated there as shady stuff.  It might not be exactly the 
same, it might have a wider meaning but I think for present 
purposes we can accept that that translation is not far from 
it.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Good.  In paragraph 14 witness

WITNESS 2:      On one occasion with the visits to the 
Gupta residence Mr Gama came to the vehicle and alerted 
me that somebody will approach me bringing something to 
me I must open up the back side of the vehicle and put it in 
there.  A few minutes later which could have been ten 
minutes or so…[intervenes]

ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Did you say anything to either Mr 
Gama or Mr Jiyane in relation to what you had seen inside 
10 
the suitcase? 
WITNESS 2:  No Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You go in your statement to describe 
certain incidents that took place at Melrose Arch.  Would you 
tell the Chair about that please?  Or about those incidents. 
WITNESS 2:  On the trips to the Melrose Arch we – I would 
transport Mr Gama on most occasions drop him off at the 
African Pride Hotel with an instruction that I must go to the 
residence part of Melrose Arch and meet a gentleman that I 
somehow got acquainted to that handed me on one occasion 
20 
a plastic bag. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright we will come to the detail in a 
moment Witness number 2.  This gentleman did you come to 
learn his name? 
WITNESS 2:  Yes. 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 81 of 152 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What was his name? 
WITNESS 2:  I conducted my own finding only to confirm that 
it was the gentleman that was being mentioned in the news 
as Mr Essa. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  How do you spell that?  How do you 
spell that name? 
WITNESS 2:  Essa would be E-s-s-a. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Would you look please at 
page 101?   
WITNESS 2:  I am on page 101. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  There is a photograph there who is 
that in the photograph? 
WITNESS 2:  It is the very same gentleman that I have 
identified as Mr Essa. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right is he the same person with 
whom you engaged at Melrose Arch? 
WITNESS 2:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  On the occasions that you are going 
to tell the Chair about now? 
WITNESS 2:  Correct. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  You describe an incident that 
occurred on the 13 June 2017 would you tell the Chair about 
that incident please? 
WITNESS 2:  On the 13 June 2017 Mr Gama asked me to 
collect a parcel from Mr Essa at Melrose Apartments and 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 82 of 152 
 
thereafter once I have collected, he came up at the front 
door of the African Pride Hotel in Melrose Arch. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Having received that instruction what 
did you do? 
WITNESS 2:  I drove to the apartment side parking and 
waited to receive the package.  Upon Mr Essa walking 
towards me I met him at the back of the vehicle, opened up 
and received the package and stored it in the boot of the 
vehicle. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Please look at page 103?   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am on page 103. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What do you see in that photograph? 
WITNESS 2:  A striped plastic bag. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And how does that bag shown there 
relate to the story you are now telling us? 
WITNESS 2:  Correct Chair confirms and relates to the detail 
that I have just mentioned. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  So the bag that Mr Essa 
brought to you is it similar to the bag depicted in the 
photograph? 
20 
WITNESS 2:  Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What did you do with the bag? 
WITNESS 2:  I placed it in the back compartment of the car 
which is the boot, secured it and drove towards the front of 
the hotel and picked up Mr Gama. 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 83 of 152 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Now did you stay with the 
vehicle for the next few hours? 
WITNESS 2:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  What happened after you had 
collected Mr Gama at the entrance of the hotel? 
WITNESS 2:  I transported Mr Gama to Bryanston. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Sorry I have just been alerted 
to the fact that you have described the person who handed 
the bag to you as Mr Essa.  Can you recall his first name or 
did you know his first name or do you know his first name? 
10 
WITNESS 2:  Salim. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Say that again please? 
WITNESS 2:  Salim. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Salim.  Okay let us go back to… 
WITNESS 2:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I am sorry.  You wanted to say 
something I interrupted you. 
WITNESS 2:  No I was confirming the first name as Salim. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right thank you.  Alright let us go on 
with the events of that evening.  You collected Mr Gama at 
20 
the entrance of the hotel to which you have referred.   
WITNESS 2:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Let us just look at annexure W2 06 
we can – page 105.  What do we see here? 
WITNESS 2:  We see a timeline that was captured by my 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 84 of 152 
 
movements through Google Map. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And captured on what device? 
WITNESS 2:  A cell phone device. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  And in the middle of that page 
one sees Melrose Arch and a time? 
WITNESS 2:  Yes Chair. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
How 
do 
we 
interrupt 
those 
references?  What do they mean? 
WITNESS 2:  The references confirm the detail that I have 
just given. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Okay. 
WITNESS 2:  To the commission. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  So you collected Mr Gama 
what happened then? 
WITNESS 2:  I collected Mr Gama and then we proceeded to 
Bryanston. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right and at Bryanston did you meet 
a person? 
WITNESS 2:  Yes a close friend of his. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  And if one looks at W2 06 
20 
what do you see there on page 105?  Am I correct?  
WITNESS 2:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What does that show you page 105? 
WITNESS 2:  It shows me a pattern of my movements. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry let us go to 106 we have been 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 85 of 152 
 
to 105. 
WITNESS 2:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Let us go to page 106 what do we 
see there? 
WITNESS 2:  That was the 13 June 2017. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes and in the shaded area two thirds 
the way down the page. 
WITNESS 2:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  There appears to be an address, 
what place was that? 
10 
WITNESS 2:  That was the residence in Bryanston, Sandton. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  The address to which you 
drove? 
WITNESS 2:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The exact address?  Oh, I see yes at 
the bottom of the page. 
WITNESS 2:  Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Let us just go back to 
paragraph 25.  I understand your records confirm that you 
went from Melrose Arch to an address – was it Sandton or 
20 
Bryanston? 
WITNESS 2:  It is Bryanston. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  At the bottom of the page. 
WITNESS 2:  Yes it written as in Bryanston.  I think it falls 
under the area Sandton.  But it is Bryanston. 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 86 of 152 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes okay good.  Let us go to the next 
paragraph, paragraph 25.  At this address in Bryanston, 
Sandton what happened? 
WITNESS 2:  After arriving at the residence, I waited in the 
vehicle for a few hours.  At some point, Mr Gaba came out of 
the residence and asked me to open up the back of the 
vehicle and pull out the plastic bag that we had collected 
earlier.  He opened it up and started the cash that was 
stacked inside ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Did you ...[intervenes]  
10 
WITNESS 2:  ...cut it in half. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I am sorry.  Before you go on Witness 
2.  Did you see inside the bag? 
WITNESS 2:  Yes, as he opened it, I identified ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Do you remember the denomination 
or did you notice the denomination? 
WITNESS 2:  Yes, they were R 200,00 notes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And again, was the bag half-full, 
complete full? 
WITNESS 2:  It was a quarter full. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  A quarter full?  Right. 
WITNESS 2:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And what did you observe or what did 
you do when the bag had been opened? 
WITNESS 2:  I observed him splitting the cash into two, half-
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 87 of 152 
 
half, calculating it in stacks and later handed me what I 
confirmed later when I got home, which was R 50 000,00 
...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  During this ...[intervenes]  
WITNESS 2:  ...that he ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I am sorry, Witness 2.  During this 
process, were you able to estimate how much money was in 
the bag? 
WITNESS 2:  I presume it could have been a million rand. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  And how did you calculate or 
10 
conclude that it was a million rand approximately? 
WITNESS 2:  Because he... because in the calculation when 
he was putting the stacks and dividing them, I kind of 
assisted him ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you. 
WITNESS 2:  ...in the calculation. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  What did he do with the 
money that was left over after giving you the R 50 000,00? 
WITNESS 2:  He handed me ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Pretorius and Witness 2.  
20 
Why did he give you R 50 000,00?  Did he say why he was 
giving you that money? 
WITNESS 2:  He never specifically said.  He just gave it to 
me.  I assumed it was just thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was ...[intervenes]  
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 88 of 152 
 
WITNESS 2:  Or ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it... it was not money that he was 
going to ask you to give back to him at any stage? 
WITNESS 2:  No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you... was your understanding that he 
was just giving you the money for you to use it as you so fit? 
WITNESS 2:  Can you please repeat Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it your understanding that he was 
giving you the money so that it would be your money which 
you could use as you so fit? 
10 
WITNESS 2:  That was my understanding Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He did not say anything in particular about 
the purpose of the R 50 000,00, did he? 
WITNESS 2:  He did not give an instruction. So he just 
handed it to me and I thanked him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he never asked for it back? 
WITNESS 2:  Never Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Yes, you may continue Mr 
Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You say, Witness 2, that he divided 
20 
the money and he gave you R 50 000,00.  What happened to 
the one million rand, approximately, that had been divided? 
WITNESS 2:  What... he placed it in a sports bag and took it 
back into the residence and the rest, the remainder, we took 
it with to his residence in Kyalami, Midrand. 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 89 of 152 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What did you do with the money that 
was given to you? 
WITNESS 2:  I used it for myself or the project of building. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  What were you building? 
WITNESS 2:  I was building my residence. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  At the bottom of page 86 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  One second Mr Pretorius.  After you... 
after Mr Gama had given you that money, R 50 000,00.  Did 
you keep it as cash without putting it into your bank account 
10 
or did you first put it into your bank account before you used 
it? 
WITNESS 2:  I never placed... I did not put it in my account 
Chair.  I used it as I was in the process of building my 
residence.  So it was cash on hand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  So you used it as cash until 
it was finished? 
WITNESS 2:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Good.  Witness 2, on page 86, at the 
20 
bottom of the page, paragraph 27, you relate another 
incident that you say occurred on the 13t h of July 2017.  
What happened on that occasion? 
WITNESS 2:  On that occasion, it was the same modus 
operandi of me dropping him off at the hotel, driving to the 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 90 of 152 
 
apartments and parking at the residence parking and 
receiving the package from Mr Essa.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  What did this package look 
like? 
WITNESS 2:  It was a wrapped plastic bag. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Different or similar to the one 
that you described earlier.   
WITNESS 2:  No, it was not of that magnitude. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Not as big? 
WITNESS 2:  It could have been a carry bag with a stack of 
10 
notes and folded. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  So you went to... with Mr 
Gama to Melrose Arch, did you? 
WITNESS 2:  Yes, I did Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And did you meet anyone together 
with Mr Gama in Melrose Arch? 
WITNESS 2:  I dropped him off at ...[indistinct] [distortion 
present]  He went into the hotel. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright? 
WITNESS 2:  His instruction(?) [distortion present] was, I 
20 
must go to the residence’s parking area. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right? 
WITNESS 2:  And Mr Essa will come to me. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And did that happen? 
WITNESS 2:  That transpired Chair. 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 91 of 152 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Was Mr Essa alone or he was 
accompanied by anyone? 
WITNESS 2:  He was always alone. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  I am just a little confused as 
to the sequence of events.  You say that Mr Gama went into 
the hotel? 
WITNESS 2:  Yes, I dropped him off at the front entrance of 
the hotel ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And when mister ...[intervenes]  
WITNESS 2:  ...he went inside. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And did Mr Essa come to meet you? 
WITNESS 2:  I drove up, say ...[indistinct] [distortion 
present] metres because the main(?) entrance, it is part of 
the same building of the hotel. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Because I must point out to 
you ...[intervenes]  
WITNESS 2:  Perhaps(?) there is ...[intervenes] [distortion 
present] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  In paragraph 27, you say: 
“Approximately in 30-minutes later, Gama walking 
20 
with Essa returned with the plastic bag...” 
 
It seems to differ from what you are saying now.  I know 
it is a detail but what was the position? 
WITNESS 2:  [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Have a look at paragraph 27. 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 92 of 152 
 
WITNESS 2:  That was one of the events that took place.  I 
maybe... I may have mixed the occasions.  Just to correct.  
Yes, the statement is correct.  On one occasion, he had 
walked into the apartments and walked out with Mr Essa. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  And on the particular occasion 
that we are talking about on the 13 t h of July, what happened 
after Mr Gama and Mr Essa came out of the residence or the 
apartment? 
WITNESS 
2:  They 
walked 
out together(?) [distortion 
present] and he came out with a plastic bag that was folded.  
10 
I had to open the boot and it was placed at the back of the 
car.  And ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Where did you ...[intervenes]  
WITNESS 2:  ...after we ...[indistinct] [distortion present] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  The plastic bag, you say, was 
put in the boot of the vehicle.  What did you do then? 
WITNESS 2:  We drove through to ...[indistinct] [distortion 
present]  Went into that particular address and we proceeded 
into that residence. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That was the residence in Sandhurst, 
20 
you say? 
WITNESS 2:  In Sandhurst, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Okay and who went into the 
residence at that address? 
WITNESS 2:  Yes. 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 93 of 152 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Who went inside? 
WITNESS 2:  Mr Gama. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And where were you? 
WITNESS 2:  I remained with the vehicle. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And did you do anything whilst you 
were waiting at the vehicle? 
WITNESS 2:  Yes, I inspected... I conducted an inspection 
and confirmed what was in the plastic bag. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  What did you see in the 
plastic bag? 
10 
WITNESS 2:  There was a stack of R 200,00 notes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Were you able to estimate 
approximately how much was contained in that plastic bag? 
WITNESS 2:  I would not want to... I am not sure how much 
it was but it was not less than a hundred thousand. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Okay let us go to paragraph 
29, where you refer to certain records which appeared to be 
a printout of Google Maps.  WU207 on page 108.  What is 
depicted here? 
WITNESS 2:  It is the top line from Google Map confirming 
20 
the detail that I had just mentioned. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The date at the top of the page is 
13 July 2017 and there are certain records which appear 
beneath that.  Where does this picture come from? 
WITNESS 2:  It comes from the record within my old fault 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 94 of 152 
 
device. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Your cell phone, is that right? 
WITNESS 2:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Oaky and what does it tell us?  Just 
briefly. 
WITNESS 2:  It tells of the timelines, the events that I just 
mentioned. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  It shows Melrose Arch and 
then in the shaded part an address. 
WITNESS 2:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And is that address close to the 
residence you visited or Mr Gama visited? 
WITNESS 2:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Okay. 
WITNESS 2:  Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Were you ever accused of any acts in 
relations to money that ...[intervenes]  
WITNESS 2:  I was Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What was the accusation? 
WITNESS 2:  It came to my attention at a later stage that he 
20 
mentioned to my senior managers that I stole money from 
him. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  You refer at the bottom of 
page 87 to two other occasions where you say you 
discovered cash.  What were those events?  Will you please 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 95 of 152 
 
tell the Chair? 
WITNESS 2:  One event, it was when I would conduct the 
maintenance of the vehicles at his residence in Midrand.  I 
discovered two hundred notes, R 200,00 notes in one of the 
vehicles in the back boot. 
 
And on another ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Just before you go on, you 
say in the back boot.   
WITNESS 2:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Was it just laying in the boot?  Has 
10 
it... had it been concealed?  What did you see? 
WITNESS 2:  One, it was concealed in the spare wheel 
component. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  And what vehicle was this? 
WITNESS 2:  An SL 63. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And just tell the Chair again.  What 
did you find in the spare wheel compartment? 
WITNESS 2:  R 200,00 notes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Can you estimate from memory how 
much was contained in that spare wheel compartment on that 
20 
occasion? 
WITNESS 2:  It was nothing more than hundred thousand. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Was there any other 
occasion? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  You intend saying nothing 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 96 of 152 
 
more or do you intend saying nothing less than hundred 
thousand?  You said nothing more. 
WITNESS 2:  I would assume it was not more than hundred 
thousand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You relate another incident in 
paragraph 
36 
that 
apparently 
occurred 
on 
the 
20t h of April 2017.  What happened on that occasion. 
WITNESS 2:  There was an official meeting in Centurion that 
was initiated by the former office of the minister then.  And 
10 
there were SOE’s, CEO’s.  And upon arrival, I dropped him 
off, made sure that he was secured, went and parked the 
car, conducted an inspection and I discovered in the back of 
the Range Rover in a red medical kit bag that there were 
R 200,00 as well. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Can you estimate once more, please?  
Approximately how much you saw on that occasion? 
WITNESS 2:  Again, a hundred thousand. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You relate some further incidents 
on page 88 in paragraph 40 and following.  What happened 
20 
on that occasion?  You say sometime during June 2016.  
But before we go there perhaps for completeness sake 
would you look at W209? 
WITNESS 2:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   At page 112.  There appears what 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 97 of 152 
 
appears to be a similar printout of Google Maps or a map 
application, am I correct?  Page 112? 
WITNESS 2:     Yes, Chair, on 112. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Under the date 20 April 2017. 
WITNESS 2:     Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What does that printout tell us? 
WITNESS 2:     It tells us and confirms what I have just 
mentioned, it is a printout of the timeline. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, that you were in Centurion 
at a stage? 
10 
WITNESS 2:     Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Let us go on to the 
incident referred to in paragraph 40 and following.  What 
happened on that occasion? 
WITNESS 2:     On that particular occasion we were – head 
back to his residence after work and we stopped at the 
entrance of Beaulieu College which is situated in Midrand, 
Kyalami.  And we met up with Mr Jiyane there who handed 
a box that can occupy two to four bottles of wine that was 
sealed with Sellotape.  He handed that box to Mr Gama.  I 
20 
put it at the back of the vehicle.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  From what you saw – and I 
stress from what you saw, could you tell what was 
contained in the box?  And I stress from what you saw. 
WITNESS 2:     What I saw, it was a box.  As I mentioned, 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 98 of 152 
 
that was made for wine but upon feeling it, with the weight, 
it did not contain wine. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you see what it did contain? 
WITNESS 2:     No, I did not see but I can confirm that the 
packaging could have been of paper or notes and also 
based on the conversation I overheard that it had to be 
transferred or given to somebody over the weekend. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  I think we should be clear 
here, witness 2, you did not see what was in the box. 
WITNESS 2:     Correct. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You concluded from what you 
heard at the time and from what the box felt like, 
particularly its weight, that it might contain paper or paper 
notes.  Do I understand you correctly? 
WITNESS 2:     Correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What was the conversation that 
drew you to that conclusion? 
WITNESS 2:     I picked up from the coding or code dialect 
between him and the other person on the other hand that 
transaction had to be confirmed and the content that was 
20 
within the box had to be given to that person by weekend. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let us go on then to the incident 
described in paragraph 42 and following.  What happened 
during the course of that incident? 
WITNESS 2:     I went to the residence in Midrand and 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 99 of 152 
 
collected a Mercedes Benz, S65 of the premises which was 
a loan from a dealership for that specific week or weekend. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What happened? 
WITNESS 2:     I proceeded to Woodmead Centre and met 
up with a former colleague. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Colleague of whom? 
WITNESS 2:     Excuse me, Chair? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You say you met up with a former 
colleague. 
WITNESS 2:     Yes. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And colleague of who?  Whose 
colleague? 
WITNESS 2:     My colleague, a former colleague in the 
line of work. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right. 
WITNESS 2:     The colleague had a close associate or 
friend of Mr Gama’s that had to be transferred into the 
Mercedes Benz that I was driving with an instruction that I 
had to meet up with Mr Gama whom I had left in the office.  
The instruction was to meet up on the N17 highway. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you travel to the N17 highway 
with the colleague or associate of Mr Gama? 
WITNESS 2:     Yes, I travelled with the associate of Mr 
Gama. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  And what happened, did 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 100 of 152 
 
you go to the N17 highway? 
WITNESS 2:     Yes, we met up just past the first tollgate 
as you enter N17 from November 3. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  And what happened on the 
highway? 
WITNESS 2:     There was Mr Jiyade that also was present.  
I handed over the vehicle to Mr Gama whom was dropped 
off by a colleague of mine as well and I handed the car 
over to him.  Mr Jiyade walked from his vehicle with a 
package that he handed to Mr Gama. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Again, did you have an occasion to 
observe what was in this package? 
WITNESS 2:     No, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Because you say in your statement 
– well, let me not lead you on this.  Did you observe 
anything or did you make any conclusions?  If you drew 
any conclusions please tell the Chair what conclusions and 
why you drew them? 
WITNESS 2:     As per the norm it came to my attention or I 
was aware that Mr Gama was on a weekend away and as 
20 
per the norm and with the previous – on previous 
occasions that I had experienced, I concluded that it was a 
packet of cash notes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So from the circumstances and 
your experience that was your conclusion but did you see 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 101 of 152 
 
anything in that packet or package? 
WITNESS 2:     The content that was inside, I did not see. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  Was there anything else 
that led you to that conclusion that occurred at the time? 
WITNESS 2:     As I mentioned, Chair, that through 
experience and norm, that is where I could draw my 
conclusion from. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   On page 90, witness 2, you deal 
with the current breakdown in the relationship between 
yourself and Mr Gama.  Would you tell the Chair please 
10 
briefly what happened in this regard? 
WITNESS 2:     The relationship became strained because 
I could not execute instructions from a third party that was 
an associate of Mr Gama which he was not happy about 
and subsequently it ended up me being accused of 
witchcraft.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Witchcraft in what sense?  What 
was the content of the accusation? 
WITNESS 2:     Yes, supposedly there was a video where I 
was picked up sprinkling something in the residence in 
20 
Bryanston of which that video has never surfaced to this 
day. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  Is it correct that you 
sprinkled a substance in and around the residence of Mr 
Gama? 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 102 of 152 
 
WITNESS 2:     No, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What happened after you had been 
accused of this action? 
WITNESS 2:     With the accusations piling up and 
victimisation that took place I resorted to exit out by 
resigning but that was somehow rejected and a case was 
put together and somehow there was a dismissal in 
fabrication, 
I 
guess, 
because 
I 
never 
attended 
or 
responded at the action. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You say you took steps to resign 
10 
from Transnet? 
WITNESS 2:     Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   When was that? 
WITNESS 2:     That was 2017 in November. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  And you say that you were 
then learnt of disciplinary proceedings that had been 
conducted.  Obviously, they were conducted in your 
absence, am I correct? 
WITNESS 2:     Correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And what was the outcome of those 
20 
disciplinary proceedings? 
WITNESS 2:     A dismissal. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you subsequently approach 
Transnet about this “dismissal”? 
WITNESS 2:     Right, Chair. 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 103 of 152 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What was the outcome of your 
approach to Transnet? 
WITNESS 2:     An investigation was conducted and the 
outcome 
yielded 
results 
that 
were 
in 
my 
favour 
by 
reinstatement. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, so it must have been 
considered that you had been unfairly dismissed and you 
were reinstated, am I correct? 
WITNESS 2:     Correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You go on in your affidavit at page 
10 
91 and 92 to set out your concerns about your personal 
security.  Did you believe that your personal security was 
under threat? 
WITNESS 2:     Right, Chair, to this day that has been 
confirmed with a few events since my departure in 2017 
and after my reinstatement.  There has been a few 
occasions where I have experienced incidents specifically 
soon after I left Transnet in 2017.  On two occasions I 
noticed drones by my residence.  I have had text sent to 
me threatening me since I have been back at Transnet 
20 
being persuaded not to give evidence whether it be in this 
Commission or during my interview before I was reinstated. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, were these threats directed 
directly to you or to someone else? 
WITNESS 2:     They were directed to me, Chair.  I had 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 104 of 152 
 
reported them even with the security cluster which is SAPS 
and on occasion information was leaked through Transnet 
after my interview with the institution and it leaked through 
a personal assistant to the former HR manager. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, I am just looking at your 
affidavit, witness 2, at page 91 and 92.  You do not 
mention any threat there being made to you directly.  Is 
there any reason for that? 
WITNESS 2:     Those were developments, Chair, that I 
experienced a few weeks ago after I had made this 
10 
statement. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  Thank you, is there 
anything else you wish to tell the Chair that I have not 
covered? 
WITNESS 2:     Everything seems to be in order till this 
moment so I think all is in order. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, witness 2.  I do not 
have any further questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, Mr Pretorius.  Thank you, 
witness 2, thank you for coming to give evidence even 
20 
within the circumstances that you have described in terms 
of safety, yourself and your colleagues, we appreciate that 
you decided that you wanted to come to the Commission 
and assist the Commission and tell it what you know and 
what you observed during those years.  Thank you very 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 105 of 152 
 
much for coming to give evidence, we appreciate it.  Thank 
you very much and you are excused. 
WITNESS 2:     Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are ready for the third witness, 
witness 3? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, let us go ahead. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   May I assume that we are going to

CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think we …[intervenes]

CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I think we should finish, ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, if we might just take 
two minutes to make the arrangements for one witness to 
be moved out and the other to be moved in.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no that’s five minutes adjournment.

Page 106 of 152 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Witness number 3 can you hear 
me?   Hello witness number 3, can you hear me? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes, loud and clear. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Good, you have a bundle of 
documents before you, marked Exhibit BB14C, am I 
correct? 
WITNESS 3:   That’s correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Would you go to page 115, I’m 
referring to the black numbers in the top left-hand corner 
of the document. 
10 
WITNESS 3:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do you recognise that document? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes I do. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Is it an affidavit? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes, it is. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Is it your affidavit?  
WITNESS 3:   Yes Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Please go to page 132, there’s a 
space for a signature at the bottom of that page which has 
been 
redacted, 
do 
you

Witness number 3? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes, I recall signing it.

13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 107 of 152 
 
subject to any corrections we might have to make and 
subject to any further redactions that we might have to 
make, are the contents of this affidavit true and correct? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes, they are a true reflection. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, Chair, may this Exhibit be 
entered onto the record? 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 The 
affidavit 
of 
witness 
number 
3 
appearing at page 115 of Bundle Transnet 1 will be 
admitted and marked as Exhibit BB14C.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you Chair.  Witness number 
10 
3 are you employed in a senior security position in the 
Transnet Group? 
WITNESS 3:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, on page 116 and 117 there’s 
a table which shows your previous employment, I don’t 
want to go into any detail there for reasons which we have 
made clear to the Chair but if we can go to paragraph 4, 
did you have some experience as an employee of South 
African Police Service? 
WITNESS 3:   That’s correct Chair. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And, were you, in fact, during 2004 
a member of the VIP Protection Unit of the South African 
Police Service? 
WITNESS 3:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And you describe, in paragraph 6 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 108 of 152 
 
the duties of a Close Protection Officer, were you trained 
as a Close Protection Officer? 
WITNESS 3:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Briefly what are the duties of a 
Close Protection Officer? 
WITNESS 3:   Normally, I will be assigned to an Executive 
or a Minister in this regard for driving and making sure that 
he’s personally safe. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, during 2005 were you 
assigned as a Close Protection Officer to any particular 
10 
Minister or Deputy Minister? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes, I was Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   To whom were you assigned? 
WITNESS 3:   Then, Deputy Minister Gigaba. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, during the period – well 
first, during which period were you assigned as a Close 
Protection Officer to Deputy Minister Gigaba? 
WITNESS 3:  Late 2004 until 2007, late.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay, and did you ever have 
occasion to accompany Deputy Minister Gigaba to any 
20 
entity related to the Gupta family? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes, back then I accompanied him to the 
Sahara Business residence in Midrand. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, when did you resign from 
the South African Police Services and as Close Protection 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 109 of 152 
 
Officer for Deputy Minister Gigaba? 
WITNESS 3:   2008, as a VIP Protector. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, how did you come to be 
involved with Deputy Minister Gigaba, could you just relate 
it please, you deal with that at paragraph 10 of your 
statement and following, you deal with your appointment at 
Transnet and your secondment to the Department of Public 
Enterprises? 
WITNESS 3:   In 2013, I was called by a Major from the 
DPE at the Minister ’s office to come and have a meeting 
10 
with him, the Manager and the Minister, regarding some 
position to – backup position at the Minister ’s entourage.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, did you attend the meeting? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes, I did Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And what did you learn at that 
meeting? 
WITNESS 3:   I was told about the third level on the 
Minister ’s side and that we would be required to have – 
give support on a backup, on the main cover of the 
Minister. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, so you were required – it 
wasn’t very clear, do I understand you correctly, you say, 
you would be required to provide close protection and 
vehicle backup duties? 
WITNESS 3:   That’s correct Chair. 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 110 of 152 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What does vehicle backup mean? 
WITNESS 3:   It means we would drive behind the main 
car. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay, at that time, who were you 
employed by? 
WITNESS 3:   At that time, I was not employed. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I’m sorry that didn’t come through, 
just speak slowly please, you were employed by whom? 
WITNESS 3:   At that time of the meeting I was not 
employed Chair. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But, as I understand it, you were 
seconded after that meeting that you’ve just told the Chair 
about, to the Department of Public Enterprises, am I 
correct? 
WITNESS 3:   That’s correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And your duties were to perform 
close protection duties for Deputy Minister Gigaba and 
vehicle backup support, am I correct?  
WITNESS 3:   Ja but for the backup he was now a full 
Minister for DPE. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just want to clear up something, I 
thought Mr Pretorius asked whether you were seconded, 
and I thought you said yes but I thought you said you were 
not employed at the time of that meeting, is that correct?  
If you were seconded you would have been employed 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 111 of 152 
 
somewhere and then you were asked to go and work 
elsewhere but if you were unemployed at the time you 
would not be seconded.  Were you employed at the time 
you received that call? 
WITNESS 3:   Chair when I received the call to come and 
have a meeting for this backup position, I was not 
employed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, so let’s just summarise to 
get it clear, perhaps the dates are not clear.  When Mr 
10 
Gigaba was the Deputy Minister of Home Affairs and you 
were assigned to act as his Close Protection Officer, I 
understand that to be during 2005, is that correct? 
WITNESS 3:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And it was after that and before 
our resignation from SAPS in 2008 that you, together with 
Deputy 
Minister 
Gigaba 
visited 
Sahara 
Computers 
in 
Midrand on a number of occasions, is that correct? 
WITNESS 3:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And then, you say in April 2013 you 
20 
received a call from an official in the Department of Public 
Enterprises and you had the meeting with Mr Gigaba, who 
was then Minister for Public Enterprises, am I correct? 
WITNESS 3:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright and you took up that 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 112 of 152 
 
position as a backup driver as well as a Close Protection 
Officer, correct? 
WITNESS 3:   That’s correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And after July 2013 in serving 
Minister Gigaba as he was at that time, you were employed 
by the Department of Public Enterprises, is that correct? 
WITNESS 3:   I was at Transnet. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Sorry, you say you were in 
Transnet at that time? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes, June 2013 I was employed by Transnet 
10 
and July the 1 s t 2013 I was seconded then to the Minister 
of DPE. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, so in July 2013 you were 
employed by Transnet or at that time you were employed 
by Transnet, is that correct? 
WITNESS 3:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And then from the 1 s t of July you 
were employed by the Department of Public Enterprises in 
order to serve Minister Gigaba? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes, Chair I was employed for the services 
20 
of Minister Gigaba. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There may be some confusion, as I 
understand you witness 3, you are saying as at the end of 
June you were employed by Transnet but with effect from 
the beginning of July you went to DPE, is that correct, or 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 113 of 152 
 
did I misunderstand you? 
WITNESS 3:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you go to DPE on a secondment or 
did you end your employment with Transnet and started a 
new employment at DPE or are you not sure? 
WITNESS 3:   Thanks Chair, I was employed by Transnet 
and July 1 s t, I was seconded to DPE. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, well it’s clearly put in the 
table that we didn’t deal with, because it details your 
10 
employment in a way that, perhaps, could identify you but 
let’s look at page 116, witness number 3 there you see part 
of the table of your employment history.  Could you go to 
item 3 on page 116 please, are you there witness number 
3? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It says there,  
“Transnet, 
May 
2013, 
security 
training 
course 
during first month, 
 
Does that indicate that you were employed by 
20 
Transnet in May 2013 and underwent a security training 
course?   
WITNESS 3:   Thank you Chair, it’s 2013 June I was 
employed 2013, June by Transnet. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:     Oh, so should May read June 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 114 of 152 
 
then? 
WITNESS 3:   Thanks Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Okay…[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I’m sorry, or is the position that, 
during May you received training for purposes – in 
preparation for you taking up employment at Transnet in 
June? 
WITNESS 3:   Chair, I was employed June 1 s t, and I 
underwent training for the whole duration of June, then 
July 1 s t, I was then seconded to DPE. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And in May 2013, that is now the month 
before June, were you employed, were you not employed 
by Transnet? 
WITNESS 3:   No May 2013 I was not yet employed by 
Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you did not undergo the training 
that, that table reflect you underwent in May 2013, is that 
right? 
WITNESS 3:   It should be June 2013, the training. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, so where it says May it should be 
20 
June 2013? 
WITNESS 3:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And how long, witness number 3, 
did 
your 
secondment 
to 
the 
Department 
of 
Public 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 115 of 152 
 
Enterprise last, when did it come to an end? 
WITNESS 3:   2013, December. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So, during the period, July to 
December 2013 you were serving Minister Gigaba, is that 
correct? 
WITNESS 3:   That’s correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In paragraph 21 of your affidavit, 
witness number 3, you relate certain visits that took place, 
would you tell the Chair about those please? 
WITNESS 3:   Thank you Chair, from July to December I 
10 
can recall I escorted the Minister as part of his convoy to a 
scheduled visit to the Gupta residence in Saxonwold. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   On, approximately how many 
occasions did you do that? 
WITNESS 3:   Six to seven times. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right and on those occasions did 
you drive a backup vehicle or did you drive with Minister 
Gigaba? 
WITNESS 3:   The six times I was on the backup and only 
once to make it seven, I drove the Minister himself, I was 
20 
just alone. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Were any of these visits recorded 
in the Minister ’s diary? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes, they were Chair, they were handed over 
to witness 1. 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 116 of 152 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright…[intervenes]. 
WITNESS 3:   Sorry, Chair, and on this particular day 
where I drove him alone, he said I shouldn’t record the 
journey on the log book so I didn’t record that event. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Did you have access to the 
Minister ’s diary as a Close Protection Officer?  
WITNESS 3:   Yes, we do. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, and paragraph 21.1 you say, 
and I don’t understand your evidence, now, to be this, that 
none of these visits were recorded in the Ministers diary.  
10 
So, what was the position? 
WITNESS 3:   Okay, normally he will just inform us as and 
when he wants us to go, he will inform us to go there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So, were they, or were they not 
recorded in the Minister ’s diary? 
WITNESS 3:   They were not recorded at all. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And did you record these trips in 
the log book of your vehicle? 
WITNESS 3:   He informed us, we shouldn’t record this 
information on the log book, so we didn’t. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did he give a reason for telling you 
not to record them in his log book in your vehicle log book? 
WITNESS 3:   No reason was given to us. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What types of trips did he say you 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 117 of 152 
 
should not record in the log book, was it trips to particular 
destinations or only trips to a particular destination, one 
destination?   
WITNESS 3:   Only for the – that is in question now, he 
would say we shouldn’t record that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which address is that, is that the Gupta 
residence? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That was the only – those are the only 
trips he said you must not record? 
10 
WITNESS 3:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Did he say that from the beginning 
before you could even record the first one or you did record 
some but you had to stop after he told you not to record 
them? 
WITNESS 3:  Can you repeat Chair, repeat that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  When he told you not to record those trips 
to the Gupta residence was it at a time when you had 
already recorded some but then you did not record others 
because of the instruction or did he tell you not to record 
20 
them before you could even record the first one? 
WITNESS 3:  I was told that trip that we should not record so 
then as and when we go the second time I should not record 
because I was instructed not to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 118 of 152 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  When you were part of the convey 
which visited the Saxonwold residence of the Gupta’s what 
did you do?  Did you – when Minister Gigaba visited where 
were you during those visits? 
WITNESS 3:  Normally as in when we arrive, I would wait in 
the car then he will jump out quickly and get into the 
premises. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right were you able to observe 
whether there were any other people present outside the 
residence? 
10 
WITNESS 3:  In normal [indistinct 00:01:44] I saw Mr Brian 
Molefe and later I saw Matsela Koko of Eskom, Mr Ben 
Ngubane, Linda Mabaso our chair then within the premises 
as well. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Did you see any other 
convoy at that time or around that time? 
WITNESS 3:  There was the convoy of the President of the 
Republic leaving the premises as we enter in one occasion. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Who was he President at the time? 
WITNESS 3:  Mr Jacob Zuma. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  In paragraph 2 you talk of 
certain incidents involving Minister Gigaba.  Would you tell 
the Chair about those incidents please? 
WITNESS 3:  At some point the Minister would carry a large 
sum of cash with him and I wish to highlight the following 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 119 of 152 
 
instances in this regard.  One day I was present with the 
Minister and when he opened the boot of the car of the 
official vehicle to take out money to buy lunch for us. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Who is us? 
WITNESS 3:  The convey, the backup guys and the two of 
SAPS officials with him. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
WITNESS 3:  Inside the boot it was a bag which he opened 
and there was some stack of bundles of money inside. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
10 
WITNESS 3:  With R200.00 notes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Are you able to say where that money 
came from? 
WITNESS 3:  I could not tell that time but as – as we make 
some visits then I could connect the dots to say the money 
came from the Saxonwold residence. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  How can you say that? 
WITNESS 3:  Because at some point as we went to the 
premises he would go to the Gupta’s and we will go to 
Sandton he would use to pay cash for his tailored suits. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us go back to the money you saw in 
the bag.  Was it just loose cash or was it tied in any way? 
WITNESS 3:  It was 200 bundles stacked in rubber bands full 
in there.  Only R200.00 notes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And about how much space did it 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 120 of 152 
 
take in the bag if you are able to say about half, about a 
quarter or was it full? 
WITNESS 3:  It was quarter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About a quarter of the bag? 
WITNESS 3:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What type of bag was it? 
WITNESS 3:  It was a sports bag. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  On that particular occasion where 
had you been on that day?  Can you recall?  Witness 3 did 
10 
you hear my question? 
WITNESS 3:  Not clearly Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  You have just told the Chair 
of an occasion where you saw a bag in the boot of Mr 
Gigaba’s official vehicle and you say Minister Gigaba opened 
that bag and you could see stack of R200.00 notes in that 
bag right?   
WITNESS 3:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Correct? 
WITNESS 3:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right now I asked you earlier 
because your statement says nothing in relation to where 
that bag came from.  Are you able to say where that money 
came from through any observation that you made not any 
opinion that you might have but through any observation 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 121 of 152 
 
from what you saw?  Did you see where that bag came from? 
WITNESS 3:  No I cannot say where it came from Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I am sorry. 
WITNESS 3:  I cannot tell you where it came from Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is because you do not know how it 
came to the car not because you do not want to tell us?  You 
do not know how the bag that had money came into the car, 
is that right? 
WITNESS 3: Yes that is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
WITNESS 3:  That is correct Chair I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And nor does your statement say 
where it came from.  You have expressed an opinion earlier 
in your evidence but I just wanted to establish that according 
to your statement and what you say now you do not know the 
history of that bag and how that money came to be in the 
bag and the bag came to be in the boot of the Minister, we 
are correct? 
20 
WITNESS 3:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  You say that you were present 
when Mr Gigaba went shopping in Sandton City for tailored 
suits.  Do you recall that incident or those incidents? 
WITNESS 3:  Yes I do recall Chair. 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 122 of 152 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Did Mr Gigaba buy suits and pay for 
them? 
WITNESS 3:  Yes he did buy a couple of suits and paid cash. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  He paid cash right?  
WITNESS 3:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  And when he ate at 
restaurants where you were able to observe how did he pay 
for meals and drinks? 
WITNESS 3:  He paid cash Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  You move on in… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Do you – are you able to say 
roughly about how many times you may have seen him pay 
cash at restaurants because obviously somebody may pay 
cash on a particular day.  Is it something that appeared to be 
common that whenever he was at a restaurant, he paid cash 
or you saw him once or twice pay cash at a restaurant? 
WITNESS 3:  Certain times he will pay cash. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And other times? 
WITNESS 3:  I would not have seen how he paid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said certain times so I thought maybe 
20 
you know of other times when he did not pay cash, he did 
not use cash, is that right? 
WITNESS 3:  Chair around the times if I can recall well three 
times that I saw him paying cash. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And altogether do you have an idea 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 123 of 152 
 
about how many times you might have taken him to a 
restaurant or you do not know? 
WITNESS 3:  It is a couple of times but only three times I 
saw him paying cash. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and on other times you did not see 
how he paid? 
WITNESS 3:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Yes Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  Where were you 
employed during January 2014? 
10 
WITNESS 3:  I was employed by Transnet in the Carlton 
Centre. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And in July 2014 were you given 
certain duties to perform? 
WITNESS 3:  Yes I was the CPO for the CFO Mr Anoj Singh 
then. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The Chief Financial Officer Mr Anoj 
Singh? 
WITNESS 3:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Were you a driver as well? 
20 
WITNESS 3:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  And what was you practice in 
relation to Mr Singh were you his personal driver?  In other 
words how did you operate with him as his driver? 
WITNESS 3:  Yes I was his close protector.  I would drive 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 124 of 152 
 
him around.  I will run his diary as well. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What vehicles did you drive for Mr 
Singh?  I am on page 123 of your affidavit paragraph 35. 
WITNESS 3:   The white Mercedes C220 and the white 
Mercedes as well E350. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry you broke up there.  A white 
Mercedes? 
WITNESS 3:  The white Mercedes the C220. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
WITNESS 3:  And the white Mercedes E350. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Okay white Mercedes C220 and a 
white Mercedes E350. 
WITNESS 3:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Can you remember the registration 
numbers? 
WITNESS 3:  Yes the C220 it was DT77MMGP. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And the 350 can you recall that 
registration number? 
WITNESS 3:  It was DN87KFGP. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Did you say KFGP? 
20 
WITNESS 3:  KF that is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Did you keep logbooks of trips 
undertaken in these vehicles? 
WITNESS 3:  Yes I did Chair.  I would hand them over to 
Witness 1. 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 125 of 152 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Have you subsequently 
attempted to obtain these logbooks in order to substantiate 
the trips undertaken for Mr Singh? 
WITNESS 3:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And what was the result of your 
efforts? 
WITNESS 3:  I was told that the logbooks could not be 
located. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Did you ever drive Mr – or sorry not – 
did you ever drive him but did Mr Singh ever use a private 
10 
vehicle? 
WITNESS 3:  Yes he did with his blue BMW M3. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right and when would he use that 
vehicle as you recall? 
WITNESS 3:  Normally on [indistinct 00:13:45] and on 
Monday morning he will bring it at the Carlton Centre and the 
Monday afternoon I will drive him with the Mercedes back 
home. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  Right in paragraph 38 you 
relate some incidents in relation to your duties serving Mr 
20 
Singh.  Tell the Chair about what you say in paragraph 38 
and following please? 
WITNESS 3:  At some point I transported Mr Singh to the 
Gupta residence in Saxonwold. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
On 
approximately 
how 
many 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 126 of 152 
 
occasions do you think you did that? 
WITNESS 3:  More than ten times Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And upon arrival at the Gupta 
residence what would happen? 
WITNESS 3:  I would park the parking and Mr Singh would 
jump out of the car into the premises. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And how long did he remain in the 
premises? 
WITNESS 3:  But mostly it would... 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I am sorry I interrupted you. 
10 
WITNESS 3:  Sorry, Chair.  Mostly it will take 20-minutes to 
30-minutes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  And during that time, Mr Sing 
would be inside the Gupta Residence, I presume? 
WITNESS 3:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just note that Witness 1 also said, I think, 
Mr Brian Molefe used to stay inside the Gupta residence 20-
minutes to 30-minutes if I am not mistaken.  And I see here, 
it is also 20-minutes to 30-minutes. 
 
I do not know if I am mistaken about the time that 
20 
Witness 1 said Mr Molefe used to stay there.  Whether...I do 
not think he went before that. 
 
I think he also said, maybe 20-minutes to 30-minutes or 
something. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It was slightly different but in any 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 127 of 152 
 
event, the record will show. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes.  I think the 20-minutes seems to 
be common. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And do you have any recollection of 
incidents that happened after the meetings, when Mr Sing 
emerged from the residence? 
WITNESS 3:  At some point, he would leave the residence 
into the car with a bag full and would it put into the boot of 
10 
the car. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  H’m. 
WITNESS 3:  A sports bag.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Did you ever have an occasion to see 
what was contained in a bag that Mr Singh brought out of the 
residence of the Gupta’s? 
WITNESS 3:  I have seen that Chair later on, not on the day. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  What happened?  Please tell 
the Chair. 
WITNESS 3:  As ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I am sorry.  We are at paragraph 41 
of your statement. 
WITNESS 3:  That is correct Chair.  He would come with a 
sports bag into the car from the Gupta residence and he 
would open the bag which he had collected earlier at the 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 128 of 152 
 
Gupta residence inside the boot of his vehicle to give me 
some money to buy some lunch and I saw some ...[indistinct] 
[distortion present] of money of hundred notes and two 
hundred notes inside the bag. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  How often did this happen? 
WITNESS 3:  [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Did it happen once, several times? 
WITNESS 3:  More than once Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  More than once, can be two times.  It can 
be five times.  It can be twenty times.  Are you able to give a 
10 
much closer estimate? 
WITNESS 3:  Plus-minus, ...[indistinct] [distortion present] 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Plus-minus six times? 
WITNESS 3:  Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  I may have confused you 
with my question where you may not have been following my 
question Witness 3.  How many times did he emerge from 
the Gupta residence with a sports bag that looked as if there 
was material or something inside the bag? 
20 
WITNESS 3:  It is more than once, like I said Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  How many times did you see 
money, actually observed money, in the bag? 
WITNESS 3:  Okay, that is six to seven times Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  How many? 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 129 of 152 
 
WITNESS 3:  Six to seven times. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You saw money six to seven times? 
WITNESS 3:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well, look at paragraph 41 of your 
statement.  Please have a look at that.   
WITNESS 3:  [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Your evidence now does not seem to 
accord with what you say in paragraph 41 because in 
paragraph 41 you say: 
“My suspicion that the bags contained money was 
10 
confirmed when on one occasion he opened the bag 
which he had earlier collected from the Gupta 
residence inside the boot of our vehicle to give me 
some money to buy lunch.   
When he opened the bag, I could clearly see that the 
bag was stacked with one hundred and two hundred 
rand notes...” 
 
Now, you are saying, as I understand ...[intervenes]  
WITNESS 3:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  ...that that happened six times. 
20 
WITNESS 3:  No, that is correct Chair.  I might have missed 
it.  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So what is the position?  How many 
times did you see Mr Singh emerged from the residence with 
a bag? 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 130 of 152 
 
WITNESS 3:  [Indistinct] [distortion present] occasion Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I am sorry? 
WITNESS 3:  In... one occasion Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you see him only once emerging from 
the Gupta residence with a bag?  Let us forget about what 
was in the bag.  Just imagine from the Gupta residence with 
a bag.  Was it only once that you saw him or was it more 
than once? 
WITNESS 3:  It was once(?) [distortion present] Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m? 
10 
WITNESS 3:  [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the answer? 
WITNESS 3:  Chair, I only ...[indistinct] [distortion present] 
the money that we collected from the Gupta residence.  That 
is once that I saw the money.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
WITNESS 3:  But in two instances, we have collected the 
bag from the Gupta residence. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, let us take it step-by-step.  Just 
20 
listen to my question.  How many times, if you are able to 
tell me, did you take Mr Singh to the Gupta residence?  Just 
taking him there.   
 
Do not think about whether you saw a bag with or 
without money.  Just, how many time, do you think, you took 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 131 of 152 
 
him there if you are able to estimate? 
WITNESS 3:  It is more than ten occasions Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  More than ten occasions.  Alright.  Of 
those more than ten occasions, how many times do you see 
him come out of the Gupta residence with a bag?  And at this 
stage, forget about whether the bag had money or not, just 
with a bag. 
WITNESS 3:  More than ten occasions Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  More than ten occasions? 
WITNESS 3:  That is correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does that mean that most of the time 
whenever you took him, he would emerged from the Gupta 
residence with a bag? 
WITNESS 3:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Of those more than ten 
occasions when he emerged from the Gupta residence with a 
bag, on how many occasions did you see what was in the 
bag? 
WITNESS 3:  [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Witness 3? 
20 
WITNESS 3:  Yes, Chair it was on one occasion that I saw 
the money... the bag with the money inside. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was only on one occasion that you saw 
that there was money in the bag. 
WITNESS 3:  That is correct Chair. 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 132 of 152 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was there any other occasion when you 
saw what was in the bag, even though it was not money or 
may it have not been money? 
WITNESS 3:  Only one occasion money ...[indistinct] 
[distortion present] 
CHAIRPERSON:  You never saw anything else inside the 
bag, you only saw money and it was only once? 
WITNESS 3:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  You say in... I think that is 
10 
now clarified that.  Thank you, Witness 3.  You say that in 
paragraph 42 or you say in paragraph 42 that: 
“On certain occasions, you would go somewhere with 
Mr Singh after a visit to the Gupta residence...” 
 
What happened on these occasions? 
WITNESS 3:  Okay.  Normally, we would leave the residence 
and drive to the ...[indistinct] next to Killarney Mall. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  What is Knox Vault.  K-n-o-x 
Vault?  What is it?  Do you know? 
WITNESS 3:  Honestly, I know the premises.  I do not know 
20 
exactly what are you doing there but I know that address 
because I have been there on many occasions. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Alright.  So on your way you 
would take Mr Sing to Knox Vault after a visit to the Gupta 
residence?  Did you go there out of your own accord or did 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 133 of 152 
 
Mr Singh instruct you to go there? 
WITNESS 3:  He instructed me to go there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  And what would happen 
when you arrived at Knox Vault? 
WITNESS 3:  I would park the car and he would jump out and 
instruct me to open the boot, take out the bag into the 
premises and he would come with the bag empty. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  So you say he would instruct 
you to open the boot. 
WITNESS 3:  Yes? 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And the bag, was it empty or was it 
full?  Could you see? 
WITNESS 3:  Upon our arrival, the bag would be full and we 
would... he would go inside with the full bag and come back 
with the bag empty. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  So you would go to the 
Gupta residence.  After visiting the residence, you would go 
to Knox Vault with Mr Sing.  He would take a full bag into 
Knox Vault and emerge from Knox Vault with an empty bag.  
Do I understand that correctly? 
20 
WITNESS 3:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you say, he would come out of Knox 
Vault with an empty bag, did you have an occasion to open 
the bag and look inside or you are only able to say that 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 134 of 152 
 
because of how the bag looked like when he came back with 
it? 
WITNESS 3:  Chair, a full bag will look bigger. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
WITNESS 3:  And as he come out, he will have packed(?) 
[distortion present] in his hand.  There will be... you could 
see, there is nothing in there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So even if there may have been 
something, it would have been far less than what had been 
there before he went into Knox Vault? 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  You would not be able to say for sure 
there was completely nothing inside but it looked very 
different from the bag that he had taken in? 
WITNESS 3:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The incident that you have just 
described, coming from the Gupta residence and taking a 
bag into Knox Vault after that visit to the Gupta residence, 
on more or less how many occasions did this occur? 
20 
WITNESS 3:  Six to seven times Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You recall an incident in 2015 when 
you were driving Mr Singh to a scheduled meeting and 
something happened to interrupt your trip to that scheduled 
meeting.  Do you recall that incident? 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 135 of 152 
 
WITNESS 3:  Yes, on the day [distortion present]  
“Sometime in 2015 when I was driving Mr Singh to a 
scheduled meeting and he received a call on the 
cellular cell phone.   
After he had finished the call, he instructed me to 
divert from our route and immediately drive to the 
Gupta residence.   
And I could hear there was some panic in his voice.  
He, subsequently, into... as we arrive, he jumped out, 
rushing inside the premises...” 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What happened then? 
WITNESS 
3: 
 
I 
then 
waited 
in 
the 
car 
and 
waited 
approximately an hour-and-a half for him to come out. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Did he come out eventually? 
WITNESS 3:  Yes, he did and he appeared to be very 
nervous(?) [distortion present] and stressed.  When he got 
into the vehicle he said, “Fuck this thing!”  He then 
instructed me to drive him home and turn off the radio.  
Shortly thereafter he fell asleep. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
20 
WITNESS 3:  And this was an unusual behaviour(?) 
[distortion present] from him. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Did you ever find out what 
led to his distress on that day? 
WITNESS 3:  No, Chair I cannot tell. 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 136 of 152 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  In paragraph 47 and 
following, you relate an incident that occurred at the Three 
Rivers Lodge.  When was this incident... when did this 
incident occur? 
WITNESS 3:  Sometime in July 2014. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And what happened? 
WITNESS 3:  It was an executive strategy meeting for that 
whole week and I dropped Mr Singh.  And on Monday and... I 
came to collect him on Friday.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
10 
WITNESS 3:  So ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And it was an executive management 
meeting of which company? 
WITNESS 3:  For Transnet. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right and it was taking place at the 
Three Rivers Lodge you say in Vereeniging? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes, in Vereeniging, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And you tell the Chair that you 
dropped Mr Singh off early in the week and you came to 
collect him on the Friday afternoon? 
20 
WITNESS 3:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   When you arrived at the Three 
Rivers Lodge on the afternoon of the Friday, what did you 
observe? 
WITNESS 3:   I noticed four men who appeared to be from 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 137 of 152 
 
Asian descent, they looked like Chinese to me, standing 
around a Hyundai H1 kombi, the parking area.  Two of the 
mean appeared to be busy with a conversation on cellular 
phones. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And what happened next? 
WITNESS 3:   The next thing the two men who were 
speaking on their cellular phones took two luggage bags 
from the H1 kombi, one black bag and one maroon bag and 
went inside the lodge area where the executive meeting 
was held. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And then continue, what happened 
after that? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes, at around 3 p.m. I received an SMS 
from Mr Singh requesting me to come to the conference 
room where the meeting was held.  As I entered the room 
the two men who took the luggage bag into the lodge were 
in the room together with Mr Molefe and Mr Singh.  Then 
Mr Singh pointed to me, the maroon luggage that I should 
take to the car. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you do that? 
20 
WITNESS 3:   I took the bag and put in the boot of our 
vehicle. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  Was the bag light, heavy, 
full, empty?  What did you notice? 
WITNESS 3:   It was a travelling bag, very heavy. 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 138 of 152 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right and are you able to say 
whether the bag – you had seen the bag earlier? 
WITNESS 3:   I have seen the bag earlier (indistinct – 
recording distorted) inside the conference room. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think you will have to repeat that 
answer, witness 3, because there was …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Witness 3, please speak slowly 
and say that again. 
WITNESS 3:   Yes, Chair, I have seen the bag before 
because I have seen the bag with the two Chinese as they 
10 
were taking it into the conference facility. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, did you then take the bag 
and what did you do with it? 
WITNESS 3:   I took the bag to our vehicle. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right and did you see anybody 
else at that time in relation to these events that you are 
telling us about? 
WITNESS 3:   As I was putting the bag in the car, I saw 
one of our – Mr Brian Molefe’s driver putting the black bag 
20 
into Mr Molefe’s car. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, this black bag, had you seen 
it before? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes, I have seen it before when the Chinese 
were pulling it from their kombi into the conference facility. 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250

ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right. 
WITNESS 3:   So is the position that at a certain stage you 
had seen two persons that appeared to you to be Chinese 
and they had two bags.  They went into the hotel with the 
bags and later on you were asked by Mr Singh to take the 
one bag and put it into his car and later on you saw Mr 
Molefe’s driver carrying the other bag that you have seen 
been carrying by the Chinese men into Mr Brian Molefe’s 
car.  Is that the position? 
WITNESS 3:   That is correct, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Witness 3, is that the position? 
WITNESS 3:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you hear me? 
WITNESS 3:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Thank you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  On that occasion, on that 
day, we are talking about a Friday.  Did you have occasion 
to see what was in the bag?  Now I am talking about the 
Friday now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Witness 3. 
20 
WITNESS 3:   Yes, Chair? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Can you hear me, witness 3? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you struggling to hear us, witness 3? 
WITNESS 3:   It was not clear, can you just repeat, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you struggling to hear us at the 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 140 of 152 
 
moment? 
WITNESS 3:   I could hear clearly now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, you can hear us.  The 
question I am putting to you is, you are talking about an 
incident that happened at the Three Rivers Lodge in 
Vereeniging on a Friday in July 2014, am I correct? 
WITNESS 3:   That is correct, Char. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   On that Friday, not the next 
Monday but on that Friday did you see what was in the bag 
10 
that you put into the boot of Mr Singh’s vehicle? 
WITNESS 3:   No, I did not see anything, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  What happened the next 
Monday? 
WITNESS 3:   Okay, the Monday Mr Singh came with his 
blue M3 and normally I would take it to a car wash on 
Mondays and as – normally I will check the car because I 
can hand it to the car wash, so I saw the very same 
maroon bag at the boot and it was quarter empty.  As I 
opened it there was a lot of money inside and I informed 
20 
him about the money and at the basement he came down 
from the 49 t h floor to come and take the bag. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, now was this bag – you say 
it was the same bag?  The same bag as what? 
WITNESS 3:   The same maroon bag that I saw on Friday. 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 141 of 152 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, on the Friday at the Three 
Rivers Lodge, right? 
WITNESS 3:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Were you able to recall the weight 
of the bag on the Friday as compared to the weight of the 
bag on the Monday? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes, on Monday the bag was lighter. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right and you say you opened the 
bag to see what was inside the bag and what did you see 
inside the bag? 
10 
WITNESS 3:   I saw stashed R200 notes in rubber bands. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And how did you communicate with 
Mr Singh? 
WITNESS 3:   I sent him an SMS informing him about the 
[indistinct] 38.17 and he came downstairs to come and 
fetch it.  I told him – I sent him an SMS to inform him about 
the money in the back.  He said he is coming downstairs.  
Then he took the bag up and I left for car wash. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   When you went to collect Mr Singh 
at Three Rivers Lodge on that Friday in July 2014 what 
20 
vehicle were you driving? 
WITNESS 3:   It was the E220. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay, so it was a Mercedes Benz. 
WITNESS 3:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So you saw the bag in a different 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 142 of 152 
 
vehicle on the Monday, do I understand you correctly? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes, it was in his private vehicle on Monday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Had you – were you present or were you 
not present when the bag would have been taken from the 
E220 to his private vehicle or is that something that 
happened when you were not there? 
WITNESS 3:   Okay, from the Three Rivers we drove to the 
Carlton Centre where his blue private vehicle was and we 
exchanged – I took the bag from the Mercedes to his 
private vehicle. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
WITNESS 3:   And he drove off the Friday on his private 
vehicle with the bag. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you ever have occasion to go 
with Mr Singh to the business of Sahara Computers? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes, Chair, I did. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Can you recall on how many 
occasions you did that? 
WITNESS 3:   It was a number of occasions, Chair, I 
20 
cannot give you the number but we went there many a 
times. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  And do you know who he 
visited at Sahara Computers? 
WITNESS 3:   No, Chair. 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 143 of 152 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Not sure that the next two 
paragraphs really are of any relevance to what we are 
saying but did you ever pick up an associate or a person 
who was a friend of Mr Singh at Sahara Computers? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes, I did, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And this person, who did she work 
for? 
WITNESS 3:   As we collect her from Sahara, she was 
working for the Sahara business. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And previous to that? 
10 
WITNESS 3:   Working for Transnet. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You go on in paragraph 57 to talk 
of close protection officer services to a Mr Gary Pita.  Is 
that P-i-t-a? 
WITNESS 3:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   When was that? 
WITNESS 3:   From late 2016 to 2018. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, 2016 to 2018 you say you 
served Mr Gary Pita.  Was this in a capacity as driver and 
close protection officer? 
20 
WITNESS 3:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Was Mr Gary Pita the newly 
appointed Chief Financial Officer of Transnet? 
WITNESS 3:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And what vehicles did you use to 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 144 of 152 
 
transport Mr Pita? 
WITNESS 3:   The white Mercedes C-Class, the white 
Mercedes E-Class. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The same vehicles that Mr Singh 
used? 
WITNESS 3:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And the logbooks for those 
vehicles, for that period could you find them? 
WITNESS 3:   All I have submitted to this one. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes but since then did you attempt 
10 
to find them? 
WITNESS 3:  They could not locate them Chair.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, alright.  Did you ever have 
occasion to drive Mr Pita to the Gupta residence? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   On how many occasions? 
WITNESS 3:   Only two occasions. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  On the first occasions what 
occurred?  
WITNESS 3:   It was on a Friday. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did anything happen other than a 
visit to the Gupta residence? 
WITNESS 3:   I think on that Friday as I took him to the 
Gupta residence, he was the acting CFO and the week 
after he was appointed as the Group CFO. 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 145 of 152 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the week before he was appointed 
Group CFO, he had visited the Gupta residence. 
WITNESS 3:   Yes Chair order of the day. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   How long did he spend inside the 
residence? 
WITNESS 3:   About an hour Chair.    
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well it is – well I see that here I am 
hearing about somebody who visited the Gupta residence 
the week before getting appointed as Group CFO. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The day before yesterday I heard 
evidence of Mr van Rooyen that he was at the Gupta 
residence during the day on which he was later informed by 
the former President that he was to be appointed as 
Minister of Finance. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, continue. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The second occasion was when 
witness number 3? 
20 
WITNESS 3:   The second occasion was in 2017 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, did he go into the residence 
on that occasion? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes he did Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   When he came out what did you 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 146 of 152 
 
notice about him? 
WITNESS 3:   He was very loud and he was red-faced and 
he was mentioning something like 600million payment and 
some timelines, but I couldn’t understand what he was 
talking about. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Pretorius can we just – 
can the witness just repeat that evidence, I missed 
something, what about – what was the occasion and what 
about 600million.   In this Commission I have heard a lot of 
10 
600million Rand figures. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We will have to collate that 
evidence with other evidence Chair.  Just tell the Chair 
again please Witness number three what happened on the 
second occasion when Mr Pita returned from – as he was 
coming out.    
WITNESS 3:    Okay, as he was coming, as he was coming 
to the door, he was red-faced and he swear a lot and he 
mentioned something like 600million and some timelines 
but I did not understand what he was talking about. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was he talking on the phone or was he 
just speaking alone? 
WITNESS 3:    He was speaking alone; he hit the seat of 
the car. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.    
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 147 of 152 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right you mentioned earlier in your 
evidence in relation to Mr Singh transporting Mr Singh to 
Knox Vault, did that ever occur with Mr Pita? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes it did Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Tell the Chair please what 
happened in relation to these visits? 
WITNESS 3:   I did transport Mr Pita to the Knox Vault six 
times.   This would usually be some time during the week 
on a day to the office, so I will pick him up at his house 
and he would come out from the house with a bag, into our 
10 
car.  We drive then as we drive, he would instruct me to go 
to that Knox Vault.  He would go there and I will park, he 
will jump out with the bag into the premises of the Knox 
and he would come with an empty bag, we would drive to 
the office thereafter. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That evidence will be collated with 
other evidence I regard to Knox Vault’s records Chair.  In 
paragraph 65 you deal with visits by Mr Pita to Mr Saliem 
Essa, do you know Mr Saliem Essa by site?   
WITNESS 3:   Yes I know Mr Saliem Essa as to see him; 
20 
we used to see him in Berea in a restaurant. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right what restaurant was this, it 
is an unpronounceable name but let’s try. 
WITNESS 3:   It is a Portuguese restaurant it is called 
Parreirinha restaurant  
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 148 of 152 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe you can spell it for the benefit of 
the transcribers. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well he does much better than I do 
when I tried to pronounce Parreirinha. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Witness 3 do you want to spell the name 
of that restaurant for the benefit of the transcribers?   
WITNESS 3:   Yes Chair, it is P-a-r-r-e-i-r-i-n-h-a. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right is that a restaurant in 
10 
Turffontein? 
WITNESS 3:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   On how many occasions did you 
drive Mr Pita to meet Mr Essa at this restaurant? 
WITNESS 3:   Fifteen occasions. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, and were these meetings, 
short meetings? 
WITNESS 3:   Long meetings Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Fifteen 
occasions 
of 
exactly 
or 
approximately? 
20 
WITNESS 3:   Normally he would arrive around one and we 
would leave in the evening, seven o’clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but what I am asking is whether 
when you say fifteen occasions is that because you are 
sure that you took him there on fifteen or occasions or you 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 149 of 152 
 
are not sure about fifteen and you mean approximately or 
about fifteen occasions. 
WITNESS 3:   Approximately fifteen occasions Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   After Mr Pita’s departure from  
Transnet did you continue to perform duties as a close 
protection officer in Transnet? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes I did Chair, within the CFO’s office with 
acting CFO Mr Mohammed Mohamedy. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.   You deal on page 129 with 
10 
some 
aspects 
of 
your 
career 
after 
working 
for 
Mr 
Mohamedy but I don’t think it’s necessary for us to go 
there, you continued to work in a security function do I 
understand you correctly? 
WITNESS 3:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright if you go to page 130 you 
deal there with security matters, just briefly tell the Chair 
how did you and do you regard the circumstances of your 
personal security after you had become involved with the 
Commission?  Do you understand the question? 
20 
WITNESS 3:   Not clearly, can you just repeat again. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Your personal security in the time 
leading up to your giving evidence today how do you 
regard your personal security?   Your personal safety. 
WITNESS 3:   I feel scared from here going forward Chair.   
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 150 of 152 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  And you explain those 
circumstances 
fully 
you 
have 
explained 
them 
in 
a 
supplementary 
affidavit 
which 
has 
been 
part 
of 
the 
application but you also explain them to a degree at least 
on page 130 to 132.  Is there anything you would like to 
add to your statement that I haven’t mentioned? 
WITNESS 3:   No Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you very much Witness 
number 3.  
WITNESS 3:   Thank you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Witness 3 you remember you told me 
that you took Mr Singh to Knox Vault, I think you said 
about six times, is that correct. 
WITNESS 3:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you able to indicate roundabout 
when that would have been, would it have been during a 
particular year, was it 2015 or when was it or can you not 
remember?    You were with him only for six months or was 
it more? 
WITNESS 3:   More than a year Chair.    
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   About a year 
WITNESS 3:   More than a year yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would that have been 2014, or 2015 or 
another year? 
WITNESS 3:   2014 and 2015. 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250 
 
Page 151 of 152 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So those six times when you took him to 
Knox Vault some of those times would have been in 2014 
and others would have been in 2015, is that right? 
WITNESS 3:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, thank you.  Thank you 
very much witness 3 for coming to assist the Commission 
and to share with the Commission what you know about 
what happened when you were performing these duties or 
some of the people that you have mentioned we appreciate 
it very much, we understand your concerns about your 
10 
safety and the safety of your family, but we are very 
grateful that you were able to come and give evidence.  
Thank you very much, the Commission will do what it can, 
all that it can to assist with regard to having your issues of 
safety addressed.  Thank you very much and you are 
excused now. 
WITNESS 3:   Thank you Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you witness number 3. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That was your last witness? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Correct.  I hoped there were more 
20 
but ... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you feel some more energy? We are 
going to adjourn for the day, tomorrow I am supposed to 
hear the evidence of a former Chief Financial Officer in the 
Free State Provincial Government, Ms Bati Dlamini, so we 
13 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 250
