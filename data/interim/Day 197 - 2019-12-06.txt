PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 6 DECEMBER 2019 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Rangata, good morning everybody. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. So what happened? 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Morning Chair.  We – firstly let me just 
apologise.  We take some time to start because the witness was getting 
lost. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your – I do not know whether it is your microphone 
but you are not as audible as you should be. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Sorry.  I wanted to say Chair we apologise 
10 
for starting late the witness was getting lost so she came a bit late as 
she was supposed to be here.  We have Ms Cholota, Moroadi Cholota 
today we are proceeding with the – with her evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am still looking at the fact that we are starting 
late.  You say she was getting lost? 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let – I think let her counsel tell me what 
happened. 
ADV LUISA MAKAPELA:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning.   
20 
ADV LUISA MAKAPELA:   Chair in the actual fact of the matter is that 
there was a misunderstanding between myself and the witness.  On 
Wednesday we had met at the McDonald’s across the street to discuss 
and 
go 
through 
the 
proceedings 
today 
and 
there 
was 
the 
misunderstanding that we were going to meet there.  So the witness 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 3 of 55 
 
was actually early however it is my fault because I came straight here 
instead of going to meet with her.  And so she took some time getting 
here and that is one of the reasons.  So for that I apologise but it is 
mostly my fault Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh because I was told that it was the witness who 
was not around. I was told you were around. 
ADV LUISA MAKAPELA:   Indeed Chair because I came straight here 
instead of going to McDonalds as we did on Wednesday.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was waiting for you? 
ADV LUISA MAKAPELA:   Yes indeed Chair.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
ADV LUISA MAKAPELA:   We came together on Wednesday and I think 
she expected that same sequence of events to take place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV LUISA MAKAPELA:   My apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV LUISA MAKAPELA:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us continue.  I think you must just administer 
the oath or affirmation? 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you Chair. 
20 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
MS CHOLOTA:  My name is Moroadi Nomalanga Selena Cholota. (Too 
soft to hear names properly). 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the prescribed oath? 
MS CHOLOTA:  No. 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 4 of 55 
 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
conscience? 
MS CHOLOTA:  (No audible sound). 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the 
truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the truth, if so please raise 
your right hand and say, so help me God. 
MS CHOLOTA:  So help me God. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you Chair.  Chair for today’s 
proceedings the evidence will be led from – we have one bundle in front 
of us.  The bundle Chair is labelled Exhibit X7.  It contains summons 
10 
issued on the 28 t h of November 2019 of Ms Cholota attached to it is e-
mails ranging from item 1 up to item 17 on page 2 of the Index.  And 
next there Chair, is item 18 is the unsigned sworn affidavit or statement 
of Mr Cholota and next to it is the signed version of the statement.  If 
that is in order Chair I will request that that be entered into the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well her statement should have been at the top of the 
bundle. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  I understood that Chair I was just advised 
that for referencing and numbering it was just going to be convenient to 
carry on. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it could have been made 1A up to whatever so it 
would be much more convenient.  But it is okay.  If – oh it is just that 
you already have marked otherwise they could have been put in at the 
top as we always do of the bundle. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  I understand that Chair. 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 5 of 55

ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  As you have already explained if you go to 
the first page you will see the index in front of the page.  It will tell you 
where you find which document but it is also labelled on the side in 
terms of numbering. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Yes. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  To guide you as to where to find your 
documents. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Yes ma’am. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  The Chair has already explained it is 
20 
easier to have the statement on top but I am sure you have placed your 
finger there. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Yes ma’am. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Because we are going to make – work 
mainly from your statement.

MS CHOLOTA:  Noted Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I do not know whether it is that or whether it is

before I go there I want to just to lay a basis.  You have been served

November 2019 to appear before this Commission.

06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 9 of 55 
 
like you to start – deal with your employment background.  Can we deal 
with that?  Feel free to read where you need to read or to 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes what you can do Ms Cholota when she asks you 
questions you do not really have to look at the statement unless you

CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you. 
ADV LUISA MAKAPELA:  My apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
ADV LUISA MAKAPELA:  Just to note that with regard to the e-mails 
that have just been referred to by our Evidence Leader that some of the 
e-mails while they may have been found from Ms Nomalanga’s 
computer were not from her.  So just to note that even though she 
agrees that she has knowledge of the e-mails they are not e-mails that 
20 
came from her e-mail address.  Some of the annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but she can explain that. 
ADV LUISA MAKAPELA:  Okay just noted Chair.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and then you can switch off – ja. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you.  Ma’am can we deal with the 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 10 of 55 
 
employment background?  You do not have to read unless you have to – 
you can refresh your memory but can you take us back – through your 
back – employment background? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Actually for intents and purposes what we want is if 
you can say when you started working in the Office of the Premier. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Okay.  I started working in the Office of the Premier 
from the beginning of August in 2013 from the Office of the Executive 
Mayor in Mangaung.  That is when I started working there until 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS CHOLOTA:  Until ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  And until when? 
MS CHOLOTA:  Until 2019 on the 30 t h of June. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in the meantime there had been a change of 
Premiers? 
MS CHOLOTA:  Yes.  I worked with the former Premier Dade Magashule 
until he left and became the Secretary General of the ANC.  I continued 
to work with the new Premier Ms Ntombela until the 30 t h of June this 
year 2019. 
20 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and the Premier who succeeded Mr Magashule is 
Messrs Ntombela? 
MS CHOLOTA:  The new Premier Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The new Premier. 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 11 of 55 
 
MS CHOLOTA:  Yes it is Ms Ntombela. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and she became Premier and you worked under 
her or in her office after the elections – or was it after the former 
Premier had been elected as Secretary General of the ANC? 
MS CHOLOTA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so you had – you worked for about what a year 
and a half? 
MS CHOLOTA:  It is a year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Under the new Premier? 
MS CHOLOTA:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And for both Premiers you worked in the 
capacity of a PA is that right? 
MS CHOLOTA:  Yes but the appointment letter would say appoint – 
Appointment Secretary but it is referred as the PA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay but in the appointment letter it is Appointment 
...(intervenes). 
MS CHOLOTA:  Appointment Secretary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Secretary. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Yes. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Secretary. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  I think you can go immediately to what 
her duties were in ...(intervenes). 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In that position. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Do you want to take us through your 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 12 of 55 
 
duties primarily in the Office of the Premier.  We can start from the 
period when you started in 2013? 
MS CHOLOTA:  Okay. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes. 
MS CHOLOTA:  I would deal with the incomings and the outgoing calls 
in the Office of the Premier. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes. 
MS CHOLOTA:  The incoming mails and the outgoing mails and all the 
documents that come in the Office of the Premier for the attention of 
the Premier.  I would – I had a person who – two people who reported 
10 
under me that I had to manage in the office and the most important one 
that was happening is the walk-in of the people of the community that 
are coming in the Office of the Premier.  I was handling the diary of the 
Premier and his travelling arrangements. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Okay when you talk about people that walks in. 
MS CHOLOTA:  H’mm. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  They walk in because they want to speak 
to the Premier or what? 
MS CHOLOTA:  Yes.  Most of the people who would come. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes. 
20 
MS CHOLOTA:  In the office they would come as asking or requesting 
an appointment with the Premier.  So it will be different cases but 
everyone who comes there would want an appointment with the 
Premier.  That is how I engaged with them. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  I see.  And on page 263 on paragraph of 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 13 of 55 
 
your – of the statement – from your statement on paragraph 27 I see 
there you deal with further that you liaise with different Departments.  
What will that entail? 
MS CHOLOTA:  Correct.  In the Office of the Premier all the 
requirements or inquiries that people comes with. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes. 
MS CHOLOTA:  They were mostly relation to all the Departments that 
we work with.  All the ten Departments that we had basically report to 
the Premier.  Like all the MEC’s and all the HOD’s so I was liaising with 
all the Departments based on what the community with that is related to 
10 
their Department. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Alright.  You also deal with the travel. Are 
you dealing – are you responsible for the travel arrangements of the 
Premier or were you responsible at the time? 
MS CHOLOTA:  Correct ma’am but I also had the assistant appointment 
secretary.  In cases where I would be busy with most of the things the 
task of the travelling arrangement would be arranged by the assistant 
appointment secretary. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  And was there any dedicated travel agent 
that will be utilised? 
20 
MS CHOLOTA:  The travel agent is – we would use the one that is 
appointed to be used at that time. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Who will have appointed – who would 
have appointed that travel agent? 
MS CHOLOTA:  We would get the direction or the confirmation letter 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 14 of 55 
 
from the Director-General and the CFO from the Supply Chain. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  So if we go to the period – the relevant 
period at that time were you at some stage also responsible for the 
travelling arrangement for them – for the Premier? 
MS CHOLOTA:  For the Premier. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Yes ma’am. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes.  And what travel agent would have – 
would you have used at the time or did you use? 
MS CHOLOTA:  We had Astra Travel Agents.  Before it was – oh sorry I 
10 
forgot the name. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Okay. 
MS CHOLOTA:  And then lately we were using – we also used 
Hambanathi Travel Agency. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  When you say lately when did you start 
using Hambanthi? 
MS CHOLOTA:   I think just the former Premier left and when the new 
Premier came. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  So will it be safe to say that at the time 
when the new Premier came then you – there was a new agent that was 
20 
utilised? 
MS CHOLOTA:  No it did not come with the new Premier.  I am just not 
sure when their contract ended.  It depends on the contract that the 
travel agency gets so I am just not sure about the date or when did 
their contract end.  But it did not come with the new Premier. 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 15 of 55 
 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Okay.  So would you know if there was 
any tender process or selection process for the travel agent that was 
utilised at the time 2015/2016? 
MS CHOLOTA:  No ma’am I would not know. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  You would not know? 
MS CHOLOTA:  I would not know. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  When the Office of the Premier required 
travel arrangement to be made who will then pay – how will payment 
and invoicing be handled? 
MS CHOLOTA:  The Supply Chain will be responsible for the Office of 
10 
the Chief Financial Officer is the one who is responsible for the 
payments. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Okay.  So what will be the reason for 
payment being made by any other person except from the Department? 
MS CHOLOTA:  I am sorry repeat the question again ma’am? 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  What will be the reason for payment to the 
travel agent made outside the payment that will have – would have 
been made through the Department? 
MS CHOLOTA:  It means it will not be for the Premier of – for Official 
purposes. 
20 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Okay.  If we still put your pen there and I 
would like to take you to page 18.  There is a document there.  It is an 
e-mail.  It is item 2. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Okay ma’am.  I am there. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes.  You can page over that is the 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 16 of 55 
 
document.  
MS CHOLOTA:  Okay. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Can you identify ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry what page is that? 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Sorry Chair it is page 18. 
CHAIRPERSON:  18? 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  18 Chair.  I see the number it is put on 
that blue divider.  But just immediately after the blue divider that is 
where the relevant document is.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well there is a document that has got no page number 
10 
here.  After ...(intervenes). 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  It was supposed to be 19 thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Tab 2. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you. It was supposed to be 19.  
Thank you.  ma’am can you identify that document for us? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you do not seem to have pages 18 and 19. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  I have actually noticed Chair that on the 
folder which is marked 2 there is a number there is 18.   
CHAIRPERSON:  But that should not – that is not how they do it. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That 18 should be on the ...(intervenes). 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  On the actual document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the page relating to Astra Travel. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But also then there should be one for 19.  It looks like 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 17 of 55 
 
there is no page 19. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  It was skipped.  So I would – I will 
suggest for conveniences we can mark the document page 19. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No let us leave it like that because you do not have 
it, is it not? 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are all the dividers given a number?  Okay maybe 
that. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe let us do as 19 but it is not satisfactory. 
10 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  I apologise for that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Ma’am on page 19 that we have put now is 
a document.  Can you identify for us?

MS CHOLOTA:  Sent to Ignatius Mpambani igo@diamondhill.co.za. On 
the 28 t h of January 2016. 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 18 of 55 
 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes.  If you down there it says good day. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Good day. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes. 
MS CHOLOTA:  “Good day.  Kindly find the below details as 
discussed telephonically.” 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Okay. 
MS CHOLOTA:  “Account name Astra Travel.  Account number 
470179252 ABSA bank Cheque account.  Amount 
R250 000.00.  Please do send the Proof of Payment to 
the above e-mail address.  Thanking you in advance. 
10 
Thank you in advance.  Warm Regards. Moroadi 
Cholota Personal Assistant to Premier Office of the 
Premier.” 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you.  So this is an e-mail that you 
have sent in your Official capacity from your Official e-mail. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Correct ma’am. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  To Ignatius Mpambani.  Who is Ignatius 
Mpambani? 
MS CHOLOTA:  He is one of the businesspeople. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  He is? 
20 
MS CHOLOTA:  Yes. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  And he still is? 
MS CHOLOTA:  I believe he is late ma’am he was – sorry? 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes, yes.  Thank you.  You sent it to him

MS CHOLOTA:  Yes ma’am. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  And you said in that e-mail you were 
sending the banking details and you requested for him to send you the 
Proof of Payment. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Correct ma’am. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  What was the payment for? 
MS CHOLOTA:  I tried to look at the attachment ma’am.  I was hoping 
that the list would be covered because I would send different e-mails to 
different people. So if I can get either the list or the Proof of Payment 
that is stating what it is in connection with because I can see here I 
10 
just sent it to him saying as discussed telephonically. So I really do not 
remember what was it for ma’am. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  You do not remember what it was for? 
MS CHOLOTA:  I do not remember what was it for.  Normally when I 
send an e-mail I would attach either the list or an attachment that 
explains what is it for to the person that we request funding from. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  If you go to – I am just going to leave it 
for now – leave it there.  If you go to the next page. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Okay ma’am. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  And you – it is – which is page 20.  In the 
20 
middle of that page there is an e-mail from Ignatius Mpambani. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Yes ma’am. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Rangata ...(intervenes). 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It will go faster if you are referring to an e-mail if you 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 20 of 55 
 
just tell her the gist of what that e-mail is about and then ask the 
question. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Okay thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So she does not have to read. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you Chair. 
MS CHOLOTA:  I think we should try and finish her evidence as soon 
as possible.  It is not a lot. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is required from her. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS CHOLOTA:  We will move with speed.  Ms Moroadi we see on that 
page 20 that you are – there is an e-mail – that e-mail from yourself to 
Ignatius where you – you stating , kindly note. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To Mr Mpambani. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Mr Mpambani you noting, 
“Kindly note that the Proof of Payment is well received 
and appreciated.” 
MS CHOLOTA:  Correct ma’am. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Will that serve to remind you as to what 
20 
the payment was for? 
MS CHOLOTA:  If I receive the attachment and the Proof of Payment 
yes ma’am I would remember. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  You would have if you received the 
attachment for the Proof of Payment? 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 21 of 55 
 
MS CHOLOTA:  The attachment for the Proof of Payment and the list or 
whatever page that explains because normally when I send the e-mail I 
would send the attachment or what is the request for, who requested 
and where is it going with together with the banking details before I can 
even receive the Proof of Payment. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Without the Proof of Payment or for the 
attachment that the payment was for would you be able to comment 
from your office in your Official capacity why would you have Mr 
Mpambani to pay for travel within the Office of the Premier? 
MS CHOLOTA:  It will be regarding all the requests that we receive in 
10 
the Office of the Premier.  As I explained previously if it has got 
nothing to do with the Premier travelling or Officials travelling.  If the 
request comes to the Office of the Premier and the government is 
unable to assist the Premier would ask for businesspeople to assist 
hence it is a request for funding.  So it was nothing related to the – 
either the students or anything that is covered by government.  If my 
explanation is clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So is your evidence that where you asked a 
businessperson or somebody to make payment to a travel agent. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Yes Sir. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That payment would not be for the Premier?  That 
payment would be for something else? 
MS CHOLOTA:  Yes for ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it would be done as a response to a request from 
the Premier? 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 22 of 55 
 
MS CHOLOTA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you would have been liaising with that 
businessperson on behalf of the Office of the Premier? 
MS CHOLOTA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Are you able without the attachment are 
you able to remember what kinds of situations you handled where you 
may have asked or the Office of the Premier may have asked 
businesspeople to make payments to travel agents? 
MS CHOLOTA:  Yes Sir.  In most if not all cases it will be regarding 
students’ request. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS CHOLOTA:  And for an example you would get a letter from a group 
of artists or a group of people saying that we have received an 
opportunity to go somewhere they will attach the invitation, the 
confirmation and stuff and say, we have organised the request from 
number 1 to 5 but we are struggling with the flights or the assistance – 
financial assistance in order for us to arrange accommodation and 
everything for us to attend the conference or whatever the case may 
be.  Then they would write a request of funding to the Premier or – we 
kindly ask the Office of the Premier to assist us with attached.  I would 
20 
go to the – firstly in the absence of the Premier I would go to the 
Director-General and see if the government would help based on the 
financial implication or the availability of funds in government.  If we 
can help as the government it will be handled by the Director-General. 
But if the Director-General says, unfortunately we will not be able to 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 23 of 55 
 
help that is where I keep them for the attention of the Premier.  He 
would say if we do not have money there is nothing we can do or he 
would say, see if there is any businessperson who can assist because 
this is very important.  These people are travelling for a very valid 
reason that is going to – that is important for our province or whatever 
the case may be.  That is when I have to communicate with 
businesspeople.  I would send it to two or three different people and 
see who is available to assist Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So this would occur when the Office of the Premier or 
government could not assist. 
10 
MS CHOLOTA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
And 
then 
an 
approach 
would 
be 
made 
to 
businesspeople to see if they could assist? 
MS CHOLOTA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And mostly was – did this relate to requests by or on 
behalf of students or also other groups in the community like music 
groups and maybe emerging businesspeople.  What kind of groups 
really ...(intervenes). 
MS CHOLOTA:  Would request help? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were helped through this kind of arrangement? 
20 
MS CHOLOTA:  In most cases that I have dealt with 80% is students.  
The rest would be groups.  It is either artists or a group of athletes 
going somewhere requesting for funding.  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know why the Office of the Premier would not 
in such situations simply refer the people concerned to businesspeople 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 24 of 55 
 
and let the business – no.  This – the students or the people asking for 
help refer them to the businesspeople and then the businesspeople 
liaise with them directly without having to involve the Office of the 
Premier? 
MS CHOLOTA:  We would do that in most cases Chair.  People would 
come before even we refer them to businesspeople direct.  We would 
refer them to the relevant Departments.  Like if you come as a group of 
music and stuff.  We would tell you that go to the Department of Sports, 
Arts and Culture, but in most cases people would come to the Office of 
the Premier saying they have exhausted all those. 
10 
Like they have knocked at all doors.  So every time you refer 
them back they will tell you I tried to meet with the HOD.  I tried to 
meet with the MEC.  Some of them would come with regret letters and 
stuff based – due to the fact that we do not have a budget.  
Unfortunately we will not be able to assist and stuff.  So that is where 
they come to the Office of the Premier as the last resort, but we would 
do that Chair and try as much as we can to refer them to the people 
that we think they would assist. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now you have looked at the e-mails that were sent to 
you or that you sent to certain businesspeople that are in the bundle.  
20 
Is that correct? 
MS CHOLOTA:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now are you able to say all those e-mails insofar as 
they involved payment of money by those businesspeople fell under 
that arrangement.  Namely mostly assistance for students, but maybe 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 25 of 55 
 
also assistance for other people. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Most of them Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Most of them would be students and then the – but 
there could be other people who are not students who were also 
seeking help in terms of those that are here? 
MS CHOLOTA:  In terms of those that are – yes Chair.  If my memory 
serves me well.  It is students. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is students? 
MS CHOLOTA:  Yes.  If I recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  You have said in your statement I think that the 
10 
assistance that was being provided by the Office of the Premier related 
not only to students who were studying at universities and other 
institutions within the country, but also outside of the country.  Is that 
correct? 
MS CHOLOTA:  Correct Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you also said there was a bursary scheme 
provided by the Government ...(intervenes). 
MS CHOLOTA:  Correct Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then there is financial assistance that was 
provided by the Office of the Premier.  Now the financial assistance – I 
20 
am saying provided by the Premier.  Maybe that is not what you said in 
your statement.  Were you talking about exactly what you are talking 
about?  Namely the Office of the Premier trying to get people who can 
help and not itself paying.  Giving that assistance – that financial 
assistance. 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 26 of 55 
 
MS CHOLOTA:  It would be – I am not sure how to explain it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sometimes the Office of the Premier would pay if that 
...(intervenes). 
MS CHOLOTA:  That is where ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  If they had money. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Sorry Sir.  That is where we - we start Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You start.  Ja. 
MS CHOLOTA:  If it is financial assistance for students.  We would 
engage with the Department of Education and say this is the list that 
we have.  The Department of Education would say for this year we will 
10 
only be able to cover 100 students.  They would go through and check 
all the requirements and give us back the list of the ones that they can 
assist. 
Then give us the rest that they can – they will not be able to 
assist.  That is where the financial assistance gets included.  After 
exhausting all other ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Departments. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Departments that are relevant – yes – that I – that can 
assist Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So if the relevant Government Department did 
20 
not have money to assist or could not assist for whatever reason and 
the Office of the Premier could itself not assist then businesspeople 
would be approached by the Office of the Premier? 
MS CHOLOTA:  Correct Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were you the Official in the Office of the Premier who 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 27 of 55 
 
would make contact with the businesspeople to say there is somebody 
who needs this kind of assistance or there is a student who needs this 
kind of assistance.  I will send you the paperwork.  Can you see if you 
can assist or would the Premier have spoken to the businesspeople and 
you would just make a follow up? 
MS CHOLOTA:  It would be me and the colleagues that I work with.  If 
after getting the list of the ones that are not being able to assist – to 
be assisted.  We would have to engage with the Premier.  We cannot 
take decisions without talking to the Director-General or the Premier by 
saying unfortunately these students cannot be – should we write regret 
10 
letters or what should we do. 
The Premier would advise.  Did you try and – and find or 
source funds for them before.  Then after that we would take that as a 
directive.  That is when I and other colleagues from – mostly I would 
work with my colleagues from the Unit of Intergovernmental Relations, 
because most students will go to them and me.  Then each time we get 
a chance we would just combine our notes and work together. 
So after that that is the only time I can communicate with the 
businesspeople to assist, but it also depends on the availability of the 
Premier, because after dealing it with once Chair.  If something comes 
20 
and it is urgent.  At some point I do not have to wait for the Premier to 
give me a directive.  That is why I am there in his office to assist. 
So I would approach one or two or three businesspeople.  If 
they all say unfortunately we will not be able to help.  Then I know I 
have tried my best.  That is the only time I will write a regret letter, but 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 28 of 55 
 
if I do get help from one or two of them.  Then I know how I should go 
about by saying all the attachments are there, because if you send a 
request I would ask you to attach all the necessary documents. 
Even if we have to communicate with the university or 
wherever you go.  So that we confirm before we get included in your 
request.  Then I would send everything that I found from the person 
who’s requesting to the person who agrees to assist Chair.  That is how 
it will go about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And as you said I think you said that that was part of 
your official duties doing that. 
10 
MS CHOLOTA:  For the request. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For the students and getting assistance for the 
students ...(intervenes). 
MS CHOLOTA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And so on? 
MS CHOLOTA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Okay.  You want to proceed? 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may – if necessary you may direct her to the 
specific e-mails, but I wanted to get the general picture. 
20 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes.  Yes.  I just want to take from – 
follow from that what Chair has - has asked.  When you decide to 
contact the businesspeople ...(intervenes). 
MS CHOLOTA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Who would direct you to those people?  
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 29 of 55 
 
How do you identify them? 
MS CHOLOTA:  It is myself ma’am.  Hence I am saying I will send it to 
different businesspeople.  If I decide that there is Tata Igo.  There is 
ma’am Ruwadi.  There is …(indistinct).  No one is saying send it to 
Thandi or Sello …(indistinct).  I would decide if I send it to three 
different people and they regret.  I move to the next three names or 
four and so forth, but I will be the one who is dealing with it direct. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  I think my question says who – how do 
you identify those people.  For an example let us be particular 
...(intervenes). 
10 
MS CHOLOTA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Particular on this one. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  When you identify to send the request to 
Mr Mpambani how you have identified him identified him?  Would you 
have relationship with him before?  Would you know him from prior to 
that? 
MS CHOLOTA:  Not really ma’am.  I would have a list of 
businesspeople.  If you work in that kind of an environment that is 
where you get to know if the kind of request that you get.  You would 
20 
have to establish at some point on how you get to deal with them.  So 
at – as time goes by I will know that there is a so, so, so gentleman 
who assisted a group of people blah, blah, blah. 
I would just note it down in case next time I need help from 
you and I am not sure if you are aware that the establishment of this 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 30 of 55 
 
request for funding for students has been there long before I even 
arrived.  So when I got to the Office of the Premier I just continued with 
what I found.  Either it is from the database or sometimes you would 
even go and check when – let us say there – there were invites of 
people for the State of the Province Address or anything related to that. 
Then you would try and go out there and find help for them.  
That is how I get to ...(intervenes). 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Okay ma’am. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  I have noticed – I have gone through – I 
10 
am sure you have gone through the e-mails.  Ranging from e-mail 1 up 
to e-mail 13/14.  I have noticed out of all the e-mails 80% if not 90% 
there was one particular person who was very helpful in terms of the 
requests for funding and that is Mr Mpambani.  Any particular reason 
for that? 
Was he the only one that was approached or was he the only 
who was eager to assist? 
MS CHOLOTA:  Mr Igo Mpambani was not the only businessperson I 
approached.  According to this file that we received.  It is the ones that 
– I do not know how were chosen to be printed out for this, but from my 
20 
laptop that the gentleman took from me they had lists and lists of the 
businesspeople that I have contacted.  Mr Mpambani is not the only 
business that I have contacted. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  I note that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you are no longer in the Office of the Premier 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 31 of 55 
 
now ...(intervenes). 
MS CHOLOTA:  Correct Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it would be good if the Commission could get as 
much information as possible of who the other businesspeople or 
companies were who used to be approached and to see payments that 
they made.  I take it that for all payments that were made at the 
request of the Office of the Premier there would have been some 
written confirmation or receipt that payment has been made as 
requested or something like that.  Is that right? 
MS CHOLOTA:  We do have such Chair.  Hence I am saying the 
10 
gentleman who met with me in the office ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS CHOLOTA:  They have those lists Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So all that information can obtained as far as 
you are concerned? 
MS CHOLOTA:  Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  All that information as far as you are concerned can 
be obtained from the Office of the Premier? 
MS CHOLOTA:  They do have all the information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  All the information. 
20 
MS CHOLOTA:  I am just not sure if it is still in – on the system 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Because I am not sure who is utilising the laptop 
...(intervenes). 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 32 of 55 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS CHOLOTA:  At this present moment, but I am definitely sure that 
the gentleman had everything that was on my laptop ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Because we discussed most of them just not all of them 
are in this file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And are you able to give an indication of more or less 
of about – more or less how many businesspeople would be asked over 
10 
let us say a year or did you end up with your regulars?  If I can call 
them that.  Those that you normally sent to.  Whether they were 10 or 
20, but you knew you would send to mostly some of those ones or there 
were always new ones on the list? 
MS CHOLOTA:  Not really Chair.  It – I had different people.  As I said 
as time goes by.  If today I – like you get to information or you get to 
know that there is somebody that you can approach regarding that.  I 
cannot say there are specific people that I refer to, because it is not 
fair that I can ask you something today and tomorrow and the third day. 
Hence I am saying there were a number of businessmen and 
20 
businesswomen that I could ask for.  So no Chair it was not only a 
group of people that I keep repeating.  It also depends on the nature of 
the request, because at some point we would even approach Pick ŉ 
Pay and Checkers.  Depending on what the request is for.  So it was 
definitely not a certain group that I am based with or that I am dealing 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 33 of 55 
 
with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well at some stage after you have finished giving 
evidence I would like you to, together with your legal team, to talk to 
the Legal Team.  So that they can establish what they should ask for 
...(intervenes). 
MS CHOLOTA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When they approach the Office of the Premier to 
obtain all of this information that you are talking about ...(intervenes). 
MS CHOLOTA:  Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because you would know to say well they must just 
10 
ask for this and that and that, because that is where the information 
will be. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Noted. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Just to take from that Ms Cholota if you go 
to page 41 of the bundle there is a list of people that are compiled 
there.  Is that part of the people that you will have utilised or identified 
20 
at – as businesspeople? 
MS CHOLOTA:  Yes.  Most of the people that I see here I have sent 
them regular – I mean the same requests. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Okay.  Alright and who would have 
compiled this list? 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 34 of 55 
 
MS CHOLOTA:  Myself.  This was my own draft. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Did you show it to the Premier at the 
time? 
MS CHOLOTA:  Not really.  It was just my draft on my laptop ma’am. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  I see the subject there says: 
“Guest to be Placed at the President and the Premier’s 
Table.” 
MS CHOLOTA:  Yes ma’am. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  That is the subject of this e-mail. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Yes ma’am. 
10 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Were you instructed by the Premier to 
compile this list? 
MS CHOLOTA:  No ma’am.  I should have – I would have taken this list 
of out of either a guest list of some sort of an event or so.  Hence I am 
saying I was like getting names where – from the database – the 
previous databases.  So this list was not done or compiled by the 
Premier.  It is my own list. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  My understanding of the e-mail is these 
are the guests that were supposed to be placed at the table of the 
President as well as the Premier.  So I would imagine that these people 
20 
were going to sit with the Premier.  Would he have been made privy of 
the people that he was going to sit with? 
MS CHOLOTA:  If my memory serves me well when I look at this e-mail.  
It is the e-mail that I was sending to the Department of Sports, Arts and 
Culture.  I cannot remember what the event was for.  So the list was 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 35 of 55 
 
from me to the Sports, Arts and Culture.  Not directly from the Premier. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  From the – from your Official address? 
MS CHOLOTA:  From the Official address.  Yes ma’am. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know whether some of the businesspeople or 
their companies who were approached with these requests for 
assistance by the Office of the Premier would have been people who 
were doing business with the Provincial Government? 
MS CHOLOTA:  Chair, I would not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would not know? 
MS CHOLOTA:  I would not.  No. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  It may be so.  It might not be so. 
MS CHOLOTA:  I would not know Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Alright.  Ma’am we are dealing with the 
issue of the scholarship. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Correct ma’am. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  We – I have gone through your statement 
in particular page 265 where you have given the background of the 
scholarship.  How it was started and you have already in your evidence 
said you found this program already in motion when you joined the 
20 
Office of the Premier. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Correct ma’am. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Would you know when you left in June that 
the program is still proceeding? 
MS CHOLOTA:  Yes.  I can confirm that ma’am. 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 36 of 55 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  What is the problem that is proceeding or 
program? 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  The program. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  The scholarship program? 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  The program.  It is still on.  It is still 
ongoing. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Yes.  It is still continuing ma’am. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Even when Mr Magashule left office 
10 
...(intervenes). 
MS CHOLOTA:  Correct ma’am. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  It continued? 
MS CHOLOTA:  Correct ma’am. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Are you aware of any payments or request 
that had been made since he left office in March? 
MS CHOLOTA:  I would not know of any payments, but I know of a 
couple of calls of people inquiring if we get a list who do we talk to – 
Department of Education.  Who do we meet with FSTDI and stuff, but I 
would not know if there are any proof of payment that took place after 
20 
that?  Since I was not the one dealing with them direct after I left the 
office. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Okay.  I ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think she was talking about after Mr Magashule had 
left ...(intervenes). 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 37 of 55 
 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you Chair. 
MS CHOLOTA:  When I was ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  But before you left. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Okay.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS CHOLOTA:  I was – yes.  I was still continuing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Would you be – would you be able to 
assist the Commission with that information?  The requests that were 
made post March 2018 until the time that you had left in June.  That 
10 
will be the requests that were submitted to the Premier’s Office as well 
as the requests that would have been made – funding requests that 
would have been made to businesspeople and that would be coupled 
with 
obviously 
if 
payments 
were 
actually 
received 
from 
the 
businesspeople or not. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Okay.  I can check with them at the Department from 
the IT Section or who is using the laptop.  Are we able to access the 
information? 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you very much. 
MS CHOLOTA:  We will work on that immediately after this. 
20 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know what you might have Ms Rangata and 
you may still ask further questions if you have, but what was important 
for me is confirmation whether these transactions relating to requests 
for payment by people outside of Government were made in the course 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 38 of 55 
 
of your performance of your official duties on behalf of the Office of the 
Premier which you have confirmed.  Is that right? 
MS CHOLOTA:  I did not hear that Chair.  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I am saying what was important for me 
...(intervenes). 
MS CHOLOTA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In relation to these transactions where your name is 
involved in requests for payment by people outside of Government of 
certain monies at the request of the Office of the Premier.  That was 
part of your official duties. 
10 
MS CHOLOTA:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Which you have confirmed? 
MS CHOLOTA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And to explain what the amounts were about and you 
say mostly they related to students? 
MS CHOLOTA:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Some studying inside the country.  Others studying 
outside of the country ...(intervenes). 
MS CHOLOTA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you have said that there is other – there are 
20 
other documents that are not here which would have been attached to 
explain what the amount requested was for and you say those 
documents would explain and then you say there are many other 
businesspeople who – to whom similar requests were made and there 
would be documents which can show that. 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 39 of 55 
 
There should be documents in the Office of the Premier which 
should show that.  Is that right? 
MS CHOLOTA:  Correct Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  I can just say that some of the amounts 
appear to me to be quite high.  You know.  I think there is an amount of 
about close to half a million Rand.  I think 470 000.  I think there is 
R30 000 altogether.  The two could have been half a million Rand.  I 
think it was to be sent to the President – a President in Cuba. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes.  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If I am not mistaken.  You remember that one? 
10 
MS CHOLOTA:  Yes.  I remember Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Would you know why it was such a big amount?  
You have a businessperson being asked to pay half a million 
...(intervenes). 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Such an amount.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Rand to a student? 
MS CHOLOTA:  Yes Sir.  When I read my e-mail Sir.  It says as 
discussed telephonically with Ms Morake from the Intergovernmental 
Relations.  I checked the dates and I believe there is a trip that 
happened to Cuba.  I am just not sure of the dates Chair – and 
20 
remembering my conversation with ma’am Morake I believe that they 
met with Mr Mpambani in Cuba and he committed – we had students 
who was studying medicine in Cuba and he committed to buy them 
laptops. 
That is when ma’am Morake came back and said this is the 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 40 of 55 
 
commitment 
we 
had. 
 
Can 
you 
kindly 
communicate 
with 
the 
businessperson and get the list of the students of those that we agreed 
to buy laptops for and see if Mr Mpambani would help as he committed.  
That is when I liaised with him and said you are following the 
discussion you had with Ms Morake. 
This is the list of the students and we managed to get a 
quotation for this amount of 474.  200 pieces of laptops if my memory 
serves me well, but then according to the documents and if I try to 
remember correctly.  Mr Mpambani did not buy those laptops for 470.  I 
believe a lesser quotation was obtained as I have the proof of payment 
10 
of the 200 000 plus the 100 000. 
So I believe they bought 200 laptops to an amount of 
300 000.  So Chair answering your question I would say that amount 
was sent to him based on his commitment.  If that makes sense Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So that was your understanding? 
MS CHOLOTA:  Yes.  That is my understanding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That he had independently made that commitment? 
MS CHOLOTA:  A commitment that he would buy student laptops. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was also an amount about some ...(intervenes). 
MS CHOLOTA:  Of ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Some event Africa Day or something. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  That is the 30 000 Chair. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Correct. 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 41 of 55 
 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that is the R30 000. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes. 
MS CHOLOTA:  That is the R30 000. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS CHOLOTA:  To the same students.  The gentleman was the SRC 
President.  Apparently they approached the Premier and told them that 
they have an event that is coming up to celebrate Africa.  So they 
would need funds to prepare to buy all the things that they need for the 
event and the Premier agreed that he will try and assist. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS CHOLOTA:  That is where the R30 000,00 comes from. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Okay.  Well you may proceed, but it 
seems to me that there may be a need – when are you leaving South 
Africa?  If you are able to say so.  If you should not say so publically I 
will respect that.  Maybe I should say where – when do you continue to 
– up to when are you available to assist the Commission with further 
investigation on this issue without saying whether – that means being 
out of the country or not? 
MS CHOLOTA:  Chair I would be available until – I was hoping until the 
20 
13 t h ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS CHOLOTA:  But it also depends on the things that I need to do 
before I leave.  So my schedule is a bit ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Tight. 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 42 of 55 
 
MS CHOLOTA:  Hectic.  Yes.  It is a bit tight, because I have not 
achieved even 60% of the things that I came here for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I will tell you what.  It would be very helpful to 
the Commission if you could have some – a session with the 
Investigators and maybe member – a member of the Legal Team.  Just 
to get as much information from you as possible to try and obtain 
documentation from the Premier’s Office if possible before you leave. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Okay. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that you are able before you leave to say okay 
what you have got is what I was talking about.  You have got everything 
that 
I 
think 
explains 
these 
transactions 
and 
whatever 
else 
...(intervenes). 
MS CHOLOTA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because you have indicated – I think part of the 
problem is that there have been challenges as I understand the position 
about your availability and it maybe I am not sure.  It may be that the 
legal team and the investigation team have not had a chance to sit 
down with you.  Get this – some of this explanation and be able to 
20 
follow up and check documents and so on. 
So if at all possible I think that would be very helpful.  If you 
could make time even within your tight schedule.  You will try that? 
MS CHOLOTA:  I will do my best Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Alright. 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 43 of 55 
 
MS CHOLOTA:  As I have explained previously I do not think it is going 
to be difficult, because the investigating team that used to – met with 
me previously. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Have most of the documents.  So I do not think it will 
be difficult Chair.  We will work on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Your – there might be one or two issues 
10 
that I just want to deal with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Ms Cholota if you can just quickly page to 
page 38. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Page 30? 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  38.  I will tell you ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  28 or 38? 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  38 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  38.  There is an e-mail there for – from 
20 
Ashnee Settrade to penny@robsinvestment.co.za.  The e-mail is 
sending of an invoice as requested between the two and the e-mail 
eventually finds its way into your Official e-mail address on the 2 n d – on 
the – if you go backwards on page 37 of the same bundle.  The bottom 
e-mail there is from Penny Mtentula to Ashnee and you are copied in 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 44 of 55 
 
your capacity premier@fspremier.gov.za. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Okay. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  And on the top e-mail there from yourself 
to Penny where you say noted.  My question there is very simple.  I just 
want to understand this seems like a conversation between two 
individuals or two entities and eventually they find themselves 
communicating with the Premier Office.  What would have been the 
reason for that? 
MS CHOLOTA:  If I read this clear ma’am.  I am the one who 
communicated with Robs Investment and I got the proof of payment for 
10 
Robs Investment.  That is why I said noted, but I will not be able to 
respond 
for 
the 
communication 
between 
the 
two, 
because 
I 
communicated with the – Rob Investment.  If ...(intervenes). 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA: 
 
My 
question 
says 
on 
page 
38 
...(intervenes). 
MS CHOLOTA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA: 
 
Ashnee 
is 
sending 
the 
invoice 
– 
Mr Ashnee sending an invoice to Mr Kennedy ...(intervenes). 
MS CHOLOTA:  Okay ma’am. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA: 
 And 
on 
the 
page 
37 
Kennedy 
is 
20 
responding with a proof of payment. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  To the same person that sent the invoice 
...(intervenes). 
MS CHOLOTA:  Correct ma’am. 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 45 of 55 
 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  But you get copied. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Yes.  I am copied in. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  What would be the reason between two 
entities that have – are communicating about their own payments.  Why 
would it end in the Premier’s address? 
MS CHOLOTA:  I would not know ma’am. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   You have noted on the top e-mail you 
have noted. 
MS CHOLOTA:   I have noted to Robb Investment I believe that is 
where I forwarded my request, if I am answering your question now. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your request being your request for what? 
MS CHOLOTA:   It should be for funding.  It should be for funding 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, you can’t off the top of your head remember the 
correspondence when you see it or you do remember it? 
MS CHOLOTA:   I don’t remember the conversation but as I have seen 
for proof of payment it should be for the request for funding Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   Thank you, on the same line I am going 
to move to page 31. 
20 
MS CHOLOTA:   31? 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   Yes, there is an e-mail there from Mr 
Mpambani sent to john.clux and copied Igo Mpambani, on that e-mail 
there’s a discussion about the payment, there seems to be a little 
confusion, sorry if I can just on the bottom there, there is an e-mail 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 46 of 55 
 
where it comes on the 3 r d of February 2015, I am just not sure where it 
comes from but to Mr Mpambani: 
“Good 
day 
Mr 
Mpambani, 
kindly 
forward 
your 
documents in PDF format and observe the following: 
invoice 1 for 51 must be dated 2 December 2014; 
invoice 2 for R31 must be dated 12 January 2015” 
I am just going to complete the picture for you, on the same e-
mail the one on top then gives more clarity, it says: 
“There seems to be a little confusion invoice was for 
R51 million but it was paid in two parts, R20 million in 
10 
December and R31 million in January.  Therefore I 
cannot make an invoice for R51 million (40%) and then 
another for R31 million (part of the same 40%) unless 
that is what is required for administration purposes.” 
This was found from your computer or your laptop.   Would you 
mind to comment how it landed in your computer? 
MS CHOLOTA:   I have no knowledge of this e-mail ma’am. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hmm. 
MS CHOLOTA:   It was not directed to me; I have no knowledge of this. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   Have you seen it before? 
20 
MS CHOLOTA:   No ma’am I saw it on this attachment of the affidavit 
for Mr Dokwane, it was the first time I see this. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   So when you read it what was your 
understanding of this, did you ask yourself why ...(intervenes). 
MS CHOLOTA:   I did not even go through it and tried to think about it, 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 47 of 55 
 
because it is not related to me and the e-mails that I have sent. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   So it was just in your computer, you were 
not aware of it, you don’t know what is it for, you didn’t ask anyone, 
you didn’t ask Mr Mpambani what is going on and why am I seeing this 
in my e-mail.  
MS CHOLOTA:   No knowledge of it ma’am, it was not in part of e-mails 
that I was sending to Mpambani. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you saw it for the first time in this bundle? 
MS CHOLOTA:   In this bundle, and if I remember correctly when I met 
with the ...(intervenes). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Investigators. 
MS CHOLOTA:  Investigators, but they did not give it to me, now that 
she is mentioning the name they ask me if I know so and so and I said 
no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS CHOLOTA:   Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I think the problem is the need for further 
investigation on some of these issues so that they can be looked into 
properly. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   Yes Chair, yes Chair.  Chair I have got a 
20 
last question for this witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  I think Ms Cholota there will be a need for 
the discussion that I talked about. 
MS CHOLOTA:   Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because some of the e-mails and some of the things 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 48 of 55 
 
still need further investigation and discussion and interrogation.  Ms 
Rangata you must just make sure it happens. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Ms Cholota’s legal representatives are here, I am 
sure they will try and assist but we need to make sure that there is no 
uncertainty about some of the things here. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But unless there is anything from your legal 
representatives, and I think there is nothing ...(intervenes). 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   I have got one last question. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   Yes Chair, sorry about that.   Ms Cholota 
I want to ask you the bursary scheme that was set up it was, I read 
from your affidavit, your statement, that it was designed for the needy, 
those people who cannot afford, am I right? 
MS CHOLOTA:   You are correct ma’am. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   There is an e-mail that deals with a 
request for payment or for funding by Ms Raphaela Mogwena, I am sure 
you are aware of it, it is item one of the bundle. 
MS CHOLOTA:   I am aware of it ma’am. 
20 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   And I would imagine that the scheme is 
designed to help those who will be able to show neediness. 
MS CHOLOTA:   If you explain it that way, I will explain mine when I 
reply. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   How do you identify people that needs to 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 49 of 55 
 
be funded, or needs assistance? 
MS CHOLOTA:   For me if it comes to a push for you to go out and 
seek help for me I would say you are in need of it, if it makes sense. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   So I can apply today and I will get 
funding for my children? 
MS CHOLOTA:   If we manage to assist you we will be able to assist 
you, it depends on your request ma’am. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   So the scheme is not based on 
indigenous, it is based on anybody who says can you assist me?  
MS CHOLOTA:   I was attending to all the requests that I received on 
10 
my Official e-mails. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   It does not matter if their parents can 
pay, or if you have got the ability to pay for yourself so it is not 
indigent based, it is on request based? 
MS CHOLOTA:   When it comes to the ones that we were forwarding to 
the Department of Education they do that background check, but the 
other requests that comes to me I would believe that if I received 
something and the person is explaining and put it all the relevant 
attachments to me that person is in need of that whatever they 
requested on that document. 
20 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   As part of that request can you also add 
this one so we can be finished with the supporting documents that we 
made when this particular request was made? 
MS CHOLOTA:   I saw everything on your file ma’am, everything is 
attached from their request up until, I am not sure if you did put 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 50 of 55 
 
...(intervenes). 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   I am talking about Ms Raphaela Mogwena 
in particular when she applied for the funding for her child. 
MS CHOLOTA:   Okay yes. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   Can we be furnished with the supporting 
documents that showed that she was in need of assistance. 
MS CHOLOTA:   Okay ma’am I will give you what I have on the laptop 
there ma’am. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   Thank you.  Chair that is all the questions 
that I have. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is all.   So are you saying that your 
understanding of the people who were supposed to be assisted by the 
Office of the Premier when Government Departments could not assist 
them did not have to be poor people, did not have to be people who 
could not afford the assistance themselves, as long as they made their 
request and you could look for some businessperson who could assist 
them? 
MS CHOLOTA:   If I put it correct Chair I would say the people who are 
poor and needy and could not afford was our priority, but in some 
instances I would say at some point people are asking for different, 
20 
even if, I am just making an example, even if my father is a Chief 
Director raising seven kids, four of us are at the University, they are 
going through a divorce and stuff like that, we would consider such 
happening in other people’s lives, but poor people, needy people were 
our priority. 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 51 of 55 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay but I guess that in order to make sure that you 
put a request to businesspeople that are really deserving there ought to 
be some kind of screening because otherwise you don’t want somebody 
who just wants to have a lot of pocket money when they are in Cuba or 
whatever to approach and say I am in need of money when actually 
they have got, they just want to have extra money. 
MS CHOLOTA:   You are correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You appreciate that? 
MS CHOLOTA:   I hear what you say Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but are you able to say whether you had in place 
10 
mechanisms to make sure that there was no abuse of that kind of the 
assistance? 
MS CHOLOTA:   Yes Sir, the investigation team can go through it, I 
truly believe that 90 if not 98% of the people that we assisted are 
people who are needy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS CHOLOTA:   Who were in need of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay and I am sure also whatever documentation 
might be available you will do your best to try and make sure we’ve got 
it. 
20 
MS CHOLOTA:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay, alright.  Thank you.   Unless your counsel 
has anything I am ready to release her. 
ADV LUISA MAKAPELA:  Chair I just have two quick points that I just 
wish to raise. 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 52 of 55 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, use the other mic. 
ADV LUISA MAKAPELA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes? 
ADV LUISA MAKAPELA:   The first is just to highlight I think what Ms 
Cholota had said about the fact that there was an International 
Governmental Relations Office that dealt with the international students 
and that her main priority was the fact that she dealt with the local 
students, and so I said that to get to the second point which is it might 
be somewhat difficult to get to the information that related to a 
separate component where she is concerned. 
10 
 
The other worry is the fact that Ms Cholota is no longer an 
employee of the Office of the Premier anymore, and my understanding 
was that upon receipt of the summons in June Investigators approached 
her and were able to mirror all her laptops and all her cell phone 
communication and so while she might be able to speak to the contents 
of that information I am not quite sure that she would be able to 
approach the Office of the Premier on any sort of official basis and 
obtain this information but she is very much willing to assist the 
Investigators in the interpretation of the information that they already 
have and in seeking to get individuals that may be able to provide that 
20 
information so just to that extent that she might not legally be able to 
approach a government officer that she is no longer an employee of she 
is willing to do her best. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no I appreciate that she is no longer there 
and therefore she can’t – she would have limitations but I think what I 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 53 of 55 
 
have in mind is that she would arm the Investigators and the Legal 
Team with all the information that they might need to get any further 
documents or information that may be necessary but also before or 
during the days that she might be able to make time she can give 
whatever information or clarify whatever may need to be clarified to 
them just to make sure that we have got everything that we need. 
ADV LUISA MAKAPELA:   No that is in order Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And we appreciate that she says that she will do her 
best. 
ADV LUISA MAKAPELA:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And we don’t expect to do what she cannot do. 
ADV LUISA MAKAPELA:   Indeed Chair and I think the correct 
procedure if I understand correctly where witnesses are summoned by 
the Commission is that the Evidence Leader team interviews the 
witness and that they have not had the opportunity to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV LUISA MAKAPELA:   To the extent that they would have liked to, 
so my understanding is that Ms Cholota is very much willing to co-
operate with the Commission and the Evidence Leaders and to the 
extent that she hasn’t been able to sit with them I think we do 
20 
apologise for that and we do take responsibility on her behalf for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, that is alright. 
ADV LUISA MAKAPELA:   Thank you Chair, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No thank you.   Ms Cholota thank you very much for 
responding to the summons, you will as arranged then co-operate and 
06 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 197 
 
Page 54 of 55 
 
meet with the Legal Team and the Investigators so that you see what 
more, how else you can be of assistance to them and they can indicate 
what more they would like to get from you and in the weeks and the 
months to come wherever you are if the Commission wishes to have 
more information I am sure you will cooperate, is that right? 
MS CHOLOTA:   Yes Chair I will cooperate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Within the constraints that you will have, you might 
have. 
MS CHOLOTA:   Anything in my ability to assist I will do so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  Thank you very much, you are 
10 
excused. 
MS CHOLOTA:   Thank you Chair. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay we are going to adjourn this is the last witness 
we are hearing this year; the hearings will resume next year from the 
13 t h of January.  There might just be a hearing of some application or 
other in between if a need arises but in terms of witnesses giving 
evidence this is the last witness for this year.    
 
We will then – we adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise.
