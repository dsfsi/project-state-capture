PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 19 FEBRUARY 2021 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning...  Good afternoon 
Mr Seleka.  Good afternoon everybody. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Good afternoon Chair. 
MS DANIELS:   Good afternoon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good afternoon Ms Daniels. 
MS DANIELS:   Good afternoon Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good.  Are we ready? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We are Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I should indicate that Ms Daniels is 
overseas.  So it is morning on her side. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did we wake her up quite early? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think we have Chair. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs]

SUZANNE MARGARET DANIELS:  (d.s.s.) 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you.  You may proceed 
Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chairperson.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Will you just briefly remind the public 
20 
what you will be dealing or tell the public what we will be 
dealing with today. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  Ms Daniels, the last 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 5 of 144 
 
time when she was here, she testified on the transactions 
and there was a couple of aspects in regard to the 
transactions, the Tegeta transactions, which involved a 
prepayment decision of R 1.6 billion.   
 
She took us through that, the submission and the 
decision made in respect of that aspect.  We ended up with 
her, just having touched on the guarantee. 
 
That prepayment decision ought to be converted 
into a guarantee on the 10 t h of December 2015.  She 
touched briefly on that and we had to adjourn. 
10 
 
She will continue from there Chairperson and 
also 
touch 
on 
the 
prepayment 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
R 659 million that was decided in April 2016.   
 
And she will show by virtue of correspondence 
emails how parties outside of Eskom, even in respect of 
the guarantee, even in respect of the drafting of the 
underlining agreement to that guarantee, got involved in 
that drafting process, which is what she did, also, in 
respect of the submission for the R 1.68 billion. 
 
We will then touch on the McKinsey/Trillian 
20 
matter insofar as Ms Daniels features there.  It is not a 
long aspect.  Just two aspects of the meetings of Trillian 
where she features Chair. 
 
And for that purpose, we would use two of her 
affidavits.  The one affidavit is already in Eskom Bundle 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 6 of 144 
 
18A on page 236.  That is marked Exhibit U-34.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I have got it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then Ms Daniels provided an affidavit 
in the early hours of this morning Chairperson.  It has 
incorporated in Eskom Bundle 8(a).   
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, so it is this other bundle that I have 
got here? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And that is on ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that has got to do with? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She responds to certain allegations 
made against her by those who – some of the witnesses 
who have come before the Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then she gives a section dealing 
with the Trillian/ McKinsey matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And that is the last part we will be 
addressing with her. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I might add also Chair.  We will touch 
on the R 2.1 billion penalties but very briefly in regard to 
that.  The new affidavit is on page 1079 in Eskom Bundle 
8(a). 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 7 of 144 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I have got it. 
EXAMINATION BY ADVOCATE SELEKA SC:   Ms Daniels, 
do you have the affidavit as well? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is your page reference, the numbering 
the same as I have been mentioning? 
MS DANIELS:   Uhm ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Eskom Bundle 8(a).  It will on page 
...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   I have just got Eskom Bundle 8. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Go to page 1079 of that bundle.  
I think the electronic bundles are not giving alphabetical 
numberings.  Page 1079. 
MS DANIELS:   I do not think it is incorporated into this 
bundle Adv Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Not on your electronic bundle? 
MS DANIELS:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay let us...  You have ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   No, it is not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is not incorporated.  Okay the 
20 
pagination – if we follow the pagination at the foot of the 
page on your – on that supplementary affidavit. 
MS DANIELS:   What page number would that be? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   If you have it separately it will be from 
page 1. 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 8 of 144 
 
MS DANIELS:   Oh, yes I do have it separately. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  On the cover sheet ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Seleka.  I wonder whether they 
could quickly paginate it, even at this stage, so that when 
you refer to pages, then we all have the same pagination.  
All she would need to do is, just put like 1079 and 8.  From 
8 one to the last page. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the left-hand corner. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then when you refer to pages, you just 
stick to the pagination. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I would use the pagination for the 
purposes of the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then for her convenience, I could 
use the page numbers at the foot of the page. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So I will use it at the same time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Simultaneously. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that...? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if you think that is fine, we can go 
on with that. 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 9 of 144 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us see.  Let us try it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Daniels, there is a cover sheet 
which is on or page 1079, a certificate of authentication. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   With that affidavit? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I just wish you to place it on record so 
that we ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I beg leave to have it admitted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Oh, and also for its 
admission? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Just for the purpose for now. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  When you turn the page 
Ms Daniels, it is our page 1080.  That will be the first page 
of the affidavit. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 10 of 144 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  The affidavit runs up to – on our 
side it is page 1102.  On your side it is page 203. 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   A signature appears there.  Do you 
confirm that to be your signature? 
MS DANIELS:   I confirm that that is my signature. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Just above signature of deponent.  And 
the date of the affidavit is 18 February 2021. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You confirm that.  You confirm this to 
10 
be your further affidavit – further supplementary affidavit to 
the Commission? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Ja, I beg leave to have it 
admitted as Exhibit U-18. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess what we should do is.  Since the 
certificate of authentication is separate, we should admit it 
separately and give its own exhibit number and her 
affidavit which you were saying with the... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Yes, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is...  I mean, I do not know – it seems 
to be separate although on my reference here it is one side 
of the same page as the first page of her affidavit. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
It 
is 
a 
separate 
document.  
Chairperson is correct. 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 11 of 144 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   However, it does relate to her affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It reads:  I, the undersigned...  And the 
person’s name is there, of the South African Consulate 
General in Los Angeles.  It is certified.   
“It is Suzanne Margaret Daniels of whose 
identify I have just satisfied myself has this 
day signed the attached document in my 
presence, this day, 18 February 2021.” 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you see.  Our normal... or she – or 
the 
Vice 
Consul 
General 
has 
also 
signed 
whereas 
commissioner of oaths. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess the certificate of authentication 
relates to authenticating the actual affidavit and the 
commissioner of oaths, at the end of the affidavit, serves 
the normal purpose that is certificates ends.  It does – but 
it does seem to me...  Do you have it as on the same page 
as her first affidavit or you have it as a separate document 
20 
all together, the certificate of authentication? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is printed out double-sided. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So it is on the flipside. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, so it is not part of the affidavit 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 12 of 144 
 
itself? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see, it is a standalone. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is a standalone document.  Then this 
is the affidavit.  I think we must give it its own exhibit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Exhibit number. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think you can just confirm with her, 
confirm the certificate of authentication with her and then 
we can admit it. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Ms Daniels, the – back to the 
cover of – covering sheet which is the certificate of 
authentication in the affidavit you gave us early this 
morning.  Are you at ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I have that.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   On that certification of authentication.  
I have read the contents thereof to the record.  Do you 
confirm that to be a commissioner...  Well, in this case it is 
a Vice Consul, South African Consulate General in Los 
Angeles certifying the contents of your affidavit. 
20 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And who has got the original of the 
certificate of authentication? 
MS DANIELS:   I have the original here Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have it?  Oh, okay alright. 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 13 of 144 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It has not been send through yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   And it ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   It is not sent through ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...in the meantime but you confirm 
Ms Daniels that this is the certificate of authentication that 
was signed by the Vice Consul in regard to your affidavit? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, Mr Chairman I had to attend there in 
person. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   To have it signed and commissioned. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  What exhibit number must 
we give it Mr Seleka?  It will be separate from the exhibit 
number of the affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Yes, Chair.  It will be U18.4.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay the certificate of authentication 
signed by the Vice Consul of the South African Consulate 
20 
General in Los Angels which appears on page 1079 is 
admitted and will be marked as Exhibit U18.4. 
CERTIFICATE 
OF 
AUTHENTICATION 
OF 
DANIELS 
MARGARET DANIELS IS ADMITTED AND MARKED AS 
EXHIBIT 718.4 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 14 of 144 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  And then the 
affidavit of Ms Daniels which appears – which starts on 
page 1080, I beg leave to have that admitted as Exhibit 
U18.5. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And she has confirmed, if I remember. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She has Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The affidavit of Ms Suzanne Margaret 
Daniels which starts at page 1080 is admitted as an exhibit 
and will be marked as Exhibit U18.5. 
AFFIDAVIT 
OF 
SUZANNE 
MARGARET 
DANIELS 
IS 
10 
ADMITTED AND MARKED AS EXHIBIT U18.5 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  Ms Daniels, shall we 
then proceed with your testimony?  And you could have in 
front of you the affidavit, your affidavit on the transactions 
which is in Eskom Bundle 18, page 236.   
MS DANIELS:   What numbers are you using Mr Seleka, 
the red or the black ones? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The black, the black numbers. 
MS DANIELS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Are you there?  I will not ...[intervenes]  
20 
MS DANIELS:   I am there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Ms Daniels, the last time you 
testified on how the board’s decision to make a prepayment 
of R 1.6 billion about, you had been instructed by Mr Koko, 
as you said, to do – to draft the submission.  That 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 15 of 144 
 
submission was proceeded by ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Go ahead. 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That submission was preceded by a 
letter which you had also been asked by Mr Koko to draft 
and have it addressed to the DMR.  Do you recall? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   That letter formed part of the 
submission that was submitted to the board in order to 
10 
motivate for the board’s resolution on the R 1.6 billion by 
way of a Round-robin.  Remember? 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct.  Yes, that is correct.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  And you took us through the 
drafting of that submission which went to Mr Eric Wood and 
ultimately to Businessman. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now, that Round-robin decision of the 
board was made on the 9 t h of December 2015.  On the 
10 t h of December, we see new developments in regard to 
20 
that decision of the board.  And that new development is a 
conversion, for a lack of a better word, of the board 
decision for making the cash payment into a guarantee.  
Do you remember that? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 16 of 144 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now we have provided with Mr Anoj 
Singh’s affidavit.  In his affidavit ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   Yes, you have. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  In his affidavit, Mr Anoj Singh 
makes an allegation that, to the effect that you came up 
with the idea for that guarantee.  What is your response? 
MS DANIELS:   No, that is incorrect Mr Chairperson.  I am 
not quite sure how the guarantee discussion came about 
but there was a memorandum from the Eskom Treasurer, 
Ms Caroline Hindley on the guarantee which Mr Singh 
10 
discussed with me.   
 
In it she sets out the advantages of not paying 
out the cash and limiting the risk to Eskom.  It was on that 
basis that he then asked me is it possible to do that and I 
advised that yes it is in terms of the resolution that was 
provided by the board. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now can you tell the Chairperson, why 
did you hold the view that it was possible for that board 
decision to be converted into a guarantee? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, in the resolution there is a 
20 
tax all fares.  I am just struggling to get to the submission.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that the R 1.6 billion submission? 
MS DANIELS:   The R 1.68 billion so that I can read it.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   You have the – if you have the Tegeta 
reference. 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 17 of 144 
 
MS DANIELS:   I am at Eskom Bundle 18. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right. 
MS DANIELS:   Is that the correct one? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that is the correct one. 
MS DANIELS:   Uhm ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   The submission ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   Can you just help me with... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You want the one to the board or to the 
IFC? 
MS DANIELS:   To the board would be the one that I would 
10 
reference. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Go to page...  Ja, do you want the 
submission or the resolution Ms Daniels? 
MS DANIELS:   The resolution would be fine Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay the board resolution then is on 
page 580.   
MS DANIELS:   And this is Bundle 18? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct.  Bundle 18, yes. 
MS DANIELS:   Okay I am almost there.  Okay.  The 
resolution that I – the part of the resolution that I relied on 
20 
was the one that said:   
“The 
Chief 
Financial 
Officer 
is 
hereby 
authorised to take all the necessary steps to 
give effect to the vote(?) including the signing 
of 
any 
consensus 
or 
any 
documentation 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 18 of 144 
 
necessary or related thereto.” 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay so for the purpose of the record.  
You are on page 580 of Eskom Bundle 18?  Are you 
reading from paragraph 2.1.4? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  But then, you would have seen 
Mr Koko’s affidavit where he says the submission he made 
and prepared to the board did not incorporate a guarantee.  
So the ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   No, it did not. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Sorry, can you see me when I 
speak? 
MS DANIELS:   I can see you now, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Okay what did you want to 
confirm? 
MS DANIELS:   No, it did not – it did not specifically 
mention a guarantee. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So that provision 2.1.4 you have 
just read, would have related to necessary steps in relation 
to the board decision for a prepayment? 
20 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We heard from Ms Naidoo, Viroshini 
Naidoo...  Oh, no that is in respect of the other two 
payments.  Oh, yes.  That Ms Cassim took part in the IFC 
meeting, 
teleconference 
of 
the 
board 
on 
the 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 19 of 144 
 
9 t h of December 2015.   
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct Mr Chairman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now did you and him not discuss the 
possibility of taking the matter back to the board if you 
were going to convert a board decision into something 
else, other than what the board had decided? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, not at that stage.  On the 9 t h, 
there was no talk of a guarantee.  It was purely a 
prepayment to the proposed purchaser of Optimum.  On the 
– I think it was on the morning of the 10 t h, the email from 
10 
the ABSA person came through and that was the first 
indication of a guarantee consideration. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, in fact, there was an email much 
earlier than that Ms Daniels.  Remember the email that 
Mr Koko receives from infoportal?  And he forwards that 
email to you and on the basis of that email you gave 
instructions to CDH. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   Are you referring to the email of Mr Koko? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Seleka and Ms Daniels.  
20 
Please do not forget your question. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And please do not forget your answer 
Ms Daniels. 
MS DANIELS:   [No audible reply]  
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 20 of 144 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just want to go back to the resolution.  
The – because you are giving evidence Ms Daniels to say 
Clause 2.1.4 of the Resolution appearing at page 580, 
Bundle 18 gave authority for the issuing of a guarantee, is 
that right? 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now I just want us to explore that 
a little bit before we go forward.  There is no reference in 
the resolution to a guarantee, is that correct? 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So to the extent that one would say that 
clause 2.1.4 authorises the issuing of a guarantee that 
would have to be on the basis that clause 2.1.4 implies 
such authority or is wide enough to include a guarantee, is 
that right? 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct, Mr Chairman, my view at 
the time that it was wide enough to include the guarantees 
based on the fact that the motivation set out by the Eskom 
Treasurer Ms Henry was to mitigate the risk of paying out 
that amount of cash. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I would like us to just explore that 
because I want to make sure I understand your reasoning 
correctly.  The resolution that is said to have been 
required, which I take is the resolution that was given 
says: 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 21 of 144 
 
“It is hereby resolved that the request from the 
Department of Mineral Resources is hereby noted.” 
That does not seem to say much in terms of what we are 
looking for.  In 2.1.2: 
“The Group Chief Executive together with the Group 
Executive 
for 
Generation 
and 
Chief 
Financial 
Officer are hereby authorised to negotiate and 
conclude a pre-purchase of coal agreement with the 
proposed owners of OCM. 
(a) 2.1.3: 
10 
“This agreement shall be subject to the necessary 
regulatory 
approvals 
having 
been 
obtained 
by 
Eskom and the supplier respectively as and when 
necessary.” 
That might not mean much.  So it seems that – because 
2.1.4 has got to be read with clause 2.1.2 to see whether it 
produces that meaning but I think you also referred to the 
first paragraph which says: 
1. “Having had due regard to all the following 
factors Eskom faces a supply risk of coal to the 
20 
Hendrina power station of 5.5Mtpa by OCM as a 
result of business rescue proceedings.” 
2. “There is potential proposal from the business 
rescue practitioners supported by the Department 
of Mineral Resources. 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 22 of 144 
 
3. The solution relates to a pre-purchase of coal to 
the value of R1.68 billion which mitigates supply 
risk for the funding of the pre-purchase will be 
made by an inventory working capital reduction 
of 54 days to approximately 40 days.  The 
proposal will result in a net present value benefit 
to Eskom of R238,9 million.  In conclusion this 
proposal provides much needed coal for business 
operations and mitigates the supply risk and 
provides financial benefit for Eskom.” 
10 
As I read this, it seems to me, and I would like your 
comment, that the steps which the Chief Financial Officer 
is authorised to take under clause 2.1.4 are steps that are 
meant to ensure that the conclusion of the pre-purchase of 
coal agreement referred to in 2.1.2 happens.  What do you 
say to that?  Do you think the same or do you think 
differently? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, Mr Chair, and one of those steps was 
to lay out the amount or pay the amount of R1.68 billion in 
cash to the supplier. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But that – but was that going to precede 
the conclusion of the coal agreement or was it going to 
come after? 
MS DANIELS:   It was going to come after the conclusion 
of the coal agreement. 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 23 of 144 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so if it was going to …[intervenes] 
MS DANIELS:   It was actually – if you look – if you… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, go ahead? 
MS DANIELS:   If you look at the coal agreement it is 
actually in there upon signature that the supplier would be 
paid with the – paid the amount of 1.68 billion. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Are 
you 
saying 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
agreement that was concluded there was provision that the 
supplier would be paid upon signature? 
MS DANIELS:   That is how I recall it, Mr Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where do we find that agreement?  I just 
want to quickly have a look at it. 
MR SELEKA SC:    The underlying agreement, Chair, is on 
page 442.7, the signed copy of that agreement.  442.7. 
CHAIRPERSON:   442.7? 
MR SELEKA SC:  Point 7, that is on bundle 18. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you going there, Ms Daniels? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I am, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you recall the clause that says what 
you are talking about. 
20 
MS DANIELS:   Sorry, Mr Chair, I lost the sound there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I see clause 6.1 of the agreement 
at page 442.8.  Ms Daniels, can you hear me now? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I can hear you now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, clause 6.1 may be the clause you are 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 24 of 144 
 
talking about, I am not sure, it says: 
“Eskom will make an advanced payment to OCM to 
pre-purchase crucial coal supply in terms of the 
existing coal supply agreement in the amount of 
1.68 billion payment on fulfilment of the conditions 
precedent set out in clause 5.1.” 
Is that what you are talking about? 
MS DANIELS:   That is what I am talking about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   6.2 then says: 
“Pursuant to clause 6.1 Eskom will issue a bank 
10 
guarantee in favour of Tegeta in the amount of 
R1,680 billion, that is guarantee amount, to secure 
the payment of the advance payment.  It is recorded 
that the issue of the guarantee will be conditional 
on the similar terms as set out in clause 5 hereof.” 
Is 
that 
what 
you 
are 
talking 
about 
when 
you 
said 
…[intervenes]    
MS DANIELS:   Yes, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So but now – okay, what the resolution 
said in 2.1.2 it that: 
20 
“The Group Chief Executive Officer together with 
Group Executive for Generation and Chief Financial 
Officer, 
I 
hereby 
authorise 
to 
negotiate 
and 
conclude a pre-purchase of coal agreement with the 
proposed owners of OCM.” 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 25 of 144 
 
Now the resolution does not say what terms and conditions 
these three officials of Eskom should bind Eskom to, is that 
right? 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
It 
simply 
says 
they 
were 
being 
authorised to negotiate and conclude a pre-purchase of 
coal agreement so it did not require them to come back to 
the 
board 
and 
say 
are 
these 
terms 
and 
conditions 
acceptable, can we go ahead and conclude an agreement, 
is that right? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct it was a very open – what is 
the word, a blanket authority to conclude the agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, the three officials were basically 
even a blank cheque to agree to whatever terms and 
conditions they thought were acceptable without having to 
go back to the board, is that right? 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct, usually – that is correct, 
Mr Chairman, that was my understanding because when we 
do negotiate and conclude there is no need to go back to 
the board, you know, for permission to conclude. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I accept that if the board gives you the 
authority to negotiate and conclude an agreement, you 
have not obligation to go back to the board, that would be I 
guess on the basis that the board has confidence that the 
three officials knew what they were doing and that they 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 26 of 144 
 
would were doing and that they would act in the best 
interest of Eskom, I would imagine.  Would you agree that 
such a bank cheque …[intervenes] 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I agree with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   …be given on that understanding, 
generally speaking. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, in general, Mr Chair, that would be 
the understanding. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And then what they then went on to 
do, the three officials, I assume, was to go and conclude 
10 
an agreement which said they should – Eskom should issue 
a guarantee, that is clause 6.2, I think, that we read. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it may well be that once the board 
had given them that wide authority that the board should 
not complain if they acted – they issued a guarantee but 
the resolution, by the mere fact that it authorised the three 
officials to conclude a pre-purchase of coal agreement 
which I understand to be a prepayment, did that not 
necessarily 
imply 
that 
the 
agreement 
that 
the 
three 
20 
officials were authorised to conclude was an agreement 
that allowed a prepayment, a payment for coal before coal 
was delivered. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, Mr Chair, it in effect was the payment 
of cash up front, upfront cash of 1.68 billion. 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 27 of 144 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   To the supplier.  If you strip away all the 
legalities. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, of what it was. 
MS DANIELS:   I mean, not the legalities, I mean, you 
know, the wording. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS DANIELS:   What it effectively meant is that Eskom – 
that the board authorised upfront cash payment of 1.68 
billion. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and therefore, the issuing of a 
guarantee in favour of Tegeta in circumstances, if this 
interpretation 
is 
correct, 
in 
circumstances 
where 
the 
resolution authorised in effect the payment of cash, the 
payment to be made was no worse than what was 
authorised and actually – I am not sure, it might have been 
– if they had taken cash and given it to Tegeta to this 
amount they would have acted within the resolution, is that 
correct? 
MS DANIELS:   Well, Mr Chair, that is correct, and that is 
20 
why, you know, the issuing of the guarantee, as strange as 
it may seem, was actually a better risk mitigation factor for 
Eskom because can you imagine had we paid the money in 
cash over to the supplier, there would have been greater 
issues. 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 28 of 144 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   So it was for that reason that, you know, I 
– when Ms Henry – she put it in a memorandum and you 
will see from her memorandum that she actually it is better 
for Eskom and I supported that within the ambit of what 
was provided because it was a better option for Eskom to 
hold on to the cash than to give it to a supplier because we 
would have given 12 months of cash actually. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Issuing the guarantee as opposed to 
paying cash certainly did not put Eskom in a worse position 
10 
than Eskom would have been if cash had been paid in 
advance. 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct and that was the reasoning 
that we adopted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
MR SELEKA SC:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I wanted to just explore this. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are free to explore it further and 
feel free to indicate anything that might indicate a different 
20 
interpretation or understanding. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Ja, no, that is alright, Chair.  Ms 
Daniels, let us see this because, you see, we need to just 
get the facts right.  When Tegeta was concluding a sale 
agreement 
with 
Oakbay 
OCH, 
the 
business 
rescue 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 29 of 144 
 
practitioner says in his affidavit, that is Mr Marsden, that 
the consortium of banks required Tegeta to show that it has 
sufficient funds to do the deal, to pay the 2.1 billion 
purchase price.  That is on the one hand. 
 
Now Tegeta seems to have not had – and I say 
seems, you can comment on that, not to have had the 
funds required.  What then happens is, early on the 10  
December 2015 and this is immediately after midnight, 
Chairperson, you see that email that comes from a 
businessman, is sent to Mr Koko and it sets out what 
10 
essentially became the terms of a guarantee to be issued 
by Eskom in favour of Tegeta.  
 
So the memorandum and what happens thereafter is 
preceded by that communication which is forwarded to you 
by Mr Koko on the basis of which instructions are given to 
CDH.   
So comment on this because based on those facts it 
would seem that even the idea of a guarantee did not 
originate from Eskom’s officials, it seems to have come 
from outside of Eskom in order to do what presumably Mr 
20 
Marsden is saying, Tegeta needed to demonstrate that they 
have sufficient funds to do the purchase of OCH.  Your 
comment on that? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, based on the communication, 
yes, it did come from outside but I think in our execution it 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 30 of 144 
 
was better for Eskom to issue the guarantee.  I just cannot 
remember the timing, Mr Seleka, if you can just show me 
the email. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   I think it came on the morning of the 10 t h 
as well. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes, I am going to give you that page 
reference, that is page 724 of Eskom bundle 18. 
CHAIRPERSON:   724? 
MR SELEKA SC:  724, Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
No 
but 
this 
one 
cannot 
have 
…[intervenes] 
MR SELEKA SC:  Bundle 18, 18A. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Bundle 18 cannot go to 7 something, it 
goes up to 597, black numbers. 
MR SELEKA SC:  The black numbers? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, my one. 
MR SELEKA SC:  18A? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, it is 18A. 
MR SELEKA SC:  You are there, Chairperson?  Okay. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I am not on the page you are talking 
about, I am saying I have got bundle 18A but it does not go 
to page 700 and something, the last page is 597. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Oh.  Yes, it is in – my junior says it is 
18B, Chair, sorry. 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 31 of 144 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR SELEKA SC:  724, where it is the same email on 723.  
Ms Daniels, are you there? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I am there. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes, so the email, the one below from 
businessman, dated 2015.12.10 at 00.15, to Matshela 
2010, the subject is Two Pager: 
“Two Pager between Tegeta and Eskom, Salient 
Facts. 
 
Eskom 
will 
provide 
bank 
guarantee 
…[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Salient points. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Salient points. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SELEKA SC:  I beg your pardon, Chair, I beg your 
pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To the extent that it makes a difference 
but in terms of what is written here. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Salient points. 
“Eskom 
will 
provide 
bank 
guarantee 
for 
1.68 
billion.” 
20 
Chairperson, let me accelerate this because if you turn the 
page, Ms Daniels, when you go to the next page, which is 
page 725, it is Ms Daniels’ email to Mr Rishaban Moodley 
of CDH.  That is on the 10 t h again of December 2015 but 
this time it is at 8.42 and Ms Daniels says: 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 32 of 144 
 
“Please call me, I need your assistance in drafting 
this agreement.  Urgent time pressure, I need the 
draft by 12.00.” 
Then Chairperson, the two pager is on the next page which 
is page 726.  Ms Daniels, you are following, hey? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I am following, Mr Chairman. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Then there is the two pager, two 
pager between Tegeta and Eskom Salient Points and we 
can compare point for point, Chair, what you see in the 
email which goes to Mr Koko and this two pager which is 
10 
sent to the attorneys. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I wrote here previously when one of 
the witnesses was giving evidence, compare this document 
with the one at page 724.  I think we compared it on that 
occasion. 
MR SELEKA SC:    That is correct, that was Ms Daniels, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Remember that, Mr Seleka, the point 
which I wanted to clarify with Ms Daniels was simply about 
whether the issuing of the guarantee was authorised by the 
resolution and nothing else. 
MR SELEKA SC:    Yes. 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 33 of 144 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the question of who the idea of 
guarantee came from. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Obviously that is separate but it was 
simply the question of whether the three officials and Ms 
Daniels could say that the issuing of a guarantee fell within 
the authorisation in the resolution. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I just want to make sure.  Obviously 
at some stage you will indicate what your thinking is but 
10 
you can go ahead.  So I think she – Ms Daniels confirms 
that the idea of a guarantee came from outside of Eskom. 
MR SELEKA SC:    That is right, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja and we can see that the document 
she attaches to her email, which is the email at page 725 
and the attachment is at 726, we can see that the 
attachment insofar as it relates to the guarantee that 
[indistinct] 27.09 is the same as the document at page 724.  
If there are any differences they will be minor. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Correct, Chair, correct, Chair.  Ms 
20 
Daniels, yes, just to clarify and maybe make clear the 
response to the Chairperson’s question, whether on the 
terms of the resolution of the board for the prepayment of 
R1.6 billion could one rely on those terms to make a 
conclusion that those terms also authorised the CFO, Mr 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 34 of 144 
 
Anoj Singh to issue a guarantee in favour of Tegeta.  Mr 
Koko says that submission did not incorporate a proposal 
regarding a guarantee.   
The board is also surprised that there was a 
guarantee issued the day after they made that decision.  
They say they did not authorise a guarantee.   
I know you have already said that you relied on 
paragraph 2.1.4 of the resolution but strictly speaking, 
what would be your answer to the Chairperson whether that 
reliance can be substantiated by the provisions of the 
10 
resolution.  Whether you look at it then or now you can 
make the distinction is up to you. 
MS DANIELS:   Ja, I am going to look at it then answer the 
aspects of your question in the following manner and tell 
me if I am interpreting correctly.   
 
Number 
one, 
my 
instructions 
regarding 
the 
guarantee came from Mr Koko so for Mr Koko to say that 
he does not know about the guarantee, I mean, it is clear 
from the evidence that he forwarded the email to me.  We 
had a discussion and that is how I instructed CDH on the 
20 
matter. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Ja, can I, sorry ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   Second ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry can I just, he does not 
necessarily say he does not know about the guarantee but 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 35 of 144 
 
what I am saying to you is he says the submission did not 
incorporate a recommendation for a guarantee, that is all I 
was saying. 
MS DANIELS:   That is, that is – oh okay, that is correct in 
terms of the guarantee was not specified as an instrument, 
okay.   However, what the Board did authorise was the 
upfront payment of cash, the amount of R1.68billion and it 
was in that context that we looked at the risk, to Eskom, I 
cannot remember what, I just lost my thought. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well the question I am not sure that it 
10 
went beyond that.  You may, in dealing with it Mr Seleka 
the question of whether issuing of a guarantee was 
authorised for purposes of assisting me because Mr 
Singh's 
presence 
there 
does 
seem 
to 
me 
that 
the 
resolution was wide enough.  
But it may be that there is something I am missing 
that you might be able to point out.  It seems to me that 
this could be compared to a situation where I authorise you 
to pay somebody from my money in cash R100,00 and 
instead of paying them in cash you issue a cheque.  How 
20 
can I complain, unless that other person complains but the 
agreement was cash, so by you giving me a cheque but I 
do not see how I can complain, if it does not make a 
difference to the other person that you have given a 
cheque, if they are happy with a cheque. 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 36 of 144 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I hear what the Chairperson is 
saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In the end if the cheque is presented, 
then honoured money will go out and in terms of what I had 
authorised you, cash would have gone out probably earlier 
than, cash would go out by way of a cheque.  The only 
complaint I can have, about you issuing a cheque instead 
of cash is if I think that the issuing of a cheque will 
prejudice the other person or the other person will 
complain because of whatever delays there may be before 
10 
they get cash but if the other person is happy, I do not see 
why I would have a problem with the fact that you issued a 
cheque.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I think Chair the ultimate issue 
turns on the purpose of either the cash payment, I mean 
for 
our 
purposes, 
either 
the 
cash 
payment 
or 
the 
guarantee.  The ultimate purpose that was meant to be 
achieved or objective to be achieved by issuing either the 
cash or the guarantee.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no I do not have a problem with 
20 
that that is important.  It is just that all along I have 
understood that there is an issue about whether the Board 
had authorised the issuing of a guarantee. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And obviously, we need to apply our 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 37 of 144 
 
minds to that but if the reasoning that indicated is correct 
it seems to me that the Board cannot complain or should 
not complain or blame the officials for issuing a guarantee 
in circumstances where they had authorised them actually 
to pay even cash, you see. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So obviously we can look at other 
issues, if there is no indication that this construction of the 
resolution is wrong but if there is anything that suggests 
that it is not sound, we can look at it.  But on the face of it, 
10 
that seems to be the, that seems to me to be the position 
and therefore the Board should have no grounds to 
criticise the officials if they did not apply their minds to the 
resolution that is there problem. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is it not the Chairperson looking at 
ultimately which one is the worst of the two?  Because on 
the face of it, the resolution is, it contemplates a cash 
payment.  So steps to be taken are in relation to the cash 
payment.  What the Chairperson is saying is, but is that 
not in itself to take all the necessary steps to give effect to 
20 
the above?  Does that not open the door for them to do 
even the less of the two worst situation?  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you see, it seems to me that one 
has to start with what authority the three officials - what 
terms and conditions the three officials were authorised to 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 38 of 144 
 
agree to in terms of the agreement, and it seems that the 
Board gave them a blank cheque as it were to say you will 
see what terms and conditions you agreed to and they 
decided to agree to among others a clause that says a 
guarantee would be issued.  
Now, if you accept that, that fell within, that was left 
to them to decide what terms and conditions they should 
bind Eskom to, they bound Eskom to among others to that 
and once they had bound Eskom to that term they had to 
issue the guarantee.   
10 
If the Board did not, if the Board wanted to narrow  
the scope for their mandate, to say, you can agree to 
whatever terms and conditions except not about A, B, C, D 
it was free to say so in their resolution, they did not say 
so, they just gave them a wide the widest possible 
authority in terms of what terms to agree to. 
It may well be that they were terms and conditions 
that are usually agreed to between Eskom and such 
suppliers in such a case and they expected the officials to 
agree to usual terms but they did not say so in the 
20 
agreement, they did not say they must negotiate and 
conclude an agreement on the usual terms and conditions.  
They just said you negotiate and conclude and the 
official decided one of the things we will agree to will be a 
guarantee but that was not voiced then what had been 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 39 of 144 
 
authorised if one reads the resolution to mean that the 
Board authorised pre-payment which could be cash, ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:    I mean, I have mulled over that 
Chairperson I know that the guarantee would have in the 
minds of the executive be more safeguarding to the 
interests of Eskom exactly for what Ms Suzanne Daniel is 
saying that the cash constraints at the time, financial 
constraints at the time in regard to Eskom and maybe the 
Board does not have a leg to stand on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, on the face of it unless the Board 
10 
comes up with something else or unless somebody picks up 
in 
it 
something, 
it 
does 
appear 
that 
the 
resolution 
authorised this kind of thing, it left it to the three officials 
to agree the terms and conditions and one of the terms 
they agreed to was the issuing of a guarantee. 
So that of course does not deal with the question 
whether it was right or it was proper, it was justified to 
agree to a pre-payment on the part of the Board in the first 
place.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it answers the question whether the 
three officials were authorised to issue a guarantee. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, Chairperson I wanted to add that 
in terms of the PFMA that you may well say well that is 
exactly what the Board did but in terms of the PFMA, the 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 40 of 144 
 
guarantee can only be issued by the accounting authority 
in the case of Eskom.  I think Ms Suzanne Daniels, you can 
explain that we did go through that and I know that the 
Parliamentary Portfolio Committee, there was a debate 
about 
whether 
it 
does 
not 
require 
ministerial 
prior 
approval, 
having 
lifted 
the 
provisions 
of 
the 
PFMA, 
actually, in this case, the accounting authority.  
But I am also mindful of what Ms Naidoo said that 
the Board, I think she said the Board had the authority only 
up to R750million to issue a guarantee. So beyond that, 
10 
according to her, then you will require ministerial approval. 
I think Ms Suzanne Daniels can explain that to us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you see it is important to separate 
all the issues.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So far, all we were talking about and all 
I was raising was whether the issuing of a guarantee fell 
within the terms of the resolution.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That does not necessarily mean it was 
20 
following the terms of the PFMA, it does not mean it was in 
order in terms of any other instrument.  It may well be that 
one might say the Board did authorise by its resolution the 
issuing of a guarantee, but obviously could not authorise 
the issuing of a guarantee that falls on its delegated 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 41 of 144 
 
authority or beyond its power.  So if the guarantee was 
beyond its power, and one assumes the officials would 
know that because we are talking here about the chief 
executive officer of Eskom and chief financial officer that 
they would know what falls within, what fell within the 
mandate within the power of the Board in terms of 
amounts.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So if the argument is from the Board, we 
are not saying that the officials did not - the resolution did 
10 
not authorise the issuing of a guarantee at all.  We accept 
that the resolution did authorise in effect or by implication 
issuing of a guarantee, but it could not authorise the 
issuing of a guarantee that is your power in terms of 
amounts of the Board, then that is a different argument. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I am with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair I think what - the way I have 
seen it is to restrict the resolution to a cash pre-payment 
by virtue of that paragraph which says: 
20 
“You take all necessary steps to give effect to the 
above, it does go on including the signing of any 
concerns or any other documentation necessary or 
related there too.” 
Which is the above, it is a contemplation or a decision for 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 42 of 144 
 
the pre-purchase of coal and I am separating that aspect 
from the lesser of the two evils, ultimately, a step being 
taken the next day.  I mean, the executives might well have 
seen that well it will be risky for us to part with cash, as 
opposed to issuing a guarantee, let us rather resort to the 
lesser of the two evils and decided well it is not necessary 
to even go to the Board because we actually saving Eskom 
money.  And the question obviously is on the face of it, if 
the resolution is restricted, in terms of the above and what 
is in relation thereto, where does it take us?  Because 
10 
ultimately the executives took a step that was favourable 
to Eskom, you know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well you see it seems to me that clause 
2.1.2 of the resolution and I am not looking at I am just 
mentioning it from memory.  Is so wide that for purposes of 
whether there was entitlement to issue a guarantee there 
might be no need to go to the clause that Ms Daniels was 
relying on because you say clause 2.1.2 gives the three 
officials complete discretion to what they must bound 
Eskom to in terms of that agreement.  
20 
And if they choose to bound Eskom to saying issue 
a 
guarantee, in circumstances where the resolution actually 
authorises 
the 
payment 
of 
cash 
that 
is 
within 
the 
resolution.  
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 43 of 144 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And once they have included that in the 
agreement, obviously it is going to be honoured and then 
maybe with or without clause 2, was it clause 2.1.4 the one 
that Ms Daniels relied on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe with or without it still they are 
authorised but certainly it seems you can say once they 
have included the issue of a guarantee in the agreement as 
a term or condition that clause 2.1.4 allows them to take 
10 
whatever steps to give effect to that agreement. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, because, well, if you take it to its 
logical conclusion the guarantee would simply defer the 
date of payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, because that is exactly what they 
even say here in their agreement.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so it seems that the Board unless 
they come up with something more convincing cannot really 
complain that in issuing the guarantee the officials did 
20 
something that they were not authorised by the resolution 
to do.  
Yes, but of course you feel free to - you can always 
come back later on if you reflect and you or you come 
across something that might change one's thinking. But in 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 44 of 144 
 
the meantime, you can explore the other issues of you 
know, Ms Daniels has confirmed that the idea of this 
guarantee came from outside of Eskom.  I do not know 
whether she may have dealt with this before, Ms Daniels 
you say it came from outside from whom outside of Eskom 
did it come? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, at the at the time I did not 
know because you can see from the email it came from Mr 
Matshela Koko, and then it came from Businessman, based 
on the evidence and the other emails, you know, it was 
10 
more than likely that this list of business plan is Mr Salim 
Essa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well…[intervene] 
MS DANIELS:   Because…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, continue. 
MS DANIELS:   Well because later on in the email 
exchange both the investigators, and I think it was in 2018 
the Mail and Guardian showed me the emails and they are 
included in the bundle that the paperwork that we prepared 
inside of Eskom actually went to Mr Salim Essa and Mr Eric 
20 
Wood. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, now Mr Koko when he gave 
evidence here a few weeks ago said that, I think he said he 
was shocked or he would be shocked if the position was 
that Businessman was Salim Essa or was somebody from 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 45 of 144 
 
outside of Eskom.  I cannot remember how he put it 
because as far as he was concerned, he had been told and 
I do not know whether he said he had been told by you, I 
think he said, you had told him that Businessman was Dr 
Ngubane the Chairperson of the Board.  What do you say 
to that? 
MS DANIELS:   Ah, no Mr Chairman, I think Mr Koko is 
trying to mislead the Commission.  I at no stage told him 
that the info portal address or businessman address 
belongs to Dr Ngubane.  I did not use it; I categorically 
10 
deny that.  Dr Ngubane had a personal email and it was 
Baldwin[?] - I am just reading from my affidavit that I - the 
latest one I submitted.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS DANIELS:   It is baldwin.ngubane@gmail.com. That 
was his personal address that you used at Eskom and 
there would have been no reason.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Was that personal email address of Dr 
Ngubane known to Mr Koko at the time as far as you know? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, it was as far as I know yes, it was.  I 
20 
think Mr Koko in his…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I am asking whether, to your 
knowledge did Mr Koko also used the – Dr Ngubane’s 
personal email address, or is that something you do not 
know? 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 46 of 144 
 
MS DANIELS:   I am not sure at the time was the Mr. 
Chairman, but he would have known about it because on 
the correspondence that I would have sent out, you would 
see 
on 
the 
correspondence 
to 
the 
Board 
and 
the 
executives, I would have used their Eskom and their 
personal addresses. So it would have been known to the 
executives. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so are you saying that there are 
documents, Eskom documents or emails that you sent to 
Board members and maybe some of the senior executives 
10 
at Eskom which included Dr Ngubane’s personal email 
address that you have just mentioned? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Mr Koko would have been one of the 
recipients of such emails that you sent, which included Dr 
Ngubane’s 
personnel 
email 
address 
that 
you 
have 
mentioned? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do we by any chance have such 
documents Mr Seleka? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I will check in suspension…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe I could ask her Ms Daniels she 
might know, in the bundles that we are using have you 
come across any documents that you send to, among 
others, Mr Koko which had Dr Ngubane’s personal email 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 47 of 144 
 
address that he used at Eskom that you mentioned? 
MS DANIELS:   I think if you actually look at the round 
robin resolution, Mr Chairman that I sent out, I am just 
trying to get the page it may just be on there as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, ja, you can look. 
MS 
DANIELS: 
 
 
I 
just 
would 
need 
help 
from 
the…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Evidence Leader. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I am looking for her email where she 
seeks, invites the Board members to a round robin. 
10 
MS DANIELS:   It is on Eskom 18, oh no that is just Anoj 
Singh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, this on page 524 Ms Daniels it 
does not show the email address it shows the name of Dr 
Ben Ngubane that is where you send an email requesting 
the Board to make a round robin decision on the 9 t h of 
March. 
MS DANIELS:   But I am sure we can find an email for you 
Mr Chairman where we, where I sent it to everybody. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and you think it might be quite a 
20 
few that could be found? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, there will be quite a few, Mr Koko was 
quite involved in some of the decisions that were made.  
So he would be well aware that Dr Ngubane’s address is 
baldwin.ngubane@gmail.com. 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 48 of 144 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, if – have you found something Mr 
Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I found it on page 571 on Eskom 
bundle 18, 571 but it is only an exchange between Ms 
Suzanne Daniels and Dr Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, it does not involve Mr Koko but 
Miss Ms Daniels says there will be quite a few.  I guess 
whether in the bundles or not in the bundles, if they are 
not in the bundles you think they can be found easily Ms 
Daniels? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, Mr Chairman, I think if you, if the 
investigating team does a search on the emails that I sent 
to the Board members and executives, you will find them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, then they should come across those.  
MS DANIELS:   Yes, you will definitely come across those.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, do you know whether there would 
be a category of emails where you would include the 
personnel emails, email addresses or in other words, how 
would 
one 
know 
when 
you 
include 
personnel 
email 
addresses of the Board members and when you do not or 
20 
does it happen when it happens and then it did not happen 
when did not happen? 
For example, if you were sending minutes of the 
Board meetings, do you know whether you would include 
the personnel email addresses of the Board members, or at 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 49 of 144 
 
least of Dr Ngubane or is it when you were dealing with a 
different category of documents that you would include it? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, during this time, you know, 
in the early stages of let us say 2015/2016 Eskom’s IT 
system did not - was not sort of compatible for some of the 
Board members.  So they asked - so you would find that I 
had to send it to both the Eskom address and the personal 
email address.   
So I did not have a defined category yet, you know, 
as to when I would send, so you would see on the emails 
10 
that I would send it to the Gmail address and the Eskom 
address. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so that is fine.  So…[intervenes] 
MS DANIELS:   So it was ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...or the period when you did that 
because that was because of the challenges ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...of the anti in Eskom? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes.  And I think that even when Eskom 
developed an app for the board members, you know, a 
20 
secure portal, there was still problems with the board 
members and they would ask that it be send to their 
personal emails.  And that is why you see personal emails, 
work emails...  You know, there is a mixture.  It was not yet 
...[intervenes]  
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 50 of 144 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   A special ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   ...in terms of a board portal yet.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You... the investigators or somebody 
must just pursue that.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Or I can address other emails to 
the board members with private email addresses which is 
not Eskom email addresses but Mr Koko is not in that 
correspondence.   
 
Ms Daniels, just – okay so we have traversed the 
issue of the guarantee.  It is issued in favour of Tegeta.  
We have read the agreement which says: 
“It suspends the payment until the fulfilment of 
the conditions. 
The conditions have an expiry date which is 
20 
the 31 s t of March 2016.” 
 
Do you recall that? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which is in Clause 5 of the Agreement 
by the ...[intervenes]  
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 51 of 144 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just want to go back to this issue of 
Mr Koko saying that he was told by Ms Daniels that the 
infoportal address was for Dr Ngubane.   
 
In your discussions – or when Mr Koko would send 
emails to Dr Ngubane, would those emails be opened by 
you and handed over to Dr Ngubane by yourself or would it 
be opened by his PA and handed over to him or would he 
open it themselves? 
10 
 
Or, sometimes he would do so, sometimes they 
would do so and sometimes you would do so? 
MS DANIELS:   It would be a combination of the three, the 
last scenario that you mentioned Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MS DANIELS:   I did not have direct access to mister...  
Sorry, Dr Ngubane’s email at Eskom.  That would be the 
prerogative of the PA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS DANIELS:   And she would bring to my attention if 
20 
there were emails that she was not sure what to do with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS DANIELS:   Dr Ngubane did attend at the Eskom office.  
Then he would also go through his emails. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 52 of 144 
 
MS DANIELS:   And if he received emails on his personal 
email that he needed, he would send them to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS DANIELS:   So it really depended on what the nature of 
the email was and what he wanted done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Did you ever have an occasion to 
discuss with Mr Koko any emails or documents that he sent 
to the email address of Businessman, the infoportal email 
address at any stage giving that while you were both at 
Eskom? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Chair, Businessman or...  You see, it is a 
difficult one.  The subject matter of the transactions, we 
did discuss.  It was not – I was not aware that he had sent 
them to the infoportal.   
You would see in my supplementary affidavit that I 
filed 
today 
or 
yesterday, 
that 
I 
do 
highlight 
some 
transactions based on Ms Matjeko’s evidence but he would 
discuss with Dr Ngubane if it were a board matter.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So are you saying ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   And ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...you may have discussed documents 
that he would have sent to Businessman but if you – you 
would not know that he had sent them to Businessman.  
That is what you are saying? 
MS DANIELS:   That is what I am saying. 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 53 of 144 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You never discussed a document that, to 
your knowledge, he had sent to Businessman? 
MS DANIELS:   Well, at the time Mr Chairman because if I 
– when I listened to the evidence that has been coming 
out, there have been documents that have been sent to 
Businessman 
that 
came 
before 
the 
board 
and 
were 
discussed with Mr Koko. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but what I am saying is.  At the 
time of you discussing such documents.  You are saying 
you would not have known that he had sent them to 
10 
Businessman? 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You might found out later but at that 
time, you say you were not aware.  You would have 
discussed documents which might later on turn out to be 
documents that he had sent to Businessman. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Mr Seleka, you may continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you can take further whatever may 
20 
arise from the evidence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  I will send the broadcast Chair 
with Ms Suzanne Daniels interview at 07:02.  In that 
broadcast Ms Daniels is the – a clip of a previous interview 
with Mr Koko.  And he is asked:  Who is Businessman?  He 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 54 of 144 
 
says:  Suzanne Daniels.  Do you remember that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it Mr Koko who says that? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is exactly on these lines to say 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He is interviewed and he tells the 
interviewer ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...that the email address is – the 
infoportal1@zoho.com is Ms Daniels’ email address.  So he 
is asked:  Who is Businessman?  And he says:  It is 
Suzanne Daniels.  And Ms Daniels had to be asked exactly 
these questions about the email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that interview was between Mr Koko 
and somebody not involving Ms Daniels as well? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct.  Ja, it did not involve her.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So there is a previous interview with – 
20 
of Mr Koko.  This time Ms Daniels has – is on the station 
for an interview.  Then they played the clip. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The previous clip of Mr Koko. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And asked for her comment? 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 55 of 144 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And asked for her comment, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Well, what did you say on that 
occasion Ms Daniels? 
MS DANIELS:   He got me fixed up Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Well ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   To even be ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Would the implication of ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   ...that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Would the implication of that version, 
Mr Seleka, be that what Mr Koko told the interviewer in 
10 
that clip and what he told the Commission are contradictory 
in the sense that in the Commission he said he understood 
the infoportal email address to be belonging to Dr Ngubane 
but in the clip that you say that was played to Ms Daniels, 
he does not say that email is Dr Ngubane’s but he says it 
is Ms Daniels? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In the clip yes Chair.  I should say 
that, I do not think they played the entire interview of 
Mr Koko. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   They played a clip and then they asked 
Ms Suzanne Daniels to comment and they asked her 
further questions on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So ...[intervenes]  
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 56 of 144 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But obviously, that clip – the entire 
interview should be obtained. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that it can be looked at. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I think that should be done. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Ms Suzanne Daniels, quickly on...  
Okay so the board is approached on the basis that there is 
an urgent need for coal in terms of the submission.  Or was 
it the submission on page 527 of Eskom Bundle 18? 
 
But I suppose you accept this is the gist on which 
or the basis on which the board was approached to make a 
Round-robin 
decision 
overnight 
on 
the 
9 t h  of December 2015? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  And when ultimately the board 
20 
decision is executed or implemented, it results in a 
guarantee being issued but the guarantee is subject to 
suspensive conditions as well as the underlining agreement 
in that guarantee and that is the period of three months, 
for about three months, until 31 March 2016. 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 57 of 144 
 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which – on the basis of which Mr Anoj 
Singh testified at the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee 
that he was aware that coal was not going to be supplied 
during that period.  Hence he opted for a guarantee as 
opposed to a cash payment.  I do not know whether you 
know about that? 
MS DANIELS:   I saw it – you brought it to my attention in 
our discussions.  I saw that.  I really cannot make sense of 
it. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MS DANIELS:   Because the – I think the coal supply and it 
was effective from the 1 s t of January 2016 subject to those 
suspensive conditions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   So it is really a much about muchness. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Well, that is alright.  And then – I 
mean at Clause 6.1 of the Pre-purchase Agreement which 
says:   
“Payment will only be made upon the fulfilment 
20 
of the conditions.” 
 
So 
everything 
is 
deferred 
until 
the 
31 s t of March 2016. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The point I am trying to make is that, 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 58 of 144 
 
the execution of the board decision by deferring everything 
for three months, it undercuts the motivation of an urgent 
need for coal to the Hendrina Power Station. 
 
So it weakens the very motivation why the board 
had to make this decision on an urgent basis for to avert a 
risk which was said to be eminent at the time.  You see the 
point I am making? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I see the point that you are making 
Adv Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, I think the – you know if you 
look at the submission closely, the underlining issue was 
security of supply.  And I think that was a little bit broader 
than just the urgency of like an immediate need.  So yes it 
was premised on urgency but it was delayed at the end of 
the day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but I think the part of the point that 
had been – that Mr Seleka seeks to make is, the board was 
prevented from discussing this issue in a proper board 
meeting.  And it was sent a Round-robin resolution on the 
20 
basis that this was urgent because there were – you were 
seeking to address an urgent coal supply demand.  Is it 
not?  That is what the resolution said, is that not so? 
MS DANIELS:   That is how it was framed Mr Chairman.  
So, yes, but I just want to point out that, you know, I think 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346

that in the beginning it was supposed to be a meeting but 
because the board members were not available during that 
time, it then became a Round-robin resolution.  And yes, 
the executives did push the urgency factor at that point in 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but it seems that the board could 
have met in a week’s time, it could have met in two weeks’ 
time, it could have met even in a month’s time to discuss 
this issue.  Is that not so? 
MS DANIELS:   That is so Mr Chairman. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then when the management wanted 
the board to authorise this matter.  Are you saying that first 
there was an attempt to arrange for a board meeting to 
take place and there seems to be problems of the 
availability of members of the board and that is why the 
idea of a Round-robin was resorted to?  Is that what you 
are saying? 
MS DANIELS:   Chair, my – what I am saying is, when 
Dr Ngubane approached me, he wanted me to convene a 
meeting.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS DANIELS:   As the discussions went along, you will see 
there is an email of the CFO’s office, Mr Singh’s office, 
asking for it to be a Round-robin.  And I do ask, as the 
Chairman knows about this, because my understanding was 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 60 of 144 
 
that he wanted a meeting.  It then became a Round-robin 
because it was urgent.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So the ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   And ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The idea that it should be a Round-
robin, from whom did it come from? 
MS DANIELS:   There is an email from the general 
manager from Mr Singh’s office asking that it be sent out 
and now a Round-robin. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  At that stage, do you know 
10 
whether before the manager sent that memo or note or 
email.  Do you know whether there had been attempts to 
communicate with the board members to ask them to avail 
themselves for a meeting on some date discussing the 
issue? 
MS DANIELS:   Well, Mr Chairman I was still checking 
availability during that time.  It really happened so quickly.  
It was already the first week in December and people were 
already going on holiday.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So who would ordinarily speak to board 
20 
members about a need for a meeting and who would talk to 
them about dates?  Would it have been the company 
secretary? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that would have been – at that time 
that was me.   
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 61 of 144 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   I was the Company Secretary. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   It was mister... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, continue. 
MS DANIELS:   The Chief of Director also spoke to the 
board members directly.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS DANIELS:   So, you know, Mr Singh and executive 
directors were the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief 
10 
Executive.  So they would – you know, as part of the board 
they would discuss it with the board members. 
 
Sometimes I would just be told that we need a 
meeting, but in this instance, I had been approached by Dr 
Ngubane to say try and arrange a meeting and I would get 
the information from Mr Singh and Mr Koko. 
 
As things unfolded, there was an email from – I 
think it was Ms Naidoo, asking that this go out on Round-
robin and he was in the office of Mr Singh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Is my understanding correct that 
20 
you yourself did not engage with board members prior to 
this email or letter from Mr Singh’s office?  You did not 
engage with board members and with the chairperson of 
the board, Dr Ngubane about possible dates for a meeting? 
MS DANIELS:   I actually did not get a chance to do that.  
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 62 of 144 
 
I had already checked some of the people’s availability.  
There were some committee meetings still happening at 
Eskom but there was no place for a board meeting at that 
point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay but you say, Dr Ngubane was the 
person that approached you first and asked you to convene 
a meeting of the board? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, he did.  He called me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  So at that stage, he was talking 
about convening a meeting rather than talking about a 
10 
Round-robin arrangement? 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct.  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  But later on, an email from 
Mr Singh’s office came which said:  Let us go the Round-
robin route. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said – I think you said you asked 
somebody whether Dr Ngubane knew about this latest idea 
of the Round-robin as opposed to a physical meeting.  Is 
that right? 
20 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And who did you speak to, the author of 
the email that was suggesting a Round-robin. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can I assist you? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I did.  And I also subsequently spoke 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 63 of 144 
 
to Dr Ngubane and asked him and he was fine.  You will 
see – that is why the email says at the request of the 
chairman.  I sent it out in Round-robin. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you Chair.  Ms Daniels, 
please check on page 492 of Eskom Bundle 18, please.  
There is an email there.  You can identify it to the 
Chairperson and say whether this could be the email that 
you are talking about.  Page 492 Chairperson. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is the email that I am talking 
10 
about Mr Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes I see it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes., 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
It 
is 
the 
email... 
 
Tuesday, 
8 December 2015 at 16:41.  It is addressed to you 
Ms Daniels, Mr Anoj Singh, Mr Matshela Koko.  Board 
Round-robin request, Optimum Coal Mine (Pty) Ltd.  And it 
says: 
20 
“Hello, Suzanne.  Can you please assist with a 
Round-robin to the board?” 
 
Are you saying that is the email of the request 
for the matter to be decided by way of a Round-robin? 
MS DANIELS:   That...  Yes, that is the request.   
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 64 of 144 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But the draft that was prepared – I 
mean, there is an attachment to this email.  The draft itself 
which comes before this email already bore the word 
Round-robin submission to the board if you go to page 481.   
 
And I think all the drafts before them, even page 
475.  Page 475 even better because it has the track 
changes which I think were made by officials of Trillian.  It 
is attached to the email of Mr Mohammed Bobat and 
Faheema Badat on page 474.  They already had Round-
robin submission to the board.   
10 
MS DANIELS:   ...Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the same date Mr Seleka?  Is that 
the 8 t h? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is the 8 t h of December 
Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That email...  Yes, Chair the email 
trails, they start way back.  They are on the 8 t h.  They are 
certainly before 16:41.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  So it may be that you may not 
20 
have been correct including that the idea of Round-robin 
came from Ms Badat(?) [00:24:34] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [Indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS DANIELS:   I might have got the time sequence wrong 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 65 of 144 
 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS DANIELS:   But at this time, Mr Chairman the – so the 
availability of the board members was the issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  I think ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   So in this period, we would not have had 
been able to have a meeting but you are correct in saying 
it could have been pushed out by a week or two. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or even a month if you ended up 
...[intervenes]  
10 
MS DANIELS:  But as of this ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   If you ended up waiting for end of 
March.  Even in January, you could ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct.  I mean, it was 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   It was not ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   It was not... 
CHAIRPERSON:   There are no ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   Alerts(?) ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...that suggests that it was urgent that 
20 
the decision be taken by the 10 t h or somewhere around 
there by the board. 
MS DANIELS:   Not inside of Eskom, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  Okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair. 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 66 of 144 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   We might have taken too long on this 
issue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have in mind my own estimation that 
we should be able to finished about five, half-past five, six.  
You might say maybe not but just try and move.  Of course, 
if there is still something of substance about the issue or 
urgency. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then we can.  But I think we can move. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She has made the concession. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Indeed Chair.  I mean, the 
suspensive conditions in the pre-purchase agreement and 
the guarantee ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...the allegation of urgency. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Daniels ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think let us take a short adjournment.  
20 
It is four o’clock.  Ten minutes’ adjournment and then when 
we come back, we try and see if we can ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...go or another hour, hour and a half or 
two.  But I think we can try and cover as much as possible. 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 67 of 144 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I will try less than two hours Chair.  
Let us see what happens. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We will adjourn for ten minutes.  We 
adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Thank you, Chair.  Ms Daniels, are you 
10 
with us? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I am. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Okay.  The same bundle, page 487, 
Eskom bundle 18, page 498.  Just a follow up on the email 
you were referring to of Ms Bana. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
MR SELEKA SC:  It is an email from you, Tuesday 8 
December 2015, 16.44, that is after Ms Bana’s email of 
16.41 and there you are asking: 
“Has the Chairman been notified or do I have to 
20 
request him to allow?” 
I think that is talking about a round robin, the email still 
appears below your …[intervenes] 
MS DANIELS:   Yes.  Yes, that is correct. 
MR SELEKA SC:   Could that be what you were trying to 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 68 of 144 
 
explain to the Chairperson? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
MR 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
That 
you 
enquired 
whether 
the 
Chairperson was aware that the meeting should proceed by 
way of a round robin? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Just to add, Chair, to the urgency of the 
situation, 
this 
alleged 
urgency, 
the 
pre-purchase 
agreement is subject to suspensive conditions.  Coal is not 
supplied pursuant to that agreement and in its affidavit…” 
10 
In its affidavit, I say it is, that is CDH’s affidavit.  Mr 
Moodley says that at that stage, this is December 2015, an 
even before that, I think from September 2015, OCM and 
Eskom had an interim arrangement in terms of which OCM 
was supplying coal to Eskom, Eskom’s Hendrina power 
station.  Did you know that? 
MS DANIELS:   That is mentioned in the agreement but I 
did not know the specifics. 
MR SELEKA SC:   Well, you see …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can I interpose, Mr Seleka, just on 
20 
something that goes back, I am sorry that I am taking you 
back, do not forget your question.  Ms Daniels, tell me, 
how did Eskom’s need or even purportedly urgent need for 
– or to secure coal, coal supply, how was that addressed in 
December by a resolution authorising that a pre-coal a pre-
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 69 of 144 
 
agreement of coal supply be concluded with people who did 
not own the coal that you are talking about at that time?  
The 
resolution 
itself 
says 
the 
agreement 
should 
be 
concluded with the proposed owners which obviously 
means conclude an agreement with not the owners but the 
proposed owners.  How did that address the urgent or the 
need for the security of coal supply? 
MS DANIELS:   The (indistinct – recording distorted) Mr 
Chairman, it did not in the immediate address the coal 
supply urgency. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes because also this was not even a 
situation where the idea was let us conclude an agreement 
with the proposed owners to say if and when you become 
owners you will supply us with coal on the following terms 
and conditions, this is not what was authorised, is that 
right? 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct, Mr Chairman, in fact I think 
the underlying issue is here that this was actually to assist 
the proposed owners to acquire Optimum. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes because if you were in – if you – if 
20 
Eskom wanted to secure coal supply, the idea was to 
conclude agreements with the owners of coal.  Do you 
agree? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I agree with you, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But at the time of the submission that 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 70 of 144 
 
you made to the board did you not appreciate this? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, you must remember that I 
was drafting it for Mr Singh and Mr Koko and at the time I 
must admit I did not really ask, you know, interrogate it to 
that degree, it has been on reflection and the subsequent 
questions that these issues have come to light. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it is difficult to think that – let me 
ask this question first.  Did Mr Koko say to you draft an 
agreement, draft a submission on the basis that we are 
asking 
the 
board 
to 
authorise 
that 
we 
conclude 
an 
10 
agreement with the proposed owners of OCM for a pre-
purchase.  Is that what he said to you? 
MS DANIELS:   That was instructions, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And did he advance to you his reason of 
Eskom seeking to secure coal supply as the reason why it 
was urgent that the board provides authorisation? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct, urgency was in his 
mind and also the big security of supply about Hendrina. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  One of the things that I have said 
to a few members of the board, maybe two, maybe three 
20 
who have testified, is it is difficult for me to understand 
how they could not have seen that the resolution that was 
being asked for, from them, was a resolution that they 
authorise 
the 
three 
Eskom 
officials 
to 
conclude 
a 
prepayment agreement with the proposed owners with 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 71 of 144 
 
Tegeta, so to speak and not with Glencore.  I have said 
that it is difficult for me to understand that they all did not 
see that because those that have come here seem to – 
maybe one said she saw it or he saw it, I cannot 
remember, but I think Dr Ngubane said he did not see it, he 
was under the impression or he, as far as he was 
concerned, the board was authorising the conclusion of 
this pre-purchase agreement with Glencore and not with 
Tegeta.  Dr Ngubane is a medical doctor, he has been a 
politician, he was a minister, he was a Premier of a 
10 
province, he was an ambassador, I think he was or 
continues to be a businessman.  Then I had Professor – 
was it Professor Naidoo? 
MR SELEKA SC:  Pat Naidoo, yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, Prof Naidoo.  I do not know whether 
he was the one who said he did see it but nevertheless he 
still continued to think he was authorising a prepayment 
agreement with Glencore and I think Ms Klein may have 
said she did not remember whether she saw it or not but 
she 
also 
still 
thought 
that 
she 
was 
authorising 
a 
20 
prepayment agreement with Glencore.  Now you are saying 
you did not pick up that point, is that right?  You saw that it 
was – you say you were instructed to draft a submission 
that would ask the board to authorise the conclusion of an 
agreement for prepayment with the proposed owners but 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 72 of 144 
 
you say it did not click to you that hang on, but why must 
we do that?  Is that what you are saying? 
MS DANIELS:   No, that is not what I am saying, I am 
saying that when you talk about the urgency. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so – okay, so what is your position 
in terms of did you notice that the – you were drafting a 
submission that was saying the board should give a 
resolution that authorises the conclusion of an agreement 
with the proposed owners as opposed to the [indistinct] 
12.30 owners at the time? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say you did – you knew you were 
doing that? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that was the intention because you 
will see that the underlying agreement refers to Tegeta. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  I am sorry, you say the underlying 
what? 
MR SELEKA SC:  Agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat. 
MS DANIELS:   Agreement. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat the part that relates to what 
is underlying something? 
MS DANIELS:   The coal supply agreement that we 
prepared, it refers to Tegeta, the sources. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There is a part that I could not hear 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 73 of 144 
 
because I think there was a technical problem.  Would you 
like to start that sentence again please? 
MS DANIELS:   I said that when you look at the underlying 
agreement that we were asked to prepare, the coal supply 
(indistinct – recording distorted) resources. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think the technology does not want me 
to hear the whole sentence. 
MR SELEKA SC:    She says …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think I understand you to be saying 
the submission and the resolution contemplated that the 
10 
agreement would be concluded with Tegeta but I may be 
missing something else and I do not know whether it is 
something to say if you look at the submission or if you 
look at the resolution there is something that makes it 
clear that it is Tegeta that was contemplated.  Is that what 
you are saying? 
MS DANIELS:   In the coal supply agreement that I was 
asked to draft, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, ja.  No, no, that is fine.  
Obviously the agreement would have to reflect who all the 
20 
parties to the agreement were and it had to reflect Tegeta 
as one of the parties because Tegeta was the proposed 
owner of OCM. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  But if you were aware that you were 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 74 of 144 
 
drafting a submission that would ask the board to authorise 
the conclusion of a prepayment agreement with the owners 
of OCM and not – or the proposed owners, that is Tegeta, 
and not Glencore, why did you not ask the question why 
are we – why do we seek to conclude prepayment 
agreement with people who do not own OCM when there 
are people who own the OCM now?  Why did you not ask 
Mr Koko that? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, at the time there was a due 
diligence exercise underway so it really – it really did not 
10 
strike me as odd and I did not think that, you know, it was 
my place to second-guess the executives at that stage, I 
took it at face value. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No but were you not the legal adviser as 
well as the company secretary at the time? 
MS DANIELS:   No, I was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which one were you not, or both? 
MS DANIELS:   I was not the legal adviser, I was the 
company secretary.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but is it not the job of the company 
20 
secretary – does the job not of a company secretary 
include giving legal advice to the board?  I thought so. 
MS DANIELS:   Ja, none of the board members actually 
asked for advice at that time …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but they might not ask …[intervenes] 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 75 of 144 
 
MS DANIELS:   I focused …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But they might not ask because they do 
not know but you, as a legally qualified person, would see 
and then you can alert them to a potential legal problem, is 
it not?  And if somebody does not know, if …[intervenes] 
MS DANIELS:   That is – ja.  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If, as a judge, a scientist gives me a 
certain document that talks about some science, I might 
not pick up any danger but another scientist who looks at 
the document that might have been given to me might pick 
10 
up something and say hang on, do not sign this, you 
realise that these are the implications?  So you too, as a 
company 
secretary, 
legally 
qualified 
– 
and 
my 
understanding is that a company secretary does advise on 
legal compliance and so on, so it would have been your 
job, would it not have been, to advise the board even if 
they did not ask for advice to say there is a problem here 
or at least please appreciate that this request, this 
submission requires you to authorise a, b, c, d in 
circumstances where ordinarily this should not be the case.  
20 
It seeks you to authorise that the pre-purchase agreement 
be concluded with none owners of OCM when they are 
current owners of OCM and you would need to say this is 
problematic, this is strange.  Or if you thought there is no 
problem, advise them, having alerted them to this unusual 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 76 of 144 
 
feature and advise them to say notwithstanding this, there 
is no problem because of a, b, c, d. 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, at the time I must admit I did 
not do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you see …[intervenes] 
MS DANIELS:   I took it at - you know, I took at face value 
because it was the Chief Financial Officer and Mr Koko 
involved and I did not do that at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see, it is difficult for me to accept 
that.  You know, as I see it, this is like a situation where 
10 
you want to buy a car and you know that this car belongs 
to me but you go and conclude an agreement with Mr 
Seleka, you buy the car from Mr Seleka who does not own 
this car and you know I am the owner.  How do you not 
pick that up? 
MS DANIELS:   You see, when the documents came back 
from Mr Koko and Mr Singh they were already signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They were already? 
MS DANIELS:   Signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Signed? 
20 
MS DANIELS:   By the executives, yes.  Signed off.  So 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, but did you not draft the 
submission yourself? 
MS DANIELS:   Not all of it because they made some 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 77 of 144 
 
changes as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but also, if they made changes and 
if this was one of the changes, all the more reason why 
you would need to say to them what you have now put in 
here is problematic, what is your reasoning, why did you 
put this in?   Because I am not sure …[intervenes] 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, at the time …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am not sure that saying that it came 
from them already signed or they made amendments, 
changes, anything, because to me it seems that the 
10 
moment you knew that this document was asking the board 
to authorise the three officials of Eskom to buy from Mr 
Seleka a car that belongs to me and you know it belongs to 
me, that should be problematic.  Can you see that? 
MS DANIELS:   I can see that but at the same token, I 
would 
not 
want 
to 
be 
second-guessing 
these 
senior 
executives. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, it is just a …[intervenes] 
MS DANIELS:   It is for them to put the stuff before the 
board and the board to also interrogate the documentation. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, I do not think, Ms Daniels, it is 
about second-guessing.  None of these officials were 
lawyers, is it not? 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct but they are also senior 
executives in the company. 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 78 of 144 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are not suggesting that you did not 
want to give them correct advice just because they were 
senior, correct legal advice because they were senior? 
MS DANIELS:   No, that is not what I am saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is why I am saying to you if it 
would have been correct legal advice to say to them legally 
you cannot buy coal – you cannot conclude an agreement 
for buying coal from somebody who is proposed to be the 
owner and therefore currently has no right to that coal.  If 
that was correct advice it would not be wrong for you to 
10 
raise that with them, would it? 
MS DANIELS:   Chair, I agree with you there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You accept, h’m.  Is there something you 
wanted to add earlier on and I interrupted you? 
MS DANIELS:   I am just checking the documentation just 
to make doubly sure.  I think we covered it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you see, you have – well, maybe the 
three executives will say well, we knew that we were 
asking the board to authorise that we conclude a pre-
purchase agreement with non-owners, with people who 
20 
were not owners of the coal but here are our reasons which 
make this thing that appears to be so unusual, justifiable, 
which make it justifiable, we will see, but it is strange that 
about 12 or so board members, some of whom I think are 
quite highly qualified and they say they either did not see 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 79 of 144 
 
this in the resolution or if they saw it they did not think it 
meant anything, as far as they were concerned they were 
authorising a conclusion of an agreement with Glencore 
and this company secretary, who is legally qualified, says 
she saw it but she did not think it was her place to give 
legal advice to the officials.  You must just tell me if I am 
summing up what you say incorrectly. 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chair, in the documents that I have if 
you look at the draft that I sent, I think – let me just see, it 
is page – Eskom 18, 509. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, 509. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes.  There is an email to Mr Koko and the 
document attached is version one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   And in there – I think in – on page 512 
under the key assumptions, I do – we – this is the draft 
that I prepared. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   You will see that I put there the transaction 
between Optimum Coal Mine and Oakbay Investments 
20 
being formally approved by the regulatory authorities. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, just tell me which clause you 
are reading from? 
MS DANIELS:   It is number 3.2.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   “The submission and decision required  
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 80 of 144 
 
set out herein is based on the following key 
assumptions. 
3.2.2 
The transaction between Optimum Coal Mine 
(Pty) 
Ltd 
and 
Oakbay 
Investments/Tegeta 
Resources is formally approved by the regulatory 
authorities.” 
What does that mean in the context of the issue we are 
dealing with? 
MS DANIELS:   Okay, what I am saying is that this – these 
things were removed by the executives in the final 
10 
submission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but before they were removed tell 
me what their presence would have meant in the context of 
the question we are dealing with? 
MS DANIELS:   In the context of the question, it would 
have 
given 
the 
board 
a 
fuller 
appreciation 
of 
what 
transaction was about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The transaction that you were talking 
about there, namely clause 3.1.2, what transaction are you 
talking about? 
20 
MS DANIELS:  Was that Oakbay/Tegeta was buying 
Optimum at the time.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but still that did not change the fact 
that at the time of the – that did not change the fact that 
the board was being asked to authorise the conclusion of 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 81 of 144 
 
this agreement at the time when Tegeta would not be the 
owners of OCM. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS DANIELS:   But you will also remember at the IFC 
discussion it was pointed out that the acquisition would 
improve the BEE status, so there was some appreciation 
that this was in transition and that there was going to be a 
new ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but again even that still doesn’t 
10 
answer the question why conclude such an agreement with 
a non-owner at the time, when there is a non-owner that is 
known to you as Eskom and as officials. 
MS DANIELS:   I think that is a question that you would 
have to ask the Executives and the Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MS DANIELS:   I think that is a question you would have to 
ask the executives and the Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you too, because you were the 
legal advisor, you were the Company Secretary, as far as I 
20 
am concerned you were supposed to alert them that you 
cannot conclude an agreement with a non-owner of the 
coal when there is an owner, isn’t it?   You accept that? 
MS DANIELS:   I accept that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Seleka? 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 82 of 144 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.   Ms ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, you might even have 
forgotten the question that you were on when I interrupted 
you but if you made a note – I hope you made a note and 
you remember. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I did but she answered it during – ja 
her first interaction with you Chair, when she said the 
motivation was to help to get the purchase of this 
…[indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  ...so because that can only be the 
explanation for this astounding decision, Ms Daniels. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And Chair, you see, Ms Daniels the 
inclusion of this proposed owner, one can trace it back, the 
emails, well maybe you don’t trace it back because by that 
time the submission was made but you could see when one 
of the Board members sent you questions, and I want to 
refer you to the page so we can run quickly, through what I 
want to – what I want you to point out to the Chairperson if 
20 
you could please be on page 559.  So, one of the Board 
members sends you questions after you’ve sent the 
submission to them, that the Board should make a round 
robin decision on the 9 t h of March and that’s Ms Mariam 
Cassim on page 559. 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 83 of 144 
 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The questions are there on the 8 t h of 
December 2015 you’ve just sent them your request which 
we see on – at the bottom of page 560 you sent it at 
5h52pm on 8 December 2015, she responds at 9h28pm on 
the same date and that email goes to – she asks 
questions, you received the email and then you forward it 
to Mr Anoj Singh.  Mr Anoj Singh takes that email on the 9 
December, the next day and he forwards it to Mr Eric 
Wood.  Mr Eric Wood takes that email on the 9 t h of March 
10 
and he forwards it to Mr Mohamed Bobat, you see those 
emails on page 559? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I see them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And what does Mr Mohamed Bobat do 
with this is apparent on page 562.  So, the email now 
comes from him, also 9 March 2015, he’s replying to Mr 
Eric Wood and the subject line is, 
“Urgent request to approve the pre-purchase of coal 
from Optimum”. 
 
And now you see that there is a font in red colour 
20 
which are inserted against the questions on page 562. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I see that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You there? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I’m there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Was it apparent to you that, the 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 84 of 144 
 
answers to the questions were coming from outside and not 
from…[intervenes]. 
MS DANIELS:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And not from Mr Anoj Singh himself? 
MS DANIELS:   No, it was not, the emails came from Mr 
Anoj Singh to me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, to you they came from Mr Anoj 
Singh? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There – if you go to page 565, at the 
10 
bottom of page 565 which goes over to page 566, there is, 
again this email from Mr Mohamed Bobat, 9 December 
2015 at 8h04am to Mr Eric Wood and on the next page you 
see further additions to the answers that are being 
provided.  Now you see both the additions in red and now 
there are those in blue, page 566. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Are you there? 
MS DANIELS:   I’m there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And the answer, this time around, the 
20 
answer to the first question it incorporates the concept, 
potential buyer.  So, the last – the answer to paragraph 
one, the last part, which is in blue, it says, 
“Consequently, Eskom is thus in no worse financial 
position 
than 
before 
the 
transaction 
but 
has 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 85 of 144 
 
mitigated the security of supply risk and has funded 
its working capital financing cost via the discounts 
being offered by the, and you see that word, 
potential buyer”. 
You see that? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And these questions answered in this 
way by, what potentially looks to be Mr Mohamed Bobat, 
were ultimately forwarded to Ms Cassim.  You remember 
you would have taken those answers and forwarded the 
10 
email to her. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let’s see because…[intervenes]. 
MS DANIELS:   But my answers came from Mr Singh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, on page, let’s see, on page 656 
where I was, on the bottom of the page is that email of Mr 
Mohamed Bobat at 9 December 2015 at 8h04 about 
that…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page is that again? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 565, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, at the bottom of that page.  So, it 
is Mr Mohamed Bobat replying to Mr Eric Wood, they have 
kept the same email of Ms Mariam, they’re simply adding 
answers to her questions. Mr Eric Wood then forwards that 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 86 of 144 
 
email to Mr Anoj Singh, 9 December 2015 at 8h11, so he 
received it at 8h04, he forwards it 8h11 to Mr Anoj Singh so 
he says, 
“Please 
see 
responses 
below, 
as 
discussed, 
regards Eric”. 
 
The 
email 
above, 
is 
then 
Mr 
Anoj 
Singh, 
Chairperson at 8h55 on the 9 t h of December he seems to 
reply to his PA, Polly Ndzotyana, that was Mr Singh’s PA, 
Mr Daniels? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Seleka, can you just give me the page 
10 
reference, I seem to…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m losing him or he’s losing me as well 
now. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 565. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am at 565 and I can see Mohamed 
Bobat but I see only the subject, I don’t see the actual 
content of the email. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair, it starts on page – well it 
goes over to 566. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well at 566 I see an email from Mariam 
20 
Cassim. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To Ms Daniels.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but what you see there Chair, it’s 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 87 of 144 
 
an edited email of Ms Mariam Cassim because her original 
email only has questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Repeat that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Her original email, Ms Daniels, only 
has her questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Questions? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Question 1, 2, 3 and 4. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   What you are seeing there now, the 
fonts which are in red and blue are the answers to those 
questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And who is giving the answers? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, then you see – if you go back to 
565, when Mr Eric Wood forwards the email to Mr Anoj 
Singh, he says, 
 
 
“Please see responses below as discussed”. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, the email at the bottom of 565 
comes from Mr Mohamed Bobat? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And this is on the morning of the day on 
which Mr Nhlanhla Nene was fired, 9 December 2015? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I believe so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, well on this day, Mr Mohamed 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 88 of 144 
 
Bobat, who the following day, I think on the 10 t h or 11 t h met 
with Mr Des van Rooyen and they discussed that Mr Bobat 
would be – his advice, our Chief of Staff, I forget who was 
Chief of Staff and who was advisor, but on the morning of 
the 9 t h of December he is engaged in some discussions 
involving what is happening or about to happen in Eskom 
in relation to Tegeta and coal and so on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright but – so are you saying 
that Mr Eric Wood was he sending to Mr Bobat the 
10 
document on page 566? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair so that Chairperson can 
follow, let’s start where I started, page 559. 
CHAIRPERSON:  559?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   559. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Those are the original email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, this is an email starting with the one 
on the top or the one at the bottom? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We should start with the one in the 
20 
middle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the one from Mr Singh, Anoj 
Singh? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The one from Ms Mariam Cassim. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is addressed to Ms Daniels. 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 89 of 144 
 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Correct, 
Chair 
and 
Mr 
Singh…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And who was Mariam Cassim? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She was one of the Board members. 
CHAIRPERSON:   One of? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   One of the Board members. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, of Eskom? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So they would have received the email 
10 
from Ms Daniels on page 560. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh yes, that is – they would have – all 
the Board members would have received the email from Ms 
Daniels in closing the submission. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To the Board about this transaction. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then she sends an email to Ms 
Daniels/Mr Anoj Singh, where she raises certain questions 
about the content or the subject matter of the submission. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja she asks four questions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And you will see there, there are no 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 90 of 144 
 
red fonts or blue…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That email Chair, is forwarded, if you 
go up, is forwarded to Mr Eric Wood by Mr Anoj Sing on the 
9 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, it’s forwarded to Mr Eric Wood by Mr 
Anoj Singh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who has received it from Ms Mariam 
Cassim. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, who also received it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And sent from her Iphone, then you go 
up, you see Mr Eric Wood then forwards it on to Mr 
Mohamed Bobat. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what page do we go to, to find that? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It’s above, the one above Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes, okay.  So, he sends it to Mr 
Mohamed Bobat. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That’s correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And…[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   At 7h13. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay 7h13 on the 9 t h of December. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   On the 9 t h of December. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, right. 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 91 of 144 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, that’s outgoing, that’s outgoing, 
now, on the page where we were, you see the replies, the 
responses. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s 565. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That’s 565. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then Mohamed Bobat ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Replies. 
CHAIRPERSON:    ...replies to Mr Eric Wood. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   At 8h04.   
CHAIRPERSON:   At 8h04. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the subject it still the same “urgent 
request to approve the pre-purchase of coal from Optimum 
Coal Pty Limited. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes and they are keeping this email of 
Ms Mariam Cassim now they had aired that responses to 
her questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...on the face of it, it is Mr Bobat who is 
20 
providing answers. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He is providing answers to questions 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 92 of 144 
 
that are – were asked by a member of the Eskom Board to 
officials of Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And not to him. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Not to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but what happened was that the 
Board members questions were sent to Ms Daniels and Mr 
Singh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Mr Singh passed his questions to Mr 
10 
Eric Wood, Mr Eric Wood passed them to Mr Bobat, Mr 
Bobat provided the answers ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   The answers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...in red at page 566. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then sent these – the document at 
page 566 together which contains answers in red to the 
questions of the Board member to Eric Wood. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, ja, he requested ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Who I assume will send it to Mr Anoj 
20 
Singh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which is exactly what he is saying 
there in his email, he says: 
“Please see responses below as discussed.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, there he says on the 9 t h of 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 93 of 144 
 
December. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Eleven minutes past eight in the 
morning: 
“Hi Anoj, 
Please see responses below as asked.” 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Those are the responses provided by Mr 
Mohamed Bobat. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, right so well when I heard the 
evidence relating to Mr Bobat and his being appointed as 
either an advisor or Chief of Staff to Mr Des van Rooyen on 
the 10 t h or 11 t h in the manner in which that appointments 
seems to have been made, one of the questions I asked 
was whether he was not employed or could he be given an 
offer just like that and he is said to accept it, he doesn’t 
even want to go and think about it, he accepted on the spot 
and yet Mr van Rooyen was I think saying he didn’t know 
him, or he may have seen him once in six years or 
20 
something, or maybe that was not Mr Bobat, maybe it was 
the other person. 
 
Okay, alright, well I am trying to – so now I know 
that on the 9 t h he was busy at Regiments with matters 
relating to Eskom. 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 94 of 144 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay now I understand, now I follow, yes 
thank you Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then it seems they are not saying their 
sense to his PA, he says to his PA on that same page the 
PA ultimately Chair, the emails are not in sequence, 
Chairperson will have to go to page 554, she ultimately 
forwards it to Ms Suzanne Daniels. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 554? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   554. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   This is the email in the middle is from 
Pauli Ntochane ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   On behalf of. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On behalf of Anoj Singh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   For some reason she emphasis the “on 
behalf of” Anoj Singh, she sends it at nine minutes past 
nine, December 9 2015 to Ms Daniels and she says 
responses to Board Queries.  She says: 
“Hi Suzanne,  
20 
Responses 
to 
the 
questions 
raised 
by 
board 
members is as follows on the resolution.” 
I take it that what then she puts in under one, two, three, 
four is exactly what came from Mr Bobat. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   As is. 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 95 of 144 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But she has filed and I guess that is 
something that Ms Cassim had not asked. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is the question ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh she raised, h’m ... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It says has – let’s see. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, “has this proposal been approved or 
recommended by the Board IFC”. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the answer is a special Board IFC 
was held this morning to consider this matter and we were 
10 
comfortable to recommend the approval to the Board.   So 
now this is being sent to Ms Daniels as answers that come 
from Mr Singh? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In fact ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:     Can I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   This part, this question 5 was it among 
the questions from Ms Cassim, I’m talking about four 
questions. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that question wasn’t there, but it 
would have been a request made by Ms Veroshni Naidoo. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Daniels will recall, she was here 
Chairperson and she said she asked kindly ensure that IFC 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 96 of 144 
 
approves the submission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, well obviously the question that 
arises is why Mr Singh was not able to respond to these 
questions raised by the Board Member on his own being 
the Chief Financial Officer of Eskom, and why he needed 
outside assistance. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And this is about the submission so this 
is before the guarantee, it is the submission, I know in his 
10 
affidavit he gives an answer but the answer relates to the 
guarantee, why he went out again to seek advice from Eric 
Wood and he says: 
“I further wish to point out that at the time I thought 
it prudent – but this is the guarantee – I thought it 
prudent to seek advice from Wood as to the options 
presented by ABSA Bank regarding the guarantee 
as he could properly advise us with regard to his 
past banking experience.” 
I am not sure whether he deals with this to give the 
20 
reasons for seeking this advice but I am sure he will 
explain when he is here. 
 
And Ms Venete Klein had a background in banking 
as well, I wonder why they didn’t ask for her advice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright. 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 97 of 144 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So that email Chair if the Chairperson 
is still on page 554 at the top of that page is then Ms 
Suzanne Daniels, after having received the email from Ms 
Dasinski she forwards it to Ms Merriam Cassim. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is at page 556? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   554. 
MS DANIELS:  554. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   554 Chair.  So then Ms Daniels is able 
to respond ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, and she also says “see below, best 
regards”. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At this stage Ms Daniels did you not 
know the journey that this email had travelled? 
MS DANIELS:   No Mr Chairman I did not know that the 
journey, the extensive journey that it had taken.   My first 
exposure to that was in 2018 when I received queries from 
the Mail & Guardian. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I mean question 2 was “please confirm 
that the coal will be purchased at a 5% discount to the 
20 
price in the current agreement”, why should Mr Anoj Singh 
not know the answer to that question, why should he go 
back 
to 
Mr 
Eric 
Wood 
and 
the 
Tegeta 
people 
and 
Regiments, because that is information that ought to have 
been known to him at the time of – before there was the 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 98 of 144 
 
decision to make a submission to the Board, isn’t it?   Isn’t 
it Ms Daniels, is that not some information that he should 
have known actually all of them should have known? 
MS DANIELS:   He should have known all of that, you now 
the financial construct in the submission document came 
from him, or I assumed at the time that it came from him.   
It is clear the he had some outside help. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.   Okay, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.   Ms Cassim 
ultimately responds Chairperson and says she is happy 
10 
with the responses. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I say Ms Cassim then approved saying 
she is happy with the responses, her email is attached to 
her affidavit Chair which is in a separate bundle. 
 
Chair we could go to those questions, but in the 
interest of time let’s see when those who ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well the – I don’t want you to abandon 
important issues, so if it is important to do justice you can 
deal with them. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, I think it may be more appropriate 
to ask Mr Singh about the questions, his questions, his 
answers I beg our pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well that is fine, but it may be that on 
some we can get information from Ms Daniels, because she 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 99 of 144 
 
was the Company Secretary and she had a duty to raise 
questions if she was being instructed to do things that she 
did not understand, or that were questionable. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So when I say let’s try and cover as 
much as possible I don’t mean that we deal with important 
matters in a superficial way. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.   Well Ms Daniels – I think what I 
could ask you in regard to these questions, perhaps is the 
one – number 4 which is on page 555.  The question they 
10 
asked is:   
“Is Optimum the only mine that can supply coal 
to Hendrina?  Have all other supply options 
been investigated?” 
 
Would you have known the answer to that 
question? 
MS DANIELS:   No...  I mean, the first part is that Optimum 
is the only mine because it is right next to Hendrina Power 
Station and it was one of the reasons why Hendrina was 
built there.  That is from the ministry.   
20 
 
Have all other supply options been investigated?  
At the time, I would not have known that without having to 
speak to the operational people. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Well, this is might take us back to 
that question of the owner and proposed owner because at 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 100 of 144 
 
the time the owners were OCM/Glencore.   
And the question is whether as a matter of fact...  
Well, whether the board was told.  Now that is a matter of 
act.  OCM was still supplying coal to Eskom at this time.   
So this question which is seeking to enquire from 
you for the executives whether OCM is the only mine that 
can supply to Hendrina.   
Should it not have been answered by – and that 
would have defeated the submission – if it was answered 
by – the correct facts:  Yes, OCM is in fact still supplying 
10 
to Hendrina.  Because that was what was happening at the 
time.  CDH knows that.   
CHAIRPERSON:   And it was supplying at one-fifty? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It was supplying at one-fifty per ton. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And it had said:  We are coming out of 
business rescue.  Glencore will fund. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And they will carry on with the 
agreement as it was.  So that question needed a correct 
20 
answer.  What is your comment on that? 
MS DANIELS:   I am not sure I understand the question 
fully.  Are you saying that I should have answered that? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  No, I am not saying you should 
have answered that.  I am asking, again, whether – if you 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 101 of 144 
 
were aware that OCM was in fact supplying coal?  OCM 
had undertaken to supply coal at the price of the existing 
CSA.   
MS DANIELS:   That was part of the meeting that I attend 
on the 24 t h of November.  You will recall from my earlier 
testimony. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   It was mentioned in the submission. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   So there is a line in the submission about 
10 
that the owners would continue with their supply.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But that question was, is Optimum the 
only mine that can supply coal to Hendrina. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The answer does not answer that 
question.  Instead, it talks about means of getting coal at a 
certain price.  It says there is no other means of getting 
coal at a price of R 150,00 per ton.  That is not what was 
asked.  The question was:  Is Optimum the only mine that 
can supply coal to Hendrina?  What was the correct answer 
20 
to that question at the time, to your knowledge? 
MS DANIELS:   To my knowledge it would have been 
Optimum as the only mine that can supply Hendrina. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  And then the next question was:  
have all other supply options been investigated?  To you 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 102 of 144 
 
knowledge, what would have been the correct answer? 
MS DANIELS:   If I said yes, they would have to explain 
what they were and also highlighting additional costs in 
terms of logistics to get the coal to Hendrina. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you look at that answer.  There is 
no other means of getting coal at a price of R150 per ton.  
To the extent that OCM was supplying coal at that price, 
that answer was misleading.  Would you not agree? 
MS DANIELS:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Because you did not need to – Eskom 
10 
did not need to have a pre-purchase agreement with Tegeta 
in order to have coal at R150 per ton from OCM.  It did not 
need that transaction. 
MS DANIELS:   It did not need that transaction Mr Chair.  
That you are correct. So it is sort of an open-ended 
answer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   It answers the question on the face of it 
but it is more what it does not say. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, no it does not answer the question 
20 
on the face of it but it seems to serve a certain purpose 
because the question did not talk about the means.  It 
simply asked:  Is Optimum the only mine that can supply 
coal to Hendrina?  Two:  Have all other supply options 
been investigated?   
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 103 of 144 
 
 
And they say there is no other means of getting 
coal at a price of R 150,00 but the fact of the matter is, 
without this transaction with Tegeta, they could and were 
getting coal from Optimum for R 150,00 per ton. 
 
So the transaction was not necessary for Eskom 
to get coal ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...from Optimum from R 150,00 per ton. 
MS DANIELS:   No, because that agreement was in place. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
So 
this 
was 
misleading. 
 
It 
...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It sought to convince board members.  It 
sought to say to them:  You know, we – this transaction is 
going to give us coal at a very good price that we do not 
have.  But the fact of the matter is, that was a price that 
they were having with OCM at the time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Indeed. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Without any agreement with Tegeta. 
MS DANIELS:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You accept that? 
MS DANIELS:   I accept that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And now...  You saw these answers 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 104 of 144 
 
including this one.  If you apply your mind to these 
answers before you sent them off to the board member, 
Ms Cassim.  Or they were sent by Mr Anoj Singh. 
MS DANIELS:   They were sent by Mr Anoj Singh and I 
forwarded them to Ms Cassim.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   Quite quick ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you apply your mind to them? 
MS DANIELS:   Quite quickly.  I did apply my mind to them 
because these came from the Chief Financial Officer.  So I 
10 
was not going to – like I said, I was not going to second 
guess what he had put down there.  I had interpreted these 
questions that you asked more of a funding nature.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  Alright.  Let us see, point – 
question 4 has – it has an element of confusion in it and it 
seems to require an explanation from the board in clear 
terms. 
 
You...  I mean, it should – a question asked in 
that manner:  Is Optimum the only mine that can supply 
20 
coal to Hendrina?   
 
The board member is either under the impression 
that Optimum is unable to supply, so we have to help it 
with a cash injection so that it can supply.   
 
You see that?  Because there is a prepayment 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 105 of 144 
 
request if you look at question 1. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But that confusion is not clear.  Look 
at question 1 Ms Daniels.  It reads: 
“Please explain the decrease in inventory 
days?” 
 
That is on page 554.  The submission reads that: 
“The coal purchase will be prepaid in terms...” 
 
So I am struggling to understand how this would 
translate into working capital saving.  And then there is a 
10 
long answer there but it goes on to say: 
“This amount, which is the R 1.7 billion, can 
be 
utilised 
to 
make 
the 
prepayment 
by 
instituting the pre-purchase agreement which 
will count as part of working capital. 
It will put inventory back to 54-days. 
The OCM coal is pledged to Eskom as security 
and it forms part of inventory. 
Under inventory perspective, the transaction 
remains unchanged. 
20 
Consequently, Eskom is thus in no ways in a 
financial position than before the transaction 
but has mitigated the security of supply risk 
and has funded it working capital financing 
costs via the discounts being offered by the 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 106 of 144 
 
potential buyer.” 
 
There we have that potential buyer.  It is – do 
you follow that answer?  To me it is convoluted.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  You were reading from what 
page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   554 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   554. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The answer to question 1.   
MS DANIELS:   Mr Seleka, these questions were asked of 
the responsible officials. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   So you know, I would not go and nose pick 
it.  At this point, the board member asked the questions.  
The Chief Financial Officer provided the answers.  And I 
provide it to the board member.  She seemed to have 
understood them because she was comfortable with them.   
 
I am not sure, you know, how I needed to 
interrogate at that stage because the questions were asked 
of the people who submitted – who signed off the 
submission.   
20 
 
And this was a financial construct that Mr Singh 
had introduced.  And this was actually the first time that I 
had seen about inventory days and you know the acting of.  
So I left it to his expertise.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  Ja and the use of OCM and 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 107 of 144 
 
potential buyer, it is so confusing.  But Chair, I want to 
move on to the next point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you can do that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Ms Daniels, let us – like the 
emails we have seen in regard to the – what was that – the 
drafting of...?  You say the emails you are getting a 
drafting of the submissions or we saw the emails now 
regarding the answers to Ms Miriam’s questions, Ms Miriam 
Cassim. 
 
Now let us look at what happens in regard to the 
10 
underlining agreement which starts on page 724, the terms 
of which starts on page 724, Eskom Bundle 18. 
MS DANIELS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because that underlining agreement 
also has an evolution similar to what we see the pattern to 
be in regard to this transaction.   
MS DANIELS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Are you there? 
MS DANIELS:   I am getting there.  There is a lot of 
...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say 724? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   724 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There are two emails there.  One from 
Matshela, 2010 and to Ms Daniels.  And another one from 
Businessman to Matshela, 2010. 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 108 of 144 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So we have looked at these emails but 
just in order to contextualise what I would like Ms Daniels 
to show the Chairperson.  Are you there Ms Daniels? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I am. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So that is the beginning of the 
guarantee terms and the underlining agreement, ultimately.  
So the email ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The email comes for Businessman 
after twelve midnight on 10 December 2015 to Mr Matshela 
Koko, 2010.  It is a two-pager.  He forwards that to you at 
07:31, 10 December 2015.   
 
And on the next page, he would have used that 
two-pager to instruct Mr Moodley of CDH to assist with the 
drafting of the underlining agreement.  Do you see that? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  On page 7...  Let me see.  Page 
743. 
20 
MS DANIELS:   Yes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   743, it is a repeat of your email to 
Mr Moodley at the bottom of the page at 08:42. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I am there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So it is a repeat of your email 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 109 of 144 
 
which Mr Moodley receives and he forwards it to – I do not 
know whether it is mister or miss - Badia(?) Maasdorp. 
MS DANIELS:   It is a mister. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   A mister.  Also an attorney at CDH. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes.  
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Okay. 
 
And 
that 
is 
on 
the 
10 t h of December 2015 and he ultimately replies to you on 
the 10 t h of December 2015 at 14:24.  You see that email at 
the top of the page? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I do. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And the attachment is, Letter 
Agreement.  It says: 
“Suzanne, see attached the mock-up version.  
Should OCM not also be a party?” 
 
He is asking.   
“There are obligations on them e.g. issue the 
credit notes, et cetera and they are actually 
the supplier.” 
 
Now who did you understand is he referring to 
there as OCM, Tegeta or OCM under Glencore? 
20 
MS DANIELS:   OCM under Glencore in the process of 
being purchased by Tegeta. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  What he is asking there is 
because the underlining agreement only has Eskom and 
Tegeta as the parties to their agreement.  Is that right? 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 110 of 144 
 
MS DANIELS:   Yes.  At the time, yes, we changed the 
draft of this confrontation. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, then on page 744 you sent an 
email or the drafts to Mr Anoj Singh and Mr Matshela Koko 
at 14:47, still on the 10 t h of December 2015.  Letter 
Agreement is the attachment.  It says: 
“Anoj, Matshela herewith the execution copy of 
the letter agreement in respect of the above.” 
 
And you go on to say: 
“Anoj, as discussed, we have not included the 
10 
date for the fulfilment of CP’s.” 
 
Were the CP’s condition precedence? 
MS DANIELS:   Condition precedence, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
“The 
interest 
payable. 
 
We 
will 
need 
to 
confirm.” 
 
Now page 749 Chairperson.  What does Mr Singh 
do with what you have sent to him?  So on page 7...  Let 
us start on 748.  I beg your pardon. 
MS DANIELS:   740? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, 748. 
MS DANIELS:   Oh, eight.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   There is your email again to 
Mr Anoj Singh and Mr Koko to the bottom of the page which 
goes to Mr Anoj Singh.  What happens at the top of the 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 111 of 144 
 
page? 
 
You sent your email at 02:47 p.m. but at the top 
of the page is an email from Mr Anoj Singh’s PA.  Again, 
Ms 
Phule 
Nezotsiyana(?) 
at 
15:14 
on 
the 
10 t h of December 2015. 
 
It goes to Mr Eric Wood and the attachment 
again is: Letter Agreement, Tegeta, Eskom, Execution 
Copy, which is what you sent to them.   
“Good day sir, please find above attached.  
Warm regards.” 
10 
 
Did you know that this had happened? 
MS DANIELS:   No, I did not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And the attachment follows on the next 
pages until page 751.  Then turn to page 752.  There are 
two emails ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   I am there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You are there.  There are two emails 
there.  The bottom one is from Anoj Singh. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The 10 t h of December 2015.  I think it 
20 
is the same from his PA.  It says: 
“Good 
day 
sir. 
 
Please 
find 
the 
above 
attached.” 
 
Now it is sent to Eric Wood.  And what does 
Mr Eric Wood do with it?  Look at the top email. 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 112 of 144 
 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Eric Wood sent – he sends it to Salim 
Essa at Gmail ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Gmail.com.  10 December 2015 at 
15:15.  The attachment is the same:  Letter Agreement, 
Tegeta, Eskom, Execution Copy, Pre-purchase of Coal from 
Optimum Coal Mine (Pty) Ltd.  Did you know about this? 
MS DANIELS:   No, I did not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now we do not see or the investigators 
have not been able to find how the agreement comes back 
if at all it came back to Eskom but the last email we have 
10 
is on page 753 which is an email from you to Mr Anoj 
Singh, 
again 
attaching 
what 
you 
are 
saying 
is 
the 
execution copy.  This is at 16:14.   
 
And you say: 
“Hi, 
Anoj. 
 
Herewith 
the 
agreement 
as 
amended.” 
 
You see that? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I see that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now the amendments are not apparent 
from 
the 
documents 
but 
who 
would 
have 
made 
20 
amendments? 
MS DANIELS:   The amendments I made here was to 
...[indistinct] [break in transmission – speaker unclear]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   Which was the 31 s t of March 2016. 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 113 of 144 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, did you personally make this 
...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   On Clause 5.1. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, did you personally make 
amendments? 
MS DANIELS:   We – there were stuff that was not filled in.  
I mean...  Sorry, information that was not completed and 
the date was one of them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   So I time stamped it where you can see it 
10 
says 16:00. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   That would have been the one that I 
inserted the dates. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Are you saying you inserted the date 
for the fulfilment of the suspensive conditions? 
MS DANIELS:   Ja, as discussed with Mr Singh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that was going to be my next 
question.  So where did you get the date of 31 March 2016 
from which is Clause 5.1 of the document? 
20 
MS DANIELS:   Correct.  I got that from Mr Singh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you know that on the same day, 
10 December 2015, 
Tegeta/Oakbay 
was 
concluding 
an 
agreement with Glencore/OCH which had exactly the same 
expiry date, 31 March 2016 for the suspensive conditions 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 114 of 144 
 
in that agreement? 
MS DANIELS:   No, I did not know that at the time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You did not know that at the time? 
MS DANIELS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   You say you did not know at the time? 
MS DANIELS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can you hear me? 
MS DANIELS:   It came to light later in the Public 
Protector ’s reports and the media. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Just repeat that again. 
10 
MS DANIELS:   It came to light later in the Public 
Protector ’s report, the State Capture Report and in the 
media. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see.  So what did – I mean if you look 
at this, the document that relates to an underlining pre-
purchase agreement with Tegeta.  Why did it have to be 
sent to Mr Eric Wood and Mr Salim Essa? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, I cannot answer that.  You 
are going to have to ask Mr Singh.  I do not know. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  And we see that subsequently – 
20 
subsequent to this exchange...  Well, just before that.  Did 
you ask him why should this agreement be subjected to 
suspensive conditions in the first place?  Because the 
submission required the board to urgently make a decision 
in order to avert a risk of coal supply. 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 115 of 144 
 
MS DANIELS:   At the time I did not ask him Mr Chairman 
because even with the acquisition of Optimum Mine, there 
would be suspensive conditions as you would see here 
because there would be approvals from the regulatory 
authorities but at the time I did not ask him why the 
urgency in respect of the first decision. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, you know the submission is made 
to the board on the basis of urgency.  So the question is to 
what extent this pre-purchase of coal agreement, if you ask 
the board to urgently make the decision.  That is one.  
10 
Number two is, why suspend it for three months?  Did you 
ask that other one, the second question? 
MS DANIELS:   No, I did not.  I think you are going to have 
to ask Mr Singh as they were the delegated officials to 
negotiate and conclude this agreement. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Did you find out from him how he chose 
the date of 31 March 2016 and not any other date? 
MS DANIELS:   No, I did not. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Did it not surprise you as one of the 
persons involved in the drafting of the submission that 
20 
required a decision by round robin? 
MS DANIELS:   Not on the – it did not surprise me because 
the regulatory approvals usually took longer so 31 March 
was a conservative estimate. 
MR SELEKA SC:  But they are approvals in respect of 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 116 of 144 
 
what? 
MS DANIELS:   The MPRDA, the Section 11 approval, the 
transfer 
of 
the 
mining 
right 
and 
approval 
by 
the 
Competition authorities but, as we know now, with the 
benefit of hindsight, those two things came fairly quickly. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Ja, but even at that stage that would not 
have been an issue because of the way the agreement was 
drafted.  The agreement specifically said, the underlying 
agreement, that Tegeta was going to purchase coal from 
OCM and Tegeta will then on sell to Eskom.  So regulatory 
10 
issues did not stand in the way of the way in which the 
agreement was drafted. 
MS DANIELS:   No, but you asked me whether I was 
surprised by the date, so from that perspective I did not 
raise – it was not a red flag for me.  
MR SELEKA SC:  Ja, but is that an answer if you look at 
the terms of the agreement?  It says: 
“Eskom Holdings and Optimum Coal concluded a 
coal supply agreement in terms of which OCM 
supplies and delivers coal to Eskom.  OCM has 
20 
become 
the 
subject 
of 
business 
rescue 
proceedings.  Eskom has obtained a mandate from 
its board of directors to enable Tegeta to pre-
purchase coal from OCM for the supply and delivery 
of coal in accordance with Eskom’s approvals 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 117 of 144 
 
framework on substantially the terms and conditions 
set out in the existing coal supply agreement.  
Tegeta is in the process of acquiring all shares on 
OCM.” 
Which is a separate matter.  But OCM is there, Tegeta is 
going to pre-purchase coal from OCM and supply to Eskom.  
Why suspend this agreement?  Do you have a response to 
that? 
MS DANIELS:   I am just reading this again.  Okay.  
MR SELEKA SC:  Are you looking for the agreement? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   No, no, I am just reading the agreement 
just to familiarise myself, it has been a while.  Okay.  I still 
– well, it does mention the purchase of OCM by Tegeta so I 
think it was reasonable to expect that in there and it does 
say that clauses – that the clauses that you read would 
become effective immediately but they are still subjecto(?).  
It was a bit – ja, it is confusing. 
MR SELEKA SC:  It is confusing, indeed. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes.  But for me the date of 31 March was 
reasonable in terms of the regulatory approvals. 
20 
MR SELEKA SC:  Ja, but that belonged to the acquisition 
agreement, to the sale of shares agreement, it did not 
belong to the pre-purchase agreement, if it was any 
relevant. 
MS DANIELS:   No, I agree with you there but it is in here 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 118 of 144 
 
now so that is how I understood it. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Then go to page 773, Eskom bundle 18. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I am there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you 73, Mr Seleka? 
MR SELEKA SC:  773. 
CHAIRPERSON:   773? 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SELEKA SC:  So your email to Mr Singh of the 
amended agreement is again reflected there on the bottom.  
10 
Mr Anoj Singh takes your email and forwards it to Mr Eric 
Wood.  Do you see that he sent that …[intervenes] 
MS DANIELS:   I see that. 
MR SELEKA SC:  You see that? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I do. 
MR SELEKA SC:  At 4.26 p.m.  Mr Eric Wood responds in 
the early evening of the same date, 10 December 2015 at 
16.42 and he is asking: 
“Any luck with the guarantee draft?  Regards.” 
In response to Mr Anoj Singh.  What did Mr Eric Wood have 
20 
to do with the guarantee? 
MS DANIELS:   Nothing from my perspective, I only learnt 
from Ms Mathepu’s evidence before the Commission that 
he had actually spoken to ABSA about the terms of that – 
of the  guarantee. 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 119 of 144 
 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Then turn to page 778.  778 is an 
email now from Mr Koko’s PA.  Is that Mr Koko’s PA?  
Executive Assistant 
to 
Mr 
Matshela 
Koko, 
ja. 
 
The 
signature there, end of the email. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Do you see that? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
MR SELEKA SC:  So this email – it is on Thursday 10 
December 2015, at 16.56, is addressed to Mr Nath of 
Oakbay.  Nath@Oakbay.co.za, c.c. Pauli(?) Nzotiana(?) 
10 
08.21 that Mr Singh’s PA.  Yes, that is correct.   
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
MR SELEKA SC:  And the letter, agreement is attached. 
“Please find attached letter for your attention, 
should you require and further clarity please feel 
free to speak to Matshela.” 
And that agreement is in the next four pages, it is signed 
by Mr Nath.  You were not aware of that correspondence, 
were you? 
MS DANIELS:   Which ones, between the PAs? 
20 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   No, I was not copied on that but the 
agreement was signed and I think I got a copy back signed 
by the parties. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Just in conclusion here on this point.  
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 120 of 144 
 
Page 784 there is a letter from Tegeta 10 December 2015. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
MR 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
Addressed 
to 
Mr 
Matshela 
Koko 
providing the banking details.  Do you see that? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I can see that. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Ja, name of account, Tegeta Exploration, 
the bank is State Bank of India and the account is given.  
Now I was surprised by this because when I read the 
underlying agreement, I saw a clause there which says the 
prepayment will be made to OCM.  Do you recall that 
10 
clause? 
MS DANIELS: The advance payment, yes. 
MR SELEKA SC:    Yes.  The agreement expressly said 
that prepayment will be made to OCM.  It says – ja, that is 
clause 2: 
“Eskom has obtained a mandate from its board of 
directors to enable Tegeta to pre-purchase coal 
from OCM for the supply and delivery of coal in 
accordance with Eskom’s approvals framework.” 
Do you have any comment there?  I can also …[intervenes] 
20 
MS DANIELS:   No, it says what it says. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Let me also read 6.1.  Clause 6.1 says: 
“Eskom will make an advance payment to OCM to 
pre-purchase future coal supply in terms of existing 
coal supply agreement.” 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 121 of 144 
 
And advance payment to OCM and they seem to have made 
a distinction between OCM and Tegeta in their contract. 
MS DANIELS:  Tegeta I think was purchasing OCM. 
MR SELEKA SC:    Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   Optimum Coal Mine, ja. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes.  And now the money is going to go 
State of Bank of India. 
MS DANIELS:  Well there is also one later for Baroda. 
MR SELEKA SC:    That is on page 786. 
MS DANIELS:   Oh, okay. 
10 
MR SELEKA SC:  Account name Bank of Baroda.  But now 
this one comes from Eric Wood and it is addressed to Mr 
Anoj Singh and banking details are different from the one 
given in the letter addressed to Mr Koko.  So did Eric Wood 
have anything to do with Tegeta, to your knowledge? 
MS DANIELS:  To my knowledge, no, I do not know.  You 
would have to ask Mr Koko and Mr Singh. 
MR SELEKA SC:    Okay.  I think that concludes the issue 
here.  Anything you want to say to the Chairperson before I 
move on.  I see there was an email from you on page 788 
20 
about the condition precedent.  One and three were still 
open.  That means were not fulfilled. 
MS DANIELS:   That was subsequent. 
MR SELEKA SC:   Ja, that is 16 March 2016. 
MS DANIELS:  [indistinct] 14.47 yes.  The approvals had 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 122 of 144 
 
not been obtained to transfer the mining licence and their 
query was whether the guarantee would be extended but it 
lapsed on the 31 March. 
MR SELEKA SC:    Ms Daniels, can we quickly deal with 
the 659 prepayment.  I say quickly because we have the 
fax, the fax that is related by Dr Mthethwa before the 
Chairperson. 
MS DANIELS:   That is why I am smiling because you say 
quickly. 
MR SELEKA SC:  The submission was made or was drafted 
10 
over the weekend.  You were sent a copy of that on Sunday 
night on the 10 April 2016.  We have grappled with the 
answer to the question why did that meeting take place of 
the BTC by teleconference, take place on the 11 t h, the 
night of the 11 April 2016 when there was a BTC meeting 
scheduled – a prior scheduled BTC meeting for the 13 April 
2016?  Your answer?  
MS DANIELS:  I was instructed by Mr Khoza to convene 
the meeting.  He was the Chairperson of the BTC at the 
time. 
20 
MR SELEKA SC:    Ja and we have asked this question, 
you would know that, that the draft submission document 
already had a date of 11 April 2016 when it came to you.  
How did that happen? 
MS DANIELS:   I am not sure I understand, Mr Seleka, it 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 123 of 144 
 
came with the date. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Ja, the draft submission – well, then let 
us do this because I have seen from affidavit you say Mr 
Zethembe Khoza called you on the 11 t h when you were 
already at home. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
MR SELEKA SC:    Monday 11 April.  What I am asking you 
is, the draft document that came to you Sunday evening 
that was exchanged over the weekend on Sunday, it 
already had a date of 11 April 2016 on it for BTC meeting.  
10 
How did that happen if Mr Khoza only got it on Monday? 
MS DANIELS:   Well, at that stage we were still preparing 
it for the 13 t h, I did not – I did not have any expectation 
that there will be a meeting on the 11 t h. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Ja, but it is not answering the question, 
how did the date of 11 April 2015 get to be inserted on a 
draft document that was exchanged before Mr Khoza called 
you, according to your version, and said let us have a 
meeting on Monday the 11 t h? 
MS DANIELS:  It came from Mr Mthethwa already and at 
20 
that stage we were talking about the content.  I actually did 
not check the dates but the assumption was that this was 
going to the 13 t h, the meeting of the 13 t h. 
MR SELEKA SC:    Who had made that assumption? 
MS DANIELS:   Well, I did because she spoke to me on the 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 124 of 144 
 
– I think it was late afternoon of the 8 April and asked me 
how could she get something on the agenda and I said 
please prepare the submission and submit it as quickly as 
possible because, you know, we have a meeting scheduled 
for the 13 t h and Mr Khoza would be the one that would 
have to approve that submissions. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Well, I – you see, the 11 t h, similar to the 
9 and the 10 December 2015 has developments that are 
taking place parallel to what was happening within Eskom 
and that again is the acquisition of OCH by Oakbay.  So 
10 
according to the evidence of Mr Marsden, on the 11 April 
2016 he had been approached by Mr Howa and told that 
Tegeta has a shortfall in respect of the purchase price and 
that shortfall was R600 million and he wanted some 
assistance, either the bank defer the payment or to give 
them a bridging loan.  The banks refused.  By 15.00 that 
day he gets a message, Mr Howa, from Mr Marsden that 
the banks declined their request.  Did you know that 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   One second, Mr Seleka and Ms Daniels?  
20 
Okay, please continue. 
MR SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  So did you know that 
– did you know those facts? 
MS DANIELS:   No, Mr Chairman, I did not know those 
facts at the time, those came out later when Mr Marsden 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 125 of 144 
 
testified at the parliamentary inquiry. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Did you know that Dr Mthethwa had been 
approached by Tegeta, Mr [indistinct] 20.44, firstly with a 
request 
to 
supply 
coal 
which 
later 
incorporated 
a 
requirement or request for a prepayment. 
MS DANIELS:  That is what she spoke to me about over 
the 
weekend 
when 
we 
were 
putting 
the 
submission 
together, yes. 
MR SELEKA SC:    Did you know that – proceed? 
MS DANIELS:   I do not think she specifically mentioned 
10 
Mr Nath’s name but she did mention that she had been 
approached by Tegeta. 
MR SELEKA SC:  She says she – I mean, in the email we 
see exchanged with you she explicitly says to you that she 
has not dealt with the issue of a prepayment. 
MS DANIELS:  Ja, what that email means is that she had 
not dealt with it in the submission. 
MR SELEKA SC:    Yes in the submission but it was only in 
the resolution. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes.   
20 
MR SELEKA SC:   So her evidence is that she had not 
dealt with a prepayment request before and so she did not 
know what to do with it. 
MS DANIELS:  So that is why she asked for my assistance. 
MR SELEKA SC:    Oh, so you would have assisted with 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 126 of 144 
 
the prepayment? 
MS DANIELS:   The drafting, how you put it in the 
submission, yes. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes.  You know that she had not been 
given an offer in writing at that stage over the weekend as 
you were drafting the submission? 
MS DANIELS:  No, she did not have anything in writing as 
she 
testified 
but 
she 
was 
able 
to 
speak 
to 
me 
telephonically about what she had discussed with the 
supplier. 
10 
MR SELEKA SC:    Yes.  Well, the reason I was putting 
that to you is because I saw your affidavit saying there 
should be no confusion about the prepayment because the 
supplier had put it in writing in the letter dated 8 April 
2016. 
MS DANIELS:   I was responding to what she had put in 
her affidavit, Mr Chairman, but at the time of drafting she 
did not have anything in writing. 
MR SELEKA SC:  And, as a matter of fact, she does say in 
her affidavit that that letter was received only on the 12 
20 
April and it was backdated to the 8 April.  You would have 
seen that in her affidavit. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes, I did. 
MR SELEKA SC:    Who came up with the motivation for 
the prepayment, Ms Daniels? 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 127 of 144 
 
MS DANIELS:   I do not understand, Mr Seleka. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Who in the submission crafted or 
drafted, inserted the motivation for the prepayment? 
MS DANIELS:  I assisted Mr Mthethwa in drafting the 
motivation for the prepayment. 
MR SELEKA SC:   Ja, we were considering that motivation 
in the submission against the reason given by the supplier 
in their offer letter.  The motivation in the submission 
suggests the reopening of the export component of the 
mine.  Do you recall that? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I saw that. 
MR SELEKA SC:  And the offer from the supplier seems to 
talk about increasing the amount of coal and using the 
money for the purposes of beneficiation.  Do you recall 
that? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes, I do. 
MR SELEKA SC:    What we wanted to understand is 
whether 
the 
two 
reasonings, 
are 
they 
the 
same 
or 
different? 
MS DANIELS:   I am not sure because my formulation was 
20 
based on my conversation with Ms Mthethwa or sorry, Dr 
Mthethwa, Mr Chairman.  So they should be similar 
because she was having the conversation with the supplier. 
MR SELEKA SC:  So are you suggesting that she would 
have given the reasoning for the prepayment to the 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 128 of 144 
 
supplier? 
MS DANIELS:   Please repeat that? 
MR SELEKA SC:  Are you suggesting that she would have 
given to the supplier the reasoning for the motivation so 
that the supplier could put it in their offer letter to Eskom? 
MS DANIELS:   I am not sure that I can say that but based 
on 
our 
conversation 
that 
is 
what 
she 
gave 
or 
the 
information that she gave me and if it made its way into the 
letter then she would have been the conduit between the 
supplier and Eskom. 
10 
MR SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Did you say anything to Mr Khoza 
about the request for the meeting – the request made to 
you to schedule a meeting for the 11 April when there was 
a meeting coming up on the 13 April 2016? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes, I did, Mr Chairman, Mr Khoza – I said 
to him well, we have a meeting in 48 hours, I mean – well, 
it was less than 48 hours because it was late Monday 
evening 
and 
he 
said 
that 
the 
operations 
team 
had 
approached him and that is was urgent. 
MR SELEKA SC:   You would have seen some of the board 
20 
members who came here and the affidavit of Mr Khoza 
saying they were misled by you and Dr Mthethwa and you 
were colluding with Tegeta.  What is your comment on 
that? 
MS DANIELS:   On the collusion aspect I think Mr Khoza is 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 129 of 144 
 
wrong, we were – I was assisting my colleagues and I know 
that was – it looks problematic but that is how we dealt 
with it because they were under pressure from Mr Koko and 
I am not sure about Mr Khoza but I know Mr Koko.  In 
terms of the collusion, my meetings that I testified about 
with Mr Essa was about the suspensions and later with the 
Guptas was about Mr Molefe suspension matter and had 
nothing to do with coal.  In fact I was not aware that Dr 
Mthethwa had met with the Guptas regarding the coal 
issues, so I reject his version that we colluded.  He was 
10 
well aware of the reason for the meeting, he was the one 
who called the meeting, he was the Chairman of the BTC, it 
was his prerogative to have the meeting, not mine. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Okay, if the – well, the assumption that 
the date of the 11 t h in the draft submission over the 
weekend could only have come from you be a fair 
assumption or unfair to you? 
MS DANIELS:  I think that is unfair to me.  I was not the 
originator of the document, I had advised Dr Mthethwa that 
the meeting was going to take place on the 13 t h, it was a 
20 
schedule board tender committee meeting, the officials 
would have been aware of that. 
MR SELEKA SC:    Dr Mthethwa has said that, in her 
affidavit, there was no reason why the BTC could not wait 
until the 13 t h of April.  I think Mr Koko says something to 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 130 of 144 
 
that effect, which means that there was nothing so urgent 
to make the BTC meet on the 11 t h of April 2016.  What is 
your comment on that? 
MS DANIELS:   These were the responsible officials who 
would have motivated for the meeting, Mr Koko signed off 
as 
the 
responsible 
executive, 
he 
bypassed 
his 
own 
subordinate, that is Mr Mboweni and signed off on these 
documents.  So he should have been aware or he ought to 
have been aware that the meeting was going to, you know, 
or the urgency.  
10 
And it also is contrary to what he had said in 
Parliament about understanding why the meeting was 
urgent for the 11 t h.  He talked about, he once again talked 
about supply issues, and demand that are not etcetera.  So 
I contest, you know that he did not know that that the 
meeting - while he was the one who motivated for the 
urgency.  If it was not so then he would have to answer for 
it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see.  Now, the BTC did ultimately 
have a meeting on the 11 t h - on the 13 t h of April 2016.  Did 
20 
you attend the BTC meeting?  
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I did. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And we see from the minutes that Mr 
Singh tendered an apology to the BTC about what he said 
were issues he had not disclosed to the BTC regarding the 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 131 of 144 
 
going concern of Tegeta, Tegeta’s going concern status? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can you tell the Chairperson a little bit 
about what those issues were? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Singh pointed out to the Board 
members, Mr Chairman, that Tegeta was having issues with 
the banks. He did not - I do not recall if he specifically 
mentioned, but from what was happening at the time, they 
were facing their bank accounts being closed.  
I think he also worked out that the surety that that 
10 
he had accepted was not acceptable and that is something 
else needed to be put in place, and then he also did a cash 
flow analysis based on what was already contracted to 
Eskom by them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So Tegeta’s bank accounts had been 
closed? 
MS DANIELS:   I think they were in the process of being 
closed Mr Chairman I am not sure that they were still 
operating. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well it shows that they were, the 
20 
minutes shows that they were closed or frozen. 
MS DANIELS:   Oh, frozen so they were in the process of 
being closed then. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But go further about the security 
because there were certain things you needed to do prior 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 132 of 144 
 
to the pre-payment being made.  One of them was to 
consider whether this was a feasible transaction for 
Eskom. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, the meeting of the 11 t h had asked, 
had tasked him with assessing whether this was financially 
viable for Eskom to enter into and what he then did was he 
looked at their status for the next period, I think it was 
next three to 12 months, and he had put in place a session 
of revenue.  
And he had come back and said that this was not 
10 
viable and that alternative security would have needed to 
be found for Tegeta and this is when the issue of pledge 
and security in the form of the shares of Tegeta was 
raised, and he said that that was more acceptable to 
Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   When you do say that in your affidavit, 
but by the time the payment was made, what was the 
position in regard to those pledges and securities? 
MS DANIELS:   Those pledges and securities were not in 
place yet Mr Chairman and I had not yet completed the 
20 
necessary paperwork for that, when the payment was made 
it was actually made earlier in the day based on – and this 
was based on the evidence of Mr Snell Naga, before the 
Commission, and listening to that, and knowing that at the 
time when that payment was made, the pledge and security 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 133 of 144 
 
agreements were not yet in place.  
They were signed towards the end of the day, 
because there were issues with the share certificates that 
were presented to us. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so you say in your affidavit: 
“Mr Singh further advised the BTC that Tegeta had 
been engaged with and the security now being 
offered basically constituted a pledge of all Tegeta 
shares as security for the pre-payment. Effectively, 
Eskom would hold the assets of the company and 
10 
be 
the 
owners 
of 
the 
coal 
mine 
and 
all 
its 
resources.  There was no mention of a discount at 
this feedback, neither the economic viability of the 
transaction.” 
MS DANIELS:   That is, sorry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Please proceed. 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct I do say that in my affidavit 
at paragraph 83. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, you also say at 85, the pledge 
and security agreement was not yet in place. 
20 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you draw that to the BTC’s 
attention? 
MS DANIELS:   When the payment was made I was not 
aware 
that 
it 
was 
made 
on 
the 
day. 
 The 
pledge 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 134 of 144 
 
agreements, I was excused from the BTC meeting of the 
13 t h to go and draft the pledge agreements and put them in 
place. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So when did you become aware that 
payment was made? 
MS DANIELS:   Round – with timing of the payment I was, I 
became aware when Mr Naga testified as to how that 
payment was actually made, and the time at which it was 
made, and that made me realise that at the time that if - I 
think it was 12 o'clock or, you know it was very early in the 
10 
day, it was not practically possible that it was made 
against those pledge agreements because I only completed 
it in late afternoon. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then let me just quickly paint the 
picture for you because this agreement is concluded or the 
pre-purchase submission, pre-payment submission made in 
April 2016 leads to the conclusion of an agreement, a short 
term agreement with Tegeta.  But this time Tegeta had 
been in short term agreements with Eskom in respect of 
our Arnot Power Station from January 2016.  
20 
So they have a short term agreement in January 
2016 and another short term agreement in February 2016, 
which was to end in April 2016.  Those agreements Dr 
Nteta has confirmed in respect of those agreements, that 
Tegeta did not ask for a pre-payment.  Were you aware of 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 135 of 144 
 
these facts? 
MS DANIELS:   Not to that detail Mr Chairman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, were you aware that Tegeta was 
supplying Eskom with coal at Arnot Power Station? 
MS DANIELS:   I was not aware of the specific Arnot 
agreement until the submission, I was aware that they were 
supplying at Brakfontein. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, then they were supplying at Arnot 
and Dr Nteta has said the supply plan of April 2016 cannot 
be relied upon as a reason for urgency for this decision, 
10 
for those two things, and there was in fact also no reason 
to 
ask 
for 
a 
pre-payment 
for 
the 
extension 
of 
the 
agreement that at the time existed. 
The only motivation, and I would like to hear your 
comment on this as received from the evidence was again 
Eskom taking a step to financially assist Tegeta in paying 
what on that day of the 11 t h was a shortfall by Tegeta to 
pay off the purchase price, in respect of OCH.  Your 
comment on that? 
MS DANIELS:   Firstly, I was surprised by Dr Nteta’s 
20 
comments at the Commission, as she and Mr Mabalane 
fielded quite a lot of questions on the 11 t h as to the 
urgency, and as to the pre-payment, and as to why it was 
required, you will see that in the minutes.  
Subsequently, I would agree with you based on 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 136 of 144 
 
what we know now that this transaction was more to assist 
Tegeta in acquiring optimum than the, you know, what is 
the word, the facts put before the BTC in the submission, 
that this was an emergency. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chair we will show the evidence in due 
course of that money how it travelled from Eskom to Tegeta 
and the Bank of Baroda ultimately.  Ms Daniels we did 
touch on the penalties when you were here last time, did 
we? 
MS DANIELS:   I am not sure Mr Seleka it has been a 
10 
while. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, but anyway, what is intriguing 
about these penalties that even before Eskom issued a 
letter of demand in July 2015.  CDH the attorneys for 
Eskom at the time, say that they had advised Eskom of the 
challenges in regard to not only the calculation of the 
penalties and the methodology, but also the evidence to 
prove the figures that Eskom had calculated in order to 
arrive at that R2.17billion. 
They talk about a memo 11 – at least at the very 
20 
latest in March 2015 raising these concerns, but we know 
that Mr Koko and Mr Brian Molefe had said that – and they 
do in their affidavit, that Eskom was entitled to this 
R2.17billion.  Were you not aware of OCH’s concerns in 
regard to this amount before the letter of demand? 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 137 of 144 
 
MS DANIELS:   I was not involved in the matter that time 
Mr Chairman, but what I can tell you from my own 
experience with the Optimum contract is that Eskom 
actually did not manage that contract very well and so the 
calculation of penalties has always been an issue of 
contention with the supplier, from the BHP Billiton days.  I 
was in Primary Energy at the time and I did manage some 
arbitration issues around it and we always had a problem 
proving the penalties.   It was not consistent, so I would 
not be surprised that there was that memo at that early 
10 
stage of the game. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So when did you become involved with 
the claim for penalties?   
MS DANIELS:   It was late 2016 when I took over from Mr 
Mayo Silanco as Acting Head of Legal and Compliance. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And you say in your affidavit that your 
observation was that Mr Koko had shown a keen interest in 
the matter? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes he did, at that stage he had just been 
appointed Acting Group Chief Executive and one of the 
20 
first things that he said to me is that he would be  happy to 
settle at roundabout R500million on that claim, and I was 
surprised, I hadn’t had the time yet to study all the 
documentation, I did caution him that we were already in 
arbitration and you know how did we get from R2.1billion to 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 138 of 144 
 
R500million. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Was that your question to him?   
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Was that your question to him? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And what was the response? 
MS DANIELS:   I don’t think he gave me a proper 
response, he just said that he would be happy to settle the 
matter, he wanted it off his desk. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But the matter ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka we might have to take an 
adjournment or some time, what is your assessment, I 
suspect that there are still quite some matters to deal with. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I have the last matter of McKinsey 
Trillian. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I could take less than 30 minutes with 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the penalties one aren’t there still 
quite some issues, the opinions from CDH and so on? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, there is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What is your assessment? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   If she doesn’t – but the tricky part was 
– it is not a tricky part but the distinguishing aspects with 
Ms Daniels is that if she did not know about these opinions 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 139 of 144 
 
given already in 2015 and she comes later once can go 
into the details of them with her. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well it may well be that we must either 
make another time available for us to continue with that, 
because while we want to finalise the evidence of as many 
witnesses as possible within a short space of time we 
nevertheless want to deal with issues properly still. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So maybe we could find time.  In next 
week I will be having quite a few evening sessions, maybe 
10 
we could look at the possibility of an evening session with 
her during the week after next.  Which week are you – are 
you here during that week? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is the one I am in, the first week 
of March Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh is that the first week of March. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I could just enlighten the 
Chairperson ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I could inform the Chairperson in 
20 
regard to recent correspondence with Mr Anoj Singh’s 
attorneys, I have seen correspondence from them that they 
would be available either on the 11 t h or the 12 t h of March.  
For Eskom Chair had given him a date of the 3 r d of March, 
so that becomes an open slot, if the Chair accommodates 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 140 of 144 
 
him on the 11 t h or the 12 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well isn’t the 11 t h or 12 t h somebody 
else’s week, Transnet’s week? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think the date of 11/12 was proposed 
through him in the letter from Transnet work stream. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but he therefore can’t say – he 
can’t propose to take Transnet’s slot and give it to you isn’t 
it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughing] 
CHAIRPERSON:   From what you are saying it seems that 
10 
he was saying that he would be available during the 
Transnet week for Eskom evidence? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think he was dealing with both Eskom 
and Transnet at the same time Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but they are separate. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    They are separate issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so in regard to your week he hasn’t 
given anything? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, well – but he has been told that we 
20 
don’t have time in terms of days so has to ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I will engage further. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...make himself available, so but during 
the week of the first of March, that first week of March you 
say you will be doing Eskom evidence. 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 141 of 144 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And did we finish Ms Klein’s evidence? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We did Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We are done with her? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We are done with her ja, we finished 
by videolink. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why does it ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Am I not giving a convincing answer? 
CHAIRPERSON:   It seems that you are not sure.  I am 
trying to look at the witnesses that we haven’t – we still 
10 
need to do under Eskom other than Mr Koko, Mr Anoj 
Singh, Mr Brian Molefe and Ms Lynn Brown. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Mr Zwane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Zwane. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Romeo Khumalo. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Romeo Khumalo. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And Mr Tsotsi has tendered to come 
back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To deal with all the allegations coming 
20 
out here against him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so we still have quite a few 
witnesses on Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think let us – Ms Daniels? 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 142 of 144 
 
MS DANIELS:   Yes sir? 
CHAIRPERSON:   How is our situation, to what extent 
would you be able to be available at short notice, when I 
say short notice like two days notice, three days notice, 
generally speaking? 
MS DANIELS:   Generally speaking that will be fine Mr 
Chairman, it is just bearing in mind the time difference. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no subject to you being 
accommodated on the time, two days, three days notice 
might well work, be fine for you? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that will work. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.   Okay I think let us 
adjourn and we are going to try and have Ms Daniels back 
to finish her evidence.    Your estimate is how much time 
do you need to finish all her evidence and having done 
justice to the issues but not too much time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes Chairperson if we go into the 
details of the opinion of the CDH we could take an hour 
with Ms Daniels, an hour, an hour thirty minutes, ja that’s 
my estimation. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is for everything? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   For the balance of what is remaining. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, so there is not a lot that is 
left, I just assumed it was still – okay alright, no we should 
find time. 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 143 of 144 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay we will – I think Ms Daniels we will 
stop here for today but we will make arrangements.  Mr 
Seleka thinks that more or less an hour, another hour of 
your evidence might be enough to complete your evidence, 
so maybe if it takes longer it might be an hour and a half, 
so we will see but they will be in touch with you to see on 
what day we could do that.  
 
It seems to me – oh by the way because of the 
difference in time we wouldn’t be able to – I wouldn’t be 
10 
able to hear your evidence in the mornings before we start 
at ten, because you would be fast asleep at the time. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay we will make a plan and then 
we will continue and then complete your evidence. 
MS DANIELS:   Thank you Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you very much, okay let us 
adjourn then, and I think next week I think I am listening, I 
will be hearing evidence relating to PRASA, I am just 
saying this for the benefit of the public and the media, but 
20 
I think next week it is PRASA related evidence.   
 
Okay, we will adjourn for the day, thank you to 
everybody for sitting until this time and working until this 
time. 
 
We adjourn. 
19 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 346 
 
Page 144 of 144 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise.
