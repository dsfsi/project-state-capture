PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 27 AUGUST 2020 
CHAIRPERSON: 
  
Good 
morning 
Mr 
Myburgh, 
good 
morning everybody. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Good morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Chairperson this matter involves the 
Transnet’s 
steam 
and 
the 
acquisition 
of 
certain 
locomotives. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MYBURGH:  In particular Mr Leher is scheduled to 
10 
give evidence today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Rebutting certain evidence given by Mr 
Callard in relation to his involvement in the negotiations 
leading the acquisition of certain locomotives. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MYBURGH:  This further to you Mr Chairperson 
having granted Mr Leher ’s Rule 3.4 application. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MYBURGH:  As you know we seek a postponement of 
20 
this matter until the October sitting in the weeks of 12 and 
19 October. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Essentially the reasons are twofold 
Chairperson.  Firstly, after Mr Callard completed his 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 4 of 64 
 
evidence, he has uncovered certain additional evidence 
which he has put in a statement which we got last week. It 
might be that we want to lead that evidence before the 
commission and it might also be that that evidence 
implicates Mr Leher.   
Secondly Mr Leher over and above wishing to rebut 
evidence given against him by Mr Callard has provided us 
with a statement that also contains potentially important 
information relating to the negotiations and the relocation 
of the manufacturing plants. 
10 
It is our intention to lead him in respect of certain 
of that evidence.  So what we need to do is to complete the 
new statements of Mr Callard complete the new statement 
of Mr Leher and then our intention with your leave would 
be to acquire a postponement now and then for Mr Leher to 
give evidence at once and not on a piecemeal basis. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine.  So I will postpone 
the hearing of Mr Leher ’s evidence.  Now you mentioned 
October is that when other Transnet evidence is to be 
heard? 
20 
ADV MYBURGH:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you would like him to – to give 
evidence during the same week? 
ADV MYBURGH:  One of those weeks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 5 of 64 
 
ADV MYBURGH:  So we will arrange that and sort it out 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay I think for now I will just say 
to a date to be determined and that will be – will be done. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if – if he can be accommodated 
during that week there is no reason why he cannot be there 
that week.  So the hearing of Mr Leher ’s evidence is 
postponed to a date to be determined. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Thank you. May I be excused Mr 
10 
Chairperson? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are excused. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Are you ready? 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:  Indeed Chair we are ready. Good 
morning, good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have not been in the hearing for a 
long time. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:  Indeed so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may have to place yourself on 
20 
record. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:  Chair I am part of the FABT 
stream with Ms Thandi Norman.  Todays’ evidence and my 
name is Advocate Mpho Rasivhetshele.   
Todays’ evidence relates Mr Rajesh Sundaram who 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 6 of 64 
 
is the former editor of ANN7 and he was employed by 
Infinity Media to help set up – well it is the establishment 
of ANN7. Mr Rajesh Sundaram’s evidence was heard on the 
3 r d and 4 t h June 2019.  Mr Sundaram’s evidence it is an 
entirety Chair yields with particularly three matters which 
are relevant to the commission Terms of Reference 1.6 and 
1.9.   
The first being the sale of the archive content.  
Second being the irregular and corrupt processing of viva 
applications and the third the involvement of the former 
10 
President Mr Jacob Zuma in the establishment of ANN7. 
Mr Sundaram testified to three meetings that took 
place at the former President’s official residence which 
were attended by the former President, Mr Sundaram 
himself and some members of the Gupta family and some 
employees of ANN7. 
Mr Sundaram was unambiguous in his description of 
the meeting rooms wherein three of the – the three 
meetings took place.  Two of the three witness’ today Chair 
will verify whether Mr Sundaram’s description of the 
20 
meeting rooms as described in Mr Sundaram’s book and 
affidavit. 
The third witness this morning Chair will confirm Mr 
Sundaram’s 
evidence 
in 
that 
the 
former 
President 
disclosed his travelling arrangements during the second 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 7 of 64 
 
meeting at the official residence. 
I have kindly asked the Chairperson’s Registrar to 
place 
before 
the 
Chair 
the 
relevant 
exhibits 
to 
Mr 
Sundaram’s evidence which have already been admitted 
into evidence. 
The first being CC1A and B which contains Mr 
Sundaram’s main affidavit and supplementary affidavit and 
Mr Sundaram’s book indentured Behind the Scenes of 
Gupta TV which is not marked clearly but has been 
admitted into evidence as CC1F. 
10 
Then the following presentation file before the 
Chairperson which I have also been informed in lines with 
the Chairperson’s new directive of pagination and labelling 
has been labelled SABC Bundle 1 which contains Exhibit 
CC1G which contain – which is Mr Rajesh Sundaram’s 
supplementary affidavits.   
The first being Chair is under the folder before the 
Chair it is supplementary affidavit 1 which contains – which 
relates actually Chair to Mr Sundaram’s book wherein he 
states that it is a true accord of his experiences while 
20 
working as editor doing the setting up of ANN7 in 2013. 
Also, that all quotations used in the book are not 
verbatim however they convey an accurate gist of what was 
spoken by the individual and finally that he commenced 
writing his book immediately upon his arrival in India in 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 8 of 64 
 
2013. 
The second supplementary statement relates to his 
response to Mr Moegsien Williams whose affidavit has 
been previously admitted into evidence as CC1E. 
Mr Williams’ affidavit was put before Mr Sundaram 
during the – his testimony and Mr Sundaram has just 
reiterated his testimony in response to Mr Moegsien 
Williams in his supplementary affidavit. 
Mr Williams has conveyed that he has no interest in 
testifying before the commission or to cross-examine the 
10 
evidence – Mr Sundaram.   
With the Chair ’s approval may the supplementary 
affidavits of Mr Sundaram under SABC bundle 1 be 
admitted into evidence? 
CHAIRPERSON:  But where the not admitted already when 
he gave evidence? 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:  No Chair these affidavits have not 
been admitted as yet.  During the time of Mr Sundaram’s 
evidence on the 3 r d and 4 t h the Chair had indicated that Mr 
Sundaram should in affidavit form apply that – that the 
20 
words that were in quotes in the book he must clearly state 
if they were in actual conversations and so forth and also 
the Chair had indicated that – well had given rather an 
opportunity for Mr Sundaram to put an affidavit his 
response to Mr Moegsien Williams. 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 9 of 64 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it may not be your fault but nobody 
has ever come back to me and said it has been done.  Here 
are those supplementary affidavits.  I am hearing for the 
first time that such supplementary affidavits were – were 
made.   
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:  Chair if I could just refer to the 
transcript of the hearing on the 4 June 2019? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no I – you do not have to do that. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I – if you say that is what I said I accept 
10 
that.  I am simply saying nobody has come back to me over 
the past twelve months or fourteen months to say Mr 
Sundaram has actually deposed to supplementary affidavits 
to address what you raised with him and here are the 
supplementary affidavits.  And I am saying that might not 
be your fault but I am just surprised that I am hearing for 
the first time that there are new affidavits from him.  So 
where do I find – find – is it one or two supplementary 
affidavits? 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:  Chair it is two supplementary 
20 
affidavits under – so there is a presentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What Tab number? 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:  Tab – it is G. 
CHAIRPERSON:  G? 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:  G Chair and then under G you will 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 10 of 64 
 
find… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I do not have tabs that are in alpha – 
alphabets here.  I have got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 up to 
whatever. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:  I was – sorry Chair I was under 
the impression that my presentation file mirrors the Chair ’s 
presentation file.  So from this it should in fact read SABC 
Bundle 
1 
Exhibit 
CC1G 
on 
the 
– 
the 
front 
of 
the 
presentation file. I think Chair – Chair I think you have the 
incorrect file in front of you.  This is – it is just a small 
10 
presentation file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No well why is it called SABC Bundle? 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:  Chair I was informed by the 
bundling team that this…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it is – it is about ANN7. Sundaram’s 
evidence was largely about ANN7 and only as I remember 
marginally about the archives at the SABC. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes Chair I think it – it would 
inter-relate with the sale of the archive content from the 
SABC to ANN7. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So where do I find the supplementary 
affidavits of Sundaram in this pack? 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:  Chair you would find it under the 
file divider. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And please arrange for these to go into a 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 11 of 64 
 
lever arch file.  You know these files that are like this they 
get lost. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:  Indeed, so Chair we will – I will – 
I will make sure that it is put in an arch lever file.  Chair 
you will find it under the file divider G and the front page it 
is Exhibit CC1G and the first supplementary affidavit of Mr 
Sundaram is under divider 1 which is labelled in tabs on 
Chairperson’s file and affidavit 2 which is tabbed as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have read the first one then there is 
another one at page 3, is that – is that one of the new 
10 
ones? 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes, yes Chair.  Yes that is also 
one of the new ones which relates to his response to Mr 
Williams. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja this – this affidavit too has never been 
given to me so I do not know anything about it.  I saw an 
affidavit yesterday of Mr Williams.  I assume it is the same 
Mr Williams that Mr Sundaram is talking about. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes Chair and Mr Williams’ 
affidavit was put to Mr Sundaram and he did in fact in 
20 
response in testimony respond to Mr Williams is affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was there no need for him to be called? 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:  Mr Williams? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Williams? 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:  Mr Williams indicated Chair that 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 12 of 64 
 
he does not want to - interested in testimony he just 
wanted to put his affidavit forward and he has no intention 
of cross-examining Mr Sundaram. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  But what his interest is is neither 
here nor there. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was there no need for the commission to 
get him to come and give evidence and be questioned? 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:  Chair in light of that Chair we 
could make arrangements according to also Chair ’s leave 
10 
to have Mr Williams come to the commission and testify. 
But he – as I said that even though his interest of coming 
or not coming is relevant to the commission we could… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but the – the legal team is supposed 
to have made their own determination of whether he should 
be called or should not be called.  So my question is 
whether is that what the legal team determined that it was 
not necessary to call him? 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:  Chair Mr Williams had indicated 
he admitted to a meeting did in fact happening but he 
20 
denied two other meetings but he did in fact admit to one 
of the meetings having taken place and he also – despite 
him admitted that the meeting took place he denied the 
reason of the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but did the legal team determine that 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 13 of 64 
 
it was not necessary to call him 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:  Chair at the time we had found 
that you know it was not as necessary to call him at the 
time because he had admitted a meeting having taken 
place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but he had denied some things is it 
not? 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:  He did in fact. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he admit the content of the meetings 
as – as testified to by Mr Sundaram? 
10 
MR MEKGWE:  He denied that the meetings were about 
policies in relation to the establishment of ANN7. But he 
did not deny the fact that the meetings did in fact take 
place at the former President’s official residence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but if he denies what Mr Sundaram 
says we should have that side as well.  We should not have 
one side.  We should not have somebody only the witness 
who says the meetings took place this is what was 
discussed unless everybody admits that that is what 
happened.  If somebody denies then we should hear that 
20 
person. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:  True Chair. Mr Williams did in fact 
also receive a 3.3 Notice in terms of Mr Sundaram’s 
affidavit and Mr Williams also elected to tell his part of the 
story 
in 
his 
affidavit 
which 
has 
been 
admitted 
into 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 14 of 64 
 
evidence.  So to that extent we felt that you know that is 
enough because he did receive the opportunity to tell his 
side of the story. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no that does not speak to what I am 
talking about.  If the legal team has to make – take a view 
whether a witness should be called or somebody should be 
called obviously subject to me but I have no recollection of 
anybody telling me that Mr William denies certain things 
that have been testified to by Mr Sundaram but the 
proposal is that he should not be called.   
10 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:  I – I think if I could go… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so I you must ask your leader to 
talk to me about it. But you know we have in regard to 
those meetings and the discussions we have only one 
witness.  If there is somebody else who has something to 
say we should hear what that person has to say.  Okay let 
us – let us get on with todays’ job.  Let us start with the 
witnesses.  Basically the witnesses that are going to be 
called today – our witnesses who are being called as a 
result 
of 
the 
commission’s 
investigation 
aimed 
at 
20 
establishing certain aspects of – or establishing the 
veracity of certain aspects of Mr Sundaram’s evidence 
about meetings that he said were held at the President’s 
official residence between the former President Mr Jacob 
Zuma and the Gupta’s – Gupta family which he said he 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 15 of 64 
 
attended.  So the point of the evidence is to test in effect 
certain aspects of his evidence.  Okay.  Call your first 
witness. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You must just announce who the first 
witness is going to be. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:  Chair the first – the first witness 
is Mr Mekgwe. He was the former household manager at 
the 
former 
President’s 
official 
residence. 
 
May 
the 
witness… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may be seated for now Mr Mekgwe.   
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:  Chair Mr Mekgwe’s affidavit … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just spell the surname for the benefit of 
the transcribers. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:  It is M-e-k-g- 
CHAIRPERSON:  Give the full name. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:  It is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Names. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:  Mr Ramaru Mekgwe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Give the spelling for the benefit of 
20 
the transcribers. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes Chair.  First name is R-a-m-a-
r-u, surname Mekgwe M-e-k-g-w-e.  And Chair 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:  Mr Mekgwe’s affidavit can be 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 16 of 64 
 
found in the same file as Mr Sundaram’s supplementary 
affidavits under the divider CC8 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will get there – we will get there after 
he has been sworn in. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you want to tell me briefly what his 
evidence will relate to? 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:  Chair Mr Mekgwe’s evidence will 
relate 
to 
verifying 
Mr 
Sundaram’s 
unambiguous 
descriptions 
of 
the 
meeting 
rooms 
and 
also 
other 
10 
submissions made by Mr Sundaram in terms of the security 
when they arrived for the meetings at the official residence 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright.  Please administer the 
oath or affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MR MEKGWE:  Ramaru Mekgwe. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
MR MEKGWE:  No objection. 
20 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
MR MEKGWE:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  And you swear that the evidence you will 
give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 17 of 64 
 
the truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so 
help me God. 
MR MEKGWE:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may be seated.  So Mr Mekgwe’s 
evidence will focus on how in his evidence Mr Sundaram 
described certain rooms at which he said meetings were 
held that he attended between the former President Mr 
Zuma and the Gupta’s to see whether his description of the 
rooms were correct, is that right? 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Indeed so, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And his evidence also, Mr Mekgwe’s 
evidence will focus on the... on certain issues relating to 
security when those meetings took place at the official 
resident and Mr Mekgwe will indicate that the situation was 
at the time.  Is that right? 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright.  
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it will be important, as you lead Mr 
Mekgwe, to... I think first tell us what Mr Sundaram said and 
20 
then Mr Mekgwe can indicate whether... what Mr Sundaram 
said.  Perhaps a little bit reflects what the position was the 
relevant time, that is in 2013 at the official residence of the 
president.  Okay? 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Yes, Chair.  Chair, with your leave, 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 18 of 64 
 
can I commence firstly with the identification and... of Mr 
Mekgwe’s affidavit? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry? 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   The witness? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat that. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   With the Chair’s leave, may I first 
commence with Mr Mekgwe identifying his affidavit? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Well, we need to first admit because 
yours certainly had not been admitted. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Yes, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr 
Sundaram’s 
two 
supplementary 
affidavits.  The one appear in... this is SABC 1201.  We will 
have... I will admit Mr Sundaram’s first supplementary 
affidavit attested to on 22 January 2020 as exhibit... what or 
it will be what, exhibit...? 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:  CC1G.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And the second one will be what? 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   It is... Chair, there are... CC1G 
and then they have the numbered as Supplementary Affidavit 
1 and Supplementary Affidavit 2. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   This is the... so in... they would be 
numbered... those two affidavits Chair are numbered as 
EXHIBIT CC1G and under the photos, I think they are 
numbered holistically, both of them, and then they are 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 19 of 64 
 
subdivided as Supplementary Affidavit 1 and Supplementary 
Affidavit 2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but it cannot... it is not right.  They 
cannot both be G.  There are two separate exhibits.  And the 
first one will be Exhibit CC1G and the second one will be 
admitted and marked Exhibit... 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Sorry, Chair.  Would Chair prefer 
them to... we just, you know, shift down the numbers.   So 
the first supplementary affidavit with the number CC1G and 
the second supplementary be number CC1H.  And then I 
10 
would... we would just have to change the subsequent 
affidavits of the witnesses. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We are going to make this one Exhibit 
CC1.1.G.  So you will have to make correction. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The one is CC1G.  This one is CC1.1.G.  
And then your other exhibit numbers should remain the 
same. 
SUPPLEMENTARY AFFIDAVIT 1 - MR SUNDARAM IS 
ADMITTED AND MARKED AS EXHIBIT CC1G 
20 
SUPPLEMENTARY AFFIDAVIT 2 – MR SUNDARAM IS 
ADMITTED AND MARKED AS EXHIBIT CC1.1.G 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.   
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Thank you, Chair. 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 20 of 64 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Continue. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Chair, Mr Mekgwe’s affidavit is 
identified as Exhibit CC1H.  With your Chair’s leave, can this 
affidavit please be admitted into evidence? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, get the witness to first confirm it. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Yes, Chair.  Mr Mekgwe, if you 
would go just to the file in front of you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You will have to raise your voice.

MR MEKGWE:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 6, I am referring to the red numbers 
but it is page 20 if you look at the black numbers.  Actually,

MR MEKGWE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is a long list, paragraphs 2.1 up to 2.28.  
It is a very long list.  It is a lot of responsibilities.  Is that 
10 
so? 
MR MEKGWE:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   It is a lot of responsibilities that are 
attached to your position? 
MR MEKGWE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay.  So do you say you started in 
this position in 2012? 
MR MEKGWE:   Yes, August 2012. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So in 2013, throughout that year, 
you were holding this position? 
20 
MR MEKGWE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Does this position give your, enable you 
to have good knowledge of the official residency, Mahlamba

MR MEKGWE:   Yes, Chairperson. 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 24 of 64 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   The various rooms and so on? 
MR MEKGWE:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Counsel, take it from there. 
MR MEKGWE:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Mekgwe, Mr 
Sundaram described also in his book and in his affidavit the 
description of one of the meeting rooms.  Chair, with your 
leave, if I could read a description from Mr Sundaram’s 
book? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, just say where it is in the book and if 
you can, where it is in his affidavit. 
10 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Certainly, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then you can read it and then let Mr 
Mekgwe whether... because he, Mr Sundaram describes what 
he says he saw when he attends the meetings at the official 
residence of the president in 2013. 
MR MEKGWE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So Mr Mekgwe can say whether, what Mr 
Sundaram, the description that Mr Sundaram gives in regard 
to certain rooms is true, is correct.   
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Yes, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You may go ahead. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Thank you, Chair.  In this book 
Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think... I am sorry.  So that you 
assist Mr Mekgwe, you might not need to read a long portion 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 25 of 64 
 
before he confirms.  You may have to take it manageable 
pieces. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   So just to identify where it can be 
found, Chair?  In the book, it is page 98 and page 131.  In 
his affidavit, Exhibit CC1B, it can be found on page 10 of Mr 
Sundaram’s affidavit.  Mister ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   When you refer to his affidavit, let he... he 
had signed to... he had deposed to two affidavits. 
10 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And one was a supplementary affidavit. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Yes, Chair.  So he had testified on 
these affidavits on the 3r d and 4t h of June and he had 
deposed to them on the 29t h of April 2019.   
 
Mr Mekgwe, Mr Sundaram describes the first meeting on 
page 98 of his book, which is also been conveys in his 
affidavit, that: 
“That the room had shelves with a neat collection of 
leather bound books.  There was a television set 
20 
mounted on the wall at the far end.  A coffee table in 
the middle with couches around it and ornate chairs 
in each in corner.” 
 
Can you verify Mr Sundaram’s description of the meeting 
as it is also indicated in your affidavit? 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 26 of 64 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, before Mr Mekgwe does that.  Does 
Mr Sundaram indicate where that room is to be found as you 
enter the residence so that Mr Mekgwe knows? 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Oh, indeed so Chair.  That can be 
found on page 97. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Tell Mr Mekgwe how the... what room 
Mr Sundaram talks about, if there is a description of whether 
it is the first room to the left as you enter or it is the first 
room to your right, if there is such a description. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Yes, Chair.  Mr Sundaram 
10 
describes it on page 97.  He states that: 
‘We were ushered into a well-appointed room to the 
extreme right of the entrance.” 
 
And then...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you able to identify such a room? 
MR MEKGWE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   And can you verify the description 
of Mr Sundaram’s description of that particular room which I 
just stated now? 
20 
MR MEKGWE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   So can you describe in relevance 
to your affidavit, where Mr Sundaram had mentioned the 
room had the leather bound books and the television 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 27 of 64 
 
mounted and ornate chairs and so forth?  Could you also just 
describe the room to the Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that what he describes on page 18?  I 
am looking at the black numbers on the top left under 
paragraph 6. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Yes, Chair.  That is the... on... that 
is from paragraph 5 on page 18 of his affidavit Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that... does that relate to that room? 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Mekgwe, you know which room 
10 
we are talking about? 
MR MEKGWE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Just talk... if you need to refresh 
your memory by looking at the... at your affidavit, you may 
do so.   
MR MEKGWE:   Thank you.  There is this room at the 
residence with a neat collection of leather-bound books.  In 
the centre, there is a coffee table.  There are two couches 
adjacent with a table... with a coffee table at the centre.  
There is wingback chairs, about four of them around the 
20 
coffee table with a TV, right at the far end of the room but 
not mounted to a wall but in a cabinet.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  H’m. 
MR MEKGWE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 28 of 64 
 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   So Mr Mekgwe, the only difference 
is that Mr Sundaram had stated that the TV was mounted on 
the wall but in your evidence, you are stating that the TV 
was... is actually in a cabinet? 
MR MEKGWE:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you prepared the affidavit or when it 
was prepared for you, were you been given the opportunity 
to look at Mr Sundaram’s book and see how he describes the 
various rooms before you confirmed or not? 
MR MEKGWE:   Correct, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did? 
MR MEKGWE:   We did get a chance to look at this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MR MEKGWE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  So in regard to this 
particular room, the... you confirm that what Mr Sundaram 
said in describing the room and the furniture is correct, 
except that when it comes to the TV set?  He said it was 
mounted on the wall but that is not true.  It was not mounted 
on the wall. 
20 
MR MEKGWE:   Yes ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   If there is something else that you picked 
up that he said which is not true, you must just tell me. 
MR MEKGWE:   This was 2013 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   2013, ja. 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 29 of 64 
 
MR MEKGWE:   ...according to the book.  So as he 
explained it, it’s... the only thing that I will say it is... the TV 
is not mounted to the wall.  It was in a cabinet.  And I also 
had a chance to check the room now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MEKGWE:   And it is not... it is completely not the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So some changes have happened 
since 2013? 
MR MEKGWE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But as in 2013, Mr Sundaram’s description 
10 
is correct except for the TV? 
MR MEKGWE:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Continue. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Thank you, Chair.  Then Mr 
Sundaram has also described a second meeting room at the 
residence.  They moved to a second meeting room.  Mr 
Sundaram has described this on page 130 of his book where 
he states that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe... I said earlier on, maybe 
you could take it in pieces because he had said that he did 
20 
read the descriptions in the book and he is able to respond.  
So you can read the whole description. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Thank you, Chair.  He states that: 
“We were moved to the next room.  This was a much 
large living room with various seating arrangements 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 30 of 64 
 
and a large TV set.  We sat around the coffee table.  
The usher took out the chip-reader and the cables.  
There was not enough cable to connect the chip-
reader to the last TV mounted on one of the walls.” 
 
That is the description that were taken to another room, 
there were various seating arrangements in that room and it 
was a much larger size in the previous meeting room that 
they had initially went to.   
 
Can you confirm or verify Mr Sundaram’s submissions?  
You have also just highlighted that... in your affidavit the 
10 
description of the furniture laid out in the large room from 
page 19, paragraph 10 of your affidavit. 
MR MEKGWE:   Chairperson, on the other meeting room.  
The other meeting room, it is two and a half times larger 
than the first room and it does have multiple seating 
arrangements with coffee tables at the centre, couches 
adjacent each other and wingback chairs around the tables 
and the TV at the far end.  The difference from this room to 
the other room is the size.  Hence it has multiple seating 
arrangements.  Yes. 
20 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   And...  sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, continue. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   And the only difference from Mr 
Sundaram’s description and what you have testified to in 
your... what you have submitted in your affidavit, is that the 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 31 of 64 
 
TV, yet again, is not mounted on the wall but it is in the TV 
cabinet? 
MR MEKGWE:   In this specific room, it is not in a TV 
cabinet.  It is on a wooden table. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   With a plasma unit or not? 
MR MEKGWE:   Not necessarily a plasma unit.  Just a table 
where... it is not mounted.  I can confirm it is not mounted on 
the wall but it is not within a wall cabinet, it is just on a 
table. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Thank you, Mr Mekgwe.  And 
10 
then...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So in regard to this room too, your 
evidence is, except in regard to one aspect that is relating to 
the TV set, Mr Sundaram’s description of this room is 
correct?  Is that right?  Or if there other differences, you 
must just tell me. 
MR MEKGWE:   The difference from this room ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   As in 2013, of course.  Ja.  we are more 
interested what was the position in 2013, if you are able to 
tell us. 
20 
MR MEKGWE:   The difference would be the size. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MEKGWE:   And multiple seating. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  What did Mr Sundaram say about 
multiple seating? 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 32 of 64 
 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Also... sorry, Chair.  Also, in his 
affidavit on page 26 of his supplementary affidavit, he had 
stated on paragraphs 28.9 a description to the second room, 
he states that: 
“There is a much larger living room that had various 
seating arrangements and a large TV set” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   And they sat around a coffee table 
and he had stated that there is a large TV mounted on one of 
the walls of that room. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   So that was his description. 
CHAIRPERSON:   With regard to the seating arrangement, 
what did he say? 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Chair, he does not necessarily 
identify what type of chairs.  He just stated that were various 
seating arrangements in the room. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  I am trying to establish differences 
between... I mean, I am trying to establish what you are able 
to confirm out of what he says and what you are not able to 
20 
confirm.  Or were you saying:   No, no.  That is not correct.  
So in regard to the TV.  He said it is mounted also on the 
wall in regard to this room? 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, and that is not true according to Mr 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 33 of 64 
 
Mekgwe. 
MR MEKGWE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was not mounted in 2013?? 
MR MEKGWE:   Yes, Chair it was not mounted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  You also mentioned the seating, 
multiple... no.  Multiple...[intervenes]  
MR MEKGWE:   Multiple seating arrangements. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Did he say anything about the 
seating arrangements that you do not agree with or you are 
not sure? 
10 
MR MEKGWE:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mekgwe. 
MR MEKGWE:   No, nothing that I am not agreeing with, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that is just the TV... the question of 
whether the TV was not mounted onto the wall or not?  You 
say that is not true?  Otherwise, the rest, there is nothing 
that you do not agree with? 
MR MEKGWE:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Thank you.  Continue. 
20 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Mekgwe, Mr 
Sundaram had also testified about security upon arrival to 
the official residence where these meetings took place.  He 
mentions it in page 97 of his book, where he states: 
“There was no frisking.  We were not asked to pass through 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 34 of 64 
 
metal detectors and we were not required to give our names 
and details to any of the security personnel.   
“We just 
walked in.” 
He further states that: 
“I could not see any x-ray machines at the venue.  I 
could not figure out if this was special treatment for 
the 
Gupta 
delegation 
or 
if 
the 
security 
was 
generally of a low standard.” 
You have highlighted this, Mr Mekgwe in paragraph 16, 
page 20 of your affidavit, could you just comment on this? 
10 
MR MEKGWE:   There were no metal detectors or x-ray 
machines in the residence during the period in question, 
Chairperson. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   So you would agree with Mr 
Sundaram’s submission, well his description of the security 
in general, the metal detectors and so forth.  So you would 
agree with what I have just read. 
MR MEKGWE:   Correct.   
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Mr Mekgwe, also whilst in your 
tenure at the residence did you see some of the Gupta 
20 
family members at the official residence? 
MR MEKGWE:   Correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As household manager, how much 
access do you have to people who visit the official 
residence?  In other words, are you able to see – to say 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 35 of 64 
 
most of the time who came, when and so on to the 
residence or is that – has your position not enabled you to 
have access to that information? 
MR MEKGWE:   Chairperson, at some instances I do have 
access to visitors to the residence or guests, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would that be a record in the official 
residence of the President?  Would there have been a 
record in 2013 at least of everyone who came to the 
residence or would there be no such record? 
MR MEKGWE:   No, no record, Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Would you have been able in 
2013 and in other years to know if certain people were 
regular visitors to the official residence of the President? 
MR MEKGWE:   No, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You would not know. 
MR MEKGWE:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would that mean – does that mean that 
you would not be in a position to say how regularly the 
Guptas visited the official residence of the President? 
MR MEKGWE:   I will not be in the position to say, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Would that be somebody within the 
official residence that you know would know that kind of 
information? 
MR MEKGWE:   To be honest, there is no record or lock-in 
of – it is treated merely as a residence and guests will 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 36 of 64 
 
come and go. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MEKGWE:   And there would not have been any reason 
to have a record of …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   A record, ja. 
MR MEKGWE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but apart from the record, you know, 
if in your house your son or daughter has certain friends, if 
they frequent the house to visit their friend, your son or 
daughter, even though there is no record you might – you 
10 
would get to know that oh, so and so comes here very 
regularly because he is friends with my daughter, he is 
friends with my son.  So that is what I am looking for, 
whether there is somebody who might be able to say 
although no records were kept they know, for example, that 
the Gupta brothers used to visit regularly, maybe there 
would be no week that passes by without some Gupta 
brother coming to the residence or no month would pass 
without them coming, that kind of information. 
MR MEKGWE:   Chairperson, there would not be anyone 
20 
that would have – because not all the time we are at work 
all the time, all of us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR MEKGWE:   So I doubt there would be someone that 
would have been on duty every day of the month. 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 37 of 64 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR MEKGWE:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, it does not have to be every day of 
the month but if, for example, in a year you might find that 
on some of the occasions when you are on duty you are 
able to say oh, for example, Mr Ajay Gupta, or he comes 
almost once or twice every month, you know, he would 
come here, there is going to be no month when he did not 
come in and so on.  That is what I am talking about. 
MR MEKGWE:   No, Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not think anybody would know 
that. 
MR MEKGWE:   Not to the best of my knowledge. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, except maybe security at the 
gate. 
MR MEKGWE:   I will say so, yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright.  Thank you. 
ADV 
RASIVHETSHELE: 
 
 
Thank 
you, 
Chair. 
 
That 
concludes …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mekgwe’s evidence. 
20 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Mr Mekgwe’s evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much, Mr Mekgwe, for 
taking time to come and assist the Commission.  
MR MEKGWE:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We appreciate it very much. 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 38 of 64 
 
MR MEKGWE:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are now excused. 
MR MEKGWE:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Chair, the next witness is Mr 
Human, he is the incumbent household manager at the 
official residence.  Now he has in his affidavit laid down a 
very vivid description of the room in particular before it has 
been changed through the social distancing measures at 
the official residence, so his testimony will be based on the 
10 
exact description of what exactly is in the room and what 
has changed since then.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   He will also testify in relation to 
the security measures that are in place at the official 
residence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, I think Mr Human is ready to 
take the oath or affirmation.  Let us do that, so he can be 
20 
seated. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MR JACQUES ANDRE HUMAN:   Jacques Andre Human. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 39 of 64 
 
MR HUMAN:   No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
MR HUMAN:   Yes, I do. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give 
will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing else but the 
truth?  If so, please raise your right hand and say so help 
me God. 
MR HUMAN:   So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, you may be seated Mr 
10 
Human. 
MR HUMAN:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, counsel, proceed. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Human’s 
affidavit is under – it just follows Mr Mekgwe’s affidavit and 
labelled as EXHIBIT CC1i.  Mr Human, if you could just 
turn to your folder and the numbering to follow would be 
the black on the top left-hand side of your page and that 
would start on page 24.  Do you see that, Mr Human? 
MR HUMAN:   Yes, I do, Mr Chair. 
20 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   And can you identify that 
document, Mr Human. 
MR HUMAN:   This is the affidavit that I have submitted, 
that is correct. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   And if you turn over to page 30, 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 40 of 64 
 
is that your signature, Mr Human? 
MR HUMAN:   That is correct, Mr Chair. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   And you deposed to this affidavit 
on the 27 July 2020, is that correct? 
MR HUMAN:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Also, just next to your signature 
on page …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, on the 2 n d? 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   27 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That looks like 2 n d to me on page 30. 
10 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Can you just confirm that date, 
Mr Human? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, it is 27? 
MR HUMAN:   It is 27, Mr Chairperson, the police official 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, well, it is – ja, okay, alright. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   And just next to your signature, 
Mr Human, you had stated – you had written something 
down.  Can you just read that out into the record? 
MR HUMAN:   Mr Chair, I stated in the affidavit that: 
20 
“Please be advised that I, Jacques Human, was not 
the household manager at the residence during the 
alleged visit.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that is during 2013? 
MR HUMAN:   That is correct, Chair.

CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   And, Mr Human, are you satisfied 
with the contents of your affidavit? 
MR HUMAN:   Yes, I am, Chair. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   As being true and correct? 
MR HUMAN:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You confirm the contents to be true and 
correct to the best of your knowledge and belief, is that 
correct? 
MR HUMAN:   Yes, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  This affidavit will be 
admitted and marked as EXHIBIT CC1 is it I? 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Yes, Chair, I. 
CHAIRPERSON:   CC1I. 
AFFIDAVIT OF JACQUES ANDRE HUMAN HANDED IN AS 
EXHIBIT CC1I 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, continue. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Human, 
will you please just in a short summary tell us about your 
employment history to date, currently? 
20 
MR HUMAN:   Chair, I was appointed at the office of the 
President in September 1995 as the assistant manager and 
chef at the official residence, Mahlamba Ndlopfu.  I was 
working there until up to 1998, then I was transferred to 
another official residence.  I want back to Mahlamba 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 42 of 64 
 
Ndlopfu in the year 2000 up to 2009 and from there again 
to another – deployed to another official residence and 
then I started at Mahlamba Ndlopfu again till current from 
2018. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, thank you. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   And, Mr Human, can you just 
shortly describe your role and function as the household 
manager at the official residence? 
MR HUMAN:   Okay.  Also, as Mr Mekgwe mentioned, it is 
all those responsibilities, it is the day-to-day management 
10 
and running of the official residence.  Also, I am managing 
the staff employed at the official residence.  All the 
catering 
and 
housekeeping 
requirements, 
events 
management, maintenance, everything to do with the 
official residence I am responsible for. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.   
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Thank you, Mr Human.  You have 
stated on page 25 of your affidavit – that would be the 
numbering on your top left hand corner, also in conjunction 
with your descriptions from paragraphs 15 onwards on 
20 
page 28 of the meeting rooms, Mr Sundaram has submitted 
in his book and so forth, you were sitting in the room while 
I read out the description as alleged by Mr Sundaram.  
Could you just descript and also verify the – because you 
have actually, you know, detailed it specifically, the 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 43 of 64 
 
furniture pieces and described the makeup of the room.  
Can you also just talk to the description of the room in 
detail? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before he does that, I take it that the 
purpose of Mr Human’s evidence must be show that when 
he returned to the official residence in 2018 to show 
whether he found the furniture or the descriptions that had 
been given by Mr Sundaram to accord with what he found 
in 2018 or not. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Yes, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And, Mr Human, did you get an 
opportunity to - before you deposed to this affidavit, did 
you get a chance to read either Mr Sundaram’s book or his 
affidavits to see how he was describing the relevant 
rooms? 
MR HUMAN:   That is correct, Chair.  When the officials 
came to visit the residence, they brought the book along 
and they read the specific paragraphs from the book to us 
while were we at that rooms, specific rooms as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now counsel will take you through 
20 
the various descriptions but are you able to say – are you 
able to say when you came back to Mahlamba Ndlopfu in 
2018, are you able to say whether substantially at least the 
descriptions that Mr Sundaram gave in his book of the 
relevant rooms was substantially correct? 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 44 of 64 
 
MR HUMAN:   That is correct, Chair.  There were minor 
differences. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR HUMAN:   Changes made in the room but overall, the 
description according to the book is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Correct. 
MR HUMAN:   It was still like that when I returned back to 
the residence in 2018. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Okay, alright. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Thank you, Chair.  Would Chair 
10 
indicate if I should reread Mr Sundaram’s description 
because he has indicated that, you know, the book was 
read to him and he was present when Mr Mekgwe was 
giving his evidence as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think what we can do, you can take him 
to – I mean, you referred him to page 28, is that right, of 
the black 28. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   That would be 25 and 28. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I think – take him through each 
one just for the sake of completeness. 
20 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Indeed so, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Mr Human, Mr Sundaram has 
said that upon their arrival they were ushered into a well-
appointed room to the extreme right of the entrance and in 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 45 of 64 
 
that room there was a shelf with a collection of leather 
bound books, there was a television set mounted at the 
wall the far end and a coffee table in the middle with 
couches around it and ornate chairs in each corner.  Now 
you have described I think far more in detail the specific of 
the colour of the couches and so forth from paragraphs 5 
on page 25 of your affidavit, can you talk to this and can 
you confirm the contents and the differences from Mr 
Sundaram’s description? 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you can look at your affidavit to 
10 
refresh your memory, okay?  
MR HUMAN:   Chair, the room, as it is described, is to the 
far left from the entrance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Far right. 
MR HUMAN:   Far right from the entrance.  It is a well-
appointed room, it is used for smaller type of meetings 
between the principal and couple of guests.  As you enter 
the room, on your right – sorry, on your left there is quite a 
large antique book cabinet and that is with the collection of 
the leather-bound books.  That cabinet has been there 
20 
since early 2000 when it was placed in that residence. 
 
The TV has always been in a cabinet, it is has 
never been wall mounted and the cabinet has been there 
from the time when I started working in that residence and 
even when I returned to the residence.  So that cabinet has 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 46 of 64 
 
always been there with the TV inside it. 
 
The layout of the furniture is two two-seater leather 
couches, brown leather couches, across – opposite of a 
central coffee table.  There is two wing backed chairs 
closest to the entrance and then there is other ornate 
chairs, almost in front of the TV cabinet.   
 
Apart from the other details in that room there is oil 
paintings on the walls, one large, two smaller ones, there 
is side tables with vases, there is a small fireplace in the 
corner that is not an actual fireplace anymore, but it used 
10 
to be, and the difference from when I left the residence in 
2009 to from when I came back was the curtains was 
changed, it was not the original curtains and also, some of 
the chairs, wing backed chairs, was changed. 
 
But from the description in the book it is, apart from 
the 
television 
set, 
everything 
is 
according 
to 
the 
description. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Thank you, Mr Human.  And then 
you describe that – that room, that you describe in 
particular, 
has 
since 
changed 
post 
social 
distancing 
20 
measures.  How has that room now changed? 
MR HUMAN:   Ja.  Mr Chair, due to the social distancing 
and the requirements for the use of that room, we changed 
it 
into 
a 
conference 
facility 
area. 
 
So 
the 
seating 
arrangements, the couches, the wingback chairs, the 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 47 of 64 
 
coffee table, all the loose furniture that was in the middle 
area 
of 
the 
room 
was 
removed 
to 
accommodate 
a 
conference 
table 
with 
big 
screen 
televisions 
for the 
distance conference facility. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Thank you, Mr Human.  Mr 
Sundaram has also mentioned a second meeting room 
which you have also talked to in your affidavit.  He in his 
book on page 131 had stated that the second meeting room 
is much larger living room that had various seating 
arrangements with a large TV set.  Yet again he states that 
10 
this TV set was mounted on the wall.  Could you verify or 
confirm this?   
You have also just in detail, as in the first room, 
described the larger room next door on page 29 of your 
affidavit.  Can you talk to that? 
MR HUMAN:   The room that you are referring to is right 
adjacent to the former room that we discussed, it is what 
we call the formal lounge or drawing room.  It is quite a 
large room with several seating arrangement, it is used for 
formal visits.  The principal will meet other heads of state 
20 
or important visitors that area.   
It is a much larger space to accommodate more 
people.  The room also, as I mentioned, have several 
seating arrangements.  There is a television set in that 
room but yet again the television is not mounted on the 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 48 of 64 
 
wall, it is on a loose standing table in the corner with the 
television placed on top of that table.  It is light colour 
furniture that is in there, it is quite an airy room with lots 
of windows, curtains and wonderful artworks and so forth. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   And Mr Sundaram has also 
stated, Mr Human, about the security measures taken at 
the official residence.   I can see that you have indicated 
from paragraphs 13 from the inception of when you started 
in 2018 again.  
I would just like to actually just check back to what 
10 
Mr Sundaram had stated, that there was no frisking at the 
gates, they were not asked to pass through any metal 
detectors and they were not required to give any names 
and details to any of the security personnel. 
  
Further, he could not see any x-ray machines at the 
venue and he could not figure out if it was special 
treatment with the Guptas.  Was this just normalcy?  You 
have talked to this on page 27 of your affidavit. 
MR HUMAN:   Mr Chair, there is no metal detectors at the 
front entrances of the residence.  Guests, when they 
20 
arrive, they will be entering through two security gates 
where they must be confirmed whether they are expected.  
So it is not specific that each person will be stopped at the 
second gate for Mahlamba Ndlopfu especially because if it 
is several cars or vehicles and if it is a convoy then they 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 49 of 64 
 
will have confirmation whether they can come in or not to 
the residence but apart from that, security is responsible 
for the exit and entrances for all guests to the residence, 
the SAPS.   Our sort is just there to confirm whether the 
guests can be allowed or not. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Mr Human, just to say, you know, 
for – let us just say if there are several cars coming into 
the residence, is it – are the identifications of the vehicles 
given beforehand, before the vehicles arrive and they are 
just waved in? 
10 
MR HUMAN:   Mr Chair, if that information is available in 
advance it will be given to the SAPS for access otherwise 
the vehicles will not be allowed through the gate. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Chair, just the relevance of that 
is Mr Sundaram also in his book and his affidavit had 
stated that upon the arrival at the residence they were just 
waved in and his submission was that the description of 
the cars were given prior to their arrival to the residence 
and hence that question.  Chair, that concludes the 
…[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Human’s affidavit. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   The statement, the evidence of 
Mr Human. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much, Mr Human, for 
coming to assist the Commission. 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 50 of 64 
 
MR HUMAN:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We appreciate it very much, you are 
excused now. 
MR HUMAN:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Chair the next witness, I think 
the next and final witness is Ms Gillian Pillay.   Ms Gillian 
Pillay is a former journalist at the SABC and her relevance 
in terms, her relevance and evidence is that the former 
President had disclosed his travelling arrangements to the 
10 
Gupta delegation and Ms Pillay will indicate and confirm 
that in fact that the President did in fact travel to where he 
had said he was travelling to in the meeting because he 
was travelling to an event. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so again the evidence of this 
witness seeks to see whether at least some aspects of Mr 
Sundaram’s evidence could be true.  Mr Sundaram said 
that at one of the meetings he attended between the former 
President, Mr Zuma and the Gupta’s the former President 
said he would be at Mpumalanga the following week and 
20 
this witness will tell me whether she is aware that whether 
Mr Zuma was at Mpumalanga during that week.   Ja, okay, 
please administer the oath or affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full name for the record? 
MS PILLAY:   My name is Gillian Pillay. 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 51 of 64 
 
REGISTRAR:   Do you have any objection to taking to 
taking the prescribed oath? 
MS PILLAY:   I do not have. 
REGISTRAR   Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
MS PILLAY:   I do. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you swear that the evidence that you 
will give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing else 
but the truth, if so, please raise your right hand and say so 
help me God. 
10 
MS PILLAY:    So, help me God. 
GILLIAN PILLAY: [duly sworn, states] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, you may be seated Ms Pillay.  
Yes counsel? 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Thank you Chair.  Ms Pillay could 
you just open up the presentation file in front of you, can 
you go to the last ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You can switch on the mic as well, ja. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Can you please just go to the 
last folder marked J, and Ms Pillay if you turn over that 
20 
page and the next page you will see the numbering that 
we’re going to use is on the top left-hand corner in black, 
that would be – are you on page 33?  Miss Pillay can you 
identify that document in front of you? 
MS PILLAY:   The document before me, Chair, is my 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 52 of 64 
 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   And the following, if you just turn 
over the following page, is that your signature? 
MS PILLAY:   I confirm that is my signature on page SABC-
010-34. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   And you depose to – is that 
correct that you deposed to this affidavit on the 10 t h of 
August 2020? 
MS PILLAY:   That’s correct Chair. 
10 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   And Ms Pillay, you’re satisfied 
that the contents of this affidavit is true and correct? 
MS PILLAY:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Chair, with your leave may Ms 
Pillay’s affidavit be admitted into evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The affidavit of Ms Gillian Pillay will be 
admitted and marked Exhibit CC1J. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Thank you Chair, Chair sorry, did 
– I think I misheard Chair saying CC1A or J. 
CHAIRPERSON:   CC1J. 
20 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Yes, sorry, Chair, thank you 
Chair.  Ms Pillay could you just shortly describe to us your 
employment as from the SABC to current? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe let’s do it this way. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Yes Chair. 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 53 of 64 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Pillay in 2013, where were you 
employed?  
MS PILLAY:   I was employed by the SABC, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, how long had you been in SABC’s 
employ at that time? 
MS PILLAY:   Up until the end of May this year, Chair, I 
was employed by the SABC for 17 years. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, yes, in what position were you 
employed by the SABC? 
MS PILLAY:   At the time, over the period of 17 years, 
10 
Chair, I was employed as a Senior General News Journalist 
in the Johannesburg Newsroom at the SABC in Auckland 
Park. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay and you collected news for the 
SABC?  
MS PILLAY:   I did news, day to day, anything from crime, 
gender-based violence, issues around, you know, in those 
17 years covering the national and local Government 
elections.  Also reporting beyond the borders of the 
province of Gauteng, going to other provinces Chair to 
20 
cover stories there but also foreign trips as well.  a lot of 
general news around health issues, particularly human-
interest stories, Chair that was my forte at the SABC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, would the news that you covered go 
on TV or radio or both? 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 54 of 64 
 
MS PILLAY:   In most instances, Chair, the news that I 
covered for the SABC as a General News Journalist would 
go onto the primetime news bulletins, that being SABC1, 2 
and 3, it was translated into different languages and also 
in recent years it also went on to DSTV channel 404, our – 
the international channel that we are running on DSTV, 
Chair.  Very few times radio would also utilise the stories 
that we would do as television journalists and they would 
use those stories for their, either radio bulletins or even 
digital news would also utilise our stories that we, as 
10 
television journalists would cover and vice versa, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would you cover areas such as the 
Mpumalanga Province in your work? 
MS PILLAY:   Chair, the SABC has a mandate to cover 
national days, that being women’s day, heritage day all the 
national days that we observe as a country and journalists 
within the different offices around the country, within the 
newsrooms at the SABC would be given opportunity to go 
to different provinces where these main events are being 
commemorated, where key note – where a key note 
20 
address is being given by the sit-in President at the time.  
So, every journalist would be given an opportunity to go 
and cover stories like that.  Relating to the 2013 incident, 
Chair, that is when I was, you know, given the assignment 
to accompany a team from Johannesburg to Mpumalanga to 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 55 of 64 
 
cover that women’s day 
event at the Thulamahashe 
Stadium in Mpumalanga Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You’re talking about the date of the 9 t h 
of August 2013 which would have been women’s day, is 
that right? 
MS PILLAY:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say you were in Bushbuckridge in 
Mpumalanga on that day? 
MS PILLAY:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay what was happening – what event 
10 
was there on that day? 
MS PILLAY:   The event on that day, Chair, was – we were 
commemorating, as a country we were commemorating 
women’s day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MS PILLAY:   The main event was happening was 
happening 
in 
the 
province 
of 
Mpumalanga 
at 
Bushbuckridge at Thulamahashe Stadium where the sitting 
President at the time, former President Jacob Zuma was 
delivering a key note address at that main event, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so you were there, you know he 
was at that stadium and he delivered the key note 
address? 
MS PILLAY:   I was given the assignment to be a roving 
reporter at that event where I would do short interviews, 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 56 of 64 
 
pre the speech with women particularly in the stadium 
women in farming, women in business also what has not 
become a epidemic in the country, talking to women around 
gender-based violence issue, looking at the challenges 
women are facing and what they’d like to see come out of 
the President’s speech.  So that was the pre speech 
reactions and interviews we were doing in the stadium 
before former President, Jacob Zuma’s address, Chair.  We 
also did post speech reactions following the President’s 
address, you know, getting a sense if the women who had 
10 
attended that event, if what had come out of former 
President 
Jacob 
Zuma’s 
speech 
was, 
you 
know, 
encouraging, if it addressed issues of empowerment and 
equity.  If they felt that, you know, the speech had maybe 
fell short of their expectations as women at the cold face 
of the challenges that many of them face in provinces – 
rural provinces like Mpumalanga, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Counsel continue. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Thank you Chair.  Just off Ms 
Pillay’s testimony, Mr Sundaram had described how the 
20 
former President, Mr Jacob Zuma had disclosed in a 
meeting.  That can be found in Mr Sundaram’s book Chair, 
on page 19. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, just read it. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Where he – where it is quoted 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 57 of 64 
 
what the former President had stated, 
“I will be in Mpumalanga next week and I will meet 
people in the local communities and…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think you should start a little earlier, 
read 
what 
Mr 
Sundaram 
says 
before 
he 
says 
what 
President Zuma said. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   In the context of the book, Chair, 
he describes…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe move to the affidavit. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Yes, Chair.  Chair that can be 
10 
found in CC1B of Mr Sundaram’s affidavit where Mr 
Sundaram had extracted contents from his book in the 
affidavit, it reads from – in the context where – paragraphs 
25.11 it states, 
“Despite Athol’s constant reminders that would only 
do 
what 
suits 
our 
vision, 
President 
Zuma’s 
directives on editorial policies puzzles me.  I will be 
in Mpumalanga next week and I will meet people in 
the local communities and announce measures for 
their welfare but I’m sure ENCA will not cover that”. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry, let me get to it, what 
paragraph of Mr Sundaram’s…[intervenes]. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Paragraph 25.11 because prior to 
that they are talking about the publicity for the ANC and 
the channel. 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 58 of 64 
 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Hang 
on 
one 
second. 
Where 
is 
Sundaram’s original affidavits?  Where does he start 
discussing…[intervenes]? 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Chair, I think…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In the second meeting? 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   This is the second meeting, 
indeed so Chair.  In the context it came from how other 
news stations, other media houses were not covering 
certain things and he had disclosed that he would be 
meeting – he would be going to Mpumalanga the following 
10 
week and he had stated that ENCA, for instance, would 
have not covered that story.  Then from then the Gupta 
delegation had suggested that they would send a reporter 
with the former President to report on this event in a 
positive light. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, in paragraphs 20 of his affidavit 
deposed to on the 29 t h April 2019, in paragraphs 20 up to 
25.10 Mr Sundaram discusses the second meeting between 
the former President Mr Jacob Zuma and the Guptas which 
he attended at the President’s official residence and in 
20 
different parts he says at paragraph 20, 
“Second meeting happened in the month of July 
2013, I do not remember the exact date but I do 
remember it was a Sunday, the meeting took place 
at President Zuma’s official residence in Pretoria, in 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 59 of 64 
 
the same room as the first meeting, and 23, he 
says, President Zuma came to the meeting armed 
with the presentation we had given him in the last 
meeting and with some questions about its content, 
paragraph 24 he says, this meeting too, was more 
of a shareholder review of the project”, 
 
And then under paragraph 25 he, in various sub-
paragraphs refers to excerpts from his book from pages 
117 to 122 and 25.2, Mr Sundaram says – quoting what he 
says in his book, 
10 
“Athol told me before the meeting, reiterating a 
point, his brother and he had made many times 
before, like the previous one this meeting took 
place on a Sunday morning, Ashul Choula came in 
his car to pick us up from the Midrand office, he 
was mostly silent during the ride to President 
Zuma’s residence in Pretoria”, 
 
And 
then 
in 
25.5 
he 
describes 
the 
security 
arrangement 
at 
the 
security 
gate 
of 
the 
President’s 
residence an in 25.6 the seating arrangement and then at 
20 
25.6 onwards he says, 
“The seating arrangement was identical to that of 
the last meeting and then he quotes, Rajesh, today 
I will ask President Zuma to give us a broad 
overview 
on 
editorial 
policy 
and 
also 
some 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 60 of 64 
 
suggestions on who we should hire as presenters.  
We will hear what he has to say but we will only do 
what we think suits our vision, Ajay Gupta told me, 
that 
is 
Sundaram 
speaking, 
then 
he 
says 
in 
paragraph 25.7, as long as it was just a formality 
and we were not bound by what he was saying, I 
was happy to play the game they were playing with 
the President, I nodded. The video log or the 
channel ID for ANM7 had been made by a graphics 
designer in India and had reached us just a few 
10 
days before the meeting”. 
 
Then in – and then he says in paragraph 25.11, that 
is Sundaram, 
“Despite Athol’s constant reminders that we would 
only do what suits our vision, President Zuma’s 
directives on editorial policy puzzled me”, 
 
And then he quotes, we’re now quoting President 
Zuma, 
“I will be in Mpumalanga next week and I will meet 
people in the local communities and announce 
20 
measures for their welfare but I’m sure ENCA will 
not 
cover 
that. 
Their 
reporter 
will 
seek 
out 
opposition supporters and do a negative story on 
how the locals hate me and feel I have done nothing 
for them. Zuma said, Sir we will have a reporter and 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256

camera operator attached to you at all times”, 
 
That’s the part that is relevant. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because it – what Mr Sundaram says is 
that, at that meeting, the second meeting, which he said 
happened at the end of July, President Zuma, according to 
Mr Sundaram announced that he was going to be in 
Mpumalanga the following week and then Ms Pillay says, 
on the 9 t h of August 2013, which is the year we are talking 
about, she was assigned to cover the women’s day function 
10 
at Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga and Ms Pillay you 
confirmed 
that, 
indeed, 
President 
Zuma 
was 
in 
that 
function and he gave the key note address. 
MS PILLAY:   I confirm Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and did you write an article or send 
to SABC the coverage and was it shown on television? 
MS PILLAY:   Chair, with national days and the mandate 
that the public broadcaster has over a period of three 
hours of any particular national day, we do rolling coverage 
of the run-up to the speech post the speech and we do put 
20 
a pre-packaged story together for all prime time bulletins 
which is a shorter version of – in this case the women’s 
day event which includes snippets which we call bytes of 
the President’s key note address speech, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 62 of 64 
 
MS PILLAY:   And in this particular case, it would be the 
same mould that the SABC would have followed.  So, there 
would be interviews prior to the speech, post the speech 
as well as a condensed version of the day where the 
President would give his address for the prime-time 
bulletins of television bulletins of the SABC, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Chair, if the Chair finds it 
prudent, our lead investigator, Dr Buya has actually 
retracted that video from the SABC and we do have it in 
10 
our possession so if the Chair is interested in viewing the 
footage, we do have it at our disposal this morning.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no we won’t view it now but what 
you can do is look at Mr Sundaram’s affidavit or evidence 
and see whether he does indicate – he does say that in 
that second meeting, the President mentioned some of the 
things he would deal with at Mpumalanga and see whether 
those things were dealt with in his speech, so that’s what 
you can check.  I seem to remember that Sundaram says 
President Zuma said he would announce certain measures 
20 
blah, blah, blah so that needs to be checked and if they 
are there then something needs to be placed on record, if 
they are not there something needs to be placed on record 
but that can be done some other time. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Indeed, so Chair, I have viewed 
27 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 256 
 
Page 63 of 64 
 
the video it’s a roundabout a two-minute clip, it’s just 
verifying that the former President was, indeed, at the 
event in Mpumalanga and there’s a snippet of Ms Pillay 
covering the event itself. So, the contents of his speech as 
a whole, I have not seen but we could also just get that as 
well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you can ask for the full speech as 
well, look at what Mr Sundaram says, President Zuma said 
at that meeting with the Guptas, if anything about some of 
the issues he would address and see whether they are in 
10 
the speech or not. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   We’ll get to that, thank you 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright Ms Pillay thank you very 
much for coming to assist the Commission, we appreciate it 
very much, you are now excused. 
ADV RASIVHETSHELE:   Thank you Chair, that then 
concludes the witnesses for this morning. I’ve also just 
looked at my watch, and I completely forgot to indicate to 
Chair about the tea but…[intervenes]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that’s fine.  We are going to adjourn 
for the day, the Commission will sit tomorrow to hear the 
evidence of Mr Motseki, the HOD for the Department of 
Human Settlements in the Free State.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 28 AUGUST 2020
