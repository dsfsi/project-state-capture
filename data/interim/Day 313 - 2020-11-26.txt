PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 26 NOVEMBER 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Chaskalson, good 
morning everybody. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Good morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we ready? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  We are Chairperson.  There are 
two Counsel who should put themselves on record at the 
start of proceedings.  Mr Mpofu. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And Ms Goodman. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay let them do so.  I think they will 
come and do it at the podium there Mr Chaskalson.   
ADV MPOFU:  Good morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Mpofu it is good to see 
you. 
ADV MPOFU:  Always a pleasure to see you Chair as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU:  Chairperson I appear with Mr Naidoo my 
learned friend and junior for the witness Mr Ramosebudi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
20 
ADV GOODMAN:  Good morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Morning. 
ADV 
GOODMAN: 
 
I 
appear 
on 
behalf 
of 
Nedbank 
Chairperson I am instructed by Allen and Overy and I am 
accompanied by my attorney Ms Carrs. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 4 of 397 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes give me your name please? 
ADV GOODMAN:  Isabel Goodman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much. 
ADV GOODMAN:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes Mr Chaskalson. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Chair Mr Ramosebudi will be 
testifying today.  Mr Ramosebudi has not furnished a full 
witness statement but he has responded to a Rule 10.6 
Notice Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  You will find that 10.6 Notice 
which is dated 5 October 2020 at page – Flow of Funds 
Bundle 4 page 8.  And Mr Ramosebudi’s responses to the 
questions in that notice run from page 14 in this Flow of 
Funds Volume 4 Bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well did he comply with the 10.6 
Directive? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes Chair he furnished answers 
to questions.  We are not suggesting that Mr Ramosebudi 
was in contempt of the notice.  He did furnish answers.  
20 
They were slightly later than the anticipated return date 
and in some respects the answers were fairly cursory and 
anticipated answers that might come in these proceedings.  
But we do not want to make an issue of that at this stage 
Chair. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 5 of 397 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it does not appear to me that he 
complied with the 10.6 Directive that I issued.  The 10.6 
Directive directed him to deliver an affidavit or affirmed 
declaration.  What I have seen is neither an affidavit nor 
an affirmed declaration. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  That is – that is correct Chair.  
Maybe we can cure that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And there seems to be – he does not 
seem to have provided an explanation as to why he did not 
provide an affidavit or affirmed declaration when the 
10 
directive was quite clear.  That is number 1. 
2. There are areas where he was supposed to give 
information and he says he will give it at the hearing. 
He does not give it in the document in which he is 
supposed – was supposed to give it. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  That is true too Chair.  There are 
– there are a number of questions which he does not – or 
there are two questions really under Item 20 where he says 
information in this regard will be provided at the hearing.  I 
understand from Mr Mpofu that in certain – that in respect 
20 
of these questions the witness will be asserting a right 
against self-incrimination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you see if in the affidavit that is 
what he said then that – then one would understand.  It is 
just that he says I will provide information at the hearing 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 6 of 397 
 
but he is not providing it there.  That is not – that does not 
appear to be somebody who is asserting that right. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  That is true Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But of course I think Mr Mpofu might wish 
to say something on this before we proceed.  Let me hear. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What Mr Mpofu. 
ADV MPOFU:   My – Shall I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  In relation to the – the failure to 
10 
furnish an affidavit that I submit could be cured if Mr 
Ramosebudi confirms the contents of his statement under 
oath in front of you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No it could be cured but I am 
concerned about the fact that it is still not compliance. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know if you are directed to furnish an 
affidavit or a affirmed declaration that is what you furnish.  
You – and there – because there is a reason why the 
requirement is it should be an affidavit or an affirmed 
20 
declaration and not just a statement. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Indeed Chair I certainly am not 
going to argue to the contrary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes let me hear what Mr Mpofu may 
have to say.  Let them sanitise Mr Mpofu before you – Mr 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 7 of 397 
 
Mpofu. 
ADV MPOFU:   Yes Chair.  Chairperson well I was going to 
address you anyway Chair or just on the approach that we 
are going to take. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU:   So may I propose that I – so that I do not 
have to come up and down but that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can do everything. 
ADV MPOFU:    And then in the process then deal with the 
contents. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  Yes okay. 
ADV MPOFU:   Thank you.  Thank you Chair.  Chair well I 
will be very brief I wanted to just to put on record a few 
things. 
 
Mr Chaskalson and I have had some discussions 
and I am happy to say that we have at least we understand 
each other or found each other on certain broad areas. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I might be the [00:08:07] generally 
that certainly I am not – I think it is the same in other fore 
in which I have been involved but certainly when you have 
20 
been appearing here there has been lots of cooperation. 
ADV MPOFU:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From your side and so I am not surprised 
if you found each other broadly speaking. 
ADV MPOFU:   Thank you; thank you very much Chair I 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 8 of 397 
 
appreciate that.  So in a nutshell Chair as in the spirit that 
the Chair is alluding to one has always tried to find this 
balance between protecting the constitutional rights of the 
witness but assisting the commission and not being 
obstructive. 
 
 
So what we have done is to indicate to Mr 
Chaskalson there are three broad topics in respect of 
which 
we 
will 
assert 
the 
privilege 
or 
against 
self-
incrimination. 
 
Now Chair you and I have had this debate before. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU:  We know – we are fully aware that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.    
ADV MPOFU:   The privilege cannot be affected broadly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU:   Then it amounts to the right to silence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
ADV MPOFU:   We also are aware that it also cannot be 
asserted you know by broad topics but when I say broad 
topics I know that it must be asserted question by 
20 
question. But Mr Chaskalson and I will know which those 
areas are. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV MPOFU:   Then Chair we will of course we will also 
employ what I will call the Mogetsi Method which we 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 9 of 397 
 
employed before of just being here to police Mr Chaskalson 
to make sure that he does not stray.  We know it is very 
tempting Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I think that the experience that 
happened in the – during Mr Mogetsi’s evidence was really 
positive. 
ADV MPOFU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Experience it was cooperation, it was a 
commitment to assist the commission as much as possible.  
My recollection is that it was only or two… 
10 
ADV MPOFU:  Or two serious. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maximum three questions that he – he in 
respect of which he asserted his privilege but otherwise 
with your advice he was able to just give answers and give 
evidence ja. 
ADV MPOFU:  Yes.  Thank you Chair particularly in this 
case in fact the same as Mr Mogetsi if you remember Chair 
that there were areas where effectively he was educating 
all of us about how things work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
20 
ADV MPOFU: So Mr Ramosebudi will do the same.  I know 
that Mr Chaskalson wants to ask him certain technical 
questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MPOFU:   Because the area where he works is very 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 10 of 397 
 
technical just so that we are all on the same page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV MPOFU:   And we will be happy to do deal with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MPOFU:   There may of course be areas where there 
is a difference of opinion, whether the line has been 
crossed and then the Chair will just give a ruling. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU:   If that happens. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine. 
10 
ADV MPOFU:   Yes.  Now Chair I also wanted to indicate 
up front but I – at some stage I will sneak out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU:   I will leave Mr Naidoo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MPOFU:   To take over. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MPOFU:   So I do not want the Chair to send the 
police on me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you have got to make sure. 
20 
ADV MPOFU:   You never know at this stage.  So apart 
from that Chair to address the concerns that the Chair has 
raised 
let 
me 
just 
indicate 
that 
the 
10.6 
response 
happened before Mr Naidoo and I were involved in this 
matter. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 11 of 397 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MPOFU:   We – we do not want to make any excuses.  
We accept Chair that strictly speaking it does not comply 
with the obvious requirement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU:   To have it done under oath. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV MPOFU:   So there are two issues that the Chair has 
raised.  The first one about it being done under oath we – I 
was going to propose what Mr Chaskalson has proposed. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MPOFU:   Just for the sake of progress. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV 
MPOFU: 
 
 
That 
can 
be 
cured 
by 
simply 
Mr 
Ramosebudi confirming his statement under oath. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MPOFU:   Now here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, Yes. 
ADV MPOFU:   As far as the second issue Chair is 
concerned which is the – the failure to answer certain 
20 
questions.  Indeed the Chair is quite correct.  What really 
should have been indicated there even at that stage was 
that he will be asserting his right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MPOFU:   But we would really humbly ask the Chair to 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 12 of 397 
 
condone such and compliance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU:   On the understanding that the statement 
will be confirmed under oath. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU:   And number 2 wherever it is vague it really 
should have said that he will be asserting his Section 35 
rights. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MPOFU:   Thank you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is alright.  No thank you Mr 
Mpofu. 
ADV MPOFU:   Thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much ja.  Mr Mpofu I 
always say that it is – it is always good to be with 
experienced lawyers who know what their case is.  They 
focus on the real case and not on other things.  Thank you.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Thank you Chair.  We – I need to 
ask you for guidance Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Because there is just the Rule 
10.6 Notice and a response for the purposes of numbering 
annexures there is not a statement with affidavits attached.  
But there is a large bundle of documents that the 
commission 
has 
prepared 
for 
the 
questioning 
of 
Mr 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 13 of 397 
 
Ramosebudi.  We will be referring to very, very many of 
those documents and might I suggest that we give the 
bundle an annexure number with pagination references in 
the bundle rather than making each new document an 
annexure number because there will literally be hundreds 
that we may traverse in the course of today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think what we should do is  
1. Yes the file should be given a bundle number.   
That is one which you say and I think at some stage it 
need not be now I think at some stage there must be a 
10 
process of formally admitting those documents.  Now you 
say there are lots of them but once they have been 
identified and they can be marked.  They can be given the 
exhibit number that would be used outside of this process.  
But at a certain stage you can come back and say the 
documents as they appear from page whatever – whatever 
you ask that they be admitted – each of them be admitted 
and given the exhibit number that you would allocated and 
I can just take five minutes to do that.  How is that? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Chair the one – my one concern 
20 
with that is that when we come – when you come back to 
read the record it may be difficult to correlate references in 
today’s testimony with what the exhibit numbers will 
subsequently turn out to be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before we give the exhibit numbers 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 14 of 397 
 
we would have used page numbers. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it not? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And even if the exhibit numbers are there 
as long as everyone remembers what page they appear 
that should be fine is it not? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Indeed.  If that file VVF – sorry 
FOF 4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Remains in your possession in 
the form that it currently sits. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Then you will be able to identify 
which documents [speaking over one another]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  The pagination would remain. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As it is but I think as a formality it is 
important to admit them at a certain stage and then give 
them exhibit numbers.  But anyone wishing to refer to them 
20 
does not have to say exhibit number so and so.  If they say 
such a document appears on page so and so that is still 
good enough. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay alright. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 15 of 397 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  But then I think what we can do 
immediately in relation to exhibit numbers is introduce the 
2 Rule 10.6 notices and the response as exhibits VV4.1, 
VV4.2 and VV4.3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes before we do that let us just confirm 
the file that you will be using is Flow of Funds Bundle 4? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Indeed and only that file today. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Ja 
okay. 
 And 
are 
there 
1 
10.6 
Directives? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  The first… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or are they the same one? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  No there are two Chair.  The first 
is requiring Mr Ramosebudi’s presence today to testify. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  That is the document at page 3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Which I would ask to be VV4.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The first Chairperson’s Directive in terms 
of Regulation 10.6 starting at page 3 is admitted as Exhibit 
4 – VV4.1 is that right? 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  VV4 – VV4.1  We are on our VV – 
VV. 
CHAIRPERSON:  VV.  Ja okay.  VV4.1.  If you put VV 
together it could be W.  Okay so that is the first one and 
the second one will be… 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 16 of 397 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  At page 8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Exhibit VV4.2.  Is that right? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so the second directive in terms of 
Regulation 10.6 starting at page 8 will be admitted as 
Exhibit VV4.2.  Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And then Mr Ramosebudi’s 
response to the second 10.6 which appears at page – from 
page 14 can be VV4.3 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Ramosebudi’s response to the 10.6 
10 
Directive starting at page 14 is admitted as Exhibit VV4.3.  
Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Thank you Chair.  At this point I 
think we are good to begin. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Thank you.  You may 
proceed. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I think Mr Ramosebudi needs to 
be sworn in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes.  Will you please administer the 
oath or affirmation. 
20 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  Phetolo Ramosebudi. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
I 
think 
you 
must 
just 
raise 
the 
microphone and then try and speak up a bit. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 17 of 397 
 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  Phetolo Ramosebudi. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  Ja. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give 
will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the 
truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help 
10 
me God. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Yes you may proceed Mr 
Chaskalson. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Thank you Chair.  Good morning 
Mr Ramosebudi. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  Good morning. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Mr Ramosebudi I first just want 
to cure the problem with the statement that we have 
discussed earlier and can I ask you to turn first of all to 
20 
page 8 of that file in front of you.  The pages I will be 
using are the page numbers are the black ones on the left 
hand side and on the top left and you will see they say 
FOF-04- and then there is a number.  It is the number after 
FOF-04 that I will be referring to today.  Do you recognise 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 18 of 397 
 
the document on page 8? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  Yes I do. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And that was a Notice in terms of 
Regulation 10.6 of this commission that was served on you 
and if you go down to page 13 you will see that it is dated 
5 October 2020. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  Yes I do. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And will you confirm that it was 
served on you? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  Come again. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  You had – you did receive this 
notice in – on 5 October or shortly thereafter? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  Yes.  Yes I did. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And you furnished a response to 
it which starts at page 14. Will you confirm that is the 
case? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  Yes I did. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And the document that runs from 
pages 14 to 19 is your response which is dated 7 
November 2020.  Will you confirm that the contents of that 
20 
document are correct? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  Yes I can confirm they are correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Thank you.  Mr Ramosebudi in 
that statement you touch very briefly on your history in the 
public sector.  Can you just describe to the Chairperson 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 19 of 397 
 
your career in – well from the beginning until the point at 
which you left Transnet? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  Thank you Chairperson.  My career 
started in 1992 when I was an academia with the Medical 
Investments Southern Africa which then – when I was then 
academia I did my MBA with University of Pretoria after 
which then I went to work for the Nedcor Group in Syfrets 
Asset Management.  Thereafter then I went into stock 
broking.  From stock broking I went to National Treasury.  
That is when I started working in the public sector. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And can you give a date to the 
Chair? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  The – I started working in National 
Treasury 
in 
1990 
– 
1998 
I 
think 
it 
is 
around 
August/September 1998 which then I left in 1999 April. 
 
Subsequent to that I went back into the private 
sector but then I think in late 1999 I went to work for 
Development Bank of Southern Africa in the Treasury 
function. 
 
From then then I started working in the public 
20 
sector from DVSA, NHFC, Transnet, ACSA, South African 
Airways and back then again to Transnet. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And just to get the chronology Mr 
Ramosebudi you deal with this at paragraph 226 of your 
statement.  You were at the Development Bank from 1999 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 20 of 397 
 
to 2002.  Is that correct? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  The National Housing Finance 
Corporation that was NHFC 2002 to around 2006.  ACSA 
2007 to 2011.  SAA 2012 to February 2015 and Transnet 
2015 to 2018 and what I have skipped out there is that you 
were Deputy Treasurer of Transnet back from 2006 to May 
2007. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  That is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  At ACSA, SAA and Transnet you 
10 
were treasurer, is that correct? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  At ACSA yes I was the treasurer and 
SAA I was a treasurer. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And Transnet from 2015 to 2018? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  I was a treasurer. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes.  Then at page 16 of your 
statement you deal with a range of entities with which you 
have a relationship or in which you have an interest or 
your family members have an interest.  Can I start with the 
first entity which is at [vii] on page 16 Risk Stats 
20 
Consulting.  Can you tell the Chair what Risk Stats 
Consulting is and what interest if any you had in it? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  You are referring to page 16 on my 
side – okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Top left hand side. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 21 of 397 
 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  Okay.  Risk Stats was a trading 
company of one of my companies called Risk Maths. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So it was a subsidiary – is it a – 
it is a separate entity that was a subsidiary of Risk Maths. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  No. It was a trading name for Risk 
Maths. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  A trading name.  So it is not a 
company in its own right?  Mr Ramosebudi? 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is… 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  Ja we can Risk Maths there was a 
10 
number trading names for – which we can call it subsidiary 
from that aspect. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So Risk Stats is not actually an 
entity in its own right but it merely a trade name that was… 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  In Risk Maths. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Okay.  And your interest Risk 
Maths?  What was – what was or is your interest in Risk 
Maths?

shareholder of that company.

Page 22 of 397 
 
just one younger brother? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  No I have got a number of siblings. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Okay which brother is the brother 
with the interest in Ka Ditlou Health Services? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  The Psychology. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Psychology Ramosebudi?  Rams 
Capital CC. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  That is my company. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And is it again 100% interest? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  Ja 100% interest for myself. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And Azana -  it is Azana not 
Azania? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  Azana. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Azana Capital Markets which 
trades as Venus Liquor Store. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  Ja it was one of my company. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And when you said was one of 
your companies are you saying at one stage you had a 
100% interest in it? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  Yes. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And when did you … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry was that answer yes?  Was your 
answer yes I did not hear? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  Yes – I said yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 23 of 397 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And when did you cease to have 
100% interest in Azana? 
MR 
RAMOSEBUDI: 
 
No 
it 
got 
registered 
I 
cannot 
remember. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Until de-registration it was your 
company? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry I did not hear the answer.  So you 
have to try and speak up Mr Ramosebudi.  I think Mr 
Chaskalson asked you whether until it was de-registered it 
10 
was your company. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  I said yes.  I said yes I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay I did not hear that answer.  
Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Then Mr Ramosebudi before we 
get into any details relating to past events because we are 
going to be talking about interest swaps and currency 
hedges 
I 
thought 
we 
might 
take 
advantage of 
your 
expertise just to explain what we are talking about here.  
So could you briefly describe to the Chair what an interest 
20 
swap is? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Thank you, Chairperson.  An interest 
swap, is exactly as the name means.  It means two things.  
One, it is an interest rate.  The other two is – the second one 
is a swap.  A swop has different meaning.  You are 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 24 of 397 
 
exchanging things.   
 
So in an interest rate swap, one party could be having a 
fixed interest rate.  The other party could be having a 
variable interest rate.   
 
In the industry, they call it a floating rate interest rate.  
So one particular – if you want to wish to exchange the 
swap, the fixed one for a floating one.  And that is who it 
happens in the market. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So I have an overdraft at my bank 
which has a variable rate at prime and I want to plan for the 
10 
future and I want to know exactly what I am going to be 
owing my bank on my overdraft on a fixed amount.   
 
So I want someone who is willing to lend the money that 
I am going to owe the bank at a fixed rate to me, so they will 
give me their fixed interest rate and in return, that assume, 
the variable interest rate that I owe the bank. 
 
And now my liability is to pay a fixed interest, not a 
variable interest rate.  That is, obviously, for individuals, 
household expenses.  It is a company issue.  But is that 
broadly what we are talking about? 
20 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   That is exactly what it is Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Basically, you could be talking of two, 
shall I call them regimes, interest regime.  The one interest 
regime is a fixed rate interest.  The other one is a variable 
one.  And you could be having a particular regime, interest 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 25 of 397 
 
regime for a certain period and you want to change that and 
move to the other interest of regime.  Basically, that is what 
it is. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   That is what it is Chairperson 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And sometimes you refer or 
sometimes one sees reference being made to hedging 
interest exposure.  Would that be a situation where you have 
a certain rate interest exposure where you would want to 
swap up and down or you have variable interest rate 
10 
exposure that you want to turn into a fix one and you enter 
into a swap.  Would that be a hedge of your variable 
exposure? 
MR 
RAMOSEBUDI: 
 
 
That 
is 
true 
Mr Chaskalson.  
Chairperson, the hedging in the process, it means protecting 
ourselves.  It is a word that is used in the market or in the 
financial market in the sector.  Hedging, you are protecting 
yourself. 
 
You can be protecting yourself from a volatile interest 
rate environment or you can be protecting yourself from a 
20 
volatile inflation, you know, market. 
 
So, you either use any of those two instruments, the 
fixed one or the other one.  And it depends in which position 
you are sitting which you want to protect. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And we will also be encountering 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 26 of 397 
 
currency hedging.  Can you explain to the Chair what a 
currency hedge is? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson, the – a currency hedge or 
a protection from the currency exposure or a volatility of the 
exchange rate is precisely using the cost currency interest 
rate swaps or forward interest rate swaps that you can use 
to protect the position that you are sitting in. 
 
If you happen to be going to buy and equipment outside 
the country which is priced in a currency that is not South 
African Rand.  So you need to make sure that you protect 
10 
yourself over the volatilities of that...  You are exempted(?) 
against those ...[indistinct]  
[Speaker is not clear.] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And could you explain to the Chair 
what sort of devices you would use?  Let us talk about 
Transnet buying locomotives.  Assume Transnet wants to buy 
locomotives that are going to be Dollar denominated and 
some of them are going to be delivered in five years’ time at 
a Dollar price.   
 
What sort of hedging mechanisms would Transnet be 
20 
able to adopt to make sure that it knows how much it is 
going to pay in Rands? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   In that case and in most of the 
institutions that I have come across in my working life.  The 
institutions will use for a cost currency swaps to hedge the 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 27 of 397 
 
expected purchase or delivery of an equipment that is 
coming from a foreign country.  And that is how most of 
these institutions are using it and then...  I think Transnet 
have been using it.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So cross-currency swap would be, 
you go to a bank and you say:  Here is a schedule of Dollar 
payments that I want to receive from you and what is the 
corresponding schedule of Rand payments that I have to 
make to you?  Is that correct? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Simplistically, yes Chairperson.  That is 
10 
what it is.  But you need to work out what is an average rate 
applicable to those, you know, cash flows so that at Day 1 
today, you are not in a lost position or in a gaining position 
when you transact that position. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But you will be doing is, you will 
be agreeing over the next five years on such and such a 
date, you will transfer a million Dollars to me and I will pay 
back to you so many Rands.  Or it may not be on the same 
date.   
 
This is the schedule of the Rand payments I will be 
20 
making on these dates.  This is a schedule of Dollar 
payments, you will be making to me on those dates. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson that is true.  So the 
intermediate cash flows will be exchange during the course 
of the contract itself.  At the end of the contract you are 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 28 of 397 
 
changing it back into your currency.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you, Mr Ramosebudi.  Can 
we now start looking at some of the details of your career as 
Treasurer and can we start with ACSA?  And the first 
document I want to take you to, it is a document that 
appears at page 20.  So quickly go to page 20 again, on the 
top left-hand the black number.   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And, do you recognise that 
document? 
10 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   No, I do not recognise it. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay.  Well, it looks like an 
invoice 
issued 
by 
Regiments 
Capital 
to 
ACSA 
on 
25 September 2009.  I think you might be on the wrong page 
Mr Ramosebudi.  Top left, page 20. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, whenever Mr Chaskalson refers you 
to page numbers, it will be the black numbers on the top left 
corner of each page.  So you can ignore the red numbers. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Page 20.  Yes, it is an invoice.  I 
cannot remember this invoice.  Yes. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes.  But what it reflects is that 
Regiments is invoicing ACSA.  Is that correct? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   True. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And in the bottom left, just above 
payment details, there is a note:   
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 29 of 397 
 
“Total agreed outstanding fee per Phase 4 as per 
mandate.  And that is R 2.734 million.  50% of 
outstanding funding invoice final billing 603610.” 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Now it talks about a mandate.  
Was Regiments Capital engaged by ACSA at that stage? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   As the document says.  So it means 
there was a mandate, you know, between ACSA and 
Regiments. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But I am asking you.  Do you 
10 
recall that ACSA had engaged Regiments?  And if we go up 
to the heading in relation to a funding plan.  It is what the 
invoice is heading.  Had ACSA engaged Regiments in 
relation to a funding plan? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   ACSA did work on the ACSA Funding 
Plan but I have never seen the mandate but I heard that 
there is a mandate. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, I did not hear your answer. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   ACSA worked on the Funding Mandate 
– on the Funding Mandate ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   ACSA or Regiments? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Regiments worked on the ACSA 
Funding Mandate. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   But I never had a copy myself. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 30 of 397 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So you have never seen this 
invoice? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   No.  Not – no, I am not saying.  I 
cannot remember the invoice but I have never seen the 
mandate. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Oh, okay. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   You are reading the total agreed 
outstanding fees as per Phase 4 as per mandate. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, together with the heading of 
the invoice just below the address of ACSA where it says 
10 
ACSA Funding Plan Phase 4.  Are you aware of what this 
Funding Plan was and what role Regiments played in it? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes, I am aware. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And can you tell the Chair? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   In 2008 sometime, Regiments were 
brought in to work on the Funding Mandate for Airports 
Company South Africa.  And through that mandate, the 
advice on a number of funding structure, you know, within 
the mandate that we are referring to here. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And did they get that appointment 
20 
pursuant to a tender? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson, as I said.  That is why I 
said that I have never seen the mandate.  So the – they 
came in and as I know, they are working through a mandate 
but I have never seen the mandate. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 31 of 397 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   My question was slightly different.  
Not whether you have seen the mandate but whether you are 
aware whether it was preceded by a tender process? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   With my recollections, you know, with 
this particular company, Regiments.  When I came in 2008 
Chairperson, I think they were there in 2007 on a similar 
mandates of a funding plan. 
 
So whether during that time they went through a 
process, I do not know.  I was not working for ACSA at the 
time. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So you do not know whether there 
was any procurement process involving competitive bids or 
anything in relation to the Regiments mandate? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I do not know.  I do not know. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I take you to this invoice 
again?  And it says: 
“Total agreed outstanding fee per Phase 4 as per 
mandate and R 2.734 million.  That suggests it was 
a fixed fee for the mandate that Regiments was 
performing at ACSA.” 
20 
 
Would you agree with that? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I cannot answer that.  I do not know.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   It is a ...[intervenes]  
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I really do not know. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   It says agreed outstanding fee per 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 32 of 397 
 
Phase 4 as per mandate. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I have not seen the contract with 
Regiments.  So I cannot say if there was a fixed fee or not. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay.  Do – could you describe to 
the Chair what sort of work Regiments performed pursuant to 
this mandate when you find them at ACSA when you arrived? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   When I was...  Chairperson, when I was 
at ACSA, they developed the Funding Plan, you know.  The 
Funding Plan, it is a piece of information within the PFMA 
that is a required, you know, that the board needs to 
10 
approve, send to the shareholder or the Minister of Finance 
of National Treasury. 
 
And from that perspective, the institution at the time, 
ACSA then could go out to raise any funding that it requires 
as per the funding in our plan that is to develop. 
 
So that is when the Funding Plan came through and the 
how Regiments have been implementing the Funding Plan. 
 
Where they have raised the money, I cannot remember a 
lot of – a number of those institutions but they have raised 
some money for ACSA. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So was Regiments’ mandate just 
to design the Funding Plan or actually then to go out and 
raise money in terms of the Funding Plan? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson, through yourself, I am do 
not want to respond in terms of whether the mandate 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 33 of 397 
 
because I have not seen that.  But what I have seen 
Regiments doing is, they have developed a Funding Plan.  
They have actually put the Funding Plan in action to raise 
the money that has been determined for the Funding Plan’s 
perspective. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So they did both.  You just do not 
know which – whether both or one or the other form part of 
this particular mandate? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Ja, they executive the Funding Plan. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   If they were executing the Funding 
10 
Plan and it was not part of that mandate, would there have 
be any procurement process necessary for them to go 
through to executive the Funding Plan? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson, I am sorry to respond to 
that.  Like, I do not know because I do not know the details 
of the mandate, whether it was to develop the Funding Plan 
and execute it or whether it was to develop the Funding Plan 
and then go out to the market to raise funding.  That I have 
got no information Chair.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So you do not know what the 
20 
mandate was? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   No. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I then take you to the next 
document which is, on its face, an email from someone 
called Mario Viznenza(?).  mariov@nedbank.co.za.  It is 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 34 of 397 
 
dated 1 October 2009 and it is addressed to Eric Wood, cc 
Moss Brinkman and Elize Brits.  Can I first ask you?  Do you 
know who Mario Viznenza is? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Mario Viznenza is – I am not sure if he 
is still but was one of the traders in Nedbank. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay.  Eric Wood? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Eric Wood is one of - was or is – was 
one of the directors of Regiments. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Moss Brinkman?  Brickman, not 
Brinkman.   
10 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   He is also one of the traders at 
Nedbank. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And Elize Brits. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I do not know that one.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Right.  The heading is ACSA 
Interest Rates Swaps.  And the email reads: 
“Hi, Eric.  Here are the current indicative rates on 
these transactions, bearing in mind the strategy are 
staggering the trades over a few days.” 
 
And then some rates are set out.  Am I correct that what 
20 
this would be is an email sent from Nedbank to Eric Wood on 
– who is acting for – they are acting in his capacity as 
Regiments Implementing ACSA Funding Plan and looking for 
funding for ACSA.  Is that the context in which this email 
would have been sent? 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 35 of 397 
 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   This is what I am seeing, yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So there is then a description of 
what the indicative rates are, R 1.7 billion swaps and the 
details are set out.  R 250 million and the swap and the 
details are set out. 
 
And then there is a line that I want you to comment on.  
Mr Viznenza says: 
“We leave it up to you to include a margin for us to 
share on the usual 50/50 agreement.” 
 
Is this Mr Viznenza saying to Mr Wood:  Here are our 
10 
terms for the swap.  You add in a margin.  In other words, 
increase the amount that ACSA is going to pay.  And we will 
share that on a 50/50 basis. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Is that how you would understand 
it as a person in finance? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes, I see – I read it that way, yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   You do read it that way? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   H’m. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Were you aware that Mr Wood and 
20 
Nedbank were doing this 50/50 agreement at the expense of 
ACSA? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   No, Chair I was not aware of that. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well, appear to have been doing 
it.  We do not know whether they did do it.  So you were not 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 36 of 397 
 
aware that Mr Wood and Nedbank appeared to have been 
including margins for them to share on a 50/50 agreement at 
the expense of ACSA? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   No, I was not aware. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I take you to the next 
document which is at page 22?  It is four days later.  Another 
email from Mr Viznenza to Erich Wood, then copies to 
Mr Brickman.  It says: 
“Fee calculations on ACSA swaps.  Regiments fee. 
Hi, Eric.  I have attached the spreadsheet with the 
10 
calculation of the fee due to Regiments on the two 
ACSA swaps dealt last week.” 
 
You will recall the previous email had two.  R 1.75 billion 
and a two hundred – I think it was R 250 million. 
“Yu will see that the calculation has been done on 
the same basis as the previous ACSA transaction.” 
 
Do you know what the previous ACSA transaction was 
that he is referring to here? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   No.  Actually, I do not even know who is 
the transaction that are referring to here. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, Mr Ramosebudi.  Can I ask 
that you speak a little bit closer to your microphone  
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   No, I am saying ...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   ... because it is difficult to hear 
your answers. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 37 of 397 
 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I am not sure whose transaction here 
they are referring to here. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We...  Thank you.  That is all I 
wanted to ask you.  The 10 BP, that is ten basis points.   
“Due to Regiments over the life of the transactions 
equates to a BP  That that is present value amount 
of R 11 548 551,00. 
On the invoice to Nedbank, please include a line 
confirming that you agree to Nedbank clause back a 
portion of the fee should the transaction to ACSA 
10 
terminate early, as well as confirming that ACSA is 
aware that a fee is being paid by Nedbank to 
Regiments on these transactions. 
Let me know if you any queries.” 
 
So can I take it step-by-step? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   The ten basis points due to 
Regiments over the life of the transactions, equals a present 
value amount of R 11 548 551,00.  Is he saying there that:  If 
we increase the interest that ACSA is going to pay to 
20 
Nedbank by ten basis points over the life of the transaction?   
 
And we looked at all those values and take a present 
value.  That will equate to R 11 548 551,00.  Is that what he 
is saying? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   That is what I see – I read here. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 38 of 397 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes.  And if we read this with his 
previous 50/50 agreement email from a few days previously, 
that would suggest that in addition to the R 11 million that 
Regiments is going to receive at the expense of ACSA on 
this transaction, Nedbank will be receiving a similar amount 
at the expense of ACSA.  Would you agree with that? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   If they are applying the same basis, 
then I will say but if – I do not know which basis they are 
applying.  [Indistinct] is going to reapplying on ...[indistinct]  
[Speaker is not clear.] 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes.  I must – I am saying, 
assuming they are doing this 50/50 basis. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Assumptions is very difficult to 
...[indistinct]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, we will deal with the 
difficulties.  You just have to answer my questions on the 
basis of an assumption and you – then the difficulties are 
mine, not yours.   
 
So on the basis of my assumption, would Nedbank also 
be getting the same fee at the expense of ACSA? 
20 
MR 
RAMOSEBUDI: 
 
 
On 
the 
basis 
of 
assumption 
Mr Chaskalson. 
 
Yes, 
Chairperson. 
 
But 
maybe 
the 
arrangement could be on a different asset, you know 
...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes.  No, no ...[intervenes]  
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 39 of 397 
 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   That is why I do not want to make an 
assumption. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Ja, but I will ask a lot of questions 
on the basis of assumptions.  I would ask you to take those 
assumptions as given.  Obviously, you cannot be blamed if 
the assumptions turn out be false later.  I will be blamed. 
 
Then the next line. 
“On the invoice to Nedbank, please include a line 
confirming you agree to Nedbank clause back the 
portion of the fee should the transaction to ACSA 
10 
terminate early, as well as confirming that ACSA is 
aware that a fee is being paid by Nedbank to 
Regiments on these transactions.” 
 
Let us take the first part of that sentence.   
“Please include a line confirming you agree to 
Nedbank clause back the portion of the fee should 
the transaction to ACSA terminate early...” 
 
Is he saying there, if this – your fees have been 
calculated on a basis that this transaction runs to term, that 
ten basis points, BP, is ten basis points of the whole life of 
20 
the transaction? 
 
But if ACSA – and we are going to pay back to you now 
– but if ACSA terminate mid-way through this transaction, we 
are going to be out of pocket because we would have paid 
you the R 11 million but we will not be getting it back from 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 40 of 397 
 
ACSA. 
 
So we need a clause from you saying that if that 
happens, we get back part of your fee.  Is that what he is 
saying? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes, that is true. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes.  Then he says: 
“We want a line confirming that ACSA is aware that 
a fee is being paid by Nedbank to Regiments on 
these transactions.   
So we want a line on your invoice, saying that ACSA 
10 
is aware that this fee is being paid....” 
 
Can I ask you to go to the next page which is an invoice 
dated – sorry page 23.  And there we see an invoice from 
Regiments to Nedbank. 
 
It is invoice Ned409 addressed to Ms Moss Brickman at 
Nedbank.  And you see underneath – the invoice is for 
R 11 548 000,00 plus VAT, giving R 13 165 348,00. 
 
And as I understand it, that is the amount that ACSA will 
be paying back over the life of the swap transaction with 
Nedbank.  Is that correct? 
20 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes, as the calculation is mentioned 
here. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes.  And it says: 
“Origination and facilitation of R 2 billion interest 
rates swap between Nedbank Capital and ACSA.  
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 41 of 397 
 
The 
service 
amount 
was 
determined 
as 
per 
agreement with Nedbank Capital. 
This issue is issued under the introduction of 
derivative 
transactions 
agreement 
between 
Regiments and Nedbank, dated 30 June 2009. 
Regiments Capital (Pty) Ltd has informed its client 
that it is earning a fee for the facilitation of the 
above transaction.” 
 
Did Regiments inform ACSA that it was earning a fee 
from – on this basis on the transaction?  Were you aware 
10 
that Regiments was going to be paid R 13 million by ACSA – 
by Nedbank and that ACSA would have to pay that back to 
Nedbank over the life of the swap? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Ja, I think I know that they will be 
earning a fee but I am not sure if there was communication 
around it. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well...  Sorry, let us take that 
slowly.  You think you know that they were going to be 
earning a fee? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Ja. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Did you know what the fee was? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I would not have known because I 
cannot remember if there was a written confirmation around 
it.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So you might not have known that 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 42 of 397 
 
the fee was R 13.165 million? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But ACSA was going to have to 
pay that amount back to Nedbank.  Regiments would not 
have to pay that.   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I would not have known the quantum 
but I would have known that ACSA would pay a fee for 
structuring of the swap.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But that fee could have been one 
million, it would have been 13 million, it could have been 
10 
50 million.  Would you not have taken steps to find out how 
much you were committing your organisation to pay back? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   True.  But as I say, the financial 
instruments, they were your price(?) in.  You will look at the 
fair value.   The fair value is a composted interest rate that 
is given for a counterparty, like in this case, ACSA to pay. 
 
So you need to then go back and check, you know, from 
a pricing point of view, whether this rate that you are getting 
relatively true(?).   
 
The other instruments that you have and the other 
20 
instruments that you have benchmarked, have used yourself, 
is it too high or not. 
 
And then from that perspective, then you can make a 
determination.  So you will look at the composing, you do not 
look at the component. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 43 of 397 
 
[Speaker is not clear.] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No, I hear what you are saying but 
let us go back to procurement processes.  You said earlier 
that you were not aware what the mandate of Regiments 
was.  Is that correct? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So it is possible that that original 
mandate ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, hang on.  Mr Ramosebudi, when 
you nod, that will not be on the record.  So just articulate 
10 
your answer and say yes, if the answer is.  No, if the answer 
is no.  Ja.  I think you must repeat that question 
Mr Chaskalson. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr Ramosebudi, you said earlier 
that you were not aware of what Regiments’ mandate under 
the Funding Plan was.  It might have just been to design the 
plan.  It might also have been to raise money in terms of the 
plan.   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   True. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you.  Now, if it was just to 
20 
design the plan, then there was no existing mandate that 
covered Regiments’ taking this fee at ACSA’s expense via 
Nedbank for placing – for raising this money from Nedbank.  
You – would you accept that? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   [No audible reply]  
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 44 of 397 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   There are one or two possibilities.  
Let me take a step back.  There are one or two possibilities.  
Either the mandate did cover raising funds or it just covered 
designing the plan but not raising funds.  You will agree to 
that? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson, I think Mr Chaskalson is 
making very simple.  I said, I have never seen that mandate, 
what it entails.  And in this case, with respect, we are talking 
only invoice that was dealing with Funding Plan.   
 
So from that perspective, I said I do not know whether it 
10 
was the developing of Funding Plan and the execution(?) of 
the Funding Plan.   
 
But the mandate could have covered a number of other 
issues including interest rate swap.  So which we did not 
discuss at that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but I think Mr Chaskalson’s question 
is aimed at establishing your understanding of the effect or 
implications of a certain mandate, such as, or lawyers. 
 
If you are a lawyer, I instruct you to defend me in a 
criminal case at the magistrate’s court.  That does not 
20 
necessarily mean, if you lose, I am convicted. 
 
I want you to appeal, unless I ask you to object.  
Give you that mandate.  Because I might think you are the 
one who did not do your job.  So I must get – so what he is 
trying to establish is what would be your understanding of 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 45 of 397 
 
what a particular mandate would mean.  If he had this type 
of mandate would it mean he could also do a, b, c, d or 
could it mean he could not do that unless he had that other 
mandate?  That is what I think he is seeking to establish.  
Maybe, Mr Chaskalson, you can then take it from there. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you.  Thank you, Chair.  
Let us assume that the – and again, it is an assumption 
that I am going to make, okay?  Let us assume that the 
original mandate included raising funds.  Make that 
assumption. 
10 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   And risk management. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And...? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Risk management. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And risk management.  And risk 
management and designing the plan, it was an all-
embracing one.  If it did, we would expect to find in that 
original mandate payment terms for Regiments, would we 
not?  This is what you will get paid for doing the risk 
management and the fund plan, this is how we will 
reimburse you when you raise funds.  Would that not 
20 
normally be what we would expect in the public sector? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Probably so. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So then if Regiments went off to 
Nedbank and said to Nedbank we are raising money in 
terms of our – we are raising money for ACSA, what can 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 46 of 397 
 
you give us and Nedbank said well, we can do this swap 
for 1.75 million and this one for 250 million, the terms of 
the original mandate would determine what Regiments fee 
would be vis-à-vis ACSA, is that not correct? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   If it is exclusively stated so in the 
mandate that should be – that is the case. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, if it was covered by the 
mandate.  Now if the mandate did not cover raising funds 
then Regiments would not have had the authority of ACSA 
to go to Nedbank to raise funds for ACSA and Nedbank 
10 
would not have been able to charge a fee to ACSA for 
raising those funds.  If somebody comes and says to Mr 
Mpofu I understand you want to go, cheers, you can leave 
now, I will look after Mr Ramosebudi for the rest of the day 
and then presents you with a bill at the end of the day, are 
you going to pay that bill? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   No. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So if Regiments mandate did not 
include the raising of funds and they took it upon 
themselves just to raise funds, was ACSA obliged to pay 
20 
them anything? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   It is not. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And so either ACSA had no 
obligation to pay them or ACSA would have had an 
obligation to pay them but that obligation would have been 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 47 of 397 
 
set out in a mandate of which you were not aware, is that 
correct? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Did you make any enquiries in 
relation to Regiments’ fee when they came back to you and 
said we have done this deal with Nedbank, we will be 
taking a fee for ourselves? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   That enquiry I would have made if I 
had made an appointment of Regiments and then I would 
have to check the payments against the mandate itself.  So 
10 
in this case the appointments which preceded my time 
could not be questioned. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes but I mean – you say you 
were aware that Nedbank was taking a fee but, as I 
understand your testimony now, you were not really aware 
whether they were entitled to take a fee.  They may have 
been, they may not have been, you did not know. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Did anybody else at ACSA know 
that Regiments were taking a fee?  
20 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   The signatures for the settlement of 
money should have known that. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, Mr Mpofu has said 
something. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Something he said, oh. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 48 of 397 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   If I – my question was did 
anybody else at ACSA know whether Regiments was taking 
a fee?  If I said Nedbank instead of ACSA that was an 
error.  So my question is did anybody else at ACSA know 
whether Regiments was taking a fee on this transaction 
between ACSA and Nedbank? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Ja, I would guess that those that 
authorised the appointment of Regiments to come and 
assist on this funding plan, through that mandate they 
know that they did not come to [inaudible – speaking 
10 
simultaneously] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I am not asking what you 
assumed, I am asking what you knew.  Did you know that 
anybody else at ACSA knew that Regiments was taking 
a…? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes, yes, yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Who else at ACSA knew that 
Regiments was taking...? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I am sure the FD knew that Regiments 
was taking a fee. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And who was that FD? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   At the time it was Priscilla Mabelane.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Priscilla Mabelane.  And you 
knew that she knew that Regiments was going to take a fee 
on this transactions. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 49 of 397 
 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   The …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   In other words, you knew as opposed to 
you assuming that she knew. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I am assuming that she knew because 
she had made an appointment on Regiments to come and 
execute the funding plan. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I think Mr Chaskalson is – well, his 
question might be a more nuanced one, maybe directed 
towards the end rather than the beginning when they were 
appointed, that whether she knew in the end that they were 
10 
taking this fee but he wants to know whether you knew that 
person that you have mentioned knew that or whether – he 
is not asking whether you assumed, he just wants to know 
what you knew. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Mr Chaskalson, thorough yourself, 
Chairperson, I think it is a common cause that when you 
appoint somebody to do something that they would be 
remunerated.   So that is my assumption.  Whether she 
knows that that was the case, I do not know. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So you do not – it is not as 
20 
though you and Priscilla Mabelane were ever in a room 
with Regiments who said oh, we are taking 13 million fee 
on this deal. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you never had any discussion with 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 50 of 397 
 
her …[intervenes] 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the basis of which you can say she 
knew. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   All you are saying is because she may 
have been involved in appointing them you take it that she 
would know whether they would be entitled or not entitled 
to that. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   On the basis that she appointed them. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but not that you …[intervenes] 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   But we never had …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   A discussion. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And if we still stay within your 
assumption then if the assumption flows from the fact that 
she appointed them, you would assume that she would 
appoint them on particular terms that would govern their 
fees, would you not? 
20 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   No because I could not get into the 
discussion with her on the appointment of Regiments. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Would it …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, I am sorry, what did you say?  
Just repeat your answer? 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 51 of 397 
 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I am saying I did not know because 
we have never had a discussion about the appointment of 
Regiments with Priscilla. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but I think Mr Chaskalson was 
saying when you said because she was involved in 
appointing them she would know, was that because you are 
saying in appointing them the issue of what they would 
have been paid or what they would be entitled to would be 
dealt with in the appointment documents. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Precisely, Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So you would have assumed that 
an appointment of Regiments would have been made that 
would have governed their appointment and the fees 
payable for that appointment. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   True. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Let us go to the next document 
which is page 32, deals with the new swap. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Might this be the convenient time, Mr 
Chaskalson? 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, let us take the tea adjournment, we 
will resume at half past eleven.  Yes – oh, Mr Mpofu, you 
are excused.  Okay, thank you, we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 52 of 397 
 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
ADV 
CHASKALSON 
SC: 
 
 
Thank 
you, 
Chair. 
 
Mr 
Ramosebudi, can I take you to a new document, it is on 
page 32. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I am here, Mr Chaskalson. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Again it is an email from Mario 
Visinenzo(?) to Eric Wood, copy to Moss Brickman.  The 
subject is ACSA interest rate swap as an attachment of the 
spreadsheet. 
10 
“Hi Eric, current indicative rate on the interest rate 
swap is as follows.” 
And then the terms are set out.  It is going to be 1.5 billion 
swap and then the same sentence: 
“We leave it up to you to include a margin for us to 
share on the usual 50/50 agreement.” 
I have to ask the same question to you again, were you 
aware that Regiments and Nedbank were going to share a 
margin on a 50/50 basis at ACSA’s expense? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   No, Chairperson. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can we then go down to page 34 
which is the spreadsheet that was attached to that email.  
Can you describe to the Chair what this spreadsheet on 
page 34 is describing?  It is called Swap Profile.xls. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson, the sheet on page 4 just 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 53 of 397 
 
show the cash flow profile for a particular transaction that 
matures on the 29 December 2023.  Sorry, on the 18 March 
2024. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can we then go over the page to 
page 36 and start with the email at the foot of page 36.  
Sorry, start with the email at the foot of page 34. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Page 34 is the cash flow profile. 
CHAIRPERSON:   34? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I am looking at the wrong 
numbers, I beg your pardon, I am looking at red numbers.  
10 
Go to the bottom of page 36, I am sorry. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mario Visinenzo(?) to Eric Wood 
10 March 2010. 
“Hi Eric, the attached spreadsheet illustrates the 
estimated future cash flows on the proposed swaps 
based on today’s swap and CPI curves.  On the 
Jibar legs of the swaps Nedbank will pay ACSA a 
quarterly interest rate payment calculated as three 
month Jibar plus 2.6% of the amortising notional 
20 
profile.  Nedbank will not pay any capital amount.  
On the CPI leg of the swaps ACSA will pay Nedbank 
a quarterly interest payment calculated as the 
quoted real rates on the adjusted CPI notional 
amounts.  The notional amounts on this leg of the 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 54 of 397 
 
swap are therefore adjusted by the change in the 
CPI level over the transaction period.  Please note 
that ACSA will also have to pay Nedbank a capital 
amount on the maturity of the swaps, this amount 
being calculated as the difference between the 
adjusted notional amount on the maturity date and 
the initial notional amount on inception.  This 
capital settlement is as per standard CPI swap 
convention.  I hope that the mechanics of the CPI 
swaps are now clearer but call me if you have 
10 
further queries.” 
Can you explain to the Chair was he is describing there?  
And if it may assist you the spreadsheet that he is 
referring to starts at page 38.  Maybe I can assist you.  If 
you go to page 38 you will see swap 1.  Is this the swap 1 
on page 38 relating to the Jibar leg of the swaps which Mr 
Visinenzo describes in his email where ACSA pays a 
quarterly interest payment calculated as three month Jibar 
plus 2.6% on the amortising notional profile. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson, this is – on page 38, let 
20 
me explain just what Mr Chairperson requested me to 
explain to you, Chairperson, on page 36, an email from 
Mario to Eric.  In here Mario says to Eric that the swap has 
two regime – I am just borrowing your terminology, 
Chairperson. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 55 of 397 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   The swaps has two regime, one 
regime is a floating rate of Jiba plus 260 basis points, 
2.6% and then the other regime it is an inflation index or a 
capital adjusted with and inflation index, so – and what he 
says here, ACSA will pay on a quarterly basis, every three 
months, and a CPI rate or an inflation rate that is adjusted 
on the capital determined by a real rate on a quarterly 
basis until maturity whereas Nedbank will be paying Jiba 
plus 260 basis points, Jiba plus 2.6% on the same 
10 
quarterly basis on an amortising profile of the loan.  So the 
loan amortises up until the end of the period, Nedbank will 
not pay any capital amount.  But somewhere here it says 
Ned - ACSA will pay a settlement adjusted for CPI at the 
end of the convention period meaning that the balance of 
the capital is adjusted by the inflation and over a period of 
time then ACSA will settle that adjusted capital over a 
period of time even though it is paying on amortising 
profile but the balance accrue with inflation because it is 
paying on a real rate.  That is what he says on this 
20 
particular email. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And that is the Jibar leg of the 
swap because there are also the CPI legs. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   No, no, the Jibar rate is what 
Nedbank pays ACSA and then the CPI rate is what ACSA is 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 56 of 397 
 
paying Nedbank. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I take you down to page 38 
because I think the situation is slightly different because 
there are two separate regimes. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   He has one regime on which he 
calls swap 1 on page 38 and there you will see the 
Nedbank paying ACSA Jibar plus 260% over the amortising 
profile.  So the amortising profile is reflected in the 
decreasing notional in the 1, 2, 3, 4 t h column, is that 
10 
correct? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   What Nedbank pays to ACSA is 
Jibar plus 2.6% on those decreasing amounts, that is in the 
next column. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then there is a CPI notional 
column which is going to determine what ACSA pays 
Nedbank and ACSA’s payments to Nedbank are in the far 
right column and as you pointed out there will be a 
20 
settlement, a large settlement payment at the end, that 903 
million. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But then if you down a page you 
will see that there are separate swaps which he calls swap 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 57 of 397 
 
2A, swap 2B and swap 2C and there is a separate schedule 
of payments in relation to these three related swaps.  So 
swap 2C sets out – 2A sets out the payments that everyone 
will pay at page 39.  If you go down a page you see swap 
2B and swap 2C on the last page which is 41 and if we go 
back up to his email on page 36 – it is possibly clearer on 
the email at the top of the page 36 which is a follow-up 
email from Mario to Eric and Moss where he says: 
“Finally the revised schedule and rates for the 
proposed inflation linked swaps with ACSA, see 
10 
attached spreadsheet…” 
Which we have just been looking at. 
“...swap 1 is based on a notional amount of 1.5 
billion amortising on the Jibar leg to match the 
underlying loan...” 
That is what you described. 
“...whilst the notional and the CPI leg is a constant 
amount of 1.5 billion adjusted by CPI.” 
He then describes – and then he talks about swap 2A, 
swap 2B and swap 2C. 
20 
“...have been structured in order to replicate the 
amortising nature of the underlying loan.  We have 
now calculated the notional amount such that the 
real rate is the same on all three swaps, interest 
payments to ACSA on the Jibar leg so the swaps 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 58 of 397 
 
will 
add 
up 
to 
the 
interest 
payments 
on 
the 
underlying amortising loan.” 
So can you explain to the Chair what swaps 2A, 2B and 2C 
are? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   The swaps 2A to C, Chairperson is 
the is a three swap that breaks the 1.5 billion in to three 
swaps and they are pricing to a CPI rate against the 2.6% 
over Jibar rate.  So the 1.5 billion was, you know, broken 
down in three swap. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And at a later stage when they 
10 
refer to the CPI swaps, so they are going to be referring to 
2A, 2B and 2C? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That was a yes? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I take you next to page 46?  
It is an email from Thabo Letlaka to yourself.  Do you 
recall receiving this email dated 19 March 2010? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes, sir, I am on the page. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   My question was do you recall 
20 
receiving this email? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   You know, Chairperson, I see the 
email, probably it came to my inbox.  I cannot recall but I 
think it came to me.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well, maybe if you look at the 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 59 of 397 
 
attachments there are two.  The one is a spreadsheet, 
similar to the one that we have just seen and then there is 
one that is called – a document called the Airports 
Company of South Africa.docex.  Maybe that will refresh 
your memory.  So if you go to page 42 you will see the 
document. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I recall this document. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So you recall this document. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And would it be correct to say 
10 
that this document is motivating the wisdom of entering 
into the swaps that we have just been looking at? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   No, I think this document explains the 
swap transactions that have been entered into. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But it is not just explaining the 
swap transactions that have been entered into, it is 
motivating them.  If I can take you down to – you go to 
page 43, you will see: 
“I feel that ACSA can get better value by changing 
the profile of the loan, proposing that ACSA enters 
20 
into a swap agreement with an intermediary bank.” 
So what the memo is doing is it is referring to an existing 
DBSA loan and it is saying you will get value by swapping 
your exposure on that loan by entering into an interest rate 
swap. 
 
Would 
that 
be 
a 
correct 
summary 
of 
this 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 60 of 397 
 
memorandum? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Do you recall who advised ACSA 
in the first place to take out the Development Bank loan for 
1.5 billion? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   It was Regiments. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Regiments Capital, yes.  Who is 
writing this memorandum?  Mr Letlaka, where does he 
work? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   It comes from Regiments, I do not 
10 
know who wrote it. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes.  Well, so it comes from 
Regiments.  So Regiments advised ACSA to enter into a 
Development Bank loan for 1.5 billion.  Were they paid a 
fee for that? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I think so. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And now they are saying you will 
get better value if you get out of the loan that we advised 
you to get into and swap and enter into an interest rate 
swap, is that correct? 
20 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Just 
remember 
to 
articulate 
your 
responses audibly, Mr Ramosebudi.  Sorry, I just make 
sure I pronounce your surname correctly. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 61 of 397 
 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes, Chairperson, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I then – and did ACSA enter 
into this interest rate swap with those three CPI swaps?  
Did it follow Regiments’ advice in this regard? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I cannot recall but ACSA did trade the 
interest rate swaps. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well, let us maybe go a little bit 
lower down which might refresh your memory.  If you go 
down to page 57 you will see an email from Moss Brickman 
10 
to Eric Wood dated 23 March 2010.  So we are still talking 
about the same process.  It says: 
“Hi Eric, below is the schedule of fee payments that 
we should be able to capture on the proposed ACSA 
transaction.  The values in the table are per basis 
point actual on the prescribed dates.” 
And then it says: 
“Payment of fees to Regiments” 
It has got ACSA on the left hand side and it has got a 
schedule of dates and it says. 
20 
“Total per basis point per rand R1 178 673 per basis 
point.” 
Am I correct in interpreting this email that Nedbank is 
writing to Regiments saying we can capture these fees for 
you which will be paid by ACSA on the following dates and 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 62 of 397 
 
the total that you will get per basis point is 1.178 million? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Ja, as per this sheet, yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And what fee – do you recall 
what fee Regiments took on the last swap where we saw 
their fee?  Do you recall how many basis points they took? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   The last invoice which we saw was 
about R11 million. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, do you recall how many 
basis points that translated to?  We did actually... 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I think they were quoting in the 
10 
document, the email, 10 basis points. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   10 basis points? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So if we applied to same 10 
basis point rate here, what would the fee to Regiments be? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Ja, without doing the calculations, I 
cannot vouch for it. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No, but it says – look, this is 
easy mental arithmetic.  Total per basis point 1 178 673, 10 
basis points would you give you 11.786 million, is that not 
20 
correct? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson... 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well, let me put the question a 
different way, if the total per basis point is this amount and 
they get 10 basis points, they will get ten times that 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 63 of 397 
 
amount, is that not correct? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Ja, ja, simple arithmetic calculation, 
yes, it does exactly but if you compare the numbers 
because there is time value of money here the numbers are 
different.  Here is 11 786 000, the other one is 11 540 000.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No, we are talking about 
different transactions that is why they do not correlate, this 
is a new transaction. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  Okay.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  They have already got their 13 
10 
million fee from the last one.  So you will agree that if on 
the new transaction at 10 basis points they will be looking 
at 11.78 million?  
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   True. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The answer is yes? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Were you aware that they were 
going to be paid this amount of 11.78? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   No. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   You were not?   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   No, I was not aware. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   You were not.  Can I take you a 
little bit lower down to page 61, which is now 26 March 
2010 and we see now an invoice from Regiments to Moss 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 64 of 397 
 
Brickman, it is invoice Ned 5 of 2010, it goes to Nedbank 
and the narrative on it is origination and facilitation of the 
1.5 
billion 
interest 
rate 
swap 
transactions 
between 
Nedbank Capital and ACSA and would those be those 
transactions that we were just looking at?  Do you recall 
they were 1.5 billion? 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are now at page 62, Mr Chaskalson? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I am page 62. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you initially said 61 but I think you 
are now on 62. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I apologise, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   62, yes.  So origination and 
facilitation of the 1.5 billion interest rate swap transactions 
between 
Nedbank 
and 
ACSA. 
 
Underneath 
the 
last 
sentence: 
“Regiments Capital (Pty) Ltd has informed its client 
that it is earning a fee for the facilitation of the 
above transaction.” 
Now you have earlier said that you had assumed that 
20 
Regiments would get a fee but you have also said that you 
were not aware that the fee would be – I think said 11.78, 
we see this one says 10.78.  Were you aware that the fee 
would be 10.78? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   No. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 65 of 397 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Were you aware that Regiments 
…[intervenes] 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   No, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, just remember to make sure your 
answer is audible. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Were you aware that Regiments 
and Nedbank apparently had an arrangement where they 
split a margin on a 50/50 …[intervenes] 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   No, Chairperson. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   ...basis.  You were not aware of 
10 
that either.  Can I then go down to a transaction between 
Standard and ACSA and that is at page 80 and there you 
will see an email from Mr Zaid Moola of Standard, 
Wednesday 19 May 2010 to Eric Wood, c.c. Johan Roos 
and it says: 
“Hi Eric, thank you for your assistance in securing 
this deal, we really appreciate it.  The following are 
outstanding from ACSA, please can you chase it up 
for us?  Can you also please send us some 
documentation disclosing the agreement between 
20 
yourself and ACSA and the fee disclosure, our legal 
head would like it on file.” 
So Nedbank just want Regiments to put a statement on 
their invoice, Standard are saying we actually want the 
documentation that chose your agreement that you can 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 66 of 397 
 
take a fee from ACSA.  Then if you go down to page 82, 
you see the document and there you will see an email from 
Eric Wood to yourself, 20 May 2010, copy to Zaid Moola 
and several other people at Standard and the subject is 
interest rate swap.  Do you recall receiving this email? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson, sometime that I see it 
came to me. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is -  are you accepting that 
you would have seen this email at this time? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes, I am accepting that I have seen, 
10 
ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  
 “Hi Phetolo, the following interest  
rate 
swap 
was 
transacted 
between ACSA 
and 
Standard Bank on 19 May 2010.  1.5 billion swap 
transacted on 19 May, nature of underlying ability, 
the client, the nature of the swap, Regiments’ fee 
11 basis points.  Person at client informed the 
Regiments fee, Phetolo Ramosebudi, Treasurer, 
date informed Wednesday 19 May 2010, telephonic, 
20 
verbal.  Should you require any further information 
or assistance please contact myself.” 
Do you recall have a telephonic conversation with Mr Wood 
where he said we are about to conclude a 1.75 billion 
transaction for ACSA with Standard and we are going to 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 67 of 397 
 
take an 11 basis point fee for ourselves which ACSA will 
pay back over the life of the swap.  Do you recall a 
conversation of that nature? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I cannot recall the call, it has been 
some time, but yes, I saw it happened. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well, let me ask a different 
question, if it had not happened, what would you have 
done when you received this email? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   So he is informing me on the 
transaction that is being concluded and the fees that they 
10 
have charged us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, he is saying there was a telephone 
conversation with you during which he told you about this.  
So the question is, when you received this email and you 
would have seen what he says, namely that he had had a 
telephone conversation with you in which he had told you 
this, if there had been no such telephone conversation 
what would you have done if what he was saying was not 
true? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Let us look at the transaction because 
20 
what he is saying here, he has transacted on the 19 May.  
And after the transaction on the 19 May he informed me of 
what the transaction entails, including the fees that he has 
charged, which what he has captured on here.  So he has 
informed him what he has charged us on the transaction 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 68 of 397 
 
that he executed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But apart from that  - and Mr Chaskalson 
you must tell me if I misunderstand something.  Apart from 
that he is saying that he had a telephone conversation 
where he told you about these things, he told you that here 
is what he had done and that he is going to be – he is 
charging a fee for it.  If, when you read this email, you 
thought but he never spoke to me, why is he saying he 
spoke to me, what would you have done? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   That is why I said it has been some 
10 
time, so I cannot recall whether he called me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but normally if somebody sends you 
an email and says you have spoken, maybe you have 
agreed on something and you never had that conversation, 
what would you do, how would you handle that? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Normally if he has – because he 
might have called me the time he was writing the email and 
then when he spoke to me at the time then I said please, 
can you reduce that in writing because I might have asked 
that question, can you reduce what you are telling me in 
20 
writing so that at least I have something?  I could have 
done that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Chaskalson, you might be able 
to - maybe that satisfies you or …[intervenes] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   It is good enough for my 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 69 of 397 
 
purposes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But, Mr Ramosebudi, there is 
another issue around this email that I want to raise with 
you, it says: 
“Person at client informed of Regiments’ fee...” 
And bear in mind this is copied to Standard Bank as you 
see in the c.c. lines. 
“Person at client informed the Regiments fee, 
Phetolo Ramosebudi.” 
10 
So on an email copied to Standard Mr Wood is saying I 
have informed Ramosebudi of ACSA of our fee.  Did it not 
strike you as strange that he was identifying you as the 
person at ACSA to cite this authority for his fees as 
opposed to Ms Mabelane? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   No.  No, Chairperson, because here 
he is stating the person he has informed of the transaction, 
not the person who is authorising the transaction.  So he 
has informed his colleague who required from Standard 
Bank a confirmation that the client knows about the fee, 
20 
which he spoke to me, that I have charged 11 basis points.  
That is what he stated. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So – but you did not know 
whether he was authorised to take this 11 basis point fee 
or not, did you? 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 70 of 397 
 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I would not have known because I do 
not know the details of the mandate that they have, 
whether it was on a fee base, on a fixed term or on a 
saving base, that I have not known that, Chairperson. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, so you do not know whether 
he is authorised to take this fee and yet he is citing you as 
the only person at ACSA who he has told about the fee.  
Did that not concern you in any way? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   No, I was the – at the time I think I 
was the sole person at the Treasury at ACSA, I had one or 
10 
two people that were working with me and mostly the 
transactions they were executed by myself. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes but you didn’t know whether 
he was allowed to take this fee on your version.   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Excuse Mr Chairperson. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   On your version you didn’t know 
whether he was allowed to take this 11 basis point fee.   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Because I don’t know the detail of the 
mandate he has. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Did you not think that maybe it 
20 
be prudent to find out whether he was entitled to take over 
R10 million rands at ACSA would have to pay back? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   The transaction of this nature and the 
attracted fee, but the relative amount of that I don’t know 
because the mandate I don’t have it. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 71 of 397 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But did you say earlier that you 
were the one who executed this transaction? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I am saying yes, because I had the 
loan for five, so I gave him the loan for five and also they 
were working with him there at the loan profile to do this 
transaction.  That is why from ACSA point of view I was the 
coordinating point.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So you are the coordinating 
point, you commit ACSA to a transaction which will involve 
paying over R10 million rands to Regiments and you don’t 
10 
know whether ACSA actually is obliged to pay R10 million 
to Regiments or not.   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I don’t think Chairperson that is the 
correct version of what this person says here.  Here he 
informed me of the charge of the interest rate.  He has 
been appointed by somebody higher than me in ACSA, so 
who gave them the commitment to commit ACSA?  I did not 
commit ACSA. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
But 
I 
think 
the 
point 
is 
this 
Mr 
Ramosebudi, they have been appointed. 
20 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 And 
on 
your 
understanding 
of 
the 
position, if they were appointed, they were not appointed 
to do this work for free.   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Precisely true. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 72 of 397 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  They were, they were going to charge. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   True. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For this work. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   True. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So when he phones you and says, I am 
charging for this, should you not have said, why are you 
telling me about this specific charge?  You are charging of 
course, why are you telling me about this specific charge?   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   You are correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the purpose?  Why, why – you 
10 
haven’t told me about other charges, why are you telling 
me about this one?   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   For the purpose of responding to 
because Standard Bank needed a confirmation, because 
Standard 
Bank 
needed 
a 
confirmation 
whether 
this 
Regiments is doing this transaction on behalf of ACSA.  
Because they might have not done it on behalf of ACSA.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if I take into account what I have 
heard, it appears that Standard Bank was confirmed, was 
confirmed that nothing should be done and no fee should 
20 
be earned or taken unless ACSA knew about it and had 
authorised it.  That’s, that’s why they wanted that they 
even wanted to know who knew about it.   
And then they are this person says, well I phoned 
Mr Ramosebudi, he is the person who knows about it.  And 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 73 of 397 
 
the question is, when he phoned you, if he did phone you, 
we assume he did, when he phoned you and said, you 
know there is this transaction and I am charging for this, 
shouldn’t your natural reaction have been why are you 
telling me that you are charging for this?   
Because of course you, you are charging for the 
work in accordance with whatever agreement, so what is 
the purpose of telling me?  So the question is, shouldn’t 
your reaction have been precisely that?   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson, I don’t, I don’t see it in 
10 
that fashion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, tell me how you see it. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   And how I see it, it is precisely from 
the email from Zaid Muller here.  Zaid Muller wanted a 
disclosure agreement between ACSA and Regiments.  And 
he wanted that disclosure to actually even specify the fee 
that is going to be charged.   
It was not about yes Regiments were transacting 
with Standard Bank on behalf of ACSA and therefore there 
is a fee to add.  That one is a normal, is in a normal cause 
20 
of business.  You transact on behalf of anybody you charge 
a fee.  But what Zaid was looking for, is a disclosure 
agreement.   
Which this email which Eric has sent to Standard 
Bank it is not saying that.  Here it says, I – he told me of 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 74 of 397 
 
the fee.  He informed me that there is a fee of 11 basis 
points that is with these bank charges.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Why would he have to tell you about this 
fee if the fee fell within the agreement?  Why would he 
need to tell you?  If he was charging a fee that was in 
accordance with his appointment, with their appointment? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   There could be two things.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   One could be that maybe in terms of 
the disclosure that he forwarded to Standard Bank this, 
10 
that Standard Bank required, the fee that he is charging is 
outside the boundaries.  That is one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is outside? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Outside the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The agreement? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   The terms of the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The terms of the agreement, ja.   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Or I could have asked myself, for this 
transaction maybe I was doing the calculation and then he 
is not giving me the numbers that I am expecting.  And it 
20 
says, how much have you charged your fees on this?  What 
are the trading, the trading cost of this transaction?  
Because then I also have to satisfy myself that the fare, 
the price that I am taking is fair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Chaskalson. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 75 of 397 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you Chair.  Can I take you 
to Regiments’ invoices for these two transactions?  If we 
go to – we have seen the 10.78 billion invoice at page 62 
that Nedbank paid Regiments.  And I take you to the 
Standard invoice, if you go to page 84.  You will see there 
that 
Nedbank 
invoiced 
Standard 
22 
million 
for 
this 
transaction, were, were you aware of that, that 11 bases 
points would translate to 22 million? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I can’t ...[indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said Nedbank, you mean Regiments. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Regiments invoiced Standard 22 
million. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I can’t recall.  I can’t, this is the 
normal ...[indistinct] of calculating.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry Mr Ramosebudi I did not 
hear that answer. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I did not see this because they 
normally didn’t come through to me. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So you didn’t see the invoice, 
but would you have known that 11 basis points would 
20 
translate to around 22 million? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Probably if I did you know work out 
numbers at the time I could have maybe. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But on a transaction of that 
nature you would have been aware broadly presumably. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 76 of 397 
 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That 11 basis points will mean 
around 22 million ...[indistinct]. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Ja.  The challenge with this type of 
transaction is that Chairperson they, they are of the nature 
where we call them over the counter transactions. So over 
the counter transactions in their nature they are not liquid.   
So meaning that there are no willing buyers and 
sellers waiting on the wings to take them.  And therefore 
should you want to transact at the time, the price you get 
10 
might not be fully disclosed to you because they charge so 
many things, you know the bankers in this type of 
transaction.  So at the time I could have seen a number, 
but how it was made of I couldn’t determine that. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No but in this particular case, 
Standard had told you 11 basis point amount on this one 
0,7 billion swop is going to be paid to Regiment.  They had 
told you.  So you knew, whatever else you didn’t know 
about the details of the swop you knew that … 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Ja. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   ACSA would be paying 11 basis 
points.   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes.  It will be paying 11 basis points. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes.  So, so you could have – 
the broad amount that ACSA was going to pay Regiments 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 77 of 397 
 
you knew.   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Not exactly.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well but you are treasurer of 
ACSA, you know what 11 basis points on a swop of 1, 7 
billion on those terms is going to yield in terms of the 
present value.   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Not ...[indistinct] extend that I did do 
the calculation at the time, I could have done the 
calculation.  Yes it would have told, informed me. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So, so if you were, if you had 
10 
been interested you would have been able to find that out 
yourself.   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   And normally you never get to the 
same number because it depends on the curve that we are 
using.  I might have used different curves. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   And different curves.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   And therefore the numbers come 
differently. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes.  But I mean you would not 
have reached a number of sort of one million.   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   There could be anything.  The 
standard ...[indistinct] is wide as 10 percent depending on 
the terms.   
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313

ADV CHASKALSON SC:   10 Percent sounds like quite a 
big standard deviation to me, but even at 10 percent you 
would have known that Regiments were getting at least 
approximately 20 million on this transaction.   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I, can I ask you before we 
go a little further, how do you understand the procurement 
arrangements in relation to paying these sorts of amounts 
of money?  22 Million to Regiments on the standard swop?  
13 Million on the one Nedbank swop.  11 Million on the 
10 
other.   
It 
is 
over 
40 
million 
that 
has 
been 
paid 
to 
Regiments.  How do you understand the procurement 
arrangements that relate to paying these amounts of money 
to Regiments?  Where, where does this happen in the 
procurement process? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   The procurement at the time was not 
within treasury, it is, it was within a division of the treasury 
of finance.  So I don’t know to what extent when the 
appointment of Regiments’ were effected, how was the 
20 
procurement process at the time.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But was it not your responsibility 
to establish what the procurement process was and 
whether Regiments were entitled to these vast fees that 
you were now seeing?  40 Million that we have looked at 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 79 of 397 
 
and it gets bigger.   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   You are quite correct Mr Chairperson.  
True yourself Chairperson, should I have initiated the 
process to appoint Regiments to execute the funding plan 
and risk management?  I think that is a process I would 
have undertaken.  Firstly to know what my delegation of 
authority is.  So that I can make sure that I do it within my 
authority.   
So in this case they were already appointed, they 
brought in, this is what they are going to do.  And therefore 
10 
any payments that was that, was done was as per that 
appointment.  I did not question my boss or whoever.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But, sorry.  Mr Ramosebudi 
we’ve 
already 
seen 
or 
you 
didn’t 
know 
what 
that 
appointment said.   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Precisely. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We have already seen that the 
two payments, the two large payments that Regiments took 
were not on the same basis.  They took 11 basis points 
from Standard, 10 basis points from Nedbank.  So they 
20 
couldn’t have been governed by one set of rules.   
And if there had been a procurement process which 
appointed Regiments on particular terms, there would have 
been a standard rate for, for all of the fund that they raised 
presumably.  Is that not right? 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 80 of 397 
 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Quite correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So – well what I have to put to 
you is that you were at best bravely negligent in allowing 
these 
sorts 
of 
transactions 
to 
pass 
through 
without 
establishing whether Regiments had the authority of ACSA 
to take these fees.  Do you have a comment on that? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson I don’t think it is quite 
true that I was negligent to the best of Regiments.  I think 
Regiments were appointed and it was pre my time to be at 
ACSA and therefore the execution on their mandate and 
10 
the payments that have effected in the past could also not 
have been my negligence.   
And therefore any payment that was effected even 
in my tenure, what I need to know on my side was that, 
was there value for what they did.  Because that was my 
responsibility and what I was accountable for, is the value 
for the work that they did.   
And that is what I was making sure that there is, 
otherwise then I was going to be negligent and stuff 
Chairperson.   
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No but Mr Ramasubudi that is 
not how procurement works in the public sector.  You don’t 
have 
individuals 
called 
upon 
to 
make 
individualised 
judgment calls and whether individual transactions which 
may or may not have been authorised grant value.   
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 81 of 397 
 
You require some regular procurement processes.  
Do you not accept that?  And where, on what basis could 
you have assumed that there was a regular procurement 
process governing these fees that Regiments was taking?   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   The process that was undertaking to 
broad Regiments at ACSA in 2007 and till the best of the 
time that they have been there, I didn’t know how that was 
followed.  And I was not in procurement at the time. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So you didn’t know whether they 
did have authority or didn’t have authority?  You said that 
10 
already.  But you were happy to stand by while on your 
watch fees of more than 40 million rand were paid to them 
on ACSA’s account. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   The question Chairperson is there 
value for money.  That is what my responsibilities were.  
They were brought in by this, the FD at the time.  And says 
you will work with these people and I worked with them.  
And what I needed to make sure was, is there value for 
what they going to be paid.  And that is what I did.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am not sure that it’s possible to 
20 
say your focus will just be, was about whether there was 
value for money, because that suggests to me that you 
wouldn’t mind if they did something that they have no 
authority to do.  As long as in the end that well it is a 
good, it is a good thing.   
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 82 of 397 
 
Whereas there is a prior question, before they can 
do anything, it must be something that fell within their 
mandate.  And if they have a good idea, an idea that they 
think would add value through the transaction they would 
need to come back to the client and say, you know there is 
this idea but it falls outside our mandate.   
This is how we think it would be good for you, if you 
just want your authority that we can go ahead.  But if we 
go ahead, this is how we will charge you.  And if the client 
says, yes you can go ahead and that is the agreement 
10 
about what you will charge, then it is fine.   
Or the client might say yes, it is a good idea but in 
terms of our financial situation blah, blah, blah, blah no 
don’t, don’t do it.  And in which case they would not be 
entitled to charge.  Or the client might say, it would be nice 
to have, but it is not essential so don’t do it.   
Go, I am saying to you when you answer on the 
basis of saying your focus or your job was to see whether 
there was value for money, it gives me the impression that 
you are saying, it wouldn’t matter whether they give 
20 
something that fell outside their mandate or not.  Do you 
want to comment on that? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I think certainly sir.  Ja, let me put it 
to you in this fashion.  In a corporate environment the way 
I am narrating this is as if I was the only person who was 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 83 of 397 
 
doing the transaction and communicating with Regiments 
and Standard Bank and Nedbank.  That was not the case.   
I every week or every day I had interact with my 
boss to tell him about the transactions that are happening.  
Because if he or she was to sign off something, they need 
to understand who are they signing off, they are signing 
off.  Secondly, there is a board, an executive committee of 
– executive committee of management of the organisation 
at the time.   
Those transactions needed to be reported there.  
10 
And subsequent to that they had to go to finance and risk 
management committee.  A board sub-committee and a 
board committee so that they understand the transactions 
that were happening.   
Should there have been at the point when I was 
narrating all the steps throughout the management, my 
boss, my management committee, executive committee and 
board at the time, something that indicated to me that 
when this guys were doing this transaction, how did you 
appoint them.  I would have taken a different step.  But 
20 
none so ever at the point when we were doing this 
transaction.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Chaskalson. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Now Mr Ramosebudi did you tell 
any of your supervisors that Regiments were taking fees of 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 84 of 397 
 
10 basis points or 11 basis points on these transactions?   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I can’t recall Mr Chairperson.  I can’t 
recall Chairperson.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Can I, can I just go back a little bit 
because maybe I may have misunderstood this.  And it 
goes back to the question of your role in regard to this.  
You said that they, the Regiments were appointed before 
your time.  Is that right? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   True. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You came in when they were 
10 
already appointed. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   True. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you said those who appointed 
them would have known what fee arrangements had been 
made.  Is that right? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   True. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now wasn’t your role after you 
came in to see to it that they acted in accordance with 
ACSA’s expectations of what they were supposed to do and 
were paid for what they were asked to do?  Wasn’t that 
20 
part of your role? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   That part was not, was not, was not 
discussed between myself and my boss. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who, who … 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   For the management of the contract 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 85 of 397 
 
itself.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know whose responsibility as far 
as you are concerned that would have been, because there 
must be somebody who was supposed to do that? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Of the number of institutions that I 
have worked for if there is that part of procurement 
process that the payments have been done and made on 
behalf of an organisation, the guys in procurement have to 
track, to track the contract amount, the contract period, the 
contract payments and then how much is outstanding, 
10 
whether it is still within so that it does not become part of 
the irregular expenditure at some point in time.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay, can I just ask a question 
Mr Ramosebudi?  Because I think you are right about how 
the system should work.  But the particular magic of these 
transactions from the perspective of Regiments is that they 
will not show up anywhere in ACSA’s books as payments to 
Regiments.   
They will just show up in Nedbank’s books as an 
amount that gets paid to Regiments.  All that the ACSA 
20 
books will show is repayment of amounts to Nedbank on 
terms of, in terms of a swop transaction.  No one looking at 
the 
transaction 
from 
the 
outside 
would 
know 
that 
Regiments have taken 10 million out of it.   
So 
your 
whole 
proposition, 
that 
if 
there 
is 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 86 of 397 
 
something irregular about this it will be picked up by 
people seeing irregular expenditure.  I must put to you 
breaks down because the transaction is designed to hide 
the fee payments to Regiments.  What is your response to 
that?   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I don’t think so Chairperson.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Let me, let me follow up.  Who is 
going to see that Nedbank has paid Regiments 13 million 
on the one, 11 million on the other?  Who inside ACSA is 
going to see that?   
10 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   So the nature of the transaction itself, 
as I said on the day one, on the day one the accountants 
do the entries such that they can then split the number and 
the amounts that have been paid or that are going to be 
paid to different parties.  And on the day one, the first 
value of the swop is zero.  The swop including its costs on 
day one is going to be zero.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr Ramosebudi you are not 
answering my question.  Sorry Mr Ramosebudi I must ask 
you to answer my question.  Who inside ACSA by looking 
20 
at these transactions is going to know that Nedbank has 
paid Regiments 13 million on one transaction, 11 million on 
another and that ACSA is paying back to Nedbank those 
amounts?  Who is going to see that on any of this 
documentation?  Where is it going to be visible?   
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 87 of 397 
 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   The accountants knows in terms of 
the, the – how they do the accounting on the swop 
transaction.  So those that are in the accounting they 
would 
know 
how 
they 
do 
the 
accounting 
from 
that 
perspective when they compare the effective rates and the 
executed rate at the time. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, but they won’t know that 
built into the rate that is being paid by ACSA to Nedbank is 
10 basis points that are going to be present value by 
Nedbank to pay an amount of 13 million to Regiments.  
10 
Would they know that? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   The nature of the transaction doesn’t, 
it 
doesn’t 
allow 
to 
book 
the 
losses 
or 
the 
profits 
immediately on day one.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes.  Is no one looking at these 
transactions from ACSA’s side will see anything that tells 
people at ACSA that Regiments has been paid 13 million 
on 
this 
particular 
transaction. 
 
11 
Million 
on 
that 
transaction.  Is that not correct? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   During the life of the transaction 
20 
itself, through yourself Chairperson, the movement of the 
truck itself will then determine the fair values which it falls, 
the profit or the losses of the instruments.  Because the 
rate itself is a composite of a number of element. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr Ramosebudi we are not 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 88 of 397 
 
talking, we are not talking about whether people inside 
ACSA know what ACSA is paying in terms of the swops in a 
globular sense.  Of course they do.   
But would anybody know that one component of that 
payment is 10 basis points that are going to repay a fee of 
13 million that Regiments has taken?  Would anyone know 
that?  That is the question I want you to answer.   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   If so ever we then request the detail 
component of the swop itself, then we can apportion what 
the fee structure is.   
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And did, did anyone at ACSA 
request the detail? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   In this case yes, disclosed 11 basis 
points to me.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And did you disclose that to 
anybody else?  Because I have asked you earlier.   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   From an accounting perspective that 
was not how we accounted the financial instruments.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So does that mean you didn’t 
disclose it to anybody else? 
20 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you.  So nobody inside 
ACSA would know other than you would know that on this 
transaction, let’s take the Standard transaction where there 
was complete disclosure at Standard in systems.  No one 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 89 of 397 
 
would know that on that transaction Regiments had been 
paid 22 million rands at ACSA’s expense.  Is that correct? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   To the extent, to the extent through 
yourself Chairperson that the, the settlement agreement 
does not stipulate, then nobody would know.  But half the 
time the settlement agreement must stipulate what are we 
settling between the two parties.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well can you point me to a 
single 
other 
person 
at ACSA 
who 
would 
know 
that 
Regiments were paid 22 million by Standard and that ACSA 
10 
was paying that back on the swop to Standard? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Me myself Chairperson, I don’t 
remember who had indeed at ACSA at the time so I can’t 
point anybody.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you say with certainty that 
there would be anyone other than you that would have 
known that Regiments had been paid 22 million? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I also did not know that they were 
paid 22 million until today I see this.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, but you did know they were 
20 
being paid 11 basis points on a swop of 1,7 billion and we 
talked about? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   You are correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Margins of errors. So you knew 
they were being paid something between about 19,8 million 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 90 of 397 
 
and 24,2 million or 24,4. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   You are correct.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, so you knew that, did 
anybody else know that? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I was the only one who was taking 
this transaction to swop and those that are in the 
accounting.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And would people in account had 
known that Regiments were getting around 22 million out of 
this? 
10 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   How did the accounting, probably 
could have.  But on the day of transaction, the swop itself 
is zero. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   [Indistinct]. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We are talking of cost purposes.  
We are not talking about the value of the swop.  We are 
talking about the value that Regiments took out of the 
swop.   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   But that is how we determine through 
20 
a self-check and the effective rate that you are going to 
pay.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Alright, let me move on.  You 
have been talking about value for money a great deal.  Are 
you talking about value for money for ACSA or value for 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 91 of 397 
 
money for you? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Value for money for ACSA.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well let me take you to another 
email.  Can you go to page 59?   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Where? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   59. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   59? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes.  And I want to put it in the 
chronology.  We have been talking about events in March 
2010.  So we have been talking about events in March 
10 
2010 just to put it back in chronology, you recall there was 
that email exchange that page 57 about between Moss 
Brickman and Eric Wood about the fee we should be able 
to capture on the ACSA swop.   
That was 23 March.  And that the invoice that 
Regiments issued to Nedbank in respect of the swop was 
issued on 31 March for 10,784 million.  So between 23 
March and – 23 March Nedbank and Regiments were 
looking for a fee to capture and on 31 March, that fee has 
crystallised into an invoice at 10,784 million.   
20 
Let’s look at a date between that.  23 March.  Do 
you see this email?  It’s addressed from you to Eric Wood 
and Niven Pillay.  Who is Niven Pillay? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Niven Pillay is one of the Directors of 
Regiments. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 92 of 397 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And do you recall sending this 
email? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I can’t recall.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   You can’t recall.   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you say positively that you 
never sent this email? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I might have sent, but I can’t recall.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay.  Let me read what the 
email says: 
10 
“Dear Eric, 
I would like to borrow E18 stock from Regiments’ 
fund managers and could repo the stock with Repo 
Trader.  I am going to trade the cash in the Money 
Market which will be collateralised with Regiments, 
there is no risk from Regiments’ point of view.  I can 
do this trade under Regiments.” 
Does that refresh your mind?   Do you recall asking 
Regiments to borrow stock from them? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I know for a fact that I am also a 
20 
market participant so there’s a number of transactions that 
I do on my own. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, but I am asking a separate 
question 
which 
is 
for 
the 
purposes 
of 
your 
market 
transactions in your individual capacity, this would have 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 93 of 397 
 
been in your individual capacity, would it not be? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, did you ever borrow stock 
from Regiments for your individual transactions? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I think I wanted to borrow but I do not 
think I got.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Right so you asked them to 
borrow and they said no we are not going to lend to you.  I 
see let us…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry what is the answer? 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr Ramosebudi the Chair just 
want you to repeat your answer.  
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I said I wanted to borrow but I was 
not offered.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So they would not lend to you, is 
that correct they would not lend the stock? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   They did not lend me.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, but you asked.  
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I asked yes.  
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, let us look at another email.  
Can you go down to – let us look at the dates of the 
Regiments invoice the standard again that is on page 84, 
20 May 2010.  That is on page 84 if one goes to page 712, 
can I ask you to turn page to 712 you will see an email that 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 94 of 397 
 
is addressed from you to Eric Wood the date is 28 July 
2010. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry I am still trying to locate page 
712.  I think some of the pages do not have the black 
numbers on, I see some Nedbank documents they have got 
the red numbers only.    
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   It is right at the back of the file 
Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I have got it.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Do you have it Mr Ramosebudi? 
10 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes, I do.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   It is an email from you to Mr Eric 
Wood dated 28 July it says: 
“Dear Eric, 
Please receive a copy of the research and will 
appreciate the review and comments as soon as 
possible for finalisation, regards.” 
Had you recall sending that email?   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I cannot recall.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   You cannot recall maybe this will 
20 
refresh your memory if you go down a page to 713 and if 
you just look at that email on 714 there is an attachment 
called workbook 2 and excel spreadsheet.  If you go down 
to 713 we see what that spreadsheet was and it is an 
invoice from Risk Stats Consulting, would you just remind 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 95 of 397 
 
the Chair what Risk Stats Consulting is? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson in the beginning I spoke 
about Risk Stats Consulting as one of the subsidiary of 
Risk Mats which one of my companies.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And if I recall correctly you had 
a 100% interest in that.  
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes, I did.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And you will see the date is 
defaulted to today’s date that it was an attachment to an 
email on 28 July 2010.  You will see that it is an invoice to 
10 
Regiments Capital for an amount of 400 000,00 plus 56 
000,00 VAT for actuarial and risk management consulting 
on behalf of Regiments Capital.  So do you recall sending 
this invoice to Regiments Capital?   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I cannot recall Chairperson.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   You cannot recall? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   No.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Do you recall doing any actuarial 
and risk management consulting on behalf of Regiments 
Capital? 
20 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson I have been advised by 
my lawyers not to respond on this one in case I incriminate 
myself.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.    
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I move on then.  Can I ask 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 96 of 397 
 
you to go to page – I must check that my note is right here, 
can I ask you to go to page 665.  Now you cannot speak to 
this because this is a bank statement of Regiments Capital 
and the date of the bank statement is 30 June 2010 and I 
presume you have never seen this bank statement before 
you came to the Commission or before the Commission 
gave you documents.  Is that correct?    
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes, it is the first time I see it.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well there is an entry on 1 June 
2010 in which an amount of 456 000,00 is paid to Risk 
10 
Stats 
Consulting. 
 
That 
what 
you 
may 
well 
have 
seen…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Chaskalson 665 you said?  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   665 Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me just, that is the red ones not the 
black one? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   No the black one 665 black.  
CHAIRPERSON:   The black one.   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   The 665 there in red there is no black 
there.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think what is confusing is that there 
are a number of pages which have only the red numbers.  I 
can see 597, I can see 604 then it looks like it skip a lot of 
pages that do not have the black numbers on my side.     
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair I must apologise for this, 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 97 of 397 
 
this is going to be, it is going to make this part of the cross 
examination particularly difficult because…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja the next number I have is a black 712 
but from 604 the next black page number is 712 so I do not 
know what happened with the pagination.  It maybe that it 
should be fixed during the lunch break.     
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair I think we must do that 
because otherwise, because we going to get in some detail 
bank transactions which will make this complicated.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I think 604 appears and it appears the 
10 
page next to it, the page after 604, black 604 is red 603 
but there is no black pagination for the red 603 and then 
you go on and on until the red 710 and red 710 is black 
712 and then between black 604 and black 712 it looks like 
there are no black numbers.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair I think what I must do 
because I doubt that we are going to be able to put black 
numbers on your file and Mr Ramosebudi’s file and all the 
legal teams file.  I must work out how my black numbers 
correlate to your red numbers…[intervene] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I think they could be put as long as 
the numbers are the same because the pages that have 
been skipped maybe are about 100 pages which could be 
done but if you have another way that can be used when 
we come back that is fine.  So we can do one of two things 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 98 of 397 
 
now it is about fourteen minutes to one we can either take 
the lunch break now and this can be attended to during the 
lunch break or we can use the last fourteen minutes of the 
time for you to ask on issues that do not require these 
pages.        
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair let us use the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And what we can then come 
back to tying up any references that we want. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is fine.  
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr Ramosebudi can I take you 
then to a document that is at black 714 and that document 
is dated – do you have the document Mr Ramosebudi? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   714? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   714.  
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Black? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Black 714.  
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And that is an email addressed 
from you to Mr Wood on 27 September 2010 again with an 
20 
attachment workbook 1.xlsx: 
“Dear Eric,

ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I see, are you saying you did not 
send this invoice to oh sorry do you recall sending this 
invoice to Mr Woods email on 4 October 2010? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson through yourself may I

CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I ask you to go to page 718 
that is another email addressed from you to Mr Wood on 4 
October 2010.  It has a different spreadsheet called 
workbook 2 attached to it, do you recall sending that email 
10

email apparently was sent it is 11:36 in the morning and it 
refers to invoice 202.  Do you recall sending that email to

was attached to it, it was at page 721 it is an invoice from 
Ka Ditlou Health Services trading as Rams Pharmacy,

MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson through yourself may I 
not respond to this one in case I incriminate myself.  
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 103 of 397 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see that oh okay I see that Ka Ditlou 
Health Services traded depending on whether it is still 
trading as Rams Pharmacy.  Am I correct in thinking that 
Rams is derived from part of your surname?   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   That is true Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright, thank you.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And it is your younger brother ’s 
business Ka Ditlou?  
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I am sorry I think we spoke at the 
10 
same time and that would also be your younger brother ’s 
surname?  
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can we go back up to page 85 I 
should have taken this a little earlier in the chronology.  Do 
you have page 85? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is an email sent from 
yourself to Eric Wood and it says forward, subject line is 
20 
forward invoice with tax calculation to dot xls and you can 
see – and then there is an attachment an invoice with tax 
calculations to dot xls.  You can see that what was 
forwarded if you go a little bit lower down was an email 
from 
you 
at 
your 
ACSA 
address 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 104 of 397 
 
VitoloRamosebudi@airport.co.za to yourself at your risk 
mats address with the same subject invoice with tax 
calculation to dot xls. Can I ask you first do you recall 
forwarding an email of this nature from your ACSA address 
to your risk mats address in May 2010?      
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Through yourself Chairperson I 
cannot recollect this.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay.  
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   It has been some time.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, and can I ask again do you 
10 
recall sending this email to Mr Wood on the same day 27 
May 2010?  
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I cannot recollect that Chairperson.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   You cannot recollect, well 
attached to that spreadsheet, attached to that email was a 
spreadsheet with seven different tabs.  Can we look at the 
first tab it is at page 86 it is an invoice in the name of 
Venus Liquor Store and can you just remind the Chair what 
Venus Liquor Store is?  
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Venus Liquor Store was my business 
20 
trading under Azana Markets.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And the invoices is billed to 
Niven Pillay of Regiments Capital we remember Mr Pillay.  
The description is provision of liquor beverages and 
catering services for the function at Regiments Capital an 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 105 of 397 
 
amount is 257 362,37 and when you add VAT that comes to 
293 393,10.  Do you recall sending this invoice to Mr Wood 
on 26 May 2010?     
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson through yourself may I 
not respond to this one in case I incriminate myself.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I then ask you do recall 
ever providing liquor to Regiments Capital for a function 
that was large enough to cost 257 000,00 in liquor in 
2010? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson with your persimmon may 
10 
I not respond to this one in case I incriminate myself.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   If you then can go down to page 
87 which was the second of the seven tabs on the 
spreadsheet that is another invoice from Venus Liquor 
Store also addressed to Niven Pillay of Regiments Capital.  
That is described provision of liquor beverages and 
catering services for the function at Regiments Capital that 
is 51 021,00 and then you’re in conference equipment 49 
150,00 a total of 100 171,00 and when you add VAT that 
20 
becomes a 114 194,94.  Do you recall sending this invoice 
to Mr Wood on 26 May 2010?     
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson through your persimmon 
may I not respond to this one in case I incriminate myself.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I ask you then did your 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 106 of 397 
 
business Venus Liquor Store ever provide venues and 
conference equipment to Regiments Capital?  
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Again Chairperson through your 
permission may I not respond to this one in case I 
incriminate myself.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can we go down to page 
88…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before we go to page 88 Mr Chaskalson 
so on the basis of the two invoices one at page 86 the 
10 
other one at page 87 it would appear that Venus Liquor 
Store sent invoices, two invoices at least on the same day 
in regard to the provision of liquor for which it charged 
probably about more than R400 000,00.     
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That would appears if you put 
the two together indeed Chair it is over 400 000,00. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, thank you.  We are at 1 
o’clock would this be a convenient time or you want 
to…[intervene]   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair…[intervene] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You can finish something if you want to.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   If we can just finish the invoices 
attached to that email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Page 88 invoice from Risk Stats 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 107 of 397 
 
Consulting to Regiments Capital for developing of the risk 
monitoring methodology for and on behalf of Regiments 
Capital 295 000,00 plus VAT which gives 336 300,00.  Do 
you recall sending this email to Mr Wood on the 26 t h May 
2010?   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I cannot recollect.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   You cannot recollect.   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I cannot, I cannot recollect.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No, no I heard your answer but 
in fairness to you, you have been asserting a right against 
10 
self-incrimination up till this point.    
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   That is exactly what it is.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I cannot recollect sending the email.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   You cannot recollect, okay.  
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I cannot respond. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but I think Mr Chaskalson wants to 
say to you Mr Ramosebudi if you say you cannot recall you 
are responding to the question.    
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Okay. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you must make up your mind whether 
you want to assert your privilege or you want to give an 
answer.  So he was seeking to make sure that you 
understand that, okay.    
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Just through yourself Chairperson I 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 108 of 397 
 
think the logic that I was using was that he was referring to 
an email then I say I cannot recall and then he referred to 
an invoice then I say I cannot respond. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no that is fine as long as you are 
aware it is maybe that you say in regard to a particular 
question you have an answer but in regard to another 
question you wish not to answer but he wants also to make 
sure that you understand.   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Okay.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Maybe if I can ask questions 
slightly differently did Risk Stats invoice Regiments Capital 
for the developing of a risk monitoring methodology for and 
on behalf of Regiments Capital on 26 May 2010?  
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson through yourself may I 
not respond to this one in case I incriminate myself.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then on page the following 
page 90 and invoice again from Risk Stats again 26 May 
2010 actuarial and risk management consulting on behalf 
of Regiments Capital for 946 017,00 plus VAT which is R1 
20 
078 456,30.  Did Risk Stats Consulting invoice Regiments 
for actuarial and risk management consulting on behalf of 
Regiments in an amount with VAT of 1 078 456,30 on 26 
May 2010?    
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Again through yourself Chairperson 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 109 of 397 
 
may I not respond to this one in case I incriminate myself.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then over the page, page 91 
another invoice from Risk Stats dated 26 May 2010 also for 
actuarial and risk management consulting on behalf of 
Regiments Capital this time the amount is 546 014,30 with 
VAT that goes to 622 456, 30.  Did Risk Stats issue this 
invoice to Regiments Capital on 26 May 2010?   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Through yourself Chairperson may I 
not respond to this one in case I incriminate myself.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then on page 92 another 
10 
Risk Stats invoice to Regiments for actuarial and risk 
management consulting on behalf of Regiments for 400 
000,00 plus 56 000,00 VAT 456 000,00 in all.  Did Risk 
Stats issue Regiments with this invoice in May 2010?  
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Through yourself Chairperson again 
with this one may I not respond to it in case I incriminate 
myself.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair we have now reached the 
end of those seven invoices that were attached to the 
email of 26 May and would this be a convenient time to 
20 
break?  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 Yes, 
just 
before 
we 
do 
that 
Mr 
Ramosebudi do you have any qualifications for providing 
actuarial services, yourself?  
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson if you go to my 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 110 of 397 
 
statements it clearly articulates my qualifications, I have 
got a very strong mathematical background. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mathematical background, yes.    
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Ja, which deals with a whole number 
of issues actuarial, risk management so that if my forte, 
that is my experience.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay, no then that is fine.  Okay let 
us take the lunch adjournment we will resume at ten past 
two, we adjourn.  
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
10 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  DCJ if we can continue then to 
page 723 – in fact 722 black 722.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Did you devise a plan how to 
handle? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  When we get to the ones that we 
need red numbers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I will refer only to the red numbers.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I have worked out how to reconcile 
them Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 722 you said? 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 111 of 397 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  722 black. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  720 red. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So that is an email addressed from 
you to Mr Wood on the 20 April 2012 it says: 
“Dear Eric.  Please receive the attached.  
Regards.” 
 
Do you recall sending it to Mr Woods – Mr Wood on 
the 20 April 2012? 
10 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  I am sorry Chairperson I think even this 
one Chairperson may I not respond it in case I incriminate 
myself? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can I ask you in relation 723 which 
is the attachment it is a spread sheet with two tabs.  Well let 
us start with the one on 722 which is an invoice addressed to 
Regiments Capital for the development of an enterprise wide 
risk management framework for R212 000.00 no VAT from 
Rams Capital.  Did Rams Capital issue this invoice to 
20 
Regiments Capital in April 2012?  That was my question did 
it – did Rams Capital issue this invoice to Regiments Capital 
in April 2012? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  I am sorry Chairperson I may not be 
able to respond to this one in case I incriminate myself. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 112 of 397 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can I – can I ask – the strange 
thing about the spread sheet and – is that there are two 
invoices on it.  There is the one we have just dealt with but 
there is another one addressed to Mr William Matamele that 
is at page 723.  Do you know a Mr William Matamele? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  Chairperson similar to the previous one 
may I not respond to it in case I incriminate myself. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And just for completeness sake did 
Rams Capital issue an invoice to William Matamele in – for 
the amount of R540 000.00 for the development of an 
10 
enterprise wide risk management framework in April 2012? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  Again with your permission Chairperson 
may I not respond to this one in case I incriminate myself. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can we go to – I think we have 
reached the end of these for now we will come back to one a 
bit later.  Can I take you now to some bank statements and 
the first one that I would ask you go to is on page 604 in the 
red numbers.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you going to use red numbers? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Red numbers for the bank 
20 
statements Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Because they are the ones which 
do not have black numbers on them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will just have to for the record say that 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 113 of 397 
 
in regard to this bundle most of the time the numbers for the 
pagination that I used are the black numbers but for – in 
regard to a small portion of the bundle the red numbers will 
be used.  The red numbers that are used are on pages that 
do not have black numbers.  Is that correct Mr Chaskalson? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  That is correct Chairman.  It might 
be simpler if whenever I refer to a red number I say red 
number. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja.  So when you do not refer to the 
colour  
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  It is black. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is black.  Or if you obviously if you say 
black number it will black number.  But if it is red you will 
always say red number. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I will Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So if we look at red number 604 it 
is a statement for Regiments Capital from Nedbank for the 
month of November 2009.  If you go down to – most of it is 
redacted but there are two entries which unfortunately not 
20 
very legible because they have been highlighted as well as 
not been redacted but it is 11 November 2009 with the 
reference Ka Ditlou Health and an amount of R336 300.00 
that was paid out of the Regiments Capital account.  Are you 
aware of a payment from Regiments to Ka Ditlou of 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 114 of 397 
 
R336 300.00 on 11 November 2009? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Chaskalson I do not see that 
on page red 604. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Chair if you go down to the – the 
yellow – the only yellow entry there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Because it is highlighted it is not 
very legible but it is 11.11.2009 is the date. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Ka Ditlou Health  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Or Ka Dittou I do not think there is 
a L that Regiments put into their reference.  Ka Dittou Health 
and the amount is R336 300.00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the number that I cannot see.  I can 
see date 11.11.2009 and then I see Venus Liquor and then I 
see 114,194,94.  That is page 604 somewhere to on the last 
third of the darkened portion.  Are we on the same page? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  No we are not Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I thought I had solved this problem 
but I evidently have not.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Nedbank documents that I have got – 
statement but… 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Oh Chair I now understand the 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 115 of 397 
 
problem.  Mr Ramosebudi I withdraw that last question 
because the entry I was speaking to has been redacted in 
everybody else’s document.  We are on the right page.  So 
let us look at the one that is visible.  11.11.2009 Venus 
Liquor 
R114 194.94. 
 
Do 
you 
recall 
a 
payment 
from 
Regiments Capital to Venus Liquor on 11 November 2009 for 
R114 184.94? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  Previous Chairperson may I ask that I 
might not be able to respond to this one in case I incriminate 
myself. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can we then go to red number 
626?   That is a bank statement for Regiments Capital for 
the month of December 2009 and – sorry if we go back up to 
624.  I beg your pardon 624.  625 – 625 – 625 red 625.  Are 
you at red 625?  Sorry Mr Ramosebudi are you at red 625? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  Yes I am at 625 the red one. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And there on the 10 – that is a 
statement for Regiments Capital of the month of November – 
sorry December 2009 and there we see an entry on 10 
20 
December 2009 a payment to Risk Stats and the amount is 
R336 300.00 – R336 300.00.  Do you recall a payment to 
Risk Stats by Regiments Capital in December 2009 in the 
amount of R336 300.00? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  With your permission Chairperson may I 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 116 of 397 
 
not respond to this one in case I incriminate myself. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Chair if I might ask just to make a 
note against this page that it corresponds to the amount on 
the invoice that one sees at page 88.  If we can then go  
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that page? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  88. 
CHAIRPERSON:  88 okay.  Thank you. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  If we can then go to page 647?  
Red page 647.  Again a Regiments Capital bank statement 
for the month of March 2010 and there on the 2 March you 
10 
will 
see 
an 
entry 
that 
says 
Risk 
Stats 
Consulting 
R350 541.71.  Do you recall a payment from Regiments 
Capital to Risk Stats Consulting on 2 March 2010? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  With your permission Chairperson may I 
not respond to this one in case I incriminate myself. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Chair if I might just refer you to 
the cross-reference to the invoice at page 89 in the same 
amount. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  89 Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  89 Ja.  The amounts correspond? 
ADV 
CHASKALSON 
SC: 
 
The 
amounts 
correspond 
R350 541.71. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  If we can then go down to page 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 117 of 397 
 
667?   
CHAIRPERSON:  667?  Did you say 667? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  667 indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay right. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Sorry Chair before we get to 66 – 
667 while we on that invoice can we – sorry that payment 
can we – can we go to 687 – 687 first?  687.  And maybe go 
back up a page to 686 to see what we are looking at.  Mr 
10 
Ramosebudi do you recognise the document at red 686?  It 
appears to be an FNB bank statement for Risk Maths 
Solution for the month of – month ending 10 March 2010? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  With your permission Chairperson may I 
not respond to this one in case I incriminate myself. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Chair I will then take you down to 
page 687 and there you will see the entry for 2 March 2010 
of a credit of R350 541.71 with the trans – the transaction 
reference Regiments Capital.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And Mr Ramosebudi I have already 
asked whether you recognise the document or recall this 
transaction.  I am not going to ask that question again.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no I said through yourself Chairperson 
may I not respond to this one in case I incriminate myself. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 118 of 397 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Then Chair can we go to page 
667?  Red 667.  And that is a bank statement of Regiments 
Capital for the month ending 31 May 2010.  If one goes down 
to 4 May 2010 one sees a payment with the reference Risk 
Stats Consulting in the amount of R622 456.30.  Mr 
Ramosebudi do you recall a payment to Risk Stats from 
Regiments Consulting on 4 May 2010 in the amount of R622 
– R622 456.30? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  I humbly request Chairperson with your 
permission that I might not be able to respond to this one in 
10 
case I incriminate myself. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Chair if I can ask you to make the 
annotation there at page – that this corresponds to the 
invoice amount at page 91.   
CHAIRPERSON:  At page 891? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  No, no 91 – 91.  Just 91 the bank 
is at 91 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The black 91.  Okay.  Yes sure thank you. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And if I can ask you Mr 
Ramosebudi then to go to red page 798?   
20 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  I am on the page. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  If you can go up a page the 
document appears to be an FNB bank statement for Risk 
Maths Solutions for the month ending 10 May 2010.  Do you 
recognise this document? 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 119 of 397 
 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  Again Chairperson may I not be able to 
respond to this one in case I incriminate myself. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Then Mr Ramosebudi I will – on 
the next page which is 708 there is an entry 4 May in the 
amount – with a credit of R622 456.30 with the reference 
Regiments Capital.  I have already asked you whether you 
recall such a payment from Regiments Capital to Risk Maths 
in May 2010 and whether you recognise this document I will 
not ask those questions again.  But can I ask you to go to 
page 661. 
10 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  Red or black? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Sorry red thank you.  Red 661.  
That document appears – appears to be a bank statement of 
Regiments Capital – it is a bank statement of Regiments 
Capital that we have got – received from Nedbank for the 
month ending 31 July 2010.  And there is an entry on 30 July 
2010 for a payment to Risk Stats or payment reference Risk 
Stats in the amount of R456 00.00.  Do you recall a payment 
to Risk Stats from Regiments Capital in late July or early 
August 2010? 
20 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  Again Chairperson with your permission 
may I not be able to respond to this one in case I incriminate 
myself. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Chair for your note can you make a 
record that that corresponds to an invoice at page 92 – 92 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 120 of 397 
 
and can we then move to red page 698. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Chaskalson I hope that somebody has 
done the sums so that I – at the end of looking at all of these 
amounts I would like to have an idea about what the total is.  
Maybe if that has not been done somebody might do it while 
we are going on with it.  I would like to have an idea how 
much appears to have been paid by Regiments into the 
entities that may be connected with the witness. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Indeed Chair.  I will ask Mr Zama 
to do it I am sure he has them on a spread sheet. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And what – I think that there will 
be – we can do three columns Chair.  We can do a column of 
invoice – invoices, a column of payments that reflect in 
statements linked to the Regiments Group and a statement 
and a column of statements that reflect in entities linked to 
the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And an aggregate column because 
there are some invoices without corresponding payments and 
20 
some payments without corresponding invoices.  Chair if we 
can then go to page 656?  Red 656 – red 656.  That is the 
Nedbank bank statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I was seeing Mr Chaskalson I was 
seeing a certain name on that page.  I am not going to 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 121 of 397 
 
mention it but it is of political grouping.  But obviously that is 
not what we are traversing on. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  No, no not now Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  We – for now in fact our copies 
and the copies that the public will see are completely 
redacted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  But for the entry at 25 June 2010. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja 656 is the page you said we must go 
10 
to? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So that is a bank statement of 30 – 
month ending 30 June 2010 for Regiments Capital.  And 
there is an entry on the 25 June 2010 that reflects a payment 
in the amount of R467 476.86 with the reference Risk Stats 
Consulting Services.  Do you recall a payment from 
Regiments Capital to Risk Stats in or around 25 June 2010 
Mr Ramosebudi? 
20 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  With your permission Chairperson may I 
not be able to respond to this in case I incriminate myself. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I will then move on Mr Ramosebudi 
to page – red 701.  And sorry Chair just for your information 
this is – that last line item we have not linked to any 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 122 of 397 
 
particular invoice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Red 701 if we go up to red 700 this 
appears to be a bank statement for Risk Maths for the month 
to 10 November 2010.  Mr Ramosebudi can you confirm that? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  Chairperson I am not going to confirm 
anything in case I incriminate myself on this matter. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Thank you Mr Ramosebudi.  Of- 
the very first entry on page 701 at 11 October is a credit for 
R460 099.43 with the reference Cash Flow Cash Regiments 
10 
Capital and I have already asked you whether you recall a 
payment in this amount from Regiments Capital in October 
2011 – sorry October 2010 have I?  Well let me ask now.  Do 
you recall a payment… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it is safer – it is safer that you ask him 
and let him assert his privilege if he wants to asset it and let 
it be on record. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can – do you recall a payment? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  Chairperson I have already indicated I 
think Mr Chaskalson has asked a number of these invoices 
20 
and amounts and I said I am not able to respond to that in 
case I incriminate myself Chairperson [00:24:06]. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And you have confirmed already 
that you cannot answer whether this is the bank statement of 
Risk Maths for the month ending 10 November 2010.  So can 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 123 of 397 
 
I then ask that we go to page 463 – red 463.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I see that at red … 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  663 I beg your pardon.  I slipped 
200 pages.  663. 
CHAIRPERSON:  663 okay.  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  That is a – oh no Chair I am sorry I 
have gone backwards we have already dealt with this one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can I ask that we go to page 701?   
CHAIRPERSON:  Red 701? 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Red 701 sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Chair I must apologise I am taking 
us backwards and forwards to the same documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Red 693 – 693.  If we go up to 692 
or 691 we have the cover page of what appears to be an 
FNB bank statement for Risk Maths Solutions for the month 
ending June 2010 – 10 June 2010 and Mr Ramosebudi can 
you confirm that that is a bank statement for Risk Maths 
20 
Solutions for the month ending June 2010 – 10 June 2010? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  Chairperson may I not respond to this 
one in case I incriminate myself. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  If we then go down to 693 we see 
an entry for 1 June with the transaction reference Regiments 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 124 of 397 
 
Capital and a credit of R456 00.00.  Mr Ramosebudi do you 
recall a payment from Regiments Capital to Risk Maths in 
June 2010 in the amount of R456 000.00? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  To yourself Chairperson may I not 
respond to this one in case I incriminate myself. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Chair if I might give a cross-
reference in respect of this payment it is a link to the invoice 
on page 713 the corresponding amount of the invoice on 
page 713 and if we can then go to page 663?  And that is the 
corresponding 
bank 
account 
of 
– 
bank 
statement 
for 
10 
Regiments Capital for the month of June 2010 and on... 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on.  I am at 663. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Red 663. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Red 663. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Red 663. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but I do not have any underlining that I 
made in – on this page but I see that we have been to the 
page. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I am looking at – I may have taken 
us here when I – I think I took us here earlier when I was 
20 
struggling with the red numbers and the black numbers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  But if you – Chair if you go to 1 
June 2010 on that page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes I can see Risk Stats Consulting 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 125 of 397 
 
there. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  There is the payment out of this 
account with the reference Risk Stats Consulting with the 
amount of R456 000.00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And Mr Ramosebudi you have 
already confirmed that you cannot answer the question 
whether you recall such a payment to Risk Stats from 
Regiments on the 1 June 2010.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And does it correspond with an invoice 
10 
somewhere or not really? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  It corresponds with the invoice at 
page 713 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At page 713. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can we then go down to red 
number 6 – or go up to red number 643?  That is a bank 
statement for Regiments Capital for the month ending 30 
October 2010 and if we go down to 9 October 2010, we see a 
20 
payment of – the amount of R 337 896,00, referenced as 
Azana Capital Markets.  Mr Ramosebudi, do you recall a 
payment from Regiments Capital to Azana Capital Markets in 
October 2010? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Through myself Chairperson, may I not 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 126 of 397 
 
respond to this one in case I incriminate myself? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, if you can just put the 
reference that this payment corresponds to page 717, the 
invoice from 717? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And if you we can then go to page 
685?   
CHAIRPERSON:   685? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Correct.  685 Chair, 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And if we go.  So we will see the 
heading of this document.  This appears to be the FNB bank 
statement for Azana Capital Markets for the month ending 
14 October 2010.  Mr Ramosebudi, can you confirm that this 
is the Azana Capital Markets’ bank statement for the month 
ending 14 October 2010? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Through myself Chairperson, may I not 
respond to this one in case I incriminate myself? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply] 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then Mr Ramosebudi, if you 
can go down a page to 685?  The entry, 9 October has a 
transaction reference, Regiments Capital and the amount is 
R 337 896 corresponding to the amount that we saw on the 
Regiments Capital’s bank statement.   
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 127 of 397 
 
 
You have already confirmed that you cannot answer the 
question, whether you record a payment in this amount to 
Azana Capital Markets in October 2010. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You say the amount at page 685 
corresponds with the invoice at what page? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   It is also 717 Chair.  So it 
corresponds with 717 and the Regiments’ bank statement at 
643.  It is 643.  Red 643. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then Chair, if we can go to red 
610? 
CHAIRPERSON:   We have to remember Mr Chaskalson that, 
all those who will read the transcript, we said whenever we 
mean the red numbers, we will always say red. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I did, in fact, say red. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So when we do not say red, they will think 
it is the black numbers. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   This is red 610. 
CHAIRPERSON:   601.  Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is an extract from Regiments 
Capital’s bank statement for the month ending 30 April 2011.  
If you go down to 15 April 2011, there is an amount 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313

payment to Ka Ditlou Health Services in April 2011 in the 
amount of R 212 964.47? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson, with your permission, may 
I not respond to this one in case I incriminate myself? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply] 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, for your reference.  That 
corresponds to the invoice on page 721 and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that now the amount at page red 610? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It corresponds...  It corresponds with the 
amount at the invoice at what page? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   721, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then Chair, if we can go to page 
614 red?   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And that again, is an extract from 
Regiments Capital’s bank statement for the month ending 
30 June 2011.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313

Services in June 2011 in the amount of R 224 934.47? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   With your permission Chairperson, may 
I not respond to this one in case I incriminate myself? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, we do not have a 
10 
corresponding invoice for this amount but if I can ask Chair 
to go to page red 675? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And there Chair, if one goes up to 
673, one sees that although the reference was Ka Ditlou 
Health Services, the bank statement we are looking at is 
Risk Maths Solutions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV 
CHASKALSON 
SC: 
 
 
For

Page 130 of 397 
 
one in case I incriminate myself? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   If we go down to page 675 against 
2 June, we see a credit of R 224 934.47 with reference 
Regiments Capital.  Mr Ramosebudi, I earlier asked you if 
you can recall a payment from Regiments to Ka Ditlou Health 
Services in June in this amount. 
 
I must now ask you whether you can recall a payment 
from Regiments in June 2010 to Risk Maths in this amount of 
R 224 934.47? 
10 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson, through your permission, 
may I not respond to this one in case I incriminate myself?

CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, if you can then go to page

ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And if we go up to red 677, we

Mr Ramosebudi, can you confirm that this is the Risk

CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   If we go down to 678 Chair, we 
see the corresponding entry on 19 August 2011 with the 
corresponding credit of R 289 074.85 in the account of Risk 
Math Solutions with the reference Regiments Capital.   
20 
 
Mr Ramosebudi 
has 
also 
– 
has 
already 
claimed 
privileged in relation to whether he can recall a payment of 
this nature at that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can we then Chair go to page 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 132 of 397 
 
629?  Red 629. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And Chair this is the Nedbank 
statement for Regiments Capital’s account for the month 
ending 31 March 2012.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   If one goes down to 9 March 2012, 
one sees an entry with a reference Ka Ditlou Health Services 
and the payment amount is R 299 874.96. 
 
Mr Ramosebudi, can you recall a payment of this 
10 
amount, R 299 874.96 to Ka Ditlou Health Services from 
Regiments Capital in March 2012? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   With your permission Chairperson, may 
I not respond to this one in case I incriminate myself? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And Chair, if I can ask you then to 
go to red page 629? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Oh, sorry.  We are at red 629. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We need to go to red 681.   
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And if we go up to red 680.  
Mr Ramosebudi, can you confirm that this is the FNB bank 
statement for the Risk Math Solutions’ account for the month 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 133 of 397 
 
ending 20 March 2012? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   With your permission Chairperson, may 
I not respond to this one in case I incriminate myself? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And Chair, if we go down at to 
681, we see on 9 March, there is a credit of R 299 874.96 
corresponding to the credit that we see on the Regiments 
account with the reference Ka Ditlou but this reference is 
Regiment Capital and it is in a Risk Math’s bank statement. 
 
So Mr Ramosebudi, a pity I must ask you again.  Do you 
10 
recall a payment from Regiments Capital to Risk Maths in or 
around 9 March 2012 in the amount of R 299 874.96? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   With your permission Chairperson, may 
I not respond to this one in case I incriminate myself? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But then Mr Ramosebudi, can we 
go to page 130?  One, three, zero.  Black one, three zero.  
We have not dealt with this invoice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Please just repeat the page 
number? 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   130. 
CHAIRPERSON:   130.  And again, still red? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No, no.  This is a black number 
Chair of 130. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 134 of 397 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And Mr Ramosebudi, what we see 
on 130 is an email dated 29 October 2013.  It is sent from 
your Rams cap(?) address, phetolo@ramscap.co.za to Eric 
Wood with the subject: Book 2.XLSX and an attachment of a 
spreadsheet called Book 2.XLSX.   
 
Do you recall sending this email to Mr wood on the 
29t h of October 2013? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   With your permission Chairperson, may 
I not respond to this one in case I incriminate myself? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply] 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   if we go over the page to 131, we 
see an invoice from Rams Capital to Regiments Capital for 
Actuarial and Risk Management Consulting on behalf of 
Regiments Capital for Transnet.   
 
The amount is R 375 606.00.  There is no VAT raised on 
that amount.  So the total amount of the invoice is 
R 375 606.00. 
 
Mr Ramosebudi, did Rams Capital issue an invoice to 
Regiments Capital for the amount of R 375 606.00 towards 
to the end of...  Sorry.  On or around 29 October 2013? 
20 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Through yourself Chairperson, may I 
not respond to this one in case I incriminate myself? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, can I ask that you flag this 
document because we are going to come back to it in due 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 135 of 397 
 
course? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But for now, I would ask that you 
go to page 652? 
CHAIRPERSON:   And are we only into black numbers now 
or ...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry.  Sorry, Chair.  It is red 652. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Yes? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And Chair, this is a Standard Bank 
statement 
for 
Regiments 
Capital. 
 
It 
is 
dated 
10 
13 November 2013.  And if you go down to the last 
transaction 
on 
this 
statement, 
there 
is 
a 
transaction 
described as Caps third party payment Rams Capital.  It is at 
eleven, 16:00.   
 
The amount is R 375 606.00 and the date is 11/07.  
Eleven referring to the month and the seven the day. 
 
Mr Ramosebudi, can you confirm that Regiments Capital 
paid Rams Capital an amount of R 375 606.00 on or around 
7 November 2013? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson, through yourself, may I 
20 
not respond to this one in case I incriminate myself? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, can I ask you – and this is 
the amount corresponding to the invoice that we see on 131 
Chair. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 136 of 397 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And it will appear in the Rams...  
Well, it will appear in another account at red page 690. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And if you go up to red 689 Chair, 
there is the cover page.  Mr Ramosebudi, can you confirm 
that this is the Risk Math Solution bank statement from FNB 
for the month ending 9 November 2013? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Again, Chairperson.  May I not respond 
to this question in case I incriminate myself? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, if you go down to red 690, 
you will see that there is an entry, also 7 November with the 
reference Regiments Capital and the same amount of 
R 375 606.00 as a credit. 
 
Mr Ramosebudi, I must ask you.  My last question was in 
relation to Rams Capital.  So I must now ask you whether 
you recall a payment from Regiments Capital to Risk Maths 
in 
the 
amount 
of 
R 375 606.00 
on 
or 
around 
7 November 2013? 
20 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson, may I not respond to this 
question in case I incriminate myself? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then Chair, if I can ask you to go 
to red 671? 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 137 of 397 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then go up to the cover page 
on 670. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr Ramosebudi, can you confirm 
that we see on 670 is the bank statement for Risk Math 
Solutions for the month ending 10 January 2011? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson, may I not respond to this 
question in case I incriminate myself? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply] 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   If we go down to page 671 red, we 
see 
an 
entry 
on 
18 
December 
which 
will 
be 
18 December 2010 with the reference Regiments Capital and 
a payment amount of R 227 601.00 as a credit.  A credit in 
the Risk Math’s account from Regiments Capital. 
 
Mr Ramosebudi, 
do 
you 
recall 
a 
payment 
from 
Regiments Capital to Risk Math in December 2010 in the 
amount of R 227 601.00? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   With your permission Chairperson, may 
I not respond to this one in case I incriminate myself? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then Chair...  We can finally move 
on to a new topic Chair.  We have dealt with all of the 
invoices and all of the bank statements. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Do you know whether your team is 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 138 of 397 
 
ready with the total of the amounts or not yet? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We do have them Chair.  If you 
can give me a minute.  I will just... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes-no, that is fine. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   ...ask them to give it to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And if needs be, it can be done later if it 
is more convenient.  I just want to, in the end, to have some 
idea. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, the total invoices issued to 
Regiments Capital are R 9 132 490,39.  And the total 
10 
payments out of Regiments Capital accounts with references 
linked to one or more of – one or other of the entities that we 
have been describing is R 5 173 013.66. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, we started this trip through 
the bank statements while we were still discussing ACSA.  
There are one or two further issues in relation to ACSA that I 
would like to raise with Mr Ramosebudi.   
 
Can I start by – when we get back to ACSA by asking 
you, Mr Ramosebudi to go to black page 105  And henceforth 
20 
Chair, I will just be referring to black page numbers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  105? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   105.  And, Mr Ramosebudi, are 
you at black 105? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Black 105. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 139 of 397 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you go to the email at the – it 
is an email trial but can you go to the email, the last email 
that one sees at the bottom of that page.  It is from Mario 
Viznenza to Aubrey Maklabe(?) copied to yourself, William 
Clue, Solomon Gwaza(?) and Moss Brickman.  Do you see 
that, 5 April 2011 at 12:07? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Do you see that email? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I see the email. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And he says: 
10 
“Hi Aubrey.  Unwind valuations of the CPI swaps as 
at 31 March 2011 were as follows.” 
 
And he lists the three swaps by trade number.  And for 
the one it is minus R 93 423 295,00.  For the other it is 
minus 
R 73 295 235. 
 
And 
for 
the 
last, 
it 
is 
minus 
R 45 481 153,00. 
 
Now can I ask you, first of all, is – are these three CPI’s 
boxes referring to the three CPI’s box that we discussed 
earlier in your evidence? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson, I am not sure which one 
20 
that this was.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I am not sure which ...[indistinct] are 
these ones.  That is probably one of those ...[indistinct]  
[Speaker is not clear.] 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 140 of 397 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   You will recall the spreadsheet 
that had the R 1.5 billion bar plus 2.6% which was then 
broken up into 2A, 2B and 2C.  I can take you back to that if 
you would like.  But my question is.  Are these 2A, 2B and 
2C? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I cannot confirm Chairperson.  I do not 
know. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay.  Can you then tell the 
Chair...  Well, I mean, we have established whether they are 
or not.  But can you tell the Chair what unwind valuations 
10 
are?  Let us assume for present purposes they are to...  
Well, there are three swaps.  What is unwind valuation 
means? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   In the simplest terms Chairperson, 
unwind means to cancel the transaction. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So if ABSA wanted to cancel these 
three 
swaps, 
it 
would 
have 
to 
pay 
to 
Nedbank 
R 93 423 million on the first.  R 73.295 million on the second 
and R 45.481 on the third.  Is that correct? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   That is the indication on the email, yes. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes.  And if we go on a month or 
so.  Actually, it is more than a month.  If we go up to page 
104, you will see another email from Mario to William Clue 
and you have copied yourself on 19 July 2011. 
 
And now the unwind valuations have actually gotten 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 141 of 397 
 
worse by ACSA. 
“Hi, 
William. 
 
Unwind 
valuations 
as 
at 
30 June 2011 were as follows. 
First trade, R 126 360 000,00.  Second trade, 
R 100 513 000,00. 
 
Last 
trade, 
R 65 834 000,00.” 
 
So those are the amounts that ACSA would now have to 
pay Nedbank to get out of these swaps.  Is that correct? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   True. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Are you aware of any other swaps 
10 
that ACSA had?  Any other CPI swaps that ACSA had with 
Nedbank on or around – during 2011, other than those three 
that we have talked about, 2A, 2B and 2C? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I cannot recall it now. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   You cannot recollect?   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I am talking specifically about CPI 
swaps. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Ja, I cannot recall it. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay. 
20 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I know CPI bonds ...[indistinct]  
[Speaker is not clear.] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, you know? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   CPI bonds. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I am sorry.  Mr Ramosebudi, I 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 142 of 397 
 
must apologise. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   CPI bonds.  There was a CPI bond.  I 
cannot recall any other swap. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes.  So, but I am not asking 
about a CPI bond.  I am asking you about a CPI swap. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I cannot recall. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   You cannot recall? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But of course, we would be able to 
establish whether we are talking about those three swaps if 
10 
we look for – if we look for them by trade number, would we 
not?  Well, it says Trade 9085799.  That is a very specific 
transaction.  It will be recorded somewhere. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   For the settlement of the agreement. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   And the ...[indistinct]  
[Speaker is not clear.]   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So we will follow that up.  But 
20 
whatever these transactions were as at 30 June 2011 for 
ACSA to escape them, it would have cost ACSA in the region 
of R 290 million.  Is that correct? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Can you repeat that? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So as at 30 June 2011, if ACSA 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 143 of 397 
 
wanted to avoid these transactions, get out them, it was 
going to cost ACSA R 290 million.  More than R 290 million, 
these three transactions.  Is that correct? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   If those numbers add up to two hundred 
plus. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes.  Well, they go a little bit 
beyond R 290 million.  They are beyond R 292 million.  Can 
we then go down to page 113? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say one, one, three? 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   One, one, three Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   You do not need to go back but I 
do want to ask another question, just from the top that we 
have just left.  Mr Ramosebudi, I said that for ACSA to 
escape 
those 
transactions, 
it 
would 
have 
cost ACSA 
R 292 million.  Do you recall?  Yes? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I trust your calculation, yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes.  You earlier said that on the 
date that the transaction is entered into, it should have a null 
20 
value.   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   True. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So if ACSA wanted day one it 
should have cost ACSA almost nothing, is that correct? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   If you compare the schedule, yes, it 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 144 of 397 
 
should be zero. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Alright, so that swap has gone 
against ACSA to the tune of about 292 million by June 
2011, is that correct? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   True. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can we then – so now we are at 
page 113.  Towards the bottom of the page there is an 
email from Tebogo Labalo to Mario Visinenza(?) and copied 
to Eric Wood. 
“Dear 
Mario, 
please 
send 
me 
the 
cash 
flow 
10 
schedule 
for 
Regiments 
Capital 
detailed 
the 
amounts and the expected timing of the cash 
flows.” 
And signed by Tebogo Labalo.  Do you know who Tebogo 
Labalo is or was at the time? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Ja, I think he is one of the guys who 
used to work at Regiments. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   One of the guys? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   He used to work for Regiments. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then if we go – that was 7 
December and we go up to 8 December 2015.  If we go to 
1112, page 1112.  Do you have 1112? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   The black numbers? 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 145 of 397 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Black page, going forward it is 
just black pages. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Okay, 1112 I see is an email. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is correct.  It is an email 
from Eric Wood to Boitumelo Mapasa forwarding a cash 
flow schedule which says Regiments summary of payments 
– 
it 
is 
an 
cash 
flow 
schedule 
with 
an 
attachment 
Regiments summary of payments but the forwarding email 
is lower down on the chain and that email is from Mario 
Visinenza again to Tebogo Labalo on 8 December 2015, it 
10 
is the response to Tebogo’s request give us the cash flo w 
schedules and it says: 
“Please see attached summary spreadsheet.” 
If we go up to page 411 we see the attachment that was 
with that email and you will see that what that spreadsheet 
has on it is a whole series of amounts in respect of ACSA 
in the first instance and then the City of Tswane three 
separate transactions there but I am just going to ask you 
about ACSA and …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Chaskalson, did you say 
20 
we must go to page 411? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, 111. 
CHAIRPERSON:   111. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Volume – bundle 4, 4-111, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 146 of 397 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I want to ask you about these 
ACSA flows.  Would these be the fees that Nedbank is 
going to pay Regiments in terms of the swaps that Nedbank 
brokered between ACSA and Nedbank?  Does that look to 
you what they are describing? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I do not know what they are 
describing, these numbers are [indistinct – dropping voice] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay, well I want to put it to you 
that these are the fees that – well, there will be evidence 
to show that these are the fees on that swap that Nedbank 
10 
would be paying Regiments and recovering from ACSA on 
the – I think it was 10 basis points.  So the initial payment 
of 9.460 million, a payment a year later of 1 179 000, a 
payment 
in 
2012, 
1 253 000, 
a 
payment 
in 
2013, 
1 323 000, a payment in 2014 of 1 416 000, payment in 
2015, 1 515 000 and then payments going on into the 
future projected because remember this document is only 
written in December 2015, projected payments going 
through in 2016,2017, 2018 and 2019.  And maybe if I can 
take you back, just to illustrate some of these – illustrate 
20 
my point.  If you go to page 108, black 108.  Are you on 
108? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON 
SC:  And you will see 108 is 
Regiments invoice to Nedbank 28 March 2013, the amount 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 147 of 397 
 
is the 1.3 million that we see on that spreadsheet and 
again it refers to origination and facilitation of 1.5 billion 
interest rate swap transactions between Nedbank Capital 
and ACSA and that 1.5 billion transaction was the one with 
2A, 2B and 2C.  If you go over the page you will see 31 
March 2014, Nedbank’s invoice, the next year.  Sorry, 
Regiments’ invoice to Nedbank the next year, goes to Mr 
Brickman in the amount of 1 416 424, again the same 
description, 
origination 
and 
facilitation 
of 
1.5 
billion 
interest rate swap transactions between Nedbank and 
10 
ACSA.  Over the page to 110, 31 March 2015.  This time 
Nedbank paid – or Regiments invoiced Nedbank 1.5 
million, origination and facilitation of 1.5 billion interest 
rate swap transactions between Nedbank and ACSA and if 
you go back to page 111 now, will you accept when I put it 
to you that these are Nedbank’s recordings of what it will 
be paying Regiments in relation to the ACSA swap? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   You do, thank you.  And just to 
confirm to the Chair, each one of these payments Nedbank 
20 
will in due course recover from ACSA through that 10 basis 
point increase on the spread of the swap, is that correct? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So these amounts are really 
being paid to Regiments by ACSA not by Nedbank. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 148 of 397 
 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you.  I think that 
concludes ACSA.  Can we move now to SAA and can we 
start on page 115?  And my first question to you is can you 
just refresh our memory, when did you become Treasurer at 
SAA? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Through yourself, Chairperson, it 
could be November 2011 or December 2011, I cannot recall 
that properly. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Towards the end of 2011? 
10 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   You were certainly Treasurer at 
SAA by 14 October 2013. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes I was in Treasury. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I ask you, if one goes to 
page 115, there is an email, it is addressed from your 
Rams Capital address, email address to Eric Wood, subject 
is 
Forward 
Working 
Capital 
Scope 
of 
Work 
and 
an 
attachment is working capital scope of work.doc, so it is a 
MS word file, working capital scope of work and if one goes 
20 
a little bit lower down one sees that that message 
originated in a message that you sent from your SAA 
address, Phetolo Ramosebudi at FlySAA.com to your Rams 
Capital address, Phetolo@ramscapital.co.za. So first of all 
can I ask you do you recall sending this message or a 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 149 of 397 
 
message with that attachment from your SAA address to 
your Rams Cap address? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson, I am here to assist, you 
know, the Chairperson and the Commission to investigate 
any malfeasance in the public sector and any other state 
organs.  Unfortunately, there are certain things I cannot 
assist you on and in particular this particular transaction I 
cannot 
assist. 
 
Unfortunately, 
I 
cannot 
answer 
any 
questions related to this in case I incriminate myself. 
ADV 
CHASKALSON 
SC: 
 
 
I 
appreciate 
that, 
Mr 
10 
Ramosebudi, but I am afraid I have to put the questions to 
you nonetheless, so we can maybe move quite quickly 
through here but I do need to put the questions to you and 
some of them you may well – some of them you may find 
are not – you are capable of answering. 
 
The first question was -  you could not answer my 
question about whether you forwarded that document to 
your – from your SAA address to your Rams Cap address.  
The second question is, do you recall then sending that 
document from your Rams Cap address to Eric Wood on 
20 
and around 14 October 2013? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Again through yourself, Chairperson, 
may I not respond to this one in case I incriminate myself. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   The document, that is the 
attachment, starts at page 116.  Can you go to page 116?  
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 150 of 397 
 
What it looks like, consistent with how it is described in the 
email, is the draft scope of work for a tender at SAA.  Can 
I ask – and it is called working capital management scope 
of work.  Can I ask whether you recall this document, 
whether you can identify it? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson, I humbly request that I 
do not respond to this question in case I incriminate 
myself. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I then take you to page 119 
and the – again there is an email chain that originates with 
10 
an email from your SAA address on 24 October to your 
Rams Cap address and is then forwarded from your Rams 
Cap address to Eric Wood and the document attached is 
called the valuation criteria.  Can I ask you first whether 
you recall sending that email from your FlySAA address to 
your Rams Cap address? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson, you will excuse me, you 
know, for not responding to this question, I am unable to 
respond to that in case they incriminate me. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then, Mr Ramosebudi, there 
20 
is the email that comes from your Rams Cap to Eric Wood 
that says: 
“Please review and comment.” 
Do you recall sending that to Mr Wood on 24 October 
2013? 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 151 of 397 
 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I will want to request again, 
Chairperson, not to respond to this question in case I 
incriminate myself. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well, the document that the 
email apparently is asking Mr Wood to review and comment 
appears at page 120 and it is called Revised Evaluation 
Criteria and if one reads through it, it appears to be the 
evaluation criteria for that working capital scope of work 
tender that appears to have been forwarded from your 
email address to Mr Wood on 14 October.  Do you 
10 
recognise this document called revised evaluation, with the 
adding Revised Evaluation Criteria? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Through yourself, Chairperson, I 
might not be able to respond to this in case it incriminate 
me. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I then take you to page 
123?  Now we see an email from Mr Wood to you on 28 
October 
2013 
with 
an 
attachment 
Evaluation 
Criteria 
SAA.docex and that appears to be – sorry, it is forward 
Evaluation Criteria SAA.docex and if one goes down the 
20 
string, one sees what is being forwarded is an email from 
someone called Inderan Pillay to Eric Wood and copied to 
Tewodros Gebreselasie.  Can I first ask you, do you know 
who Inderan Pillay is? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I think he is one of those guys who 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 152 of 397 
 
work for Regiments.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   It is not Niven Pillay, it is a 
different person but we are led to believe it is Niven 
Pillay’s brother, do you know that? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I would not know. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But it is certainly not Niven 
Pillay.  Do you know that it is not Niven Pillay? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Ja, from the names it is not Niven 
Pillay.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, different person.  Do you 
10 
know Tewodros Gebreselasie? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes, I know. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And who is he or who was he at 
the time? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   He worked for Regiments Capital. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And we have already established 
who Mr Wood is.  Do you recall receiving this email from 
Mr Wood on 28 October 2013 which forwarded a document 
called the evaluation criteria SAA? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson, may I not respond to 
20 
this one in case I incriminate myself. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So then I must take you to the 
document that was attached to that email, it is at 124 and 
it is a document which looks a lot like the document that 
was attached to your email to Mr Wood with evaluation 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 153 of 397 
 
criteria on 24 August but four days later there had been 
some material changes to the document and to see what 
those changes are I would ask you to go to page 127 
where the Commission has generated a document which 
shows what the changes between the two documents were.  
So can you just read – quickly look through pages 127 and 
128 and 129 and then I am going to ask you a couple of 
questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You want him to read silently or aloud? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No, no, I do not think it is 
10 
necessary to read into the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I just want Mr Ramosebudi to 
see …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, to familiarise himself with it. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Indeed. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I see it, Chairperson. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you, Mr Ramosebudi.  So 
you would not obviously have seen that document at any 
time prior to coming to the Commission because the 
20 
Commission generated it but I have to ask you, the 
document that starts at page 124, have you seen that 
document before? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Through yourself, Chairperson, I am 
going to respond to this one in case I incriminate myself. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 154 of 397 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you, Mr Ramosebudi.  
Can we then go to the document at page 127 where the 
track changes are flagged and can I ask you would you 
agree with me that these are not insignificant changes that 
have been made to evaluation criteria but what one sees 
here is some material changes, someone who has presided 
over tenders in the public sector before.  Do these changes 
look 
insignificant 
or 
do 
they 
materially 
change 
the 
evaluation process? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:  With your permission, may I not 
10 
respond to this question in case I incriminate myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just make sure all the time, Mr 
Ramosebudi that you articulate your reason audibly for 
wishing not to answer.  So I am just saying just make sure 
you articulate your reason audibly. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Okay, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   For wishing not to answer the question, 
it is important for the record. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I – I maybe asked that 
20 
question too generally.  If one goes to the bottom of the 
page 127, one sees that the evaluation criterion in relation 
to functional requirements and weightings – these are 
going to be scores on the tender.  Sorry, can I ask that 
question?  Functional requirements and weightings, are 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 155 of 397 
 
those going to be the scores on the tender that will 
determine who wins the tender? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   With your permission, Chairperson, 
may I not respond to this in case I incriminate myself. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well, let us …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe you can ask it generally.  Maybe 
you could ask it at a general level, would that help?  If he 
does not relation to these but just in general. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Indeed, indeed, thank you, 
Chair.  So, Mr Ramosebudi, when one – forget about this 
10 
tender in particular, but as a general principle when one 
evaluates public sector tenders and there is a phase two of 
the tender, phase one is about functional compatibility and 
anyone who does not qualify in phase one is automatically 
disqualified but people who get through to phase 2 and 
then have qualified and are being assessed, if there is a 
category called functional requirements and weightings for 
phase two, would that really be the marks that are given to 
those people who have qualified and the person – and the 
entity with the highest marks will win. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   In general. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   In general, without referring to 
this specific tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:   According to your knowledge. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Of course when I read through this on 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 156 of 397 
 
page 127 it says: 
“Bidders that fail to meet the critical criteria will be 
eliminated.” 
So it means those are eliminated, they will not go further, 
it will be, you know, evaluated on a functional basis.  So 
then move to the second phase., then they are going to be 
evaluated on a functional basis.  So therefore the weight 
probably is what is attached to a particular element or 
description of a measure that is used.  I guess that is what 
it should be. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So would that answer – would your 
answer mean that in general when you come to that phase 
those various features are how – or are the features that 
get scored.  I am talking generally now. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Ja, generally when I look at the first 
element or the first phase, it is a yes or no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   So if it is yes or no, if you are no, no, 
no, that means that you will be eliminated.  And then the 
second phase, now you have got to be weighted in terms of 
20 
what your competencies are.  That is what I read from 
these documents now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Mr Chaskalson? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And whoever gets the highest 
weighted score is presumably the preferred bidder. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 157 of 397 
 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson, may I not further 
respond to this one, in case I incriminate myself. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, then maybe I should just 
read into the record some of these changes.  One sees in 
relation to the weightings that the measure of demonstrate 
working capital management methodology and approach 
adopted in previous projects or as proposed from SAA – 
proposed for SAA, has increased from 20% to 30%. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   The evaluation of the scope of work 
10 
and benefits realised in relation to the relevance of what is 
required for SAA has – it used to say three group 
references for 15 marks, two group level references and 
one small group reference would give you 10 marks and 
two small group references and one big group reference 
would give you five marks and the kinds of references that 
are now being asked have all been eliminated, so it is just 
three references, 15 marks, two references is 10 and one 
reference is 5.  There used to be a requirement that said: 
:”Tenderer 
demonstrates 
the 
ability 
to 
conduct 
20 
global research and benchmarking based on the 
team structure and expertise employed as well as 
display of the relevant network that the tenderer 
can access to support research.” 
It was going to be 10% of that total mark but that has now 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 158 of 397 
 
been eliminated.  Then there is a line item: 
“Demonstrate 
experience 
of 
working 
at 
senior 
management level and rediscovering working capital 
capabilities by outlining methodology and approach 
utilised in similar projects as well as proposal for 
SAA, 
tenderer 
must 
show 
good 
grasp 
of 
the 
sensitivities associated with the rediscovering of 
working capital and competency requirements.” 
That used to be 10%, it is now 15%.  There was a line 
item: 
10 
“Demonstrate 
unbundling 
of 
working 
capital 
capability by outlining methodology and approach 
adopted in previous projects or as proposed for 
SAA.  This should indicated in terms of the various 
elements that will be addressed in working capital 
unbundling management as well as how this will be 
developed for SAA.” 
That used to be 10%, it has now gone.  And there is: 
“Years 
of 
experience 
in 
working 
capital 
management…” 
20 
To which has been added 
“…and balance sheet optimization.” 
A one year used to be 3 points, two years used to be – 
sorry, one year used to be 2 points, it is now 3 points.  Two 
years used to be 4 points, it is now 6 points.  Three years 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 159 of 397 
 
used to be 6 points, it is now 9, four years used to be 8 
points, it is now 12 and 5 years used to be 10 points and it 
now 15.  So the total weighing has gone up from 10 to 15.  
Then over the page there is a new entry which is called: 
“Knowledge transfer framework to SAA during and 
after the project.  Tenderer must outline their 
framework to be utilised in ensuring knowledge 
transfer happens with key internal stakeholders.” 
That new entry gets 10% and – I beg your pardon, Chair, 
that new entry is not in fact a new entry, it used to be there 
10 
at the bottom, but it has now been deleted at the bottom 
and pushed further up the list. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then we get to a document that 
we have already addressed, it is at page 130 but it now 
appears in its proper chronology.  That is the email 
addressed from you to Mr Wood on 29 October 2013, we 
have already asked if you can identify that and you have 
already claimed privilege.  I just want to refresh our 
memories that this is an email attaching an invoice to 
20 
Regiments Capital from Rams Capital in the amount of 
R375 606.  We then at page 132 have a document which 
was 
an 
extract 
from 
the 
Commission’s 
electronic 
transaction records showing that payment from Regiments 
Capital to Rams Capital on 7 November 2013 of 375 606.  
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 160 of 397 
 
Chair, if you can just, on this document, make an 
annotation that the bank statements, the relevant hard 
copy bank statements are at page 652, red, and 690 red, 
both sides of that transaction. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just one second, red page? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   It is 652 red. 
CHAIRPERSON:   652, thank you. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And 690 red. 
CHAIRPERSON:   690, the last page number? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   690, indeed. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So that is the one, the 
Regiments 
Capital 
statement 
and 
the 
Rams 
Capital 
statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We then come to a document on 
page 133 and that is an email from Niven Pillay to Andile 
Nyonya, Eric Wood, Inderan Pillay and Mohamed Bobat and 
the subject is: 
“Forwarding GSMO 85/13 RFP for the appointment 
20 
of a consultant to assist the SAA Group with the 
unlocking of working capital” 
And there is an attachment RFP working capital NN.doc.  
The email that is being forwarded is from Reinette 
Slabbert.  Do you know who Reinette Slabbert is, Mr 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 161 of 397 
 
Ramosebudi? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Ja, I recollect the name. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you tell the Chair who she 
is? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   She has worked in the procurement at 
SAA. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And the date is 19 November 
2013, this document is sent – or this email is sent to 
everyone and it – or not to everyone, to a large number of 
people and it says: 
10 
“Dear Bidders, good afternoon, everybody, attached 
herewith please find the following documents, RFP 
085/13 
NDA 
related 
to 
the 
RFP. 
 
There 
is 
confidential financial information available that will 
be submitted but it will only be submitted once the 
NDA agreement has been signed and emailed back.  
Please take note of the funding point that forms 
part of the scope of work, part 3 of the RFP 
document.  All correspondence needs to be via 
email and we will respond as soon as possible to all 
20 
questions, thanks.” 
So would I be correct in saying that the email from 
Reinette Slabbert is an email that goes out to people who – 
to bidders who are invited to bid for this bid, GSMO 85/13, 
the RFP for the appointment of a consultant to assist SAA 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 162 of 397 
 
with the unlocking of working capital.  Is that correct? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson, may I be excused not to 
respond to this question in case I incriminate myself? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I then take you to the 
document that is attached to that email.  It is a document 
that appears on page 136, its heading is: 
“Request for proposal for the appointment of a 
consultant to assist the South African Airways 
Group with the unlocking of working capital, bid 
number RFP 085/13.” 
10 
And then it goes on.  Maybe before we ask a question then 
maybe I can flag a couple of issues in this document.  
Page 137 there is an issue date of 19 November 2013, 
there is a closing date for RFP, 4 December 2013 and can I 
ask in general terms, when an invitation to bid has an 
issue date would that be the date on which bidders are 
given the tender document which describes the scope of 
work and the evaluation criteria and the like, in general 
terms, in procurement?  Sorry, Mr Ramosebudi? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I hear you, Mr Chaskalson.  It might 
20 
mean a lot of thing, you know, issued late.  It might be a 
date that is issued but in a ...[indistinct] to go out not to 
the bidders.  Or it can be an issue date that goes to the 
bidders.  So an issue date can be, can mean a lot of 
things.  So I, I don’t want to apply a general knowledge 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 163 of 397 
 
here. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay.  Or can I ask the question 
differently?  Have you come across tenders where bidders 
get a bid invitation document officially before the issue 
date? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I think Mr Chairperson I may not be 
able to respond to this question sir, in case I implicate 
myself.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   The closing date, if we can ask 
in general terms when a bid invitation document has a 
10 
closing date would that mean that subject to variations 
which are made applicable to everyone, any bid that comes 
after that closing date is not considered? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   From general perspective I don’t have 
much knowledge on ...[indistinct] issues.  I’ve been in 
treasury most of my life and … 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay, well I mean there has 
been quite a lot of evidence at a general level around 
procurement.  Can I ask if you can identify this particular 
document, it is the bid document that was actually issued 
20 
in respect of the SAA tender for the appointment of a 
consultant to assist in South African Airways Group with 
the unlocking and working capital?  Can you identify this 
document as the bid document that was officially issued?   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson can I reserve my rights 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 164 of 397 
 
to respond to this question in case I implicate myself? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then maybe just for the record 
Chair I would like to note that the issue date here is 19 
November 2013, with the closing date of 4 December 2013, 
which is roughly two weeks after issue.  But if we go back 
to page 113, we see a draft of the scope of work in this 
tender which corresponds very closely to the draft in the 
final document being emailed to Mr Wood at Regiments on 
the 14 t h of October.   
A month, more than a month before the issue date 
10 
of the tender that has roughly a two week period between 
issue and close.  The second point that I would make just 
for the record is if one compares the evaluation criteria, 
that one sees on page 153, black 153.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I can’t hear you, 130? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I beg your pardon Chair.  Just 
for the record … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   The date of 14 October and the 
email of 14 October was black 115.  Not, not 113.  113 Like 
20 
I gave the wrong reference. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I am indebted to my learned 
friend for that.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 165 of 397 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   If one goes to the evaluation 
criteria in the bid document which are at page 153 and one 
compares 
those 
evaluation 
criteria 
to 
the 
evaluation 
criteria that came back from Mr Wood, on 28 October, that 
is page 124 – sorry it is not page 124.   
Yes it is page 124.  Mr Wood sent back evaluation 
criteria 
on 
page 
– 
on 
28 
October 
2013 
and 
those 
evaluation criteria one sees from page 124 and one sees a 
fairly close correlation between those evaluation criteria 
and the evaluation criteria that ultimately get released in 
10 
the bid, which one can see at page 153.   
And maybe the best place to do the comparison is 
with that track changes version of the document at page 
127.  But maybe let’s move on in the chronology, after I 
have made those observations and I want to take you to 
page 202.   
And on page 202 there is an email under cover of 
which a bid is attached.  And that bid starts on page 203.  
And the signature page on that bid is – lost my reference. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you still at 202 Mr Chaskalson? 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I am at, I’m at 202.  I just want 
to indentify the parties that signed off on this bid.  You’ll 
see that – maybe the best place to do it from is 202.  The 
email 
on 
202 
is 
from 
someone 
called 
davidfine@McKinsey.com to Eric Wood.   
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 166 of 397 
 
And the what is attached is a completed bid.  And if 
one, and there’s some emails who were forwarded and the 
people who were, whose emails are forwarded are all 
McKinsey addresses.  But this particular document is 
addressed to Mr Wood.  And if one goes down to page 214, 
one will see three signatures, including Mr Fine of 
McKinsey, 
Nomfanelo 
Magwentshu 
at 
McKinsey 
and 
Christina Planet of McKinsey.   
And in there is a space for Mr Wood to sign.  Can I 
ask if this, if you can identify this document as the bid 
10 
document that was submitted jointly by McKinsey and 
Regiments?   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   True yourself Chairperson, I am here 
assist you know the Chairperson and the Commission.  
However on this particular one I might not be able to 
respond to it in case I implicate myself.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well maybe I can just read then 
into the record the paragraph which is the second last 
paragraph before the signatures, on page 214: 
 
“We fully appreciate the …”

This is the bidder speaking: 
“We fully appreciate the importance to as have 
achieving better management of its working capital 
and are confident that McKinsey and Regiments can 
offer distinctive and rapid bought routed in our deep

understanding of SAA and our extensive experience 
of supporting many airlines across the world facing 
comparable challenges.  The suggested risk and 
upside sharing arrangements in our fee proposal 
reflect our belief and the value that is at stake and 
in our ability to deliver significant value for SAA.” 
 
Can we then go down or before we go down to page 
204, can I ask you a general question?  Under the system 
of delegations at SAA at the time, what was the limit in 
monitory terms of the value of a tender that could be 
10 
awarded by the Bid Adjudication Committee without going 
to the Board for independent decision?   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   From a general perspective it 
depends on the board delegation to the management.  So 
on this particular one, I can’t give you an answer on it as I 
have already stated that I don’t want to implicate myself.  
And 
from 
a 
general 
perspective 
the 
maximum 
level 
depends on what the board has delegated management of.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But does, does the system of 
delegations not work according to value?  So that the Bid 
20 
Adjudication Committee – or let me put this question to you 
very specifically.  Did the Bid Adjudication Committee have 
authority to make awards in amounts greater than 100 
million rands? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   May I not respond to this one 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 168 of 397 
 
Chairperson, in case I … 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay, can we then go to page 
228.  And you will see there is a an email that is sent from 
you or from your - ...[indistinct] ramscap.coza address to – 
on 24 January  2014 to Eric Wood and to what was Gebre 
Selassie(?).   
We have remembered who they are.  And it says 
working capital BAC final recommendation.  Can I ask you 
on 24 January 2014, had the award in respect of this 
tender been made yet or was the tender still pending? 
10 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   May I not respond to this question 
Chairperson, in case I implicate myself? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I then ask do you recall 
forwarding or sending this email on 24 January 2014 to 
Eric Wood and toward Gebra Selassie, both whom worked 
at Regiments at the time? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Again Chairperson, may I humbly 
request to not to respond to this question in case I 
implicate myself? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Or let me then take you to the 
20 
email that was forwarded.  Well let’s start with an anterior 
question.  Again one sees what’s forwarded is a chain that 
you’ve, that is first forwarded from the – your flysaa.com 
address to your ramscap address on 24 January 2014 at 
10:44.  Do you recall forwarding that email chain from your 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 169 of 397 
 
SAA address to your ramscap address on 24 January? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson I have been advised not 
to respond to this question in case I implicate myself. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well let’s go then down to the 
chain itself.  It starts with an email from yourself, 24 
January 2014 at 10:43AM.  It’s addressed to Reinette 
Slabbert, you have told us she worked in procurement at 
SAA.  Viwe Soga.  Who is Viwe Soga? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I can’t recall exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just for the transcribers, Soga will be S-
10 
O-G-A.  Is that correct sir? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Viwe, V-I-W-E, that should be easy.  
Okay, alright.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And Nthabiseng and Ntshali?  Do 
you remember who that person was?   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I recall. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And who is she, who was she?   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   She used to work for SAA.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And in what department? 
20 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I think it’s risk.  Risk. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Risk.  So she worked in risk at 
SAA.  And Lindsey Olitzki, do you remember who Lindsey 
Olitzki – sorry and Nthabiseng is N-T-H-A-B-I-S-E-N-G.  
And 
Charlie 
Charlie 
is 
N-T-S-H-A-L-I 
N-T-S-H-A-L-I.  
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 170 of 397 
 
Lindsey Olitzki, O-L-I-T-Z-K-I.  Do you recall who she was? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes I recall. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And who was she? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   She used to work in finance. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  She used to work? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   In finance. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   At S - in finance and at SAA? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes, yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Did she work at SAA? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   SAA finance. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   SAA finance.  And Shireen 
Subroyen.  SHIREEN and SUBROYEN.   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I think she worked, she worked for 
SAA.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   She worked for SAA.  And would 
it be correct to say that Reinette Slabbert, Viwe Soga and 
Nthabiseng 
and 
Ntshali 
Ntshali, 
Lindsey 
Olitzki 
and 
Shireen Subroyen were all involved in work relating to 
SAA’s processing of this tender? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I can’t recall whether they were 
20 
members of the CFST or not, I can’t recall. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, you said whether they 
were members of the? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Whether they were working on this 
transaction.   
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 171 of 397 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   You can’t recall.  Well your email 
may refresh you, or the email may refresh your memory.  It 
says: 
“Colleagues 
submission 
has 
been 
referred 
for 
rework.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is on page 228 Mr Chaskalson? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Foot of 228 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   “We need to discuss the pricing  
with respect to delegation of authority.  If McKinsey 
10 
is approved as is, I will have to go to board and 
timing will be an issue.  So that is the correct 
approach?  To still recommend to McKinsey without 
breaching 
the 
procurement 
process? 
 
Would 
McKinsey reducing the cap level be the appropriate 
way to do?  Or should we go back to or for BAFO, 
that would be best and final offer with the limited 
below board approval.” 
 
And can I or let’s read on.   
“Don’t 
forget 
Boston 
was 
14 
million 
with 
30 
20 
variables, IQ is 5,5 million with percentage savings 
but no cap.  And McKinsey is zero fixed, but eight 
percent on savings with a 120 million which is 
above CEO delegation.  Let’s quickly reflect on this, 
we need to go for round robin early next week.” 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 172 of 397 
 
 
Can I ask, I framed my earlier question wrongly?  
When I – this email says 120 million is above CEO 
delegation.  Does that mean that the CEO of SAA does not 
have authority to conclude a contract at 120 million and 
that such a contract has to go to the board?  
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson may I not respond to this 
question, in case I implicate myself? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I alright.  Let’s then 
proceed and we see at 235, sorry – yes page 235, there is 
another email.  It’s also sent from your ramscap address 
10 
on 24 January 2014.  This time at 16:22.  It is also sent, 
addressed to Eric Wood and the subject is the name of this 
tender, GSMOD80 085/13 RAP for the appointment of a 
consultant to assist the SAA Group with the unlocking of 
working capital.   
And again it forwards an email that was forwarded from 
your flysaa address to your ramscap address.  And can I 
ask you do you recall sending this email from your ramscap 
address to Eric Wood on the 24 t h of January 2014?   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Through yourself Chairperson may I 
20 
not respond to this question in case I implicate myself?   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Again can I ask do you recall 
sending the email from your flysaa address to your 
ramscap address on 24 January? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson I humbly request not to 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 173 of 397 
 
respond to this question as I may implicate myself. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I then get to the content of 
what was actually forwarded on this string and you will see 
at the last part of the string on page 235, it says, from 
Reinette 
Slabbert 
sent 
16 
January 
2014 
to 
Phetolo 
Ramosebudi, 
Nthabiseng, 
Ntshali 
Ntshali, 
Viwe 
Soga, 
Shireen Subroyen, Lindsey Olitzki.  The subject is the 
same name of the tender that we have quoted repeatedly.  
It says: 
“Dear team, good afternoon all.  I have done the 
10 
clarification of the rates with each of the short 
listed bidders, attached herewith please find the 
response 
from 
Boston 
Group 
Banks, 
Reinette 
Slabbert.” 
 
Do you recall receiving this email from Reinette 
Slabbert on 16 January 2014? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Through Mr Chairperson may I not 
respond to this question in case I implicate, implicate 
myself? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And if you go down the chain 
20 
further, you will see that at below Reinette, what Reinette 
Slabbert emailed forward is an email from someone called 
W-U-E-S-T, wuestmartin sent to Reinette Slabbert on 16 
January 2014, copied to Shireen Subroyen, and someone 
called Urmias, U-R-M-I-AS, AS and Tenbite.  T-E-N-B-I-T-E.  
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 174 of 397 
 
Can I ask if you are able to identify Urmias?  U-R-M-I-A-S?   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   On page 237? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   It is 236.  236.  So it is the 
fourth line on page 236.  E-R-M-I-A-S.  Ermias.  Does that 
ring a bell? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   No it does not ring a bell. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And Tenbite or Tenbite, does 
that ring a bell? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Which one is that? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   After Ermias.   
10 
MR 
RAMOSEBUDI: 
 
 That 
is 
precisely 
why 
I 
said 
Chairperson may I request your permission not to respond 
to this question, because I might implicate myself by 
...[indistinct]. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So, so that’s in response to a 
question do you know, can you identify Tenbite? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I don’t want to respond to this 
question.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I might implicate myself. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And it says: 
 
“Dear Reinette, I trust you have been well.   
Response to your question as follows:  Variable 
component in option 1, 70 percent refers to the 
fixed P proposed to this option, 70 percent of the 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 175 of 397 
 
proposed fees are variable depending on your 
satisfaction with the project.  And 2 at your targets 
achieved, how your gains achieved, evaluation in 
terms of both 1 and 2 above to be jointly agreed 
with you at the beginning of the project.  Variable 
component in option 2, 60 percent refers to the 
fixed P, 60 percent to the proposed P’s variable 
depending on your satisfaction at the end of the 
project, evaluation in terms to be jointly agreed with 
you at the beginning of the project.  Should you 
10 
require any further information do not hesitate to 
get in touch with me.” 
 
Would 
it 
be 
correct 
that 
this 
document 
is 
a 
document sent by Mr Vurst(?) on behalf of the Boston 
Consulting Group to Ms Slabbert who is assisting with the 
administration of the tender, setting out the terms of the or 
setting out material terms of the Boston bid?  Is that 
correct?   
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Again ...[indistinct] Chairperson may I 
not respond to these questions?   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  What … 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I might implicate myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What I maybe should have said much 
earlier Mr Ramosebudi, but your lawyers would have 
advised you, but I just want to make sure you know about 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 176 of 397 
 
it.  Namely that when you don’t answer questions, when 
there 
appears 
to 
be 
evidence 
pointing 
in 
a 
certain 
direction, which may include that the evidence may be 
pointing that there was some wrong doing on your part or 
that you may have been involved in some criminal activity 
or other wrong doing, when you don’t answer questions 
relating to that, what it does mean is that I don’t have 
evidence from you saying that evidence is not true.   
That there is an explanation of what may seem to 
be wrong doing on my part.  This is the explanation, what it 
10 
means is that when I write my report, I will have evidence 
that may be one sided and it doesn’t mean that findings 
can’t be made against you because of the evidence that 
has not been challenged.  So I am sure your lawyers 
explained it, but I just want to make sure that you 
understand.  You understand that? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I, I do understand that Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Thanks so much.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr Ramosebudi can we go to 
page 248?   
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say 248? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   248 Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 177 of 397 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And maybe before you proceed Mr 
Chaskalson, I see we are at one or two minutes past four.  
Let’s talk about the way forward.  I did agree to an evening 
session for myself, so a day session and even session for 
today, with regard to I think is the Denel work stream, but I 
am just mentioning that.   
In terms of your own assessment, how much more 
time do we need 
with him and 
whether 
we would, 
...[indistinct] would finish with him tomorrow or you had in 
10 
mind that we got, go into the evening?  It’s just that I am 
not sure whether the information may have been checked 
with you.  I may have shared information about my evening 
session or not.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry Chair, today’s taken 
considerably longer than I thought.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   The … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the bottom line is we will need to 
deal with the evidence which are ...[indistinct]. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How to go about it in terms of, of time.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, my sense is that we 
probably need another hour on SAA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 178 of 397 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And another two to three hours 
on Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On Transnet.  If we do an hour on SAA 
that would take us to about five o’clock.  And one accepts 
that these things don’t always go according to one’s 
assessment.  That would take us to about five o’clock.  And 
then you said about what?  Three hours on Transnet.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  If we did SAA and finished today, 
this, this afternoon that we were left with – with SAA, three 
10 
hours of SAA, if one combines that, those three hours of 
SAA evidence with tomorrows witness would we be able to 
finish tomorrow with him and the tomorrow’s witness or not 
really? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I suspect not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [Indistinct]. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Because I think tomorrows 
witness is Mr Makhubo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But my worry – Mr Makhubo’s 
20 
legal team have, have been concerned about time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So we – it may be that we can, 
that it would suit them to do a little bit of Mr Makhubo 
tomorrow and on the issues where they need greater 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 179 of 397 
 
preparation which may in part relate to the evidence of Mr 
Powell yesterday.  I think from what they were saying to 
me, it may suit them to deal with issues relating to Mr 
Powell at a later date so that they have greater time to 
prepare. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So we certainly won’t finish Mr 
Ramosebudi 
and 
Mr 
Powell. 
 
Oh 
and 
Mr 
Makhubo 
tomorrow.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Tomorrow.  Okay.  No that’s fine.  So it 
10 
seems to me that maybe we should go on with this witness, 
at least finish SAA.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That would, I think that would be 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Conceptually … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Would make sense Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And, and, and then he could come back 
tomorrow and we finish Transnet.  And then start with Mr 
20 
Makhubo in regard to those matters where they have 
concerns of not being, of not having had enough time.  And 
then if he, Mr Makhubo must come back on another day to 
finish then maybe we could do that.  What do you think? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Subject to Mr Ramosebudi’s 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 180 of 397 
 
position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I think that that from the 
Commission’s perspective I think that would make much 
sense. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That would work.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I don’t know if Mr Ramosebudi is 
available. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Ramosebudi how, how does that 
sound to you?  How is your situation about tomorrow if we, 
10 
if we stopped your evidence at 17:00 today and then 
continue tomorrow morning?  Mr Chaskalson’s assessment 
is that tomorrow we might need about three hours of your 
time.  And I will check with your lawyer what their situation 
is, but I just want to hear from your side first.  [Indistinct]. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Ja, excellent Chairperson, but I am 
here to assist the Chair, you know the Chairperson, the 
Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   What is the time it suits finishing it is 
20 
fine.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Alright.  Counsel for Mister, 
how is your situation for tomorrow? 
ADV MPOFU:  Thank you Chair.  Chair I am available 
tomorrow, if I could just ask an indulgence?   
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 181 of 397 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU REPRESENTITIVE:  I have an appearance 
from 10:00.  It shouldn’t be too long, so if we can maybe 
start and then stand the matter down to after 12:00 and 
then I would be able to come, because Mr Mpofu is not 
here.  So we can come tomorrow, but if you can agree on a 
time.  I understand there is another witness, so I am not 
sure if you want to start with that witness and then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, it would have been better to 
continue with him from today. 
10 
ADV MPOFU REPRESENTITIVE:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And up to when he finishes before we 
start the other witness, but it’s that is not to say we can’t 
start with Mr Makhubo tomorrow if we are going to finish 
with him at a certain time.  And then this witness comes in, 
but preferably it would have been better the other way 
around.  Mr Chaskalson what do you say? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair I am in your hands 
entirely.  I mean we do have the quite unique situation that 
Mr Makhubo works in this building, so it may be possible 
20 
for him to come. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   At 10:00 and then to come back 
later without much inconvenience.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  And, and if need be, what is your 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 182 of 397 
 
assessment of the time you might need with Mr Makhubo if 
there is that portion relating to ...[indistinct] that might 
have to be done on another day? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair I think I would end up 
using most of tomorrow for finishing Mr Ramosebudi and 
dealing with material with Mr Makhubo that doesn’t directly 
traverse Mr Powell’s evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes what I am trying to look at is 
whether if we start with Mr Makhubo and subject to his 
availability if he was told ten o’clock he might have other 
10 
things to do by nine o’clock, but if we could even start a 
little earlier whether it is nine or half past nine, that would 
give us some time.   What I was having in mind is that we 
don’t want a situation where he waits, this witness waits 
but we end up taking up the whole day with Mr Makhubo 
anyway and then he has to come back another time.   
 
So I am trying to ...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair we would certainly finish 
with Mr Ramosebudi if we started after lunch with Mr 
Ramosebudi tomorrow and I could finish the non-Powell 
20 
related issues with Mr Makhubo before lunch tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, if we start with Mr Makhubo 
tomorrow and we finish by lunch time ...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Indeed, and we ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You will finish by lunch time? 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 183 of 397 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I would finish the issues that 
don’t deal with the material that Mr Powell addressed by 
lunch time, and then Mr Ramesebudi could possibly come 
back at two. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay then I think let’s do it that way, I 
think therefore that would accommodate Counsel for Mr 
Ramesebudi so I think we should take a break now of 
ten/fifteen minutes and then we will come back, we do 
about an hour, at least we finish the SAA evidence with 
this witness and then we adjourn his evidence until 
10 
tomorrow after lunch. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is right. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, you understand 
Mr 
Ramosebudi? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you for your cooperation; 
okay let’s take an adjournment now.   It is twelve minutes 
past four, let’s resume at twenty five past four. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise.

CHAIRPERSON:   Let us continue. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you Chair.  If we could 
continue from page 248 Chair, Mr Ramosebudi can I ask 
you to go to 248. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I am on page 248. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And at the top of that page you 
will see an email from Ramscap address sent on 24 
January 2014 at 16:22 to Eric Wood, the subject is the 
tender description – the tender description we know quite 
well now and again it is forwarding an email that has been 
10 
forwarded from your SAA address to your Ramscap address 
which in turn has a string behind can we take it one step at 
a time, do you recall…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you looking at the top or the middle 
email at 248, Mr Chaskalson? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So the top email at 248 is 
Phetolo@ramscap to Eric Wood at 16:22 on 24 January, it 
forwards 
an 
email 
below 
it, 
from 
PhetoloRamosebudi@flysaa.com, sent on the same day at 
12:21 
to 
Phetolo@ramscap.co.za

forwards a chain that ends with Reinette Slabbert or 
forwards and email from Reinette Slabbert on 16 January 
2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We’ll take them one at a time. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 185 of 397 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr Ramosebudi, do you recall 
sending that email on 24 January 2014 at 16:22, to Eric 
Wood? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Through myself Chairperson, may I 
not respond to this question in case I incriminate myself. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then, Mr Ramosebudi, do you 
recall forwarding, from your SAA address that email at 24 
January 2014 at 12:21 to your Ramscap address? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Through myself Chairperson, may I 
10 
not respond to this question in case I incriminate myself. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can we then go down to that 
email from Reinette Slabbert, of 16 January 2014, it’s 
addressed to yourself, to …[indistinct 2.37], to Viywe [?] 
Sogo [?], Lindsay Alitski [?], Shereen Sobrian, it has the 
subject line that they all have and it says: 
 
“Dear Team, 
Attached herewith please find the response from the 
IQ Group relating to the question of IQ Group Rael 
Consulting and the Hackard [?] Group”, 
20 
 
Can I ask you first, were the IQ Group Rael 
Consulting and the Hackard [?] Group a consortium that 
had bidded – that had put in a bid for this tender? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Again, Chairperson, may I not 
respond to this question, in case I incriminate myself. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 186 of 397 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   If we can go over the page and 
to page 249, we see – sorry can we go back, I’m just trying 
to see, I think there is a -  yes, right at the bottom of 248 
we see an email from Jonas Schoefer right at the bottom of 
248, Jonas Schoefer dated 16 January 2014 and it’s – if we 
go over to 249 we see that it is addressed to Reinette 
Slabbert, it says: 
 
“Dear Reinette, 
Apologies the confirmed fixed fee for phase one is 
4.9million ZAR plus VAT, Kind Regards Jonas 
10 
Schoefer”, 
 
And can I ask you, is this an email which sets out 
material terms of the bid that was put in by the IQ Group 
and Hackard, that consortium? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Again, through myself, Chairperson, I 
may not respond to this question in case I incriminate 
myself. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I ask, then, that we go to 
page 232 and there, again, it’s a similar sort of chain at 
the top there is an email from your Ramscap address at 
20 
18:35 to Eric Wood on 24 January 2014, subject line that 
they all have.  It forwards below, an email that has been 
forwarded from  your flysaa.com address to your Ramscap 
address and below that is an email from Reinette Slabbert 
on 16 January 2014, can we take them one at a time.  Do 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 187 of 397 
 
you recall sending this email to Eric Wood on 24 January 
2014 at 18:35? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Through myself, Chairperson, may I 
not respond to this one in case in incriminate myself. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And can we then go a little 
further down to that Ramscap – the second email in the 
string, do you recall sending that from your flysaa address 
to your Ramscap address on 24 January at 12:21? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   With your permission, Chairperson, 
may I not respond to this one in case I incriminate myself. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then, if we go to the 
Reinette Slabbert email of 16 January 2014, it’s addressed 
to yourself to Ntabiseng [indistinct], to Lindsay Alitski [?], 
to Viywe [?] Sogo [?] and Shereen Sobrien, it’s got the 
heading that all of these emails have, it says: 
 
“Dear Team, 
Attached herewith please find the response from 
Mckinsey, thanks” 
 
And below it, is forwarded a email from Christina 
Planert of Mckinsey to Reinette Slabbert on 16 January 
20 
2014, and that email says: 
 
“Hello Reinette, 
Thank you very much for your email, I wanted to 
confirm your understanding  of our pricing proposal, 
in the event that no savings are identified we will 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 188 of 397 
 
charge no fees.  This is in spirit of 100% aligned 
incentives between SAA and ourselves, thank you 
very much, please let me know should you have 
further questions, Christina”.  
 
Can I ask you, first do you recall receiving that 
email from Reinette Slabbert on 16 January 2014 at 
5:04pm? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   With your permission, Chairperson, 
may I not respond to this one in case I incriminate myself. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then if I can go down to the 
10 
Christina Planert that is forwarded by Reinette Slabbert to, 
what appears to be your SAA address and that of others, 
would it be fair to say that Christina Planert email sets out 
the material term of the Mckinsey bid in a consortium with 
Regiments? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I would like to humbly request, 
Chairperson, 
not 
to 
respond 
to 
this 
one 
in 
case 
I 
incriminate myself. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then, Mr Ramosebudi, can we 
go a little bit further down to page 255.  There you will see 
20 
an email that appears to have been sent from Reinette 
Slabbert to you on 28 January 2014, it’s addressed to you, 
to Lindsey Alitski, Shereen Sobrien, Viywe Sogo and 
Ntsabiseng Nchalechali [?], that – can I first ask you, that 
list of addressees, is there anyone on that list who wasn’t 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 189 of 397 
 
working at SAA at the time? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   May I not respond to this one 
Chairperson, in case I incriminate myself. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay, well let’s read the email: 
 
“Dear Team, 
Please refer to the clarification from McKinsey 
regarding 
the 
capped 
amount. 
I 
suggest 
the 
following to bring the bidders in line with the 
McKinsey pricing.  Boston Group and IQ Group to 
submit 
their 
complete 
pricing 
based 
on 
the 
10 
unlocking of R1.2billion savings, please confirm 
urgently 
if 
you’re 
all 
in 
agreement 
with 
my 
suggestion”, 
 
And underneath that, which – that email, there is 
the forwarded email which comes from Christina Planert of 
McKinsey addressed to Reinette Slabbert on 28 January 
2014 and copied to a series of other people, all of them 
who are, either at McKinsey or SAA people, Shereen 
Sobrian is the SAA person and it says, 
“Hello Reinette, thanks as per the below the capped 
20 
amount will reduce to 70 to 80.5million, assuming 
we unlock savings of one to 1.2billion, thanks 
Christina”, 
 
You have declined to answer whether you received 
the email from Christina Slabbert but can I ask you, 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 190 of 397 
 
whether you recall that in the course of this tender 
process, McKinsey confirmed that, if they unlocked savings 
of one to 1.2billion their capped amount would reduce to 
80.5 – between 70 and 80.5million? 
MR 
RAMOSEBUDI: 
 
 Again, 
Chairperson, 
with 
your 
permission, may I not respond to this one in case I 
incriminate myself. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I ask a follow-up question, 
if McKinsey’s capped amount had been reduced to a 
maximum cap of 80.5million, would the CEO have had 
10 
authority to award this contact or to sign this – conclude 
this contract or would it have had to go to the Board? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson, with your permission, 
may I not respond to this one, in case I incriminate myself. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can we then, go back to the 
Reinette Slabbert, same page, start of that string on 255, 
the suggestion from Reinette Slabbert is: 
“I suggest the following to bring the bidders in line 
with the McKinsey pricing.  Boston Group and IQ 
Group to submit their complete pricing based on the 
20 
unlocking of R1.2billion savings”, 
 
Would it be fair to say that, what Christina Slabbert 
was suggesting was, McKinsey had now told us what our 
cap is, if they realise savings of R1.2billion, let us go back 
to Boston and IQ Group to see what their pricing will be if 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 191 of 397 
 
they realise savings of R1.2billion, is that what she was 
suggesting? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Thank you Chairperson, may I be 
given the opportunity to not respond to this question in 
case I incriminate myself. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I then take you to the 
following – to page 261, sorry it’s actually the bottom of 
260, you’ll see the last email on the page, Reinette 
Slabbert, Wednesday 29 January 2014 7:56am, I ask that 
you make  a note of that time, it’s addressed to yourself, 
10 
Ntabisent Ntalichali, Lindsay Alitski, Shereen Sobrien and 
Voyiwe Sogo, it’s got that same subject line, it says, 
 
“Dear Team, 
 
Attached herewith, please find the response from 
BCG, which would be Boston Consulting Group, should 
there  be an amount of R1.2billion to be unlocked, thanks, 
Reinette Slabbert”, 
 
And below that, what is forwarded is an email from 
Martin Wurst who we’ve met already as a representative of 
Boston Consulting, it’s 28 January 2014 to Reinette 
20 
Slabbert at 11:21pm to Reinette Slabbert, copied to 
Shereen Sobrien…[indistinct 14.15] and Thembite [?], 
same subject line, 
 
“Dear Reinette, 
Thank you for your enquiry clarification, we propose 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 192 of 397 
 
two options in the proposal for SAA to consider so 
I’ll provide feedback on your question for each of 
the options. Option one, benchmarking, opportunity 
identification, SAA enablement, priority initiative 
implementation, phases one benchmarking and top 
down target setting, two, target validation setting 
aside 
…[indistinct 
14.47], 
three, 
roll 
out 
of 
initiatives 
for 
prioritised 
…[indistinct 
14.50] 
enablement up skilling of SAA variable component.  
Seventy percent of the fees are variable, based on 
10 
your satisfaction at the end of the project and target 
being realised in priority initiative implementation, 
the valuation terms to be jointly agreed with you at 
the beginning of the project.  If we assume that 
Boston Consulting Group identifies and unlocks 
capital to the value of R1.2billion as part of the 
prioritised project roll out, then the maximum cost 
to SAA would be R14million. Note it could be less 
depending on the exact evaluation terms that are 
agreed with you before commencement.   
20 
Option two, benchmarking opportunity identification 
SAA enablement monitor initiative implementation, 
phase one, benchmarking and top down target 
setting, two target validation settings size of the 
prize, three, monitoring roll out of initiatives by SAA 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 193 of 397 
 
for 
enablement 
up 
skilling 
of 
SAA 
variable 
component, 60% of these are variable based on 
your satisfaction at the end of the project, the 
evaluation terms to be jointly agreed with you at the 
beginning of the project.  If we assume that BCG 
identifies and monitors the roll out of the initiative 
by SAA to unlock capital to the value of R1.2billion 
then 
the 
maximum 
cost 
to 
SAA 
would 
be 
R10.2million, note it could be less depending on the 
exact evaluation terms that are agreed with you 
10 
before commencement.  I hope this provides clarity, 
please do not hesitate to get in touch should you 
require more information”, 
 
Would it be fair to say that what has happened now, 
is that, Reinette Slabbert, who had suggested earlier that 
she should go to Boston and IQ to find out what their 
pricing would be on an unlocking of savings at R1.2billion 
has done that without any instruction to do that from the 
Committee or from anyone else, can I ask that question 
first? 
20 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Through myself Chairperson, may I be 
permitted not to respond to this question in case I 
incriminate myself. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay, and the second part of my 
proposition to you is that, in response to Reinette Slabbert, 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 194 of 397 
 
Boston have come back with two options for unlocking of 
savings of R1.2billion which would cost a maximum to SAA 
of R14million on one and R10million on the other, is that 
what the Boston response means? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Again, Chairperson, may I permitted 
not to respond to this question, in case I incriminate 
myself. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I remind you that we have 
looked earlier, at the McKinsey response and I forget the 
exact number but it was in the region of R80million, let me 
10 
just find that, if one goes to 232, that’s where that chain 
begins and the – no it’s not 232, I apologise, let me just 
take you there again.  It is at the bottom part of page 255 
where Christina Planert wrote the email on 28 January, 
 
“Hello Reinette, 
Thanks, as per below the capped amount will 
reduce to 70 to 80.5million, assuming we unlock 
savings of one to 1.2billion”.  
 
So, the McKinsey cap would be at 80.5, the Boston 
cap would be, either 10 or 14.  Can I then take you to – 
20 
and when I say McKinsey, it is, of course a joint bid of 
McKinsey and Regiments, can I take you to page 260. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I’m here. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   If you see in the middle of the 
page there is an email that you send on 29 January 2014 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 195 of 397 
 
at 8:41am to Reinette Slabbert and to Ntabiseng Ntalichali, 
Lindsay Alitski, Shereen Sobrien, Viywe Sogo, the usual 
subject line and the text of the email reads, 
“Colleagues, I’m seriously very unhappy the way 
this tender is run. Reinette seems to be biased and 
we cannot …[indistinct 19.42] best and final offer 
after …[indistinct 19.45] because someone didn’t 
price the way Reinette expected”, 
 
Do 
you recall sending that email to Reinette 
Slabbert, Ntabiseng Ntalichali, Lindsay Alitski, Shereen 
10 
Sobrien and Viywe Sogo? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Chairperson, may I not respond to 
this question in case I incriminate myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, Mr Chaskalson, I didn’t hear 
the page so? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, it’s 260. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I am on that page, I think I just 
didn’t see…[intervenes]. 
MR CHASKALSON SC:   It’s the middle email, it says from 
Phetolo Ramosebudi, 29 January 2014, 8:41am. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, now I see it ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And if we go up the page to the 
top of the page we see a response from Reinette Slabbert 
on page – at the top of page 460, Wednesday 29 January 
2014 
at 
8:50, 
it’s 
addressed 
to 
you, 
to 
Ntabiseng 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 196 of 397 
 
Ntalichali, Lindsay Alitski, Shereen Sobrien and Viywe 
Sogo, 
 
“Dear Team, 
This is not the case being brought this was just 
trying to get an understanding of what the costing 
would be, thanks, Reinette”. 
 
Do you recall getting that email from Reinette 
Slabbert on 29 January 2014 at 8:50? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Through myself Chairperson, may I 
not respond to this question in case I incriminate myself. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I ask a separate question, 
was there any attempt, after this exchange of emails to 
measure the price of the McKinsey/Regiments joint bid 
against the price of the Boston bid on the assumption of an 
unlocking of R1.2billion capital? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   With permission, Chairperson, may I 
not respond to this question, in case I incriminate myself. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I then take you to page 275, 
it’s an email from Christina Planert to Reinette Slabbert 
copying yourself, Nomfulelo [?] Magwensu [?] at external 
20 
McKinsey.com and copying somebody else called Marlene 
Voster 
at 
McKinsey.com, 
the 
usual 
subject 
line, 
an 
attachment is a document 20/14/02/05 appointment letter, 
SAA signed, Mackay, 
 
“Dear Reinette, 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 197 of 397 
 
Thank you very much again for the appointment and 
trust in our partnership.  Find attached the signed 
appointment letter.  I know we’re trying to connect 
to find a suitable slot for the meeting next week.  
Ahead of this meeting would you be able to give us 
an indication as to when SAA would like to start the 
work i.e. for when should we try to have a full time 
team 
on 
the 
ground, 
thank 
you 
very 
much, 
Christina”. 
  
 
Can I ask you first, did you get this email from 
10 
Christina Planert on 6 February 2014? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   With permission, Chairperson, may I 
not respond to this question in case I incriminate myself. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I ask you then, were 
McKinsey appointed – wee McKinsey, ultimately appointed 
to this bid, do you recall? 
MR 
RAMOSEBUDI: 
 
 
With 
your 
permission, 
again, 
Chairperson, may I not respond to this question, in case I 
incriminate myself. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well Mr Ramosebudi, I think it – 
20 
the Commission will bring evidence to show that the 
McKinsey/Regiments consortium was successful in relation 
to this bid and, in fact,  performed the contract.  Can I take 
you, last to a document which you may not have seen 
previously, it’s – if I can ask you to go to page 597 – sorry 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 198 of 397 
 
not 597, if you can start at page 590.  This document is a 
spreadsheet produced internally by Regiments, it had the 
subject line, advisory invoices tracking.  It had a number of 
tabs, there are – and what it reflected is the revenue 
generated by the McKinsey advisory unit and the payments 
that, that unit had to make in respect of each contract or 
each invoice to what it called business development 
partners which were usually shelf companies set up by 
Salim Essa.  Can I take you to page 594? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Page what? 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   594. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   594? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We see, for instance here, the 
page dealing with Transnet and I’ll show you how the 
systems works before we get to your page. 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   I can see it…[inaudible mic off]. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   You can’t read what appears on 
594? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja it’s very difficult…[intervenes]. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well we’ll have to get you a 
20 
better copy of this, the – what one sees on 594, if I 
might…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On mine, Mr Chaskalson it’s not the – 
it’s not that the copy is a poor one but that the words are 
very small on mine, it seems that it’s just the size of the 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 199 of 397 
 
words…[intervenes]. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Of the font? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Maybe we should get this 
document produced in A3, I have one very simple question 
relating to it at a later stage.  The – what we see on 594, 
an it’s the format of a lot of these spreadsheets is, the first 
column is the client who’s been invoiced by Regiments, the 
second column is the date, is the month of the work, third 
column is the date of the invoice, the fourth column is the 
10 
invoice number the fifth column is the project, the sixth 
column is the amount and then what one sees in the 
seventh column is amounts that have had to be paid out to 
these companies like on page 594 the companies that get 
paid out are Travito and Homix.  Travito and Homix, Homix, 
Travito,  Homix and the last company is called For Sure 
and on the right of For Sure is another one of these shell 
companies called House Stuff.  Evidence, will, in due 
course be led that these were shell companies that were 
used to channel a substantial proportion, usually 50% of 
20 
the revenue from organs of State to entities nominated by 
Salim Essa and Ashok Narayan from which they were 
laundered on.  I am interested in page 596, which has – is 
hopefully a little bit bigger, I’m not sure if 596 is legible to 
you. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 200 of 397 
 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you see that the last 
heading on 596 is SAA? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And can you see under month, it 
says March ’15? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Date invoice 31/03/2015? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes. 
ADV 
CHASKALSON 
SC: 
 
 
And 
invoice 
number 
10 
MK/SAA1001? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes. 
ADV 
CHASKALSON 
SC: 
 
 
Project, 
working 
capital 
optimisation project, March to October 2014? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Amount 6 241 500, can I stop 
there, can I ask – this is inclusive of VAT, can I ask if 
you’re aware whether the fee paid to Regiments by SAA on 
this contract was R6 241 500? 
MR RAMOSEBUDI:   Again, through myself Chairperson, 
20 
may I not respond to this question, in case I incriminate 
myself. 
MR CHASKALSON SC:   And the next column, which is the 
column that relates to the entity that is usually the shell 
entity designated by Salim Essa or Ashok Narayan to take 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 201 of 397 
 
a cut, you’ll see on the top it says Homix, there’s an 
amount of 2 496 600 in there, are you aware whether any 
of the amounts paid by SAA to Regiments on this contract 
were paid on to a shell company designated by Salim Essa 
or Ashok Narayan? 
MR 
RAMOSEBUDI: 
 
 Again, 
Chairperson, 
with 
your 
permission may in not respond to this question in case I 
incriminate myself. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, what we – this is a 
document that the – that exists in very many different 
10 
iterations because it’s constantly updated and the flow of 
funds team will be referring to various copies of it from 
time to time but we’ll make sure that it comes back in an 
A3 format, so that the individual line items can be 
identified. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that’s fine. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And Chair that concludes my 
questions in relation to SAA, as I mentioned earlier we will 
have more questions in relation to Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, Mr Ramosebudi we are – I 
20 
am going to excuse you but ask you to come back 
tomorrow as arranged.   Mr Chaskalson should we say two 
o’clock should be fine? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Two o’clock will be fine Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, your counsel obviously hears the 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 202 of 397 
 
times so – but thank you very much for coming to give 
evidence and assist the Commission as much as you can, 
you are now excused.   Your team is excused too, your 
legal team. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  I will then excuse you Mr 
Chaskalson and your team, I will take a short break and 
then after about fifteen minutes I will start my evening 
shift. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you Chair, might I ask 
10 
from my side I certainly don’t expect that I will need more 
than the three hours from ten to one to deal with material 
with Mr Makhubo that does not embrace anything that Mr 
Powell addressed yester. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, so we don’t need to start early 
tomorrow? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can we start at ten tomorrow? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then we can start at ten tomorrow. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you Chair.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, I will take a fifteen minute 
20 
break, then at quarter past five we will start the evening

Page 203 of 397 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good afternoon Mr Kennedy, good 
afternoon everybody. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Good afternoon Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I know that we probably are all on the 
evening session having done our day sessions and different 
places. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  Are you ready? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  We are thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Chair – so this is a resumption of the 
10 
hearing of evidence in the Denel stream.  You will recall that 
a long time back Mr Riaz Saloojee the former Group Chief 
Executive Officer of Denel gave evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON: Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  End of 2018 beginning of 2019. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And he has been asked to come and 
give further evidence arising from certain allegations made 
that relate to him by other witnesses that you have already 
heard. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Chair may I ask before we deal with 
where you can find the affidavits and so forth that he can be 
sworn in? 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Yes 
please 
administer 
the 
oath 
or 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 204 of 397 
 
affirmation.  Welcome back Mr Saloojee.  Thank you. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MR SALOOJEE:  Riaz Saloojee. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
MR SALOOJEE:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give 
10 
will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the 
truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help me 
God. 
MR SALOOJEE:  So help me God. 
REGISTRAR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you; you may be seated.  Yes Mr 
Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  Chair the affidavit 
and annexures that came before you previously when you 
heard the original evidence of Mr Saloojee are to be found in 
20 
Exhibit W4.1.  So I beg your pardon W4A and B.  What you 
should have had placed before you now is Bundle 10 Denel 
Bundle 10 which includes the supplementary affidavit and 
you will find the supplementary affidavit Chair from page 799 
in Bundle Denel 10. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 205 of 397 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 7? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  99. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  It hopefully has been flagged like ours 
as Exhibit W4.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes it has. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And if I may ask the witness the usual 
questions just to get confirmation that he has signed in fact I 
see it is – Mr Saloojee if I could ask you please to turn to 
page 799?  Is this the first page of the affidavit or statement 
10 
that you have prepared at the request of the commission?  Is 
that correct Mr Saloojee? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And if I can ask you please to turn to 
page 806 in fact sorry at the foot of 805? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  There is a signature near the foot of 
the page, is that your signature? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And is it correct that you… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will have to speak up please Mr 
Saloojee. 
MR SALOOJEE:  Thank you Chair.   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you.  And is it correct that you 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 206 of 397 
 
signed this affidavit before a Commissioner of Oaths? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now as your affidavit indicates 
you were asked to provide additional information in a form of 
responses to particular points raised by other witnesses.  
And we are going to take you through the particular topics in 
that regard. 
 
I am going to come back to the – later to the first few 
issues that you deal with in your affidavit and those… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are there two statements?  I think there 
10 
seems to be another one or is it a duplication at page 807 Mr 
Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes in fact there is a second one on… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That one is a statement – the first one is 
an affidavit. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  That is what was confusing me earlier.  
Yes page 807 may I just ask Mr Saloojee is that a further 
supplementary statement that you have given?  Very recently 
on the 24 November. 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes Chair. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And is that your signature on the – on 
page 816? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Is there any reason why that has not 
been signed in front of a Commissioner of Oaths?  I am not 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 207 of 397 
 
trying to catch you out I am just interested? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Chair I am not sure.  We can rectify that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  If you would please. 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  If we can trouble you to have that 
resigned in front of a Commissioner of Oaths and if you 
would please then forward that to the legal team so that it 
can be placed before the Chairperson of this commission. 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now Mr Saloojee for both of 
10 
these affidavits/statements you confirm that you have been 
through them and that you confirm the correctness of their 
contents? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Kennedy.  Maybe – maybe it 
is going to cause confusion if he is going to sign the same 
document before a Commissioner of Oaths on the date after 
today.  Maybe as long as he confirms under oath that what – 
that the contents are true and correct to the best of his 
knowledge and belief then effectively becomes an affidavit. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So as to avoid any confusion. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Mr Saloojee so it seems it is not 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 208 of 397 
 
necessary for you to go through that formality but can I just 
confirm you – just remind you that you have just taken an 
oath before the Judge the learned Judge’s Registrar and 
before the Chairperson of the commission do you confirm 
under oath that the contents of this statement that has not 
previously been sworn to before a Commissioner of Oaths is 
in fact in all respects true and correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right thank you.  You can actually – 
yes.  Can I just pass on a message from the technical 
10 
people?  Can you just switch on your microphone and you 
can leave it on. 
MR SALOOJEE:  I leave it on. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes just leave it on throughout your 
evidence. 
MR SALOOJEE:  Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Until you are excused from the witness 
box.  It is going to be easier for you I am sure and also for 
the technical people.  Chair may we then ask that the 
affidavit that appears from page 799 be formally admitted as 
20 
Denel Exhibit 4. – sorry W4.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will leave out Denel.  Denel will be fine 
for the bundle.  We just say Exhibit whatever – whatever. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I am sorry I did not get that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I am saying for purposes of what 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 209 of 397 
 
exhibit we will call it we will leave out the word Denel. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So it will be W4.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The affidavit of Mr Riaz Saloojee starting 
at page 799 is admitted as Exhibit W4? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  .1 
CHAIRPERSON:  4.1 Okay alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  And may we ask that 
the statement/affidavit from page 807 be admitted as W4.2? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  The statement by Mr Riaz Saloojee starting 
at page 807 is admitted as Exhibit W4.2. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  Chair I propose to be 
as brief as I can be with this witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Particularly because he has already 
given detailed evidence led by the previous Denel team. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Admittedly some time ago but the 
evidence is transcribed and it is available to you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  What I am going to focus if I may is just 
on specifics aspects that have arisen from other witnesses 
testimony that – that call for comment by Mr Saloojee or that 
he has taken the trouble to deal with by way of comment in 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 210 of 397 
 
his affidavits that have now been admitted. 
 
Mr Saloojee may I please take you in Bundle 10 to 
page 801?  Yes I think you have it in front of you. 
MR SALOOJEE:  This one? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I think it is that one yes just look for 
page 801.  And remember it is the top left hand. 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Black printed numbers. 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  801.  At the foot of the page do you see 
10 
there is a heading Award of the Platform Hulls Contract to 
VR Laser Services? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  During October 2014.  Now Mr Saloojee 
you have adamantly denied an allegation that was made by 
Mr Stephan Burger that you instructed Mr Ntshepe to work 
with and trust Mr Essa.  Just explain to the Chair please 
what in fact you may have given by way of instructions to Mr 
Ntshepe? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Thank you Chair.  Firstly I have never 
20 
instructed Mr Ntshepe to work with Mr Essa.   As I have 
indicated in my previous testimony before yourself that I had 
introduced Mr Ntshepe as head of Business Development 
and Marketing to Mr Essa as we have done with many other 
clients 
and 
customers 
that 
we 
should 
manage 
that 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 211 of 397 
 
relationship.  There was never an instruction for him to work 
with Mr Essa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it might depend what meaning one 
attaches to the phrase work with Mr Essa.  Certainly what on 
your own evidence you had done as I recall your evidence 
last year was to say to Mr Essa I think Mr Ntshepe was going 
to be the contact person or the person who would deal with 
him at Denel in regard to whatever Mr Essa was wanting to 
deal with with Denel.  And I think you said you had said the 
same thing to Mr Ntshepe to say from now on you attend to 
10 
him or some – or some – or words to that effect, is that 
right? 
MR SALOOJEE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And obviously that meant that there would 
be interaction between the two of them. 
MR SALOOJEE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether you call that working with Mr Essa 
or not that might be so but you had instructed him or asked 
him to be the person to attend to Mr Essa whenever Mr Essa 
wanted to deal with Denel on whatever the matters were. 
20 
MR SALOOJEE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Chair just to pause for a moment.  My 
attention has just been drawn to the fact that Mr Saloojee 
has a legal representative present. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 212 of 397 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Who is apparently a – who is 
apparently a candidate attorney Ms Gahle and I apologise to 
her for not having raised it before. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but I do not think a candidate attorney 
can – has a right of appearance here. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Perhaps not but just so that you that he 
– he is accompanied by somebody from his attorneys. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well she can sit as an observer but I do 
not think she has a right of appearance here. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  As you please Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us continue.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now Mr Burger has – has given 
evidence that – that you were pressuring him to appoint VR 
Laser for the hulls contract and your evidence has been the 
contrary that you have been pressured by Mr Burger and 
perhaps others within the organisation to appoint VR Laser 
for the hulls contract.  Now do you persist with your version? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes Chair absolutely.  I never gave any 
instruction to Mr Burger to work with VR Laser. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now you were – you told me earlier you 
were able to listen to at least part of Mr Burger’s evidence 
last week, is that right? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  Did you hear his evidence in 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 213 of 397 
 
relation to this aspect? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Part of it Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I beg your pardon. 
MR SALOOJEE:  Part of it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Part of it I see.   
CHAIRPERSON:  You can just lower the microphone so that 
you do not have to stretch yourself.  Ja okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now Mr Saloojee it just seems rather 
odd that where we have two senior experienced business 
people both with a wealth of experience, both in your case 
10 
and in the case of Mr Burger – of course you were senior but 
both of you had huge amounts of experience.  It just seems 
odd that you are both so adamant on versions that are 
completely contrary and it does not seem the sort of thing 
that would slip ones’ mind and that one cannot remember all 
the detail this sounds at least to me as an outsider to be 
quite a fundamental issue.  And so one has to wonder why is 
there a difference – this fundamental difference in opinion or 
version rather.  Do you have any comment on that? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Chair if I may?  The fact of the matter is 
20 
that Mr Burger alleged that I had given him an instruction.  I 
have never given him an instruction to work with VR Laser.   
 
If events or how events have unfolded over time 
dictates that we determine how did this process be initiated.  
Of course there is going to be some level of culpability in 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 214 of 397 
 
terms of where did this idea emanate from and I think that is 
what I am responding to.  That there was never a discussion 
between myself and Mr Burger where I explicitly giving him 
an instruction to work with VR Laser. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Could it have been implicit?  Could it 
have been a subtle hint?  Could you have done that? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Chair I would be very clear about whether 
it was explicit or implicit. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Par of his version is that you 
specifically raised this by way of a proposal and then an 
10 
instruction on the basis that VR Laser should be given this 
contract because of their political clout. 
MR SALOOJEE:  With respect to Mr Burger that would be 
political suicide if I had made a comment like that.  I mean 
how would I make a comment to give people work because 
they have got political clout?  It is just not in my nature in 
my own understanding of who I am to behave in that manner. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  We dealing with a situation in 2014 is 
that correct?  That is when VR Laser was contracted. 
MR SALOOJEE:  2014. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  By DLS to do the platform hulls. 
MR SALOOJEE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  At that stage you must have 
been aware of the true ownership of VR Laser not so? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes Chair that was publicised in the media 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 215 of 397 
 
and elsewhere. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  And was that before or after you 
gave approval for this contract? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Before Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  And did it raise any alarm bells 
when it was being proposed to you by management that you 
should approve the award of a very major lucrative contract 
to a company that had connections with business people who 
were the subject of enormous media controversy? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Chair at that point there were no legal 
10 
processes that I was aware of that were being taken against 
VR Laser itself or the owners of VR Laser.  It would have 
been remiss of me to not allow anybody a due process in 
terms of wanting to do business with Denel.  And that is the 
view that I had taken at that point. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  What seems to have happened though 
Mr Saloojee is not that they were just given an equal chance 
to compete with the rest of the market in a competitive bid 
process either an open publicly advertised tender or a closed 
restricted bid process, is that not right? 
20 
MR SALOOJEE:  Sorry Advocate can you just repeat that? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Well there was not an open tender 
process here, was there? 
MR SALOOJEE:  There was a closed tender in my 
understanding. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 216 of 397 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  There was a closed tender. 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Three bids were solicited one from VR 
Laser, one from LMT the in-house group – group entity, 
correct?  Is that right? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And then a company if I recall its 
acronym was DND? 
MR SALOOJEE:  DCD. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  DCD I beg your pardon you quite 
10 
correct.  Yes.  And do you know how it came about that VR 
Laser was selected as one of the lucky three to put in their 
bids? 
MR SALOOJEE:  That proposal came from the division in 
Denel called Denel Land Systems which Mr Stephan Burger 
was the CEO. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  Of course Mr Burger’s version is 
not only that you instructed him to give a contract to VR 
Laser because of their political clout it is that he happened 
to be very happy with that – receiving that sort of instruction 
20 
because he believed that VR Laser was really the best entity 
to be able to do this sort of contract.  Were you aware of that 
support that he had for their technical or production 
characteristics? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Chair of course I was aware of the fact that 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 217 of 397 
 
there was a company called VR Laser that was very capable 
in this industry and he made no bones about that.  Why 
would I then instruct an individual to work with them when he 
had already indicated that that is the company that had 
preferred?  It does not make sense. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now were you…. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before – before Mr Kennedy continues can 
I just ask this question?  You said it was a closed tender 
process that was followed here.  Was there a provision in the 
Procurement Policy of Denel for a closed – for what you call 
10 
a closed tender process? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Chair historically for critical capabilities 
historically even before I got there there has always been a 
process where you could have a closed tender for critical 
strategic capabilities. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I understand the – I understand the 
historical part but that says there was a practice so I am 
asking whether that practice was something that was based 
on some provisions of the policy or was it a practice that was 
outside of the policy of the company? 
20 
MR SALOOJEE:  Chair this – there was a policy pre-dates 
me but that was the norm in the organisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you – you – are you or are you not 
aware whether in the company policy there was a provision 
for this so called closed tender policy – process? 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 218 of 397 
 
MR SALOOJEE:  Chair I am not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are not sure? 
MR SALOOJEE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay but you say in terms of practice that 
had been done over a long period of time and I think that is 
what Mr Burger was also saying.  I think he too if I am not 
mistaken could not point to anything in the policy that may 
have dealt with that.  I may be mistaken. 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I just wanted to check that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Okay. 
 
Mr 
Kennedy 
what 
is 
your 
recollection Mr Kennedy on this point? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Chair the issue of whether it should 
have been an open tender or opposed to a closed bid tender 
was not a matter of concern raised by either Ms Malahlela or 
by Mr Mlambo.  Their concern though was the way in which it 
was – in which it was carried out and whether the other 
procedures had been followed.  So it was not that that there 
was not an openly advertised tender. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but you see Mr Saloojee says yes 
there was no open tender. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But there was a closed tender process. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 219 of 397 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And obviously the next question is was a 
closed tender process a lawful process within the company?  
So that is why I asked the question. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So my – my question is whether you are 
aware or whether there is something in the provisions of the 
policy of the company that governed or talked about a closed 
tender process or is that something that we have not paid 
attention to because the – nobody has raised it? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  We have not firstly because nobody has 
10 
raised it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But secondly we have not raised it as a 
legal team. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Because it appears that the Supply 
Chain Policy is rather vague in that regard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  That does not mean to say that it 
permits it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But I have not proposed to go into any 
detailed questioning of any witnesses such as Mr Saloojee or 
the previous ones because that was not the most glaringly 
obvious 
breaches of the policy which appears to be 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 220 of 397 
 
incontrovertible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes I would like you to have a look at 
it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and in due course you can share 
with me what you find. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  We will do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With your legal team because I – if the 
question is if as a matter of fact a closed – what Mr Saloojee 
calls a closed tender process was followed. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I cannot say the process was unlawful 
unless I know whether in terms of the policy it is permitted or 
not. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Indeed.  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so if they did not follow an open 
tender policy I cannot jump to say that was unlawful without 
knowing whether the process that he says was followed was 
permitted or not.  So – so I think that is the importance of it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  As you please Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  The situation is also complicated by the 
fact that there was a change in the SCM policy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  There was one version which was very, 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 221 of 397 
 
very vague about this sort of thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And then the other that was brought in 
as I recall the tail end of 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Very late in 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  As I recall after this contract had been 
awarded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But before the Single Source Supply 
contract was awarded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And things changed there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So it is fairly complicated but we will 
address to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  In appropriate legal submissions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Mr Saloojee were you made aware of 
the fact that when the three bids were received there was a 
vast difference in price between LMT and VR Laser?  Just 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 222 of 397 
 
leave of account DCD at the moment they were fairly – they 
were fairly sort of middle of the road.  But were you aware 
that there was a huge difference in price between the 
amount tendered or bid by LMT as opposed to VR Laser? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Chair I was aware of the fact that there 
was a discrepancy in terms of the amounts that were 
competitive.  I was not sure the amounts - –he exact 
amounts and when I read through the documents what I do 
pick up is that LMT was significantly cheaper.  The other two 
were more or less in the same ball park but I was aware and 
10 
more so after the documentation came to me. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now were you made aware at that time 
or at any time while you were GCEO that Mr Burger had 
spoken to VR Laser and indicated according to his evidence 
a serious concern that their price was so high and that had 
resulted in them bringing down their price substantially? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Chair I think that came to light after he had 
had the discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay just before Mr Kennedy asks the 
question let me go back to the closed tender process just to 
20 
make sure that I understand what you – what the elements or 
features of what you are call a closed tender process.  Can 
you tell me what is supposed to happen if it is a closed 
tender process? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Chair so what will happen is that it will first 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 223 of 397 
 
of all be defined as a strategic project.  That is the first thing 
there.  I mean it has to be – it has to be critical and it has to 
be with suppliers that are probably the only ones who are 
capable of performing at that level.   
 
So you would identify who those are in the country 
and then you would approach them and ask them for bids – 
for quotations.  That is what Mr Kennedy is referring to. 
 
That there were three bids that were submitted based 
on the criteria that those were three companies identified 
who could perform the job according to the specifications 
10 
that was required. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So first the job to be done or services to 
be provided must be strategic? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And who is supposed to make up the 
determination whether anything is strategic? 
MR SALOOJEE:  It will – it will come from the division that 
is responsible.  In this instance Denel Land Systems. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  So once – once it is a 
strategic job or service product that is required then it – 
20 
once it satisfies that requirement then the process is you 
must identify the service providers who can provide that kind 
of job or those services.  And out of them you must – out of 
all of those there may be many I assume you must identify 
three or is there no limit as to how many you identify? 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 224 of 397 
 
MR SALOOJEE:  It depends how many companies are 
capable of performing that particular aspect of the work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you – if they are ten are you supposed 
to invite all ten or? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Chair let me put it this way.  You could 
either invite all ten or take the top three or the top five. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh as you see – as you see [talking over 
one another]. 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes in terms of the priority with where you 
see the real capability lies. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes – oh okay, okay.  And all of that is 
driven by the division concerned? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Then  you ask them for 
quotes that is what you do – for quotations? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and then you decide on that? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Well then they will go through an 
evaluation process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR SALOOJEE:  There will be certain criteria that they have 
to through. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SALOOJEE:  It will go through the Executive Committee, 
it will go through the technical people.  To go through a 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 225 of 397 
 
whole range of committees before a decision is made. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is the position that the process for a 
closed tender process, the process is the same as an open 
tender system other than – the only difference is that, with 
an open tender, you invite the whole world, as it were but 
with a closed process, you invite a few. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, it should be the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The process should be the same? 
MR SALOOJEE:   The process should be ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Except for who you invite. 
10 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Thank you.  Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now going back to the question that I 
have asked you earlier about Mr Burger raising with VR 
Laser concerned that their price was so much higher than 
LMT.   
 
Were you aware that he was concerned, firstly, that the 
price was so much higher?  And secondly, were you aware 
that he raised his concern with VR Laser? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, I think it was either Mr Mhlontlo  or 
20 
Mr Wessels.  They have mentioned it in passing to me that 
there was an issue around the pricing and that the divisions, 
in this instance Mr Burger is attending to it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Were you aware that only VR Laser 
was asked to revised its price and the same opportunity was 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 226 of 397 
 
not afforded to LMT or DCD? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, I have become aware of that now 
after having gone through the documents. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Do you have any comments on what 
you have now discovered? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Well, Chair either there was an informal 
decision that had already been made or that DLS was set on 
that particular supplier and that is the reason they did not 
see fit to go to the other two suppliers.  I can only speculate 
that that was the reason. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now you received a motivation to grant 
your approval and that, in fact, reflected the scoring of the 
three bidders.  And it, in fact, reflected the fact that there 
was an absolutely marginal difference in scoring between 
LMT and VR Laser.  In fact, approximately 0.6%.  Less than 
one percent difference in scoring.  Do you recall that? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes, Chair I do. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And were you not then concerned that 
they were so close?  There was no – there was really a 
negligible difference.  Would you not agree?  Zero point six 
20 
percent is negligible, not so? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, I do agree it is negligible. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Were you not concern then when 
you were asked to approve the awards to VR Laser, that 
where you have two rival bidders, one of whom is an outside 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 227 of 397 
 
company, VR Laser whose ownership rests in people with 
controversial connections, and on the other, an in-house 
Denel Divisional Group called – a group entity called LMT?   
 
Were you not concerned that you are being asked by 
way of a recommendation to favour the outside company 
rather than the internal division where there was nothing, 
really, material between them in scoring and where the one 
would – had first tendered a price of more than – 
approximately a hundred million rand more than the internal 
divisional entity, LMT and where even when VR Laser was 
10 
persuaded or induced to reduce its price, it was still going to 
be approximately R 30 million more to place the business 
with VR Laser? 
 
Did that not concern you? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, of course it concerned me but there 
are two issues here that we need to be cognisant of, is that, 
when 
they 
went 
through 
the 
evaluation 
process, 
and 
according to my understanding, they went through a proper 
process for single – within that division. 
 
They came up with a score however minimal it was in 
20 
terms of the difference but that it had gone through a 
process and that that process is what they had said should 
determine who should get the contract. 
 
But in addition to that, and I think when we go through 
the documents and that, you will look at the volumes and the 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 228 of 397 
 
amount of reasons that were given as to why that should be 
the preferred bidder from a technical one, to a risk one, to a 
financial risk one, to an operationally critical success one, to 
meet the milestones. 
 
They were convinced that, notwithstanding that it was 
such a small margin between the two – between the 
companies that that was the right thing to do. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But it was you who had to make the 
final decision.  You were the person vested with approval – 
the approval power, not so? 
10 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, notwithstanding the fact that the 
final decision had to come to me.  The fact is that you cannot 
overrule a process that has gone on, from my understanding, 
in the very in-depth way over months and having been 
signed off by the senior executives in that division and by 
the COO and the CFO, Group CFO. 
 
When it comes to me, for me as an individual to override 
a decision like that would have been very problematic.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Saloojee.  If you are the final 
decision maker and other people recommended to you.  
20 
Whatever decision you take, whether you go along with their 
recommendation or you reject their recommendation, should, 
I would imagine, depend on whether you feel that you can 
defend your decision either way. 
 
And that you cannot take a decision that you cannot 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 229 of 397 
 
defend just because you think other people can defend their 
position, is it not.   
 
You have to ...[intervenes]  
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...be able to defend the decision. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, you are correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Okay.  But at the point at which this was 
finally brought to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
10 
MR SALOOJEE:   I was convinced by all the other people 
that this was the right thing to do.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Well, what once you say that, then 
Mr Kennedy can then ask you questions based on the fact 
that you are saying, you believe it was the right decision.  So 
the fact that other people recommended it or not is, you 
came to the conclusion that it was the right decision.  Then 
he can ask you question on that, is it not? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, if I recall that even in that 
submission, there was a very clear undertaking that work 
20 
share would be given to LMT. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Ja, but the point I am making is.  If 
it is your decision, you must be able to defend it.  You – if 
you – you should not take it if you are – you do not think you 
can defend it.  I think that is the point.  And I think you would 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 230 of 397 
 
agree with that, is it not? 
MR SALOOJEE:   I do agree with that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  In fact, your 
affidavit – if I can take you to page 802, paragraph 19?  This 
is what you say: 
“Mr Burger was adamant that VR Laser Services 
should be awarded the contract as all DLS’ internal 
processes, technical reports and the view of the 
originally equipment manufacturers supported this 
10 
view. 
In addition, he cited performance and contractual 
criticisms of LMT with regard to existing contracts 
and 
that 
there 
were 
serious 
defects 
in 
the 
manufacturing 
process 
on 
the 
quality 
of 
their 
output.” 
 
I can just stop at that stage.  Did he discuss that with 
you 
or 
was 
it 
apparent 
from 
the 
Memorandum 
of 
Recommendations that you referred to? 
MR SALOOJEE:   I am not sure at what point these 
20 
comments were made but this was conveyed to me by the 
COO and the CFO. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That is Mr Wessels. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And Mr Mhlontlo. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 231 of 397 
 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Respectively. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Now we are going to get in a 
moment to the work share that you referred to in the rest of 
this paragraph and you have mentioned in passing, a 
moment ago. 
 
But 
you 
were 
persuaded 
at 
the 
time 
that 
the 
recommendation was a sound one and that, therefore, it 
should be approved.   
10 
 
As you sit now in the witness box some years later, 
having learnt of a whole lot of further information that you 
may not have been aware of at the time. 
 
Do you feel with the benefit of hindsight that it was in 
fact a wise decision made in the interest of Denel and the 
state that owns it? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, at that point, as I have indicated, 
from all the arguments that were put before me and all the 
critical issues that were going to impact on that programme. 
 
At that point, I thought that it was the right thing.  Not 
20 
necessarily the correct thing but the right thing.  So in that 
instance, yes.   
 
With hindsight...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Hmm. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes? 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 232 of 397 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, just continue. 
MR SALOOJEE:   With hindsight, it may have been viewed in 
a different way but at that point, that was the reality.   
CHAIRPERSON:   You said it was the right thing, not the 
correct thing.  What is the difference?  [laughs] 
MR SALOOJEE:   ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not know what the difference is.  I 
want to make sure I understand what it means. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, I think that the right thing was that, 
having gone through all those processes and the technical 
10 
reports and all the other arguments that they have put 
forward in terms of the delay in the programme in terms of 
the contractual obligations, in terms of the quality issues 
that was a key thing for them.   
 
It 
was, 
from 
a 
process 
perspective, 
and 
the 
investigations that they did, the right thing to do.  As 
Mr Kennedy has indicated.  Because of the slim margin, 
maybe the correct thing would have been to go back to 
revisit it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now what is the difference between the 
20 
correct thing and the right thing?  That is what I want. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, it could be a moral observation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And which one would be – would have a 
moral – a more moral support between the right thing and 
the correct thing? 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 233 of 397 
 
MR SALOOJEE:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   In terms of what you intend conveying to 
me when you say it was the right thing to do but not maybe 
not the correct thing.  I just want to understand that.  That is 
why I am asking you these questions. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Well,  Mr Kennedy has said with hindsight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SALOOJEE:   The right thing at that point was the - of 
10 
the experts from the division. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Now, if I reflect back on it and all the 
history that has gone on and water that has flown under the 
bridge.  Maybe the correct thing would have been to have 
revisited it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Burger was 
adamant, according to your evidence, that VR Laser should 
get it and that LMT should not get it.  LMT should not get it, 
20 
he argued because of its poor track record. 
 
Of course, LMT had been assessed and scored in the 
evaluation and the adjudication process and had not done 
particularly badly. 
 
It had not been, for example, disqualified as not having 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 234 of 397 
 
the capacity or the technical ability or huge quality problems 
that disqualified it.  You are aware of that? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Now, you would recall.  We had a 
consultation on a life platform, Zoom platform a few weeks 
back. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you recall telling me that you know 
feel that there was an attempt by Mr Burger to cast LMT in a 
bad light which was contrived.   
10 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes, Chair that is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And just explain to the Chair please 
why you told us that? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, if I recall and having read, for 
example, the testimony of Mr Jan Wessels who was the 
COO.  When he was appointed by me as the COO, Chief 
Operating Officer, one of the first responsibilities I had given 
him was to go and see what the issue was between LMT and 
Denel Land Systems, and more specifically, between the two 
CEO’s.  That is Dr Nel and Mr Burger. 
20 
 
Because there was obviously some issue between the 
two individuals with regard to the manner in which they saw 
how they approached the work and the professionalism with 
which they thought each company performed.   
 
And that was the real issue that we had to contend with.  
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 235 of 397 
 
When the issue of VR Laser and LMT came up, my own view 
was that there was a very clear view from Mr Burger that his 
mind was made up that this was going to be – what was 
going to happen. 
 
And that he used every single argument to negate the 
efficiency of the capability that resided within LMT.  Now, 
notwithstanding what I have just said. 
 
There were definitely problems at LMT.  I was also made 
aware of the fact that the local client, the National Defence 
Force and specifically the South African Medical Health 
10 
Services, were extremely unhappy with the performance of 
LMT with regard to some of the ambulances that they had 
manufactured for them. 
 
So that was a critical issue and it became quite an 
important issue then.  I am also aware of the fact that for 
example they had a problem with the United Nations in terms 
of the house cracking but that is a technical discussion 
that... 
 
I am not a vehicle expert.  I am a generalist.  I look after 
the 
organisation 
across 
the 
different 
domains. 
 
And 
20 
Mr Burger and his team were adamant that in terms of 
capacity constraints, in terms of performance, in terms of 
quality, the lack of an engineer that was there. 
 
That they were of the firm opinion that it would have 
been a huge contractual risk if they had approved it going to 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 236 of 397 
 
LMT as opposed to VR Laser.  And that is all well-
documented in the documents that they had sent.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Do you feel, again with the benefit of 
hindsight, that you were misled by Mr Burger? 
MR SALOOJEE:   I would not say he misled me.  I would say 
he was economical with what he was telling me.  So in his 
arguments, I think he was very persuasive in terms of the 
inability of LMT to perform.   
 
My own view was that – and I had then actually asked 
the COO at that point, if I recall properly ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Mr Wessels. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Mr Wessels. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR SALOOJEE:   To go and investigate whether this was 
actually true or not.  And again, if I recall, because it is not 
documented anywhere.  I think he was giving a verbal 
feedback.  Was that yes, there were issues that needed to 
be sorted out at LMT.  There were capacity issues. 
 
And if they had won another big contract, it would have 
meant huge capacity constraints.  So if they had won this 
20 
particular contract and they had won – and they were bidding 
for some other big contracts in, for example, Saudi Arabia, if 
I am not mistaken, that it would have just been unattainable 
for them to manage that volume of activity. 
 
And that is I am aware of the fact but I am also aware of 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 237 of 397 
 
the fact that Mr Burger himself was very clear in his mind 
that LMT did not have the capacity or the quality at that point 
to execute the project. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now if I can take you back in your 
affidavit to page 802?  The very same paragraph 19 that I 
read out earlier but for the last four lines.  I would like to 
read those four lines that I omitted last time.  I said I would 
come back to them and I do so now. 
 
You say the fourth line from the bottom: 
“However, it was agreed...” 
10 
 
Do you see that? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
“However, it was agreed that LMT should still be 
part of the work share and as such, I tasked Ms(sic) 
Mhlonthlo..” 
 
Presumable, it is Mr Mhlonthlo, correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
“...and Jan Wessels, the COO, to try to find the 
20 
middle ground between DLS and LMT. 
The aforementioned scenario did not materialise as 
there was no meeting of the minds between the two 
parties.” 
 
The scenario, are you there referring to the intention to 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 238 of 397 
 
try and find the middle ground so that LMT would at least get 
part of the work? 
MR SALOOJEE:   I have said to them that they must find a 
business model that would be a win-win situation for both 
organisations.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  But that was not, ultimately, 
achieved. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Ultimately, it was not achieved, but in 
terms of the work share that went to LMT. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am sorry?  In terms of...? 
10 
MR SALOOJEE:   The work share. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes? 
MR SALOOJEE:   That should have gone to LMT. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Should have, but it did not. 
MR SALOOJEE:   No, I am saying.  I had indicated to them 
Chair that they must a resolution that is amicable to both 
parties, given the capabilities of both organisations.  And 
that Jan Wessels and Mr Mhlonthlo who were assign the 
responsibility to then find a compromised solution. 
 
Obviously, as things eventually turned out, they could 
20 
not.  There was not a meeting of minds and they could not 
come to a compromised solution.   
 
One of the issues was, obviously, the fact that there 
were certain components that LMT could have produced, for 
example, 
the 
back 
doors 
and 
some 
of 
the 
internal 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 239 of 397 
 
components.  And I had that indicated to Mr Wessels and 
they were all in agreement that if it was possible that that 
work share should go to LMT. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But ultimately it did not. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Ultimately, it did not go. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR SALOOJEE:   That is my understanding of it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And presumable, one of the concerns 
10 
that you had was not simply for an amicable resolution to be 
made between the two rivals, LMT and VR Laser, but one of 
your concerns as Group Chief Executive Officer was to 
ensure that LMT’s interest as one of your subsidiary 
companies should be advanced, not so? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, if I did not take into consideration 
that I had to look after internal organisations within the 
Denel stable, I would not have said that.  I would not have 
asked them to go and find a solution that would have 
benefited both parties.  I would have just left it at the 
20 
recommendation of DLS. 
 
And I was genuinely committed to seeing whether we 
could give a portion or an element of the work share to LMT 
in order to fulfil our own responsibilities.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And presumable if LMT did have, as 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 240 of 397 
 
many witnesses have indicated, they had had some problems 
with quality and capacity output ability to produce what was 
required on time, presumable if it was not a completely 
hopeless cause, if it should be made to try and support it as 
an in-house company, not so? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes, Chair.  I mean, we would have 
obviously, naturally would want them to succeed. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  But why was it then left to try to 
find a solution that would be an amicable one where both VR 
Laser and LMT would both be happy?  Surely, VR Laser is 
10 
looking after its commercial interest?   
 
It seems to me, perhaps to be a bit naïve to be saying:  
Well, would it not have been nice if there can be some sort 
of peace and harmony and happiness between the two rival 
entities? 
 
Surely, you should have been saying:  Before I approve 
this deal, I need to be satisfied that LMT cannot do it.  
Because otherwise, they are going to have to pay a hundred 
million or perhaps forty million more from a company who 
has said to be technically superior. 
20 
 
But LMT is in-house and is going to charge us far less.  
So should we not be building up the capacity and solving it 
that way? 
MR SALOOJEE:   So Chair, there are a few issues here.  
The one issue is that, the recommendation from Denel Land 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 241 of 397 
 
Systems and Mr Burger, specifically with his team, was that 
the quality and capacity for MT to build the actual – to 
fabricate the hulls themselves, they did not have the ability 
to do that.   
 
And that was the contentious issue, the building of the 
hulls, the fabrication of the hulls itself.  Where Jan Wessels, 
the COO, advised was that they had the capacity to build the 
backdoor and some of the internal components. 
 
And if I read his testimony correctly, that it was not an 
insubstantial amount, the value of that particular work share 
10 
that would have gone to LMT. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Now, to go back to your point 
earlier that Mr Burger was so adamant that he may have 
contrived the extent to which LMT was inadequate or 
unreliable.   
 
Other witnesses have expressed similar concerns before 
this Commission.  Were you aware that there was, apart from 
Mr Burger’s adamant view that LMT was pretty useless in its 
ability to perform under this contract. 
 
Were you aware that others were a bit more cautious 
20 
and were saying:  Should we not investigate that?  For 
example, Mr Mlambo.   
MR SALOOJEE:   I would imagine that that would have been 
the case Chair.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.   
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 242 of 397 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   At the time you gave your approval had 
VR Laser reduced its price from what it originally was? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, if you look at the memorandum that 
was submitted, he has, according to his own evidence here, 
and the evidence that I have read of other witnesses here, 
which I was not aware to what extent he had negotiated that 
price but he had by then negotiated a new price with them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but nevertheless, VR Laser’s price 
was about what?  R 30 million or whatever.  More than LMT’s 
price, is that right? 
10 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes, Chair that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Bearing in mind that those who, in 
terms of the company’s internal processes, were tasked with 
the task of conducting the technical evaluation of the two, 
had ultimately given a score that, for all intense and 
purposes, really, meant that the two were more or less the 
same. 
 
Because if you accept that a difference in score of zero 
comma something really is negligible.  Bearing in that mind 
and bearing in mind that that job had been done by people 
20 
that in terms of the company’s processes, are deemed to be 
the right people to make a judgment call on those things. 
 
Why 
was 
this 
difference 
of 
about 
R 30 million 
or 
whatever the difference was, why was it not enough for you 
to say:  No, really.  If we are going to pay so much more, if 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 243 of 397 
 
we give the job to VR Laser than if we give it to LMT.   
 
We should give it to LMT because this difference in price 
is enough to make up for the zero comma whatever that 
exists as a difference between the two in terms of scores? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Thank you, Chair.  Having – if you look at 
the rationale behind the DLS motivation.  There was, 
obviously, the technical issue.  There was the quality issue.  
There was the issue of it being missioned critical in terms of 
contractual obligations that they thought, if LMT ran into 
problems, there would be huge penalties contractually. 
10 
 
But they also have another argument and that was a 
financial argument.  And if you look at the documentation, 
they, with the original equipment manufacturer, Patria, came 
to the view that based on – and I am not trying to be sexist 
but man-hours, that it would take to construct a particular 
one unit that it costs X amount. 
 
And that the price that LMT had given in was completely 
unrealistic and way below what it should have cost to 
produce that unit.  And that was their argument. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But were these arguments that they were 
20 
advancing, arguments that they were advancing outside of 
the process, namely, there was a forum where that – those 
arguments had to be taken to account by those who were 
scoring? 
 
Now were they advancing those arguments outside of 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 244 of 397 
 
that forum and outside of those processes?  In other words, 
somebody comes into your office and say:  You know, CEO.  
We cannot give this job to LMT.  This is the problem.  This is 
the problem.  This is the problem.  Which is outside the 
process. 
 
Whereas opposed to going to the forum, if they have a 
right to go to the forum and saying here are the problems 
with LMT. 
 
And then allowing LMT in the right forum to address 
those and then the people who are given the task of giving 
10 
scores, evaluating all of these and giving scores, give those 
scores and everyone else accepts that those are the scores 
given 
MR SALOOJEE:   So Chair, if I have created the impression 
that this was coming to me.  None of this was coming to me.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SALOOJEE:   This was being discussed internally 
through their own Exco, through their own committees, 
through their own technical people, their own financial 
people. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SALOOJEE:   It is only after they had gone through that 
process ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SALOOJEE:   ...that they have brought this. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 245 of 397 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But you see, you referred to their 
arguments when I asked you the question why this difference 
of millions of rands between LMT’s price and VR Laser’s 
price.  VR Laser’s price being millions of rands more than 
LMT’s price. 
 
I asked the question why that was not a good enough 
reason to award the job to LMT on the basis that the two 
were compared by the people who were supposed to score 
the two, the difference was negligible between the two of 
them and then you said these were the strong arguments 
10 
advanced by DLS and so I was asking the question were 
they advancing these arguments outside of the forum or 
the processes because I am looking at why you, being the 
final decision-maker, did not think this difference, in terms 
of millions, was not enough to say – to justify saying look, 
you people, I do not understand why you are saying we 
should give this job to VR Laser when it is going to cost us 
so much more because the difference in the price as not 
negligible but the difference in the score was negligible.  
That was my question.  How did those arguments come to 
20 
you if those arguments were part of what convinced you or 
persuaded you to go with VR Laser? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, that discussion went through all 
the normal forums internally within the division.  I would 
imagine that it was not outside of their formal processes. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 246 of 397 
 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
So, 
in 
other 
words, 
in 
whatever 
documentation was placed before you in order to help you 
make a decision, those arguments were there? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright and the forum that had 
given the scores, had had the benefit of those arguments 
as well. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Well, I guess still it remains if the 
forum that was mandated to give the score had considered 
10 
those arguments because they had been presented to them 
and nevertheless they had scored – the difference in the 
score as so negligible, still I have the question, but the 
difference in millions is big, it is not negligible.  
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, I mean, all I can say is that that 
process was led by DLS and its CEO. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, okay.  Thank you, Mr 
Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Saloojee you 
took issue in your affidavit that we have just been looking 
20 
at with an allegation made by Mr Burger that you approved 
the 
transaction 
which 
was 
the 
transaction 
for 
the 
manufacture of the hulls elements, the platform hulls by VR 
Laser and your affidavit say you did not approve the 
transaction, you instead gave Mr Burger and his divisional 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 247 of 397 
 
colleagues the mandate to award the contract.  Do you 
confirm that evidence and does it particularly matter in 
your view? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Well, in my view, first of all, Chair, and 
Advocate, in that memorandum that was sent, there was a 
very clear item, line item in there, which said that LMT 
should be contracted in this process because for the hulls, 
as I have explained, the back door and the internal 
conference, that was an element of it and if you look at in 
– I had signed because of the fact that I had said I will 
10 
give you the mandate to do that but if you look at the 
document itself and it is very clear up there it says 
approve or reject and it is not there because I had said 
that they must go and look at how they can implement this 
with a compromised solution between the two and I have 
said I have given you a mandate to go and initiate this 
process. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now we know that that condition that 
you attached to the mandate was in fact not fulfilled, that 
in fact LMT got nothing out of this, there was no work 
20 
share ultimately achieved because, as you put it earlier, 
they could not agree between themselves, correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:   My understanding is that that did not 
happen, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes but my question remains, if you 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 248 of 397 
 
gave a mandate subject to a condition, you said yes, I will 
give you the mandate to award this contract to VR Laser 
but on this specific condition, you may do so only if you 
give some of the work to LMT for the back door, etcetera.  
If they did not satisfy that condition, they did not comply 
with the mandate, not so?  They went beyond the 
conditional nature of the mandate that you gave, correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:   That is correct, Chair, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  In fact was your approval not 
rather than just a mandate required under the delegation of 
10 
authority?  This was a contract above 50 million and less 
than 200 million where the delegation of authority requires 
you to take the decision to approve the transaction, not to 
delegate 
it 
somebody 
lower. 
 
Should 
you 
not 
have 
approved the transaction?   
MR SALOOJEE:   I should have approved the transaction if 
the condition was fulfilled. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Yes, but you were never 
approached for that approval. 
MR SALOOJEE:   So I was never approached for that 
20 
approval. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Would it not have better, again with 
the benefit of hindsight and obviously I am speaking as an 
outsider, but the Commission has to look at whether things 
were done correctly and properly and prudently bearing in 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 249 of 397 
 
mind that this is taxpayers’ money that is at stake here?   
Would it not have been appropriate for you to say I will 
consider giving my approval, I am not going to give you a 
mandate to go and do anything, I am going to say try and 
achieve certain things but I will consider giving approval if 
you achieve what is concerning me which is that there 
should be a work share, LMT should get something out of 
it.   
Now whether that would have been permissible in 
terms of the supply chain management policy to give a bit 
10 
to this and give a bit to that is another debate which I am 
not engaging with you but if you were so concerned that it 
be done the right way would it not have been better for you 
to have said well, I am not giving you a mandate, I am not 
giving you approval, I am saying see if you can achieve the 
work share agreement because that seems to me to be 
sensible and to be favouring our internal company LMT and 
come back to me and if you achieve that then I will 
consider giving you approval but until I get satisfied on 
that, I am not going to approve it.  Instead you say go 
20 
ahead, provide that you do this, nobody comes back to you 
and says well, actually we have not achieved it and then 
they carry on with the contract.  Was that not a bit reckless 
on your part, Mr Saloojee? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, I do not think it was reckless in 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 250 of 397 
 
the sense that once that mandate was given – I mean, I am 
running the entire company, it is huge numbers of people, 
seven different divisions, I then expected the division and 
of course the Chief Operating Officer who manages the 
operations in the business to see that things have been 
done accordingly, that they would have done that.  But I do 
take the point that you are making, Advocate. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Did Mr Wessels, as COO, or 
did Mr – at the group level – or did Mr Burger as CEO at 
the DLS divisional level, did either or both of them come 
10 
back to you and say Mr Saloojee, you gave us a 
conditional mandate, unfortunately we have not achieved 
the condition, we have not fulfilled the condition. 
MR SALOOJEE:   No, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So you were left in the dark? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Should they have come back to you 
and told you that? 
MR SALOOJEE:  I would imagine that they should have.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Do you know why they did not? 
20 
MR SALOOJEE:   I can speculate about that, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  Now once thing puzzles me 
and if you have an explanation that might help the 
Commission 
because 
perhaps 
the 
Commission’s 
Chairperson is wondering about this as well and that is 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 251 of 397 
 
this.  Mr Burger was adamant that LMT was not up to the 
job so it should not get the contract even though it came 
within a whisker, 0.6% in scoring and even though its price 
was massively better from a Denel point of view and Mr 
Burger gave evidence that he thought well, they were just 
trying their luck. 
 
On the BEE side DLS – I am sorry, LMT had been 
given I think a zero percentage initially because its 
certificate was out of date, this despite the fact that it was 
not a private sector company, it was an in-house state 
10 
owned division, not so?  Correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes, Chair, but it was not a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Denel. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That is true, it was I think 51% 
owned by Denel. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Correct.  So BEE still had an element 
of significance.  I accept the point.  But what puzzles me, 
let me get to the nub of my question.  What puzzles me is 
this, DLS at divisional level decided who to ask in terms of 
20 
the closed tender RFO, request for orders or RFQ, request 
for quotes process, not so? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes, Chair.. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you left them to make that sort 
of decision because that was an operational decision. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 252 of 397 
 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes and in answer to a question from 
the learned Chair a moment ago you said well, we would 
not ask 10 people necessarily, we might only ask three 
people because they are the three people that we would 
rank the best that we feel in the market.  What puzzles me 
is this, DLS goes out on an RFO process and asks LMT as 
one of only three bidders to submit a bid.  If LMT was 
genuinely such a useless supplier and unreliable supplier 
as Mr Burger seems to have persuaded you ultimately, why 
10 
on earth was there a request for them to make a bid in the 
first place?  It just seems to me to be suspicious that it 
looks as if it was contrived, the whole RFO process.   
Let us ask LMT, we know that they are not going to 
get it because they are useless but let us ask them to go 
through a pretence of some sort of competitive process in 
which only VR Laser and LMT and DCD are going to 
compete.  We know that LMT is just not going to get it 
ultimately – not clear exactly how DCD may have featured 
in all of this but it just seems to have been an inevitability 
20 
in the mind of Mr Burger.  
In fact that seemed to be suggested in his evidence 
previously that only VR Laser was up to this contract, that 
is why we had to have them and he seems to have 
persuaded you in relation to that.  Did it ever strike you as 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 253 of 397 
 
odd, as it strikes me as odd, that LMT was invited to put a 
bid in the first place if ultimately, even though their price 
was going to be far, far less, they then get eliminated 
because well, you cannot consider them because they are 
useless.   You understand the anomaly? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, can you imagine if DLS and Mr 
Burger had excluded LMT, which is a subsidiary of Denel, 
which had some capability albeit with issues that they had 
to deal with.  If they had not included LMT in that bidding 
process it would have spoken volumes for their lack of 
10 
commitment to ensuring that Denel organisations, whether 
they are wholly-owned or partially owned would get some 
of the work it would have been an embarrassment for Mr 
Burger if he had done that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Well, that may be so but then still 
LMT ultimately was excluded.  They were turned down even 
for part of the work ostensibly because while their price 
was so much better, their quality was so much worse. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, Advocate, I mean, I think, you 
know, if you look at Mr Burger ’s testimony right from the 
20 
onset, he knew that this was the right decision.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR SALOOJEE:   To go with VR Laser.  He says, you 
know… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then he was just going through the 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 254 of 397 
 
motions if that is correct, was he not? 
MR SALOOJEE:   With hindsight now if I listen to what he 
was saying, if …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I mean, if you know even before you 
begin the process that you are going to take this supplier 
and not anyone of the other two is that not going through 
the motions? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, I agree with you because, I mean, 
if I listened to Mr Burger when he was here the other day, 
he said it was absolutely the right decision then and he 
10 
still thinks today it was the right decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.   Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I might have interrupted your question. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am sorry, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I may have interrupted your question. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   No, thank you, Chair, that is your 
prerogative, of course.  Chair, may I move away slightly 
from the business reason and whether who was the better 
supplier and the reason for eliminating LMT and now to 
20 
look at a slightly different but related aspect of this 
transaction.  Now here I am going to ask you please to just 
put aside – just close that file for a moment.  You have got 
file 10, I think, is that right?  Just put that aside and can 
you please find – and somebody can help you if you cannot 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 255 of 397 
 
find file 1, bundle 1. Do you have that?   
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now this contains a number of other 
witnesses’ affidavits and their annexures and I would like 
you please to turn in this bundle to page 785. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Sorry, is it with the red? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Sorry?  No, not the red number, the 
black number on the top left, it says Denel-01-785, I am 
going to use the only the last three digits of the number. 
MR SALOOJEE:   So which is the page you are referring 
10 
to? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   785.  Now just to check that we are 
looking at the same page and the same bundle. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes, yes, we are. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It is -  the top document is an email 
dated the 4 September from Dennis Mlambo to Stephan 
Burger, is that correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And it is copied to Celia Mahlalela.  
Now she was the head of supply chain management in the 
20 
division of DLS, correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And Mr Mlambo was the head of 
supply chain management  at group head office level, 
correct? 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 256 of 397 
 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And he reported to Mr Mhlontlo. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   CFO at the time. 
MR SALOOJEE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And the CFO reported to you. 
MR SALOOJEE:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So Mr Mlambo did not report directly 
to you. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes, Chair. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   He was nonetheless the head of 
supply chain management for the whole group. 
MR SALOOJEE:   He was the supply chain manager, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Manager? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I see in some of the documents even 
your own – even the company’s own delegation of authority 
referred to him a supply chain executive. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Executive. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But nothing particularly seems to 
20 
turn on that, not so?  He was still a very senior official 
whose word presumably should have been considered 
carefully, correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now to go back to Mr 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 257 of 397 
 
Mhlontlo, he is one of those referred to as receiving a copy 
of this, as is Jan Wessels, as is Reenen Teubes and then 
yourself as well.  Now just to put this in context, Mr 
Mlambo has given evidence  - were you able to hear his 
evidence? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Again, some of it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Some of it, I see.  And he referred to 
this correspondence as relating to the difficulties that he 
specifically raised in his capacity as group supply chain 
manager with his colleagues, including yourself, relating to 
10 
the platform hulls contract.   
Now to give it its context, perhaps we should start 
because this is an email of the 4 September, the email 
correspondence seems to have started without you being 
included in the list of people who were copied.  If you look 
at page 788, there is an email from Dennis Mlambo to 
Celia/Reenen, do you see that?  The 2 September 2014. 
MR SALOOJEE:   So it is 788? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   788, yes, it is halfway down the 
page. 
20 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   On 2 September 2014 at 18.38.  Do 
you see that? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And is an email from Dennis Mlambo 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 258 of 397 
 
to Celia and Reenen, both officials within the DLS division, 
correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then he is raising an issue about 
LMT in fact having a valid BBBEE certificate and then he 
says: 
“I will request details from Stefan Nel about the 
pricing and proof of shareholding of VR Laser as 
discussed.” 
So clearly there had been some discussion between Mr 
10 
Mlambo at group level with his divisional colleagues at 
supply chain and executive level in the form of Mr Teubes 
and Ms Mahlalela , correct?  
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes, Advocate, this indicates that there 
was a discussion going on. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   There was a discussion, indeed. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Were you made aware of that at the 
time or did you find out about that later or not? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, I found that out later. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  Now at the foot of the 
previous page you will see another email that come this 
time, the second last line on page 787 from Reenen Teubes 
and that goes back to Mr Mlambo and here he copies not 
only Celia Mahlalela but also Mr Mhlontlo and Mr Wessels 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 259 of 397 
 
and Mr Burger, not yourself, we see.  You were not copied 
in at that stage and he, Mr Teubes, is responding to Mr 
Mlambo 
about 
the 
BBBEE 
aspect 
as 
well 
as 
the 
shareholding.  Again you were not made aware of this 
immediately at that stage, is that right? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  Now the top of page 787 is a 
far more detailed email from Mr Mlambo, that is now dated 
the 3 September 2014, do you see it? 
MR SALOOJEE:   On page 787? 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, the top email. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And it is from Mr Mlambo to Mr 
Teubes copied again to Ms Mahlalela, Mr Mhlontlo, Mr 
Wessels and Mr Burger, again not yourself, correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   He raises a whole lot of serious 
concerns, at least they appear on the face of it to be 
serious.  He says, for example, in relation to paragraph 1: 
“The capability assessment of the three tenderers,.  
20 
LMT is the only one of the three tenderers that has 
manufactured the same hulls under contract from 
Patria but it obtained the lowest score.” 
So he seems to be querying how that could come about 
and then he refers to the price difference being almost 100 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 260 of 397 
 
million, that is the price different between VR Laser and 
LMT of 100 – almost 100 million.  That is what we 
discussed earlier, not so, Mr Saloojee? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   This is obviously a matter that was of 
concern to Mr Mlambo.  Would you accept that he was 
entitled, in fact perhaps expected, to be raising this sort of 
question?  There might have answers to the questions but 
it was – he was doing his job in good faith to try and ask 
these questions.  Would you accept that? 
10 
MR SALOOJEE:   That is right, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And then he says: 
“In my investigation I was informed by Stefan that 
the LMT quote was based on factual figures since 
LMT has manufactured the hull before.” 
He gave evidence that the Stefan there is Stefan Nel of 
LMT rather than Stephan Burger.  
“If Stefan is right…” 
He says. 
“…it would not make business sense to pay so much 
20 
more.” 
In other words, R100 million more on top of a 156-odd that 
LMT was quoting, in other words, another two thirds of we 
have to pay what VR Laser is quoting.  Then he says: 
“Since LMT is a sister company I believe someone 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 261 of 397 
 
at DLS should have demanded the supporting 
evidence before assuming that LMT under quoted.  I 
believe this anomaly warrants further investigation 
and validation.” 
And in fact Mr Burger later gave evidence before this 
Commission to say in fact the distortion appears to have 
been on VR Laser ’s side.  VR Laser was way above the 
rest of the market and that is what I told him, I think you 
are being cheeky, how can you – and immediately they 
reduced their price by something like 60 million.  Now then 
10 
Mr Mlambo says in paragraph 3: 
“LMT was given a zero score on transformation due 
to its expired certificate.  The two elements of 
transformation, 
namely 
ownership 
and 
EE, 
employment 
equity, 
could 
have 
been 
assessed 
without a valid BBBEE certificate.  Such date 
should 
be 
readily 
available 
from 
the 
HR 
department.” 
Now that is because presumably the HR department of 
Denel knows these things because LMT is majority owned 
20 
by Denel, correct?  Right.  I see you are nodding, just bear 
in mind …[intervenes] 
MR SALOOJEE:   Sorry, yes, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I know it is a bit tedious but just bear 
in mind it has to be recorded. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 262 of 397 
 
MR SALOOJEE:   No, yes, that… 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And possibly transcribed.  And then 
paragraph 4: 
“According to my records LMT participated in the 
clarification meeting on the 26 June 2014.  It was 
given two weeks to submit its BBBEE certificate and 
the certificate was submitted on the 9 July 2014.  
This paints a picture of being unduly harsh on LMT.” 
Again, would you accept that Mr Mlambo was doing his job 
in good faith to raise this sort of concern? 
10 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And his concern here was – apart 
from this is going to cost us a great deal more where there 
does not seem to be an explanation, on top of it he is 
saying there appears to be an unfairness being perpetrated 
against LMT because what has been held against it is its 
lack of BBBEE credentials but low and behold, LMT is part 
of our group structure because it is partly owned by Denel.  
Surely we should know, we could easily find out what its 
BBBEE credentials.  He seems to be suggesting here, not 
20 
so, that there is something funny going on or even if it is 
not deliberately sinister motive that is behind this, this 
thing is not being done according to the book, correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes, Chair, I would agree with that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 263 of 397 
 
MR SALOOJEE:   But – can I make a comment, Advocate 
Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, please do. 
MR SALOOJEE:   But I think obviously from a DLS 
perspective they were doing the right thing.  If you look at 
the arguments and the logic of Burger ’s reasoning, that 
what they did going through the processes and it countered 
everything that Mr Mlambo was saying and we can come 
back to that, Advocate. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, but let us look for example at 
10 
the BBBEE certificate.  What he seems to be suggesting is 
guys, really you are being so technical, you did not 
actually need a current BEE certificate.  Now I am not 
going to go in a debate as to whether Mr Mlambo was right 
or wrong in terms of his interpretation of the SCM policy, 
but his intention is clear.  He is saying we must not be too 
formalistic about this sort of thing, the information is 
available, it is an in-house company, all we have to do is 
go down the passage and ask HR if there is any doubt 
about their BBBEE credentials.  Why are we being so tough 
20 
on LMT in relation to BBBEE certificate and yet so relaxed 
about giving a contract to VR Laser when it is going to cost 
us, at that stage, almost R100 million more? 
 
Now again he seems to be suggesting you guys are 
really being so formalistic, in other words that the process 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 264 of 397 
 
of procurement is not being done truly in a fair and 
transparent and accountable way perhaps as some sort of 
sham going through the motions, that is what seems to be 
the undercurrent of what he is suggesting here, was that 
your impression too? 
MR SALOOJEE:   You mean my impression after having 
read…? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Of the concerns that he raised. 
MR SALOOJEE:   That he raised about it? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, that is really the thrust of what 
10 
he was conveying. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, they were valid. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  So not only was he raising 
these but they were valid concerns, okay.  Then he says in 
paragraph 5: 
“The documents submitted by VR Laser on the 
ownership raise suspicions as they do not specify 
the individual shareholders in person.  The names 
Elgasolve and Craysure Investments are silent 
about the identities of the real shareholders of the 
20 
company.  There were no other documents to 
authenticate.  I trust the above details also clarify 
my reasons for not supporting the recommendation 
to appoint VR Laser to manufacture the hulls.  
Alternatively, the entire process must be revisited 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 265 of 397 
 
and conducted in a fair and subjective fashion.” 
So he is saying that is why I have not approved this.  Now 
do you accept that Mr Mlambo should have at least been 
consulted 
to 
certify 
his 
being 
satisfied 
that 
the 
procurement policy had been properly complied with? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes, Chair, he should have been 
consulted 
and 
there 
should 
have 
been 
on 
ongoing 
discussion between DLS and himself. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR SALOOJEE:   And I am not sure if DLS actually 
10 
responded to this because I was not privy to this. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   We are going to look at that in a 
moment. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And I will help you with the 
documents on that.  But it is clear that he is against the 
award of the contract, correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And his recommendation is that the 
entire process has to be restarted and that it must then be 
20 
conducted in a fair and objective fashion.  In other words, 
he was saying this has not complied with our supply chain 
management policy, it is not in the interests of Denel, it is 
not fair and objective.  That is my understanding of the 
email.  Would you accept that understanding on his part? 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 266 of 397 
 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And on the basis in fact that you 
believe that his concerns were valid.  Right, now he did 
indeed 
engage 
in 
further 
discussions 
with 
DLS 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I think you were asking a 
question but I did not hear an answer, I think you moved 
onto the next one. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Do you want to go back to your 
10 
question because I did not hear an answer but I saw you 
were moving to another question. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Oh, I am sorry, I thought I got the 
answer.  I am not sure which question you… 
CHAIRPERSON:   The one immediately before the one that 
you were in the middle of. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Well, perhaps I can just revisit 
everything that I deal with in the last minute or so.  So he 
was raising his concerns, those were valid concerns, 
correct? 
20 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And he was raising a conclusion, in 
his view, that was to this effect.  The procurement process 
was not fair and objective, correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:   That is what he is indicating. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 267 of 397 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes and not in compliance with the 
supply chain management policy’s requirements, correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:   That is what he is saying. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And he was saying you need my 
approval and I am not giving it for these reasons.  You 
should restart the process from scratch.  Correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:   That is what he is saying here, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now we then get to the point 
that you raised earlier.  You assumed that he raised these 
concerns with DLS and addressed them further with them. 
10 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you proceed Mr Kennedy, you 
earlier on Mr Saloojee said that Mr Mlambo’s concerns 
were valid, I take it you are referring to these concerns? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you say they were valid must I 
take it that you agreed with the points, the concerns he 
was raising or is the position that you are saying you are 
not necessarily saying you agreed with him but you think 
they were legitimate to raise without necessarily that you 
20 
are agreeing with them? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair at that point I wasn’t aware of this 
conversation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At that point. 
MR SALOOJEE:   I wasn’t aware of this conversation going 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 268 of 397 
 
on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But right now you say you think they are 
valid? 
MR SALOOJEE:   So what I am saying is that he was 
correct in bringing to their attention the concerns that he 
had. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   You are not saying anything, you 
are not expressing an opinion on their merits? 
MR SALOOJEE:   No Chair I am saying he was correct to 
raise these issues. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SALOOJEE:   If he was concerned about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you Chair.   Now there is then 
a response from Mr Burger to Mr Mlambo and we see that 
email, the heading to it appears right at the foot of page 
785 and the next of the email appears on page 786, do you 
see that? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   The  heading indicates it was sent by 
20 
Mr Burger on the 4 t h of September at 1:57pm, it is 4 t h 
September 2014, it is addressed to Dennis Mlambo and 
copied this time again to Celia Malahlela, Mr Mhlontlo, Mr 
Wessels and again to Mr Reenen Teubes, but significantly 
also yourself, your name is indicated as the email being 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 269 of 397 
 
sent by way of a copy to you.  Do you recall if you received 
this email? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes Chair I am sure I have seen this 
email.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, now Mr Burger in an entire page 
on page 786 gives a very detailed response to some of the 
issues raised by Mr Mlambo and he says that he believes 
that the process was absolutely correct and fair and 
stringent in evaluation etcetera, and then after the – sorry 
after the numbered paragraphs ,do you see paragraphs 1, 
10 
2, 3 and 4? 
MR SALOOJEE:    Yes.    
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Below that an unnumbered paragraph 
follows, it says: 
“Nevertheless I am convinced that VR Laser is 
technically 
best 
equipped 
to 
execute 
this 
programme.  I also believe given the recent contract 
performance of LNT it will be irresponsible to place 
a contract of such criticality on them also taking 
into account the effect the KSA order will have on 
20 
them.” 
Now so he was attempting to address at least some of the 
concerns of Mr Mlambo, because Mr Mlambo in his 
evidence has criticised Mr Burger for not actually dealing 
with the heart of the concerns that he had raised and you 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 270 of 397 
 
have already acknowledged that those were raised validly.   
 
Now at the top of page 785 there is then a response 
from Mr Mlambo to Mr Burger and he again copies in the 
same people, including yourself, you recall if you received 
this? 
MR SALOOJEE:   I must have seen that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Now may I read it, at least the 
relevant passages into the record.   He says: 
“Dear Stephan,. 
We are clearly not aligned in terms of the analysis 
10 
of the data and information that I saw for the first 
time on Tuesday at the meeting I had with Reenen 
and Celia.  I certainly think we should not exchange 
any more emails on the issue in question as the 
resolution may be easier to find around the table.  
However the following issues have definitely not 
been addressed by  your response: 
1. The huge price differential in the offers made by 
LNT and VR Laser.  Stephan Nel of LNT is 
adamant that having produced the hull before 
20 
makes his quote a lot more realistic.   On the 
other hand VR Laser ’s quote is not based on past 
performance.   Needless to say that prototypes 
are 
typically 
a 
lot 
more 
expensive 
than 
production related products.  I am also informed 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 271 of 397 
 
that the price capacity and capability concerns 
were 
never 
raised 
during 
the 
clarification 
meeting. 
2. The mere fact that VR Laser refuted any conflict 
of 
interest 
through 
the 
submission 
of 
said 
document does not confirm the validity of the 
ownership, 
the 
adjudication 
team 
evaluated.  
Where is the document which should have been 
asked for, that details the individual shareholders 
of Alger Solve and Craysure Investments.  Even 
10 
the documents that list the directors of the two 
companies are not valid CIPC documents.  I 
cannot understand why they were accepted. 
3. You’ve also not explained why the capability or 
technical rating of LNT is the lowest despite the 
fact that the other two companies if they were 
successful would be making this type of hull for 
the first time. 
4. I have received evidence that the two week grace 
period 
for 
the 
submission 
of 
the 
BBBEE 
20 
certificate by LNT was met and yet you claim that 
could not be considered as it was after the 
deadline.   It is standard practice that a supplier 
that is being verified for BBBEE level cannot be 
penalised for that especially if the critical data 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 272 of 397 
 
used in the assessment is readily available.  
What makes this even more unacceptable is the 
fact that we have unhindered access to data and 
information as LNT.” 
So again Mr Saloojee do you accept that what Mr Burger 
had replied in the email below that to Mr Mlambo, in Mr 
Mlambo’s professional and good faith view did not properly 
answer his questions? 
MR SALOOJEE:   That is what is reflected here. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  And then he says after the 
10 
numbered paragraph 4, the final unnumbered paragraph, 
he says my contention, this is Mr Mlambo still speaking  
“is that despite being convinced of a fair and 
objective 
process 
that 
was 
followed 
by 
the 
adjudication team ...” 
that appears to be a reference to Mr Burger saying that it 
was indeed fair and objective –  
“let 
us 
appoint 
an 
independent 
assessor 
to 
corroborate your claim.   It is also worth mentioning 
that you flouted the delegation of authority by not 
20 
presenting the file for review to me before engaging 
Fikile ...” 
and Fikile of course is Mr Mahlantlo, CFO, and Mr 
Wessels, COO,  
“any transaction above R20million must go through 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 273 of 397 
 
my office first.  I am beginning to have doubts that 
this was an oversight.” 
What seems to emerge from this email is the first point that 
you have already acknowledged, that these were bona fide 
concerns that Mr Mlambo believed had not been properly 
addressed, correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Secondly he makes it clear that in his 
view there had been a serious flouting of the delegation of 
authority because they haven’t approached Mr Mlambo’s 
10 
office 
at 
an 
early 
stage, 
correct, 
that 
is 
what 
he 
...[intervenes]  
MR SALOOJEE:   That is what he is saying 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, and thirdly he is questioning the 
bona fides of Mr Burger, he is saying I am having real 
doubts about why this happened.   How did it come about 
that you didn’t come to me Mr Burger, I am having serious 
doubts about whether this is a genuine oversight.   In other 
words I am accusing you Mr Burger of actually acting in an 
underhand and deliberately deceitful manner.  That is what 
20 
he is saying, not so? 
MR SALOOJEE:   That is what he is saying yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now what I found interesting with 
your evidence earlier was that you felt well a measure of 
deference must be – and I am using words that you didn’t 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 274 of 397 
 
use but giving my understanding, you seem to be saying 
earlier that it wouldn’t be right simply to ride roughshod 
over a division such as DLS that has for strong reason 
motivated the appointment of VR Laser and you assumed 
that if Mr Mlambo would have problems he would go back 
to DLS.   Now am I understanding your evidence correctly? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, and we know now from these 
emails that that in fact happened, Mr Mlambo did continue 
the debate with DLS, correct? 
10 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   As you would have expected him to 
do, as he should have done, correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But we also know that he doesn’t get 
joy from the division in the sense that he asks a whole lot 
of questions, he gets some answers, but he says I am not 
persuaded that those answers are good answers at all, I 
still have serious doubt about things like price, why we are 
paying so much for this, about why we are not giving it to 
20 
LNT that is going to give it to us as such a price, a better 
price, where the technical capacity has not been properly 
motivated and explained and thirdly there are other issues 
such as BBBEE certificate having been dealt with in a way 
which is over formalistic and inappropriate, and finally Mr 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 275 of 397 
 
Mlambo actually gets to the point where he says now I am 
beginning to think that you are trying to pull the wool over 
my eyes. 
 
Now what I suggest to you Mr Saloojee is that the 
very fact that Mr Burger himself copied you in, he was the 
first person to copy you in on this correspondence not so? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, and then Mr Mlambo continued 
that course by copying you in, this presumably must have, 
if you had read it and you say you must have read it, it 
10 
must have raised or rung some serious alarm bells.  He 
must have realised now that there is a serious issue, that 
Mr Mlambo who is the head whether one calls him the 
manager or an executive he is the head within the group of 
Supply Chain Management, of course accountable to Mr 
Mhlontlo who was accountable to you but there is now an 
impasse between group level supply chain management in 
the form of Mr Mlambo and DLS Divisional Management, 
not so? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now presumably this would have 
been a serious alarm bell, this is something serious 
because it is not well you haven’t attached an annexure to 
your motivation please don’t send me some – it was 
nothing of that sort of technical nature or a point of minor 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 276 of 397 
 
detail.  Mr Mlambo is effectively saying really the process 
you have followed is extremely irregular and in fact may be 
tainted by bad motive.    
 
Now did you not realise at the time that you must 
have read these emails that there was in fact a serious 
problem of this nature? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair if I may, I am familiar with the 
contents of these documents, and it was discussed with me 
by Mr Mhlontlo and by Mr Jan Wessels. Again I must admit 
that I have been – I am running an organisation to get 
10 
involved at that level was just not at that moment possible, 
and I had given Mr Wessels and Mr Mhlontlo a directive 
that they need to go and investigate what is going on here. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Did they ever report back to you that 
they have [a] investigated and [b] come up with a 
resolution? 
MR SALOOJEE:   The only feedback that I got was that 
there 
was 
issues 
between 
Dennis 
and 
there 
was 
a 
difference of between Mr Mlambo and DLS and both of the 
view that they have been doing the right thing, so that DLS 
20 
had indicated Chair that they have gone through the proper 
processes, they do not agree with what Dennis is saying, 
they have justified why the price is what it is, they have 
justified why the BEE scoring was done the way it was an 
that is the conclusion that they had come to, that was my 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 277 of 397 
 
understanding of how it was. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I understand your understanding, but 
may 
I 
question 
you 
about 
whether 
it 
is 
valid 
that 
understanding.   You have here as the Group CEO two 
different entities within the group, the one is Head Office, 
your supply chain manager Mr Mlambo, you have on the 
other DLS which is a division, you are aware that they are 
now at loggerheads and in terms of that situation Mr 
Mlambo is saying you have seriously messed up the 
procurement process, correct, that’s what he was saying. 
10 
MR SALOOJEE:   That is what he is saying Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, it just seems a bit strange to me 
as an outsider, and perhaps I am being naive but it seems 
to me to be a bit strange that your approach is well guys 
chat amongst each other and then you get the message 
back well DLS are sure that they have done it all correctly 
and that is where the matter ends.   Of course DLS would 
think that they have done it correctly, that is why Mr Burger 
keeps writing letters, emails at great length to Mr Mlambo 
but Mr Mlambo is saying well I have heard you out but you 
20 
haven’t actually even properly answered my questions, so 
how could you remotely have been satisfied with news 
coming back to you, busy as you no doubt were, satisfied 
well if DLS say that they have complied that is good 
enough for me, isn’t the whole point that DLS say that they 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 278 of 397 
 
have complied but Mr Mlambo says they haven’t complied 
and he is even accusing them of going through a sham 
process of having bad motives and he lists in great detail 
the points that they haven’t addressed which are non-
compliance with the procurement policy.   
 
Why do you leave it to the one party in this dispute, 
namely DLS, to basically say we have done it all fine, trust 
us.  Do you see the problem? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Mr Kennedy I understand what you are 
saying.  Chair the issue is I did not leave it to DLS to say 
10 
that everything is fine, the fact is that I had then given a 
directive to Mr Mhlontlo and Mr Wessels to go and 
investigate whether these issues that Mr Mlambo was 
raising were valid or not and that is the process that they 
had gone through, and the response when they came back 
to me was that there is a fundamental difference of 
opinion.   
 
There are two schools of thought, the one school of 
thought is the supply chain process within DLS, the 
technical evaluations, the BEE evaluations and everything, 
20 
they stand by what their view is and they disagree 
fundamentally with what Mr Mlambo is saying and from my 
understanding 
they 
were 
saying 
that 
Mr 
Mlambo 
is 
deliberately trying to derail this process.  That is the 
response that I got. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 279 of 397 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but the fundamental question is 
once you got those – once you understood that they could 
not reach agreement Mr Mlambo and DLS, somebody had 
to take, to resolve that impasse.  When I say resolve it I 
don’t necessarily mean go and get them to agree but 
somebody had to make a decision and that person was 
you, was it not, who had to make a decision as to which 
decision 
would 
be 
correct, 
bearing 
in 
mind 
these 
fundamental differences.    
10 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair you are correct but at the end of 
the day as we have gone through the whole process and 
the submission was eventually made as to why they 
believed that this was a critical issue that needed to be 
resolved with appointing VRL as Mr Burger has given 
evidence, as all the paper trail has indicated as to why 
they justified having taken the view that they did, that was 
the view that prevailed with Mr Wessels, with Mr Mhlontlo 
which they brought to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mmm, I take it that what you mean is 
20 
that despite the fact that you say understood Mr Mlambo’s 
concerns you are saying that you came to the conclusion 
that 
his 
concerns 
when 
weighed 
against 
the 
views 
expressed by the DLS side were not justified, or were not 
correct on a balance on the scale. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 280 of 397 
 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair to tell you the truth my own view is 
that I thought that they had come to some resolution about 
these issues. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:    And what was the basis for that view 
that they had come to some resolution? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Because after all of this correspondence 
was done nobody, not Mr Mhlontlo, not Mr Wessels came to 
me to say that there was still an issue outstanding here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you had asked to speak, to speak to 
each other or something, to talk and try and find a 
10 
resolution isn’t it?    
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And therefore you were supposed to find 
out what the outcome of that process was, before making 
your own decision isn’t it?   In other words if you said I 
want you to go and talk to each other to try and find each 
other before I make a decision you would – one would 
expect that you would say come back, tell me, what’s the 
outcome of that process because now I must make a 
decision.  
20 
MR SALOOJEE:   Well Chair that’s what I am saying, I 
mean I think when Mr Mhlontlo and Mr Wessels came back 
to me and they indicated that they have addressed this 
issue I thought that there was no other intervention that 
was required at that point. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313

CHAIRPERSON:   Well I am not sure if I follow, I thought 
that what you said a few minutes ago was they didn’t come 
back to you to tell you what the outcome of that process 
was and because they didn’t come back to you to tell you 
what the outcome of their talking together to each other, 
because they didn’t come back you assumed that the issue 
had been resolved, I thought that’s what you were saying, 
as I understand you? 
MR SALOOJEE:   I think if I remember correctly Chair they 
confirmed ...[indistinct] said to me that these issues were 
10 
addressed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what was the outcome of addressing 
them? 
MR SALOOJEE:   There wasn’t any formal paperwork or 
anything which addressed this particular issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Even if there was no paperwork if he 
said to you this issue has been addressed obviously you 
would want to know what was the outcome, what do you 
mean you have addressed, have you now ...[intervenes – 
cross-talking] common cause. 
20 
MR SALOOJEE:   Now, now, now when I look at Mlambo’s 
testimony and I look at what he has said and Mr Burger ’s 
view on what the differences are obviously the issues were 
not resolved. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but what I am going back to that 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 282 of 397 
 
time, if Mr Mhlontlo said they had been addressed I am 
saying you must have asked what do you mean, have you 
agreed, have you not agreed, did you ask that? 
MR SALOOJEE:   I take your point Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you didn’t ask that question? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you Chair.  There was a 
further communication that came from Mr Mlambo to 
yourself, if I can ask you to turn to page 791, the earlier 
10 
email was dated the 4 t h of September 2014 that we looked 
at where he was simply copied in although it was an email 
addressed to Mr Burger, this time it is an email from 
Mlambo to yourself, it is addressed to Mr Saloojee and Mr 
Mhlontlo and Mr Wessels, correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And he says: 
“Gentlemen, 
I 
have 
managed 
to 
review 
DLS’s 
submission 
pertaining 
to 
the 
abovementioned 
subject. The following issues paint an unacceptable 
20 
picture from a process, fairness and objective point 
of view . 
1. The tender documents were not sent to all the 
bidders simultaneously as per the normal tender 
process; 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 283 of 397 
 
2. Prior to the adjudication process there were still 
engagements 
or 
clarification 
sessions 
with 
individual 
bidders. 
 
The 
process 
that 
such 
engagements be held with all bidders at the same 
time.  Information that is requested by one of the 
bidders must be sent to others even if they did 
not ask for it; 
3. Despite the fact that LMT BBBEE’s status was 
disregarded on grounds that it was still being 
verified and the deadline was the 25 t h of June 
10 
2014 the VR Laser certificate was accepted and 
rated on the 27 t h of June 2014, two days after the 
closing date; 
4. In the submission it is claimed that LMT’s quote 
is too low and unrealistic.   The difference 
between LMT’s quote and the VR Laser quote is 
almost R100million.   After questioning Stephan 
Nel on the accuracy of his quote he offered to 
come and present the facts to demonstrate that it 
is based on realistic quotes.   Furthermore he 
20 
claimed LMT had made the hull before under 
Patrios contract; 
5. In my meeting with Stephan Burger yesterday he 
indicated that VR Laser had offered to reduce the 
quote 
from 
around 
R262.4million 
to 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 284 of 397 
 
R195.0million!   Doesn’t that tell a disturbing 
story about the initial offer?   On the basis of 
these findings and other facts it is my considered 
opinion that the submission from DLS be rejected 
since LMT has the capability to make the hull this 
issue should have been discussed before going 
out on tender. 
Goodnight, 
Dennis” 
Clearly he is a bit upset, not so? 
10 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And serious, correct?  Correct, he is 
serious? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he is writing this at about quarter to 
eleven in the night isn’t it? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And addressing it primarily to yourself 
as Group CEO, this seems to me to be firstly an attempt by 
20 
Mr Mlambo to escalate it to the Group CEO level, secondly 
to make it clear that he believes in his professional view 
that there are extremely serious irregularities under a 
lawful and proper fair procurement process and further it 
seems to me to be a cry for help from your most senior 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 285 of 397 
 
supply chain manager to you as Group CEO to intervene 
and to stop a process which he is effectively warning you 
is unlawful and unfair and should be stopped, is that 
correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:  That is what he is indicating yes.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Now you were aware as CEO 
presumably – just forgive me for not knowing all of your 
background, do you have any professional background? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Not legal. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Not legal, and have you ever been a 
10 
supply chain management executive or anything of that 
nature? 
MR SALOOJEE:  No I haven’t.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay so the law on the supply 
management processes are not your area of particular 
expertise. 
MR SALOOJEE:   No they are not.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   To be fair to you, right, but you were 
the Group CEO at the time of a major State entity, correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Dependant on firstly doing a good job 
in the market and trying to be profitable and secondly 
accountable to the State and where there were financial 
shortfalls you would be looking to the State for bailouts as 
it were, not so? 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 286 of 397 
 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, you also know of course 
presumably as a responsible Group CEO, but particularly in 
the current era, at least in 2014, our Public Procurement 
Laws, both from the Constitution and laws such as the 
PFMA, you had heard about the PFMA presumably. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Absolutely. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Of course, and that National 
Treasury 
lays 
down 
regulations 
and 
supply 
chain 
management processes and rules that were binding, not 
10 
so? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And that Denel had to have its own 
system of supply chain management in terms of its own 
policies correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes.    
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you had exactly such policies, 
correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:    Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you knew, because you 
20 
employed him, that you had somebody called Mr Mlambo at 
Head Office level who was deeply familiar with this type of 
issue, not so? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   He was employed based on his 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 287 of 397 
 
expertise, correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Just as Ms Malahlela was employed 
for her expertise in the same field at DLS Divisional level, 
correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Now here you have been told, 
not for the first time, but at least here in an absolutely 
direct and very specific manner that there are some 
extremely serious irregularities that Mr Mlambo has picked 
10 
up.  Now again did you leave this on the basis that you 
thought it was all going to be sorted out? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair I mean this is what I was referring 
to earlier, because I had specifically asked Mr Wessels and 
Mr Mhlontlo, specifically Mhlontlo to go and address these 
issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well this was before you took the 
decision was it not, this was before you gave the approval? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  It is – I am just wondering how you 
20 
could not when told by Mr Mhlontlo that the issue has been 
addressed how you could not have said I want to know how 
they have been addressed when you were aware that the 
issues that Mr Mlambo had raised were so serious, in other 
words that you could go ahead and make your decision 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 288 of 397 
 
without knowing how they were addressed if somebody said 
they were addressed, because you accept these are quite 
serious issues he is raising? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair maybe I should just sketch a 
different view on this thing, okay.  The issues that Mr 
Mlambo is raising I said are correct, he should have been 
concerned about this, okay.  The feedback that I got 
eventually on each one where Mr Mlambo is talking about 
price for example there is an explanation from ...[indistinct] 
as to why the price is what it is.  Where Mr Mlambo is 
10 
talking about the BBBEE certificate there is an explanation 
from DLS Executive Committee why they took the decision 
that they took.   Where Mr Mlambo is talking about the 
difference, sorry the issue around quality and ability of 
LMT to perform or not there was a response by – and Mr 
Burger was here saying exactly that, he countered all of 
these things and that was the explanations that were put 
forward, that they did not agree with what he was saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But are you saying to me it is not as if 
when Mr Mhlontlo said these issues that Mr Mlambo has 
20 
raised have been addressed it is not as if you left that 
issue 
there, 
you 
did 
ask 
him 
how 
have 
they 
been 
addressed 
and 
he 
told 
you 
exactly 
how 
they 
were 
addressed, is that what you are saying? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair if I recall correctly, I mean it is a 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 289 of 397 
 
long time ago, okay, and you say there it was I will be back 
in my office Mr Mlambo is saying, I do recall that there was 
a discussion that took place in the office with Mr Burger 
and Mr Wessels and I think Mr Mlambo was there as well, 
where these, all of these issues were being explained by 
Mr Burger in order to counteract what Mr Mlambo was 
saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but did you call Mr Mlambo, put to 
him what Mr Burger and them were saying? 
MR SALOOJEE:  I think Chair if I recall at that meeting he 
10 
was not at work that day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but before you made the decision did 
you call him to say Mr Mlambo you raised these issues which 
I thought you were right to raise them if they were concerns 
to you. 
MR SALOOJEE:  No Chair we did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But this is what I have been told. I want to 
hear what you have to say about this.  You did not do that? 
MR SALOOJEE:  No we did not do that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why not? 
20 
MR SALOOJEE:  Because between Mr Mhlontlo, Mr Wessels 
and Burger’s explanations and time was going on rapidly 
okay that I thought that they had adequately addressed 
those issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Kennedy. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 290 of 397 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  Do you accept now 
that they had not? 
MR SALOOJEE:  I cannot say that they – I mean in terms – 
sorry Mr Kennedy had not addressed. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But they had not resolved these issues 
– there was a disagreement.  There still is today. 
MR SALOOJEE:  A disagreement? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  Mr Mlambo is absolutely adamant 
that his criticisms were absolutely correct and in fact to an 
extent Mr Burger has conceded at least some of those. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Far with – with hindsight retrospect I 
now realise he was right and I was wrong. 
MR SALOOJEE:  I heard that what Mr Burger was saying you 
know. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  But may I just ask from a level of 
– at the level of accountability of a Group CEO of a state 
owned entity I understand that you were busy but surely one 
of your most important duties as the Group CEO is to ensure 
that your – that you carry out what is expected of you by the 
20 
constitution and by the PFMA, correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And here you having loud rings of an 
alarm bell from your most senior Supply Chain Management 
person saying this has not been done properly it should be 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 291 of 397 
 
revisited.  At one stage as we saw in one of the emails he 
says why do we not get an independent assessor to test 
whether your claims Mr Burger are correct or not?  In other 
words I cannot just simply accept your say so that you have 
done it all correctly because I believe you have not done it 
correctly.   
Why did you not for example not bring in somebody 
for example an attorney or a senior counsel or somebody to 
say, I give an opinion that this has been complied with or 
this has not been complied with and if it has not been 
10 
complied with we do the following?  Why do you leave it on 
the basis well I thought that they were chatting amongst 
themselves and I – I thought that they – had it been 
resolved.   
We know that it was not resolved and now years later 
you having to sit under the glare of television lights in public 
to answer questions about a major transaction that bound 
Denel to huge amounts of public money that just happens to 
have been given to a Gupta linked company where as it 
happens everybody now seems to accept that there were in 
20 
fact procurement problems.   
MR SALOOJEE:  Chair I take the point I mean it is.. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  Can you answer it? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Why did I not... 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Were you not remiss Mr Saloojee? 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 292 of 397 
 
MR SALOOJEE:  Chair I mean I had my chief Group 
Financial Officer, the Group Chief Operating Officer.  I had in 
Mr Burger as he had said a CEO who had been in this 
business for thirty years and they were telling me that they 
had followed the correct process.  I mean and that is the 
advice I had taken. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But  you knew from the email 
correspondence that this thing had been bouncing back and 
forth between Mr Mlambo and Mr Burger.  Mr Mlambo saying 
XYZ are problems.  Mr Burger comes back and says no well I 
10 
have got a reason VR Laser are just great and we know they 
are going to do the job.  And LMT are useless and the price 
does not really matter so much and so forth.   
Mr Mlambo comes back and says no XYZ have not 
been answered in fact I have got a whole lot of other 
problems ABC.  Mr Burger comes back and he says in a long 
email this is my answer to Mr Mlambo then says huh-ha you 
still have not answered in fact I am now thinking that the fact 
that you did not come to me initially as you should have 
shows an ulterior motive.  And he copies you in.   
20 
Now surely that should have alerted you to the fact 
that there is a serious disagreement between them where Mr 
Burger’s say so is not satisfying Mr Mlambo and you leave it 
on the basis well people have chatted amongst themselves 
and they all say that they have done the correct thing.  I 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 293 of 397 
 
mean just at the level of professional courtesy apart from 
anything else does it not perhaps with the benefit of 
hindsight strike you as obvious what is seems to me to be 
obvious which is a response to Mr Mlambo’s email.   
“Dear Denis thank you very much for raising 
these issues.  They will be dealt with by Mr 
Mhlothlo and by Mr Wessels in consultation 
with Mr Burger and you.” 
And yet he has given evidence Mr Mlambo I am looking at 
his affidavit here.  I received absolutely no response from Mr 
10 
Saloojee. 
 
Now let us assume that you are right for a moment.  
That you were entitled simply to leave it even though you 
had been approached as Group CEO intervene for you to say 
well I am not going to intervene I am just too busy and I 
have got other people who should be resolving it so I am 
going to leave it to them to resolve and later I think that they 
have resolved it so it is all fine.   
Just at the level of professional courtesy would it not 
have appropriate for you to say to Mr Mlambo I am afraid I 
20 
am too busy to deal with this but I am delegating it to Mr 
Wessels or I am delegating it to Mr Mhlontlo you will hear 
from them  Would that not have been appropriate? 
MR SALOOJEE:  I agree with you. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  And would it not have been 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 294 of 397 
 
appropriate also for you to follow up so that before you did 
give your approval and we are going to take you to the 
memorandum in a moment where a few weeks later you did 
sign.  Would it not have been appropriate just to be sure 
because you CEO.  You are the Accounting Officer for Denel 
in terms of the PFMA not so? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  You cannot say in terms of the PFMA 
well we slipped up as an organisation but somebody further 
down the picking order in the organisation did not do their 
10 
job.  You were responsible ultimately not so for compliance 
with procurement procedures, correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And Mr Mlambo has said to you they 
have not complied with ABCDEF.  Would it not have been 
appropriate before you signed approval not to rely simply on 
what Mr Wessels or Mr Mhlontlo oh well Mr Burger says that 
he has done it all.  At least again by way of firstly courtesy 
and a way of protecting yourself to write to Mr Mlambo and 
say, this memorandum has come back to me can I just 
20 
confirm all of your queries have been answered and if they 
have not been answered tell me what they are.   
And if there is a division of opinion between you at 
head office and DLS at divisional level we will refer it to our 
– for somebody to give some sort of professional view.  
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 295 of 397 
 
Would that not have been the obvious way of dealing with it? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Chair I mean I think you know within the 
context of what happened during that particular period okay I 
thought I had done the right thing by getting Mr Mhlontlo and 
Mr Wessels to get into this issue and look at the merits of 
this thing.  And Burger and then came back into my office 
and as I have indicated they had gone through each one of 
these issues and said that they think that they have 
addressed this adequately okay.  And the nature of this 
program was of such criticality that we could not continue in 
10 
the vein that we were without coming to some resolution.  If I 
may I do not know if you have had a chance I mean I have 
got it in front of me Mr Wessels in his – in his affidavit 
indicates at that meeting and in fact Ntshepe was at that 
meeting as well where he said… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you can read – refer to what you want 
to refer to if it is relevant to your answer if you want to. 
MR SALOOJEE:  But if I may Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Visit his affidavit. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes carry on. 
20 
MR SALOOJEE:   
“So during the meeting either Mr Mhlontlo or myself referred 
to the email from Mr Mlambo …” 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are now reading from Mr Burger’s 
affidavit? 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 296 of 397 
 
MR SALOOJEE:  No this is from Mr Jan Wessels. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Mr Wessels affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh Mr Wessels’s affidavit. 
MR SALOOJEE:  So there was a meeting that was 
convened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR SALOOJEE:  With Mr Burger, with Mr Mhlontlo, with Mr 
Wessels and Mr Ntshepe was present. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes 
MR SALOOJEE:  To address this specific email of the 9 t h. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes but not Mr Mhlontlo.  I am sorry not 
Mr Mlambo. 
MR SALOOJEE:  No he was not there he was not at the 
office that day. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MR SALOOJEE:  Okay.  So they have convened this urgent 
meeting. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MR SALOOJEE:   
“So during the meeting either Mr Mhlontlo or 
20 
myself referred to the email from Mr Mlambo 
on dated 9 September.  I recollect that either 
Mr Ntshepe or Mr Burger responded that all 
Mr 
Mlambo’s 
concerns 
were 
adequately 
addressed by DLS and the submission for 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 297 of 397 
 
approval on GCEO table reflects that.  As I 
recollect Mr Burger stated that almost three 
months had been lost since July 2014 and 
reiterated 
his 
position 
that 
as 
prime 
contractor for Hoefyster DLS use LMT as a 
program risk to the safety of this fighting 
vehicle project and that he as CEO of Denel 
Land Systems is unwilling to contract LMT 
for 
hull 
manufacture 
unless 
the 
GCEO 
instructs him to do so.   And then GCEO will 
10 
have to take the safety responsibility away 
from DLS and carry it on its own shoulders.  
As I recollect Mr Ntshepe supported Mr 
Burger strongly and stated that the principle 
of decentralised operating model of Denel is 
one 
where 
the 
divisional 
CEO’s 
are 
responsible for the business performance 
operations and contract execution.  If the 
GCEO and if the GCEO overrules DLS in this 
instance 
it 
creates 
a 
dangerous 
future 
20 
precedent for the total group since divisional 
CEO’s will not be held accountable for 
project execution and business performance.  
I also recollect that either Mr Burger or Mr 
Ntshepe stated to Mr Saloojee that in the 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 298 of 397 
 
situation where DLS is instructed to use LMT 
for 
hull 
manufacture 
General 
Ntshepe 
eventually for the army and his senior staff 
will become aware with the monthly program 
reporting via Armscor that there is a safety 
risk on the Hoefyster project which could 
result in contract cancellation.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  May I interrupt you – may I interrupt you 
Mr Saloojee?  Is the position not that nobody should have 
made bets or sought to say well if you do not agree with me 
10 
then you will carry the responsibility?  Is the position not 
that you as the final decision maker had to satisfy yourself 
whether the laws and the policies had been complied with.  
You could not be threatened by somebody to go against the 
laws and go against the policies of the company just 
because they thought you might make a decision they did not 
like and they saying that in the event you will take 
responsibility.  You had to satisfy yourself whether the issues 
that Mr Mlambo had raised which went to the question 
complying with the laws and policies whether there had been 
20 
compliance.  Some – anyone else could say whatever they 
said was not your duty to satisfy yourself that there had 
been compliance and Mr Mlambo saying that there would no 
compliance. 
MR SALOOJEE:  Chair I take what you are saying and the 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 299 of 397 
 
fact of the matter is that when all of these processes was 
finished all of these interactions were undertaken and yes 
there was a discussion around Mr Mlambo’s email.  That 
when they eventually brought this submission to me okay as 
I have indicated that I had given the mandate for them to 
continue with the negotiations with LMT and with VR Laser 
and I thought that was the correct thing to do and that is 
what I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But do you – do – did you satisfy yourself 
whether the laws and the policies were complied with before 
10 
you made the decision? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Well after the presentations that were 
made to me I Mr Mhlontlo by Mr Wessels by Mr Burger and 
responding to each of these things I – I was of the view that 
I was satisfied that they have addressed those issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but I – I am asking the question.  Did 
you satisfy yourself that there had been compliance with the 
laws and the policies or is the position that somebody said 
there had been compliance and you said well if so and so 
says there was compliance I will accept that there was 
20 
compliance even if I did not satisfy myself. 
MR SALOOJEE:  No Chair there was not an external view on 
– or advice on this matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But when I talk about somebody else I am 
talking about Mr Burger and so on. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 300 of 397 
 
MR SALOOJEE:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When I say – when somebody else says 
there was compliance maybe you would say okay if DLS says 
there 
was 
compliance 
I 
will 
take 
it 
that 
there 
was 
compliance.  I am talking about internal people.  So my 
question is did you satisfy yourself that there had been 
compliance or is the position that you deferred as it were to 
other people such as Mr Burger and whoever else who were 
saying Mr Mlambo’s issues are not valid or have been 
addressed and you took that and said well if they say so I 
10 
will accept that that is so even – I will not have to satisfy 
myself. 
MR SALOOJEE:  Chair after having listened to all the 
arguments I had satisfied myself that this was the right thing 
to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja of course that does not answer the 
question whether you satisfied yourself that there had been 
compliance – compliance with the laws and policies.  It might 
the right thing to do and he talked morality in terms of what 
is morally right earlier on but I am simply talking about 
20 
compliance with the laws and the policies.  Did you satisfy 
yourself at approving that before you approved there had 
been compliance with the laws and policies? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Chair after having gone through all the 
arguments and debates and whatever else I had come to the 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 301 of 397 
 
conclusion that there had been compliance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  Is that still your 
view? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Chair I mean I have to study this in a 
better way to understand that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Interestingly Mr Burger who had been 
so adamantly in support of VR Laser’s appointment and it 
ultimately prevailed thanks to the mandate that you gave him 
although he did not comply with the condition.  He has 
10 
repeatedly conceded in the witness chair that you are now 
sitting in to the Chairperson that it was in fact irregularly 
done.  And that Mr Mlambo’s concerns about illegality and 
unfairness in a process were not only in good faith but 
actually correct.  That is was done unlawfully and unfairly. 
MR SALOOJEE:  Chair I am not sure about the unlawful 
thing of what Mr Burger has conceded to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I think Mr Kennedy is correct.  My 
recollection is that Mr Burger conceded that – but what he 
insisted on was that he believed at the time that his 
20 
decisions were in the interest of Denel.  But as to the 
compliance with the policies or the legalities my recollection 
also is the same as Mr Kennedy’s namely that he conceded 
that.  We are not saying you must concede if you do not – if 
you do not see it.  Mr Kennedy was just telling you what Mr 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 302 of 397 
 
Burger’s position was after for quite some time he seemed to 
have insisted that there had been nothing wrong with the – 
with how it had been – this matter has been handled. 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Did you at any stage consider referring 
the matter either to an external lawyer or an internal lawyer 
within the company to give an opinion as to which view was 
correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:  No we did not. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Because you came to the view you say 
10 
after considering all of the arguments that Mr Mlambo’s 
concerns were unjustified.  But you do not seem to have that 
time to have engaged with it and secondly that is not your 
field of expertise.  So would not – I mean at least to protect 
yourself would it not have made sense?  I mean for example 
if the Auditor General came to do an audit and found that 
there were irregularities how would you explain that?  Would  
you say well Mr Burger said he did it so it was all fine in my 
view or that I thought that it was a compliance – compliant 
process that was followed. 
20 
MR SALOOJEE:  Chair I mean as I have indicated before I – 
I was of the view that the process had been followed. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MR SALOOJEE:  I was of the view that this thing had been 
discussed at the very highest level within the organisations 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 303 of 397 
 
and that they had come to the conclusion that these issues 
were adequately addressed and that is what they came to 
brief me on.  And that is what I am saying here.  With 
hindsight yes we should have been… 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes carry on sorry. 
MR SALOOJEE:  We should not have – we should have 
maybe had at least a third party have a look at this. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  I find it interesting what you read 
out from Mr Wessels’ affidavit where he explained in some 
detail the discussion he had with you together with Mr 
10 
Mhlontlo and Mr Ntshepe without Mr Mlambo present.  You 
mentioned that Mr Mlambo was away for a couple of days. 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  His email indicates I think he said I am 
back on Monday. 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes, ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Was the matter so urgent that it had to 
be debated without Mr Mlambo present it could not have 
waited until he was back?  Would that not have made more 
sense whether or not he got…? 
20 
MR SALOOJEE:  I agree with that Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  At the very least to make him feel 
that he is taken seriously. 
MR SALOOJEE:   I agree with that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Because I must admit again as an 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 304 of 397 
 
outsider and perhaps naively I am going to suggest this to 
you but again it just seems to me a bit strange that Denel 
goes to the trouble of appointing somebody who is got a 
wealth of experience.  We have seen his background in his 
own affidavit Mr Mlambo and he raises all of these things.  
Everybody accepts that he does it in good faith.  You 
happened to think that he was wrong.  Mr Burger thought 
that he was wrong although ultimately Mr Burger has now 
accepted that Mr Mlambo was right. It just seems to me to be 
a bit of a waste of time and money and human resources to 
10 
employ somebody like Mr Mlambo with his decades of 
experience.  He does his job in good faith, raises these 
concerns and nobody actually ever gets back to him to say, 
well we have actually had an answer from Mr Burger.  It 
seems to me Mr Saloojee as GCEO that that is probably a 
good answer but Mr Mlambo are you happy?  Can you 
confirm that you agree or do not?  Is there something I have 
overlooked?  Instead he is just ignored that was his 
evidence. 
MR 
SALOOJEE:  Chair I mean there 
were on-going 
20 
discussions between Mr Mhlontlo and Mr Mlambo.  He was 
not being ignored at all and that is what transpired. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And yet – and yet Mr Mhlontlo has not 
given any evidence even when he was asked about this to 
the effect that he was constant discussion with Mr Mlambo.  
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 305 of 397 
 
He did not deny that there was no response to this. 
MR SALOOJEE:  I mean I cannot – I cannot comment on 
whether he said that or not. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  No.  Yes.  And you cannot comment on 
whether he actually did carry out what you would expect him 
to which is to have constant communication with Mr Mlambo. 
MR SALOOJEE:  That is what I was under the impression. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. Were you moved when – I do not 
know you say you saw part of Mr Mlambo’s evidence and 
part of Mr Burger’s evidence.  Did you see Ms Malahlela’s 
10 
evidence? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes Chair I did. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Including the moment when she broke 
down in tears. 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes Chair I did.  I did not see that part but 
I heard you talk – reference it when Mr Burger was here. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And – and did you see Mr Mlambo 
sitting giving evidence here and explaining how he came 
20 
after a lengthy career at Denel that he eventually felt well he 
was – he had to leave because there was no point in him 
being there he was not being taken seriously.  That is the 
effect of his evidence.  Clearly very sad and moving from a 
purely human point of view to see somebody like him a 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 306 of 397 
 
serious profession having become so demoralised trying to 
do his job and just being effectively ignored and the same 
from Ms Malahlela to the point of tears.  Does that concern 
you as a human being as you sit here now? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Mr Kennedy, Chair I mean I sat here before 
you last year.  What they had gone through I had gone 
through myself.  The process that I had – underwent in Denel 
by the time of my suspension had an incredible effect on me 
and my life.  I know Mr Mlambo from the days long days from 
struggle we comrades together.  I have the greatest respect 
10 
for him.  I have the greatest respect for Ms Malahlela. The 
fact that they were treated the way they were treated by that 
organisation.  The fact that myself, the CFO, the company 
secretary were treated in the way in which we were treated 
is in many respects similar to the experiences that they have 
had.  I mean the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The [00:23:11] of course is or part of the 
differences is that in this case you – on their evidence you 
seemed to have been part of the people who were acting in a 
manner that was frustrating them. 
20 
MR SALOOJEE:  Chair I have indicated very clearly what 
were the reasons, the issues that they comprise, the issues 
they are trying to resolve these issues so that we come to a 
win-win situation.  I was doing what I thought was in the best 
interest of the organisation.  I did not give blanket approval 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 307 of 397 
 
for Mr Burger or DLS.  They have to go through a process.  
This process went for over five months that is why when they 
came to my office they said that this is so critical now a 
decision has to be made.  It was stalled for five months 
precisely because of these discussions and debates that 
were going on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course one of the strange features for 
me is that there was that period of about you say five 
months. 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if I recall correctly there were two 
instances where Mr Mlambo – where certain discussions 
happened when Mr Mlambo was not around in circumstances 
where those discussing the matter should have included him.  
The one is the one that we have just talked about.   
You said he was not there on that day.  But he was 
going to come back either the following day or in a few days’ 
time and one asked the question, why could this not wait?  
But apart from that I think and I cannot remember the details 
also at some stage I think when the agreement – I do not 
20 
know which one was signed he had not been consulted at all.  
He heard much later that the agreement had been signed in 
circumstances where on his version and he seems to be right 
in terms of the policies of the company before that 
agreement could be signed he should have been approached 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 308 of 397 
 
so that he could say whether there had been compliance or 
not.   
So one is bound to ask the question was it always – 
was it coincidental on both occasions that he was not there 
when these serious developments happened or was there 
some sinister plan by somebody to exclude him because he 
was going to make it difficult to achieve what they wanted to 
achieve.  Because he had these arguments and these 
arguments were standing in the way of appointing VR Laser 
and Mr Burger at least on one occasion wrote a – wrote him 
10 
a long email but did not address the real issues that he was 
raising.   
And if I recall correctly when Mr Burger was here and 
I hope I am not mixing things up now he could not address 
those particular issues which he should have addressed in 
that email.  So – so you see that – one looks at these things 
and one wonders whether it was always coincidental or at 
least not always on those two occasions when there were to 
be important developments it was coincidental that he was 
not at work.  Or that he was not invited to be involved. 
20 
MR SALOOJEE:  I hear what you are saying Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You understand that? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.   
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 309 of 397 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see we are at quarter to eight. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Eight yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Eight should we – let us talk about how far 
we are from finishing and then maybe we should take a short 
adjournment of ten minutes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes I think I probably need about 
another hour Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About another hour. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  The bulk of it we have dealt with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  In relation to these platform hull 
contracts.  There are some further issues I still need to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Mr Saloojee are you still fine to 
continue? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and okay alright.  Maybe let us take a 
short adjournment ten minutes and then we come back and 
we continue. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
20 
MR SALOOJEE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES: 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 310 of 397 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Chair, we are still in 
Bundle 1.  And may I ask you, Mr Saloojee to turn to page 
793? 
MR SALOOJEE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now that is a recommendation that is 
dated – we see on page 795, the 29t h of September 2014.  
And it is signed by Mr Mlambo, Mr Wessels and Mr Mhlontlo.  
Do you see that? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And I am not going to take you through 
10 
all of the details of this.  The evidence has been that this 
was the product – this is what was called the physician(?) 
paper, relating to the Platform Hulls contract. 
 
Before the final award to VR Laser, what was indicated 
here was a consensus view by the three individuals that a 
portion of the work be shared with LMT. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Are you familiar with this document?  
Do you recall if that was drawn to your attention? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It was? 
MR SALOOJEE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And did you approve it? 
MR SALOOJEE:   No.  I mean, there was no approval 
process with this. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 311 of 397 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  And you were not asked to 
approve it. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But did you think it was a good idea? 
MR SALOOJEE:   What?  The sharing of the work? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. And this, presumable, would have 
achieved the condition that you had set that they need to 
share the work with LMT. 
10 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Of course, what I suggest to you 
is that sharing the work between two of the bidders does not 
necessarily remedy any deficiencies or breaches in relation 
to procurement policies and laws, correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Okay.  Mr Mlambo has given 
evidence that this decision that was taken jointly in this 
position paper that LMT should be given part of the work, 
ultimately, was not carried into effect. 
20 
MR SALOOJEE:   That is correct, ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  And we then come to the next 
document at page 797 which is the submission, Group Chief 
Executive Officer Supply Chain submission.  It is addressed 
to Exco.  Do you see that on page 797? 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 312 of 397 
 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And it comes from the DLS Exco.  That 
is the Divisional Exco. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Headed by Mr Burger, correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
 
And 
it 
is 
dated 
the 
15t h of October 20214.  
Now it 
sets out 
some of the 
background and we see the signatories to this document at 
pages 804 to 806.  The first is Ms Malahlela.   
10 
 
The second is Ms Africa, who is the then Executive 
Manager, Infantry Systems.  And then Mr Teubes.  We know 
he was another executive from DLS.   
 
And then Mr Burger himself.  He was the CEO of DLS.  
And then there is a recommendation by Mr Wessels.  Do you 
see his signature, dated the 16t h of October? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And likewise, a signature for the 
recommendation from Mr Mhlonthlo, Group CFO, Denel, 
16t h of October 2014. 
20 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now you then signed it on the same 
date, the 16t h of October 2014 and we see that on page 806. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now is this the document you were 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 313 of 397 
 
referring to earlier where you did not delete or mark which 
was approved and which was rejected? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  But everybody else seems to 
have interpreted this an approval by you, despite the fact 
that you did not circle the word approve or delete the word 
reject.  Was this, in fact, not an approval by you? 
MR SALOOJEE:   My understanding was that it was a 
mandate given to them to engage in an negotiation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Are you saying that by signing 
10 
here, you thought you were giving them a mandate to enter 
into negotiations? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Despite the fact that except the approve 
or reject?  Or you thought you were approving negotiations? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, I mean, if you look at this.  It is a 
recommendation.  It also has, for example, as I have 
indicated earlier on, the issue of contracting LMT as a Single 
Source Supplier.  They had to go and negotiate this with the 
parties that were involved.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  I am going back to page 804: 
“In line with the discussion are contemplated here 
and we hereby recommend the approval of the 
Group 
CEO 
of 
Denel 
approves 
the 
deal 
as 
recommended selection of the Hull Supplier.” 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 314 of 397 
 
 
So, certainly, that is not – it is the selection that you are 
approving there. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  And then B, you are approving a 
recommendation that the mandate to – a mandate be given 
to then contract negotiations for the manufacturing and 
supply of the hulls.   
 
And then under C, you are – you would be giving 
permission to Mr Burger to sign the contract before the 
manufacturing of the hulls.   
10 
 
So – and D, you were approving a recommendation and 
therefore you were going along with the recommendation that 
– what is this – contracting LMT as a Single Source Supplier 
for the vehicle hulls near rear internal fleet and the 
backdoor. 
 
E:  After the completion of the joint pass for design, that 
they did not therefore vehicle hull near rear internal fleet and 
backdoor be contracted on the same principles.   
 
So I guess, it is not just negotiations that you were 
approving, should be embarked upon.  There may have been 
20 
negotiations but there was a lot more, including concluding 
some contract, is it not? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.   
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 315 of 397 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So maybe just to then go back to 
Mr Kennedy’s questions because you did not delete or 
encircle any of the two words, approve or reject.  You now 
confirm that you were approving what you have said you are 
approving, in line with the recommendations? 
MR SALOOJEE:   In line with the recommendations and the 
mandate to continue with the negotiations as well Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  But of course, B, D, D and 
E are separate paragraphs.  A starts with the Group CEO of 
10 
Denel approves that DLS recommended selection of a hull 
supplier.  That was VR Laser, correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  So whether or not, ultimately, 
there were negotiations with, for example, LMT and whether 
or not they were appointed to produce the rear door, et 
cetera.  You were approving VR Laser’s appointment for the 
Platform Hull components, correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  And this is a mandate entered 
20 
into contract negotiations with the manufacturing supply of 
the Hoefyster Platform Hulls for 183 armoured vehicles to 
ensure that the total contract’s price fits within the DLS 
budget. 
 
Now this seems to rather put things back to front.  
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 316 of 397 
 
Should one not be approving something as Group CEO, 
namely the award of VR Laser as the successful tenderer on 
the basis that they have produced a price, that they have 
produced a bid which involves a price that you then approve. 
 
This seems to be back to front to say:  I am approving 
their appointment but negotiate with them just to make sure 
that the price comes down to fit in with the budget. 
 
This does not seem to me to record with what normal 
legal and fair procurement processes require, is it? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, in any transaction of this nature, 
10 
there will always be a discussion about the price, right up to 
the end in terms of what is the fairest price you will be able 
to get.  
 
And that is what I understand here.  Is that they have 
got a certain budget and they have got to fit it in with this 
budget. 
 
And Mr Burger was very adamant and clear here that 
that was the right thing to do in terms of choosing VR Laser.  
But if we had to choose VR Laser, he had to then make sure 
that he negotiates a price that was within his budget. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And does that not mean that VR Laser 
would have a rather strong negotiating position?  They would 
be approached by Mr Burger to say:  Guys, you have got the 
contract.  Mr Saloojee, good news, has awarded you the 
contract.  But I have just got to bring your price down a bit.   
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 317 of 397 
 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, I mean, if you look at this 
document.  Before it came to me, it has gone through the 
entire process as I have indicated, from...  It says even 
there.  It went through the technical – their Executive 
Committee, their Supply Chain. 
 
In fact, the person – the originator of this document with 
obviously Burger’s instruction, came from Ms Malahlela.  She 
is the first one to it   
 
Albert Africa, who is the Head of Infantry Systems.  
Infantry System is where they actually build or take 
10 
responsibility for the programme management of these hulls. 
 
Teubes is the COO.  Burger, Wessels, Mhlonthlo.  Then 
it comes to me.  It has gone through an entire process of 
some of the most senior people in the organisation. 
 
And obviously by the time it gets to me, it has had to go 
through a thorough process and that is my understanding of 
this document.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But Mr Saloojee.  You cannot always hide 
behind the fact that a number of people hold a certain view 
when you are asked to justify your own decision.  You have 
20 
got to say, this was a correct decision because of A, B, C, D 
irrespective of who held what view.   
 
And if you cannot justify your decision or your view, the 
fact that your view that you cannot justify happens to be held 
by other people, does not necessarily make it correct or 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 318 of 397 
 
right, you know.  They might all be mistaken.   
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, I agree with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SALOOJEE:   But surely, if you look at the level of the 
executives who are here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SALOOJEE:   As a Group CEO, I was to rely on the 
advice and information that was provided by the most senior 
people within the organisation.  That is how organisations 
work.   
10 
 
You cannot have five people, six people who have 
signed this document being wrong about it.  And when they 
bring – they brought the motivation to me, obviously, I 
listened to them very carefully based on all the arguments 
that they have proceeded and I said yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Up to a certain point you take into account 
what they have to say and what their views are, but there is 
a reason why you are the CEO and they are not.  And that is 
why ultimately the power is given to you to make the 
decision. 
20 
MR SALOOJEE:   I agree with you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  Thank you, Chair.  
Mr Saloojee, I am interested in your answer.  You say that all 
of these people signed and they were very senior people.  
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 319 of 397 
 
So you had to take them seriously and you acted on their 
advice.   
 
What I find interesting is that Ms Malahlela’s name and 
signature appear here as the Executive Manager for the 
Supply Chain.  Nowhere do you see any reference to 
Mr Mlambo signing here or being asked to sign, to say where 
he supports the recommendation or not. 
 
Now if Ms Malahlela was so important to give you advise 
at a divisional level where she is reporting to Mr Burger.  
What you seem to have omitted in saying that:  These are all 
10 
the senior people that I was able to rely on their advice.  Is 
an acknowledgement that Mr Mlambo’s name is nowhere to 
be seen. 
 
There is no reference here at all to Mr Mlambo having 
raised concerns and that Mr Mlambo had been engaged and 
had an agreed to anything to resolve these concerns or that 
he had been overruled for good reason or what those 
reasons were.  There is just nothing. 
 
So I just want to point out what Mr Mlambo has said 
before this Commission, both in his affidavit and in his oral 
20 
testimony.   
 
He said – can I take you back to page 793?   
MR SALOOJEE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   He said that he thought that at least 
some of his concerns had been relayed by the position paper 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 320 of 397 
 
which would at least have given LMT some part of the work.  
Nobody came back to him after that.   
 
Nobody came back to him to show him this submission 
at page 797.  And that it is significant, I suggest to you 
Mr Saloojee, that when we go back to this heading I took you 
to a moment ago, page 797. 
 
There is a heading to this document, as one would 
expect.  The heading is that it comes from Denel Land 
Systems, Supply Chain submission. 
 
It comes from the DLS Exco.  It comes from the division.  
10 
And then it contains on page 804, as we have seen, the 
signature from Ms Malahlela from the division.   
 
From Mr Teubes, page 805.  And also Mr Burger, from 
the division.   Mr Wessels from head office.  Mr Mhlonthlo 
from head office.  But not once has anybody mentioned 
Mr Mlambo or his concerns.   
 
He said he thought that his concerns had been resolved.  
And he said he found out later to his shock and dismay that 
all of this document – all that is contained in this document 
was prepared and submitted to you behind his back and that 
20 
you then signed it on the 16t h of October 2014, despite his 
serious objections. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, I mean, I cannot comment on 
whether he saw the document or not.  I would imagine that 
Mhlontlo’s signature here, who he reported to, was the 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 321 of 397 
 
appropriate signature. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it not strange that all of you, yourself, 
Mr Mhlonthlo, Wessels, Teubes, Mr Burger – all of you 
happened 
to 
be 
available 
on 
the 
same 
day, 
the 
16t h of October 2014 but this one man who had strong views 
that – against this, one, is not there.   
 
Two, nobody seems to say:  Hang on.  What about Mr 
Mlambo and his concerns?  At this stage, everybody just 
signs.  It is – it raises some issues.  I am not saying 
ultimately what one makes of them but it just seems strange.   
10 
MR SALOOJEE:   I take your point Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Do you accept the point? 
MR SALOOJEE:   I accept the point. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Do you agree that it is strange? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And there is no explanation for it? 
MR SALOOJEE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Otherwise, if there is an explanation, 
this is your opportunity to give it. 
20 
MR SALOOJEE:   Well, as I have indicated Mr Kennedy and 
Chair.  That I would have imagined that if he was reporting to 
Mr Mhlontlo, it was generated from the division that that was 
sufficient.  And I would be surprised – I am surprised that he 
said he was not aware of this document. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 322 of 397 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR SALOOJEE:   At least ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But you agree at least ...[intervenes]  
MR SALOOJEE:   At least his counterpart. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But why would you say – because I think 
that is what you are saying – you would not have seen, at 
least at stage anything strange about his absence because 
his superior, Mhlontlo was there.   
 
And yet, I think Ms Malahlela who was in the same – or 
maybe I am getting my facts wrong.  Was she not in the 
10 
same line of authority with Mr Burger?  Both were there.   
 
In other words, it does not look like it was a situation 
where it was said each unit or whatever must be represented 
by one person.   
 
Here was a situation where a junior and a senior both 
signed.  And therefore, why should Mr Mlambo not be there 
and sign as well even if Mr Mhlontlo was there. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, I mean, I think Ms Malahlela is the 
one who generated it.  That is my understanding.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
20 
MR SALOOJEE:   It is generated, this, on behalf of the 
division, Head of Supply Chain within the division. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR 
SALOOJEE:   And 
again, I would 
be 
surprised 
Mr Kennedy that given the fact that all the Supply Chain 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 323 of 397 
 
people talk all the time, that Mr Mlambo would not have been 
aware from Ms Malahlela that this – this document existed.  I 
am just – I am speculating. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Are you suggesting that Mr Mlambo 
lied under oath when he ...[intervenes]  
MR SALOOJEE:   No, I am not.  I am not at all. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That he was never – that they never 
came back to him. 
MR SALOOJEE:   I am not saying that Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Then what are you saying? 
10 
MR SALOOJEE:   All I am saying is that, I am surprised that 
he was not aware of this document. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR SALOOJEE:   That is all. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Because you would expect 
Ms Malahlela to go back to him. 
MR SALOOJEE:   I am not suggesting that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You are not suggesting that? 
MR SALOOJEE:   No. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  I just want to touch very briefly 
20 
in conclusion on this leg of the questioning before we wrap 
up with a few other issues.  This Hull - Platform Hulls 
contract.   
 
You said that, earlier, if I understood your evidence, you 
were saying, you did in fact go through an exercise where 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 324 of 397 
 
you considered all of Mr Mlambo’s objections and believed 
that they had no merit.  Is that correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:   I did not say Chair that they had not 
merits.  I said when we had the meeting with the senior 
executives and with the CEO and CFO. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR SALOOJEE:   When they explained how they just – all of 
those issues, from the finances to the BEE stuff and the 
process that they had gone through, I had satisfied myself 
that they had resolved these issues. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. Now you read out to us earlier 
from Mr Wessels’ affidavit where he referred to it, but in very 
broad general terms.  There is no document anywhere that 
we have been able to obtain with the vice powers that this 
Commission has had to get documents and information from 
various witnesses. 
 
We have got all of these documents that we see, 
including Mr Mlambo’s repeated emails in great detail.  
Nowhere do we see anybody, whether you or anybody else 
saying, Mr Mlambo says in relation to B-BBEE certificate, it 
20 
was unfair because LMT’s B-BBEE certificate was rejected 
because it was out of date and they did not – nobody 
bothered to check with HR what the true credentials were. 
 
Whereas VR Laser, also had something that was out of 
date and yet that was allowed in.  Nowhere have you said or 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 325 of 397 
 
anybody else said in a document that we are aware of, to 
say:  Mr Mlambo is wrong on those facts.  For example, VR 
Laser’s certificate was not out of date and LMT’s certificate, 
there was no basis on which we could have gone to HR and 
found out the facts.   
 
Or we did go to HR and we found out that the facts are, 
to justify LMT is scoring very little on BEE.  Nowhere have 
we seen that. 
 
Now I am not going through the exercise of going point-
by-point through Mr Mlambo’s email but I just wanted to 
10 
dwell on that for a moment.   
 
Sorry, I rather to hold a lot of questions in one, which is 
a bit unfair to you.  Let me just unpack it.   
 
Is it correct that you did not put down in writing 
anywhere an answer or your conclusion as to an evaluation 
of Mr Mlambo’s concerns? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, I should have acknowledged receipt 
of Mr Mlambo’s ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That is not the question. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Ja. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I did not ask you if you acknowledged 
receipt.  We have already dealt with that. 
MR SALOOJEE:   H’m. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I have asked you.  Have you ever put 
down in writing any analyses to justify your conclusion that 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 326 of 397 
 
each one of Mr Mlambo’s concerns was properly answered? 
MR SALOOJEE:   No, we have not. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Why not? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Because I felt the way in which we have 
dealt with it was going into the organisation, going down to 
the other senior executives that that was sufficient to deal 
with.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now, nowhere in these documents is 
there any other document from anybody other than yourself, 
Mr Saloojee in which that analysis has been done, other than 
10 
the vague emails that Mr Burger keeps sending back to 
Mr Mlambo, where he said:  But you do not address the B-
BBEE issue, for example, for the following reasons. 
 
He never actually deals with that.  Correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:   From my understanding, they responded to 
him but Mlambo was not happy with the response. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, yes.  And in fact, Burger – if we 
had the time, I would like to go through all of that is, to go 
show you exactly why Mr Mlambo seems to have been 
justified. 
20 
 
Now, nowhere in Wessels’ affidavit is there anything 
specific, for example, that actually Mr Mlambo in point 3 of 
his email on the 9 t h of September 2014 or whatever is wrong 
factually or is wrong legally because he has overlook this 
provision clause whatever of the procurement policy. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 327 of 397 
 
 
None of that is dealt with.  What you happily read out to 
the Chairperson, again, is blessed with complete generality 
and vagueness.   
 
We discussed all of these issues including B-BBEE and 
they – and we then persuaded Mr Saloojee that everything 
was in order that DLS had in fact satisfied what was required 
legally under the procurement policy. 
 
They do not say that and you have never said that.  So 
on what basis can you seriously expect the Commission to 
accept your word that, A, you went through this analyses and 
10 
B, you had good reason for coming to your conclusion that 
every single one of those concerns raised by Mr Mlambo had 
no substance or could not be taken to justify what he was 
saying?  Start this process again.    
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, as I have indicated.  On the balance 
of everything that was brought before me, the discussions 
with the senior executives and that this is how things 
unfolded and that is how the decision was made.  And I have 
said that.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   We know that. 
20 
MR SALOOJEE:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You have told the Commission how it 
unfolded. 
 
My 
question 
was 
not 
how 
did 
it 
unfold 
Mr Saloojee.  My question was:  Have you – how can you be 
seriously believe when you say to this Commission under 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 328 of 397 
 
oath:  I actually did go through it point by point, Mr Mlambo’s 
concerns and I was satisfied.   
 
Let me ask you for example just to test how sure you are 
of this.  The B-BBEE issue. Mr Mlambo has said.  LMT was 
given no points for BEE on the basis that its BEE certificate 
had expired. 
 
Now was Mr Mlambo correct or not correct on the facts 
there? 
MR SALOOJEE:   From what I read, he was not correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   He was not correct? 
10 
MR SALOOJEE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But what had – had it not expired? 
MR SALOOJEE:   It had expired. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It had expired? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  His next point was then, that as a 
Senior Procurement Specialist, I know how these things have 
to be implemented and on the basis of my specialist 
knowledge, and no doubt on some of the case law and so 
forth which bears him out to an extent. 
20 
 
If 
you 
can 
easily 
obtain 
knowledge 
about 
BEE 
credentials, apart from the certificate, whether or not it has 
expired, you should do that as a matter of fairness. 
 
Was he wrong or right in that legal opinion? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Sorry, just repeat that Mr Kennedy. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 329 of 397 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   The fact that a BEE certificate has 
expired, even if it has expired, does not mean that you have 
to give that person a zero rating.  You have to find out, if you 
can easily find out the information, whether or not they have 
BEE credentials.  Was he wrong or right in that view? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, my view is that, if you apply it for 
any tender and if you do not have a valid BEE certificate, 
that is the law.  There is no valid BEE certificate.  You 
cannot go to the HR Department and find out:  Are you 
compliant?   
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Did you ever tell that to Mr Mlambo? 
MR SALOOJEE:   I never engaged with Mr Mlambo. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Did you...  Exactly.  Did you ever ask a 
lawyer who was right and who was wrong?  You are not a 
lawyer.  I accept Mr Mlambo is not a trained lawyer, as far as 
I understand his CV.   
MR SALOOJEE:   Sorry, just repeat that Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Did you ever go back to Mr Mlambo or 
did you ever go to an outside lawyer to check whether in fact 
his view was right or wrong or whether your view was right or 
20 
wrong? 
MR SALOOJEE:   No, I did not. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You just knew this.   
MR SALOOJEE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You just knew it? 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 330 of 397 
 
MR SALOOJEE:   But I...  Chair, with respect.  I mean, we 
tender all the time with government departments and we are 
familiar with...  If you are going to say that you are BEE 
complaint and you submit a tender without a valid BEE 
certificate, it is not valid.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And ...[intervenes]  
MR SALOOJEE:   That is the truth. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Well, in fact, the law is a little bit more 
complex than that Mr Saloojee.  I happened to practice in 
that area and the case law in particular, is a lot more 
10 
complex than you suggest. 
MR SALOOJEE:   I am sure Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR SALOOJEE:   I am sure.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And in relation to VR Laser, he was 
saying:  Why could you exclude LMT because their document 
had expired and yet by the same token, admit VR Laser’s 
certificate even though it was submitted after the due date? 
 
Do you know whether they submitted their – a certificate 
before or after the due date? 
20 
MR SALOOJEE:   I am not sure when but the certificate was 
...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You do not know when. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  So you cannot say now whether 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 331 of 397 
 
in fact Mr Mlambo’s concern was correct or not. 
MR SALOOJEE:   I cannot. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You cannot. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What you can say, of course, if they 
thought – if they could accept VR Laser ’s certificate after 
the due date there is no reason why they could not given 
LMT an opportunity to submit or what would you say? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, my understanding was that an 
extension was given to both parties and that the one came 
and then the other did not come. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Okay, Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  I think let us move 
on from the platform hulls contract, if we may, and there 
are some other issues that we need to touch on but briefly.  
In relation to the single source supply agreement, I 
understand that was ultimately approved by Mr Ntshepe 
once he had replaced you as Group CEO, is that right? 
MR SALOOJEE:   I do not know which one you are 
referring to. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   The single source, single supplier 
20 
agreement between DLS and VR Laser.  You did not give 
the final approval for that, that was given by Mr Ntshepe 
after you had been suspended, correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:   There are two. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   DLS I am talking about, not DVS. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 332 of 397 
 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Denel Land Systems as distinct from 
Denel Vehicle Systems. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes, what I understand that there were 
two agreements. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Agreements between DLS and VR 
Laser. 
MR SALOOJEE:   VR Laser there was one, that was done 
just before I was suspended. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
10 
MR SALOOJEE:   And then there was another one that was 
done by Ntshepe. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Between? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Between DVS. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   DVS, yes. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Ja and VR Laser. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, that is right. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I am asking you about the DLS 
contract with VR Laser, with single supplier. 
20 
MR SALOOJEE:   That was done May. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That was done in May.  The actual 
final approval was given.  If I can take you in bundle 1, 
page 825.  Just check you have got the right bundle, it is 
not the bundle 10 that we were looking at earlier, it is 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 333 of 397 
 
bundle 1.  You got that? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Bundle 1. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, thank you, page 825. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, that was the memorandum that 
was signed by Mr Ntshepe as we see on page 825. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But that admittedly had followed 
some history where the transaction had in fact been 
approved and implemented with the contract being issued 
10 
to VR Laser by DLS the previous year and Mr Mlambo then 
raised serious objections and so forth. 
MR SALOOJEE:   I do know, I did not… 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  You were not party. 
MR SALOOJEE:   No. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   To this particular process. 
MR SALOOJEE:   No.  Chair, I was not party because by 
this time I was suspended, obviously. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You were suspended, that was my 
point earlier. 
20 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But you were party to the approval of 
the award to DLS in the first place. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Not this overriding of Mr Mlambo as 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 334 of 397 
 
it were. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Well, that is what we have discussed. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am sorry? 
MR SALOOJEE:   So you say I was party to…? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   The approval the previous year to 
award the contract to VR Laser for single source. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes, Chair, we have just discussed that, 
ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   What we have just been discussing is 
the platform hull contract, not the single source contract. 
10 
MR SALOOJEE:   Sorry, Chair, maybe I am getting a bit 
confused. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, it is late in the day. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, we are all a bit tired, Chair. Mr 
Saloojee, I …[intervenes] 
MR SALOOJEE:   Can you please just repeat that, Mr 
Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   We are finished with discussing the 
hull …[intervenes] 
MR SALOOJEE:   The hull contract, yes. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC: The platform hulls contract. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   We have been through all of those 
documents. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 335 of 397 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am just trying to wrap up with a few 
side issues.  The single supplier contract, not for the 
platform hulls but single supplier for steel fabrication, that 
was given by DLS to VR Laser, correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes, there was a memorandum of 
agreement that was signed between them. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That is correct. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:    It was initially an MOU and then it 
became an MOA. 
10 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you ultimately signed that, not 
so? 
MR SALOOJEE:   I signed the MOU.  
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
 
You 
signed 
the 
MOU 
and 
…[intervenes] 
MR SALOOJEE:   I signed a memorandum that came to me 
requesting that they engage in an MOU. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Subsequently to that they actually – Mr 
20 
Burger signed an MOA. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Correct. 
MR SALOOJEE:   With VR Laser. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And that was approved by you, you 
gave him a mandate to sign it rather than having to come 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 336 of 397 
 
back to you to sign the MOA, not so? 
MR SALOOJEE:   So the MOU, my understanding was – 
and remember, this was in May. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, in June the old board was leaving. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is 2015? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes and in July the new board was 
appointed in August was the handover period where I did 
the hand – I mean, orientation of the new board.  In 
September, on the 10 September we had the first board 
10 
meeting.  The week after that I had gone to the United 
Kingdom with the Minister and with the Chairperson of the 
board.  That week when I came back I was suspended.  So 
that is the context in which this happened. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
MR SALOOJEE:   So that MOU, my understanding was that 
he was given a mandate to go and negotiate an MOU. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Subsequently I discovered – that was in 
April.  In May of that year he signed an MOA with VR 
20 
Laser. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  But you gave him the 
mandate to go and conclude a single source contract with 
VR Laser, correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:   To engage in an MOU.  That is the 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 337 of 397 
 
approval I gave, the mandate I gave him. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes and if those negotiations in this 
engagement process proved fruitful he would then be 
entitled to sign an agreement binding Denel Land Systems, 
correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:  I am not – I cannot say for sure that that 
is what was there.  My understanding was that I had given 
him the mandate to negotiate an MOU. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Negotiate and sign. 
10 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The mandate you had given him was it to 
negotiate and sign? 
MR SALOOJEE:   I cannot recall whether there was an 
issue 
of 
the 
signing 
but 
my 
understanding 
but 
my 
understanding was that he should have brought it back to 
me, the MOU. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now were you aware that Mr Mlambo 
when he became aware of what had happened, strenuously 
resisted the implementation of this agreement on the basis 
20 
that inter alia there had been no competitive procurement 
process.  You are aware of that? 
MR SALOOJEE:   I am not aware of a formal document that 
I have seen. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am not asking about a formal 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 338 of 397 
 
document, I am asking you are you aware or were you at 
the time that you were Group CEO aware of the fact that 
Mr Mlambo raised objections to the agreement whether it 
would be an MOU or an MOA appointing VR Laser on the 
basis that there was no competitive procurement process 
followed? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, to the best of my knowledge I 
cannot recollect whether that was the case. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Do you accept that a 
procurement contract such as this, particularly one that is 
10 
going to involve millions and millions of public money has 
to follow a competitive procurement process?  Were you at 
least aware of that in terms of the law applicable to state 
entities? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, I mean, we signed many strategic 
partner agreements with many companies which is again 
motivated.  If we go through the motivation, there is very 
strong motivation as to why they wanted to do this in terms 
of who faced the contract, in terms of the fact that the 
duration of the contract was over a certain period, the fact 
20 
that they needed a steady and reliable supplier which 
would not entail going to many different other suppliers 
where the quality of the product could not have been from 
an engineering perspective treated the same.  So they 
were - again there was a whole motivation that came with 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 339 of 397 
 
the fact that they wanted to place – well, not placed, that 
they wanted to enter into a single supplier contract with VR 
Laser.  So it was not in isolation, it was not because -  
there was a motivation that came which made sense.  I 
said that they can go ahead and engage in a memorandum 
of understanding.  A memorandum of understanding is just 
to say we want to agree that we explore cooperating with 
one another.  That was in April, okay?   
And there is a lot of background to this as well, 
Chair. 
 
There 
were 
two 
drafts 
of 
that 
memo 
that 
10 
…[intervenes]. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am sorry to interrupt, Mr Saloojee, 
but please excuse me, I do not mean to be rude. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It is very late in the day, in fact in 
the evening and my question had nothing to do with 
various drafts of documents. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   My question was very simple and 
very specific.  Were you aware at the level of GCEO of 
20 
Denel at the time that the law required that before you 
awarded any such contract that you would have to follow a 
competitive process?  That is the simple question, not 
whether there were drafts, not whether there was a good 
reason, not whether you did this all the time with various 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 340 of 397 
 
people, not whether you always memorandums motivating it 
in detail, none of that.  Did you know that you, before you 
award 
a 
contract, 
giving 
business 
to 
somebody 
on 
particularly a single supplier basis you would have to 
follow a competitive process?  I think it is a yes or a no 
answer that we are really looking for. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, if you may indulge me.  This was 
an agreement for a single supplier, it was not a contract 
took place, a contract to manufacture other hulls or 
whatever else, so it was an agreement.  It was not a 
10 
contract which said we are placing a contract to the value 
of x amount on VR Laser.  That was my understanding of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Kennedy said what he was 
asking is what you were aware of in terms of the legal 
requirements.  Of course if you may have been aware that 
that was the requirement or you may say but that was not 
the requirement. 
MR SALOOJEE:   From my understanding it was not the 
requirement.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now is that because of the content of 
20 
the agreement or because what you approved was simply 
an 
initial 
step 
which 
was 
really 
a 
memorandum 
of 
understanding which is really just a statement of broad 
intent that you cannot be held to? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Absolutely, Chair, that was …[intervenes] 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 341 of 397 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Which of the two? 
MR SALOOJEE:   It was the latter. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   The latter, yes. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I understand that but can I just 
understand then, if that is the case, once you gave that 
approval, as you did, everybody seems to agree that you 
gave approval, you gave a mandate for Mr Burger and co to 
enter into negotiations with VR Laser to enter into a 
memorandum of understanding.  If they succeeded in 
10 
discharging that mandate and fulfilling that mandate, those 
negotiations succeeded and an MOU was then signed, that 
did not have the status of an MOA which would bid the 
corporation.  Do I understand your evidence correctly? 
MR SALOOJEE:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  But in your mind, once you 
gave that mandate and once that was fulfilled and an MOU 
was then concluded, presumably that would then be 
followed by an MOA in due course, correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, it would have had to come back to 
20 
corporate, we would have had to consider it before an MOA 
could have been signed. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, quite right.  And my final 
question on this is when that came back to corporate, 
would a procurement process then have to been followed?  
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 342 of 397 
 
A competitive procurement have to be followed? 
MR SALOOJEE:   I would imagine. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You would imagine so? 
MR SALOOJEE:   No, I would hope that it would, it will, it 
would have to. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It would have to. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It is a bit different from I would 
imagine so. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Would you agree with me as a CEO 
who understood that there was such a thing as PFMA and 
Treasury regulations …[intervenes] 
MR SALOOJEE:   I agree with you. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   …that a competitive process has to 
be followed before a state entity awards any agreement 
that is binding? 
MR SALOOJEE:   I agree with you. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Correct.  Alright, thank you.  Was it a 
matter of shock to you later to hear that that was then 
20 
done after your time by others without any procurement 
process having been followed? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Of course, Chair, I mean now, when I 
reflect over the last few years as to what has happened 
particularly after my suspension and coming into – with the 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 343 of 397 
 
appointment of the new board.  I mean, I have gone 
through my previous testimony about the circumstances 
around the new board, the controversies around the new 
board, issues around how we were treated, what was the 
reasons for our suspension and the process that we had 
gone through.  If I look at really where all of this had 
emanated from was leading up to an environment where 
then they would have been an unfettered ability to do 
business in this instance with VR Laser. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that answer – is your answer that you 
10 
were shocked when some time after you were gone or 
during your suspension you learnt that an agreement was 
concluded without a competitive process?  
MR SALOOJEE:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Sorry, I was not shocked. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You were not shocked. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Because that was the logical conclusion 
as to what I think they were wanting to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now whose idea was it to explore a 
single supplier agreement with VR Laser from - for DLS? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, that emanated from DLS. 
ADV KENNEDY SC: From DLS. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 344 of 397 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And Mr Burger particularly. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Mr Burger specifically. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. Now again I do not want to go 
into detail unless you feel the need but the question is 
simply this.  You are aware that Mr Burger has said in his 
evidence both in lengthy portions of his affidavit as well as 
in his oral testimony that actually the initiative, the idea 
and the initiative and the pressure to pursue this line of 
single supplier agreement with VR Laser for DLS came 
from you, not from him.   
10 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, I categorically deny that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat that? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Mr Kennedy is saying that in Mr Burger ’s 
testimony he says that the initiative to enter into an 
agreement with VR Laser, the pressure was put on him and 
there was then an instruction, Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, that you instructed him. 
MR SALOOJEE:   That I instructed him to enter into this 
agreement and I am saying that I categorically deny that I 
did that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Well, if you approved that Mr 
Burger should negotiate and conclude the memorandum of 
understanding, is the position not that the memorandum of 
understanding that was concluded would be inconsistent 
with initiating a competitive process after that, did it not 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 345 of 397 
 
necessarily mean that you either needed to have no such 
memorandum and then embark on a competitive process or 
have such a memorandum and then embark on a single 
source agreement? 
MR SALOOJEE:   So, Chair, that was the whole purpose of 
saying go and engage in a memorandum of understanding.  
What is the scope of the cooperation that you want, how 
would you manage this, what were the parameters that 
would allow you to do this?  That is my understanding of a 
memorandum 
of 
understanding. 
 
A 
memorandum 
of 
10 
agreement says we will do this, x, y and z. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the memorandum of understanding 
does it not say – I have not refreshed my memory on it, 
does it not entail that business would have to be done with 
them? 
MR SALOOJEE:   They would, from my understanding, 
Chair, there still have to be competitive pricing, they still 
had to go out into the market to see what other capabilities 
there were, what is the pricing in the market before they 
can have a strategic partnering agreement with them. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But why engage in a process that leads 
to that memorandum of understanding if indeed you are – 
you intend to have a competitive process? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, from my understanding, is that 
again from a DLS perspective they wanted to secure a 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 346 of 397 
 
relationship for a longer period with VR Laser and that is 
what happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is why I am asking you the 
question 
because 
my 
understanding 
is 
that 
the 
memorandum of understanding already points towards 
having a relationship or giving business to VR Laser so but 
you have said you expected a competitive tender process 
to happen after the memorandum of understanding then 
before the memorandum of agreement. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, my understanding is that if VR 
10 
Laser met all the requirements that were set out in a 
memorandum 
of 
agreement 
or 
a 
memorandum 
of 
understanding then they would be appointed as a single 
source supplier. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Without a competitive process. 
MR SALOOJEE:   If – no, if they had gone out into the 
market and they had looked at other prices and they had 
looked at other capabilities my understanding is that they 
would have given preference, and that is what they wanted, 
to VR Laser if they had met the minimum criteria for a 
20 
particular contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was your understanding that they would 
give preference after an open competitive process or that 
they would give preference without an open competitive 
process? 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 347 of 397 
 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, I – ja, they had to go to the 
market, whether it was – and I may correct myself, whether 
it was for competitive process or not but they had to do an 
analysis of the market.  So I agree with you, not 
necessarily through a competitive process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So therefore, just part of what one 
is trying to do is what you envisaged would happen when 
you approved that they should negotiate and conclude the 
memorandum of understanding.  So am I correct in saying 
the effect of what you are saying is that if they concluded – 
10 
if a memorandum of understanding was concluded, what 
you did have in mind was that a competitive – open 
competitive 
process, 
tender 
process, 
might 
not 
be 
involved. 
MR SALOOJEE:   That is what they were suggesting, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  So, Mr Saloojee, 
did you then assume that they had gone to the market to 
test the market before they entered into the MOU? 
20 
MR SALOOJEE:   No, Chair, I did not assume that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So what did you believe?  I want to 
go back to the question from the learned Chair, what is the 
real point of a memorandum of understanding if it does not 
give somebody something?  Now let me put the question 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 348 of 397 
 
perhaps at its most basic form. 
 
If you were going out to somebody to say we are 
going to enter into a memorandum of understanding with 
you which may lead to business coming up later, subject to 
a competitive process, should that not actually be a 
process in which you go out to the market and ask anybody 
who may be interested to compete to be awarded the MOU, 
let alone the MOA at a later stage? 
You see, the whole thing seems to be manoeuvring 
into a situation where VR Laser without a fair competitive 
10 
process gets given an MOU and thereafter without a fair 
competitive process gets an MOA and that then gives them 
the right as a single supplier for those components to 
provide that for DLS.  Do you see the point? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, I take the point. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So what is the answer to it then? 
MR SALOOJEE:   So the answer is …[intervenes] 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Where does, where does – you said 
it may or may not necessarily involve a procurement 
process, you have accepted already that there has to be a 
20 
fair legal competitive process before you award a contract 
that is binding on DLS, correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  So where in this scheme of 
things, going through this creature called the MOU that 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 349 of 397 
 
might later result in an MOA, where would there have been 
a fair competitive process rather than saying to VR Laser 
we like you guys, let us sign an MOU, that then seems to 
get them at least a foot in the door where after they then 
get an MOA?  Where would, if at all, would there be a 
competitive process? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, a strategic single source supplier 
agreement is exactly that.  If you can motivate strategically 
why this is a critical issue, why it impacts on your 
business, why it impacts on your contractual obligations 
10 
and why the strategic nature of it for business continuity, 
there have been instances where agreements like this have 
been signed in the past in my understanding and this was 
to define the parameters that if they were going to be the 
fabricator of those hulls over a certain period that they, if 
they were competitive, if they had met the obligations, if 
they had invested more in equipment and so forth, that 
they would be a preferred supplier and that is a fact, Mr 
Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So how do you know that they would 
20 
be competitive if you do not have a competitive process? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Well, I would imagine that DLS, for 
example, 
who 
would 
manage 
this, 
would 
have 
an 
understanding 
of 
what 
the 
market 
has 
– 
what 
the 
thresholds are in the market. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 350 of 397 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Without going out to a competitive 
tender or RFO process? 
MR SALOOJEE:   I mean, my understanding is that they 
would have because they have been in the business for so 
many years. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   They would have what? 
MR SALOOJEE:   They would have had an understanding 
of what would be competitive. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why – if you accept that there is a need 
to know what their competitors may have to offer, why not 
10 
make it open instead of letting DLS just contact them 
without anybody knowing and saying what would be your 
price for this, or what, what, what.  If you do need to know 
what their competitors can offer, VR Laser ’s competitors, 
why not put it transparently open and say put your 
proposals on the table, let VR Laser put their proposals on 
the table, then we will decide who will emerge as the 
preferred supplier. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, I agree with you and I think again, 
if you look at the motivations that DLS had put forward in 
20 
terms of what they call security of supply to guarantee 
supply, to guarantee workmanship quality, there was a 
whole motivation again as to why they think that it was 
important for them to enter into this thing.  And I agree 
with you, I agree with you that in a sense it was to 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 351 of 397 
 
establish a preferential relationship with VR Laser.  I mean 
that was what the motivation was. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And if you think VR Laser would be such 
a good supplier, if you think VR Laser will not have a 
serious contender or competitor, why not put it open, let – 
because they will emerge victorious anyway, they will wind 
anyway.  
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair, I agree with your sentiment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  In fact the 
10 
Chairperson is suggesting to you a very simple, sensible, 
logical business reason why you do not do it.  I want to, 
with respect, add to that to say that whether or not you 
think it is a good reason or not, it is what the law requires.  
Nowhere that I have picked up in the Section 217 of the 
Constitution or anywhere in the PFMA or anywhere in the 
Treasury regulations or anywhere in the supply chain 
management policy of Denel at head office or DLS, all of 
those documents are available to us here.  Nowhere have I 
found anything that supports that your suggestion that 
20 
well, if a division thinks that they have got a good 
understanding of how competitive somebody’s prices might 
be, we can then commit ourselves, nowhere.  In fact the 
very point that the Chairperson makes is you find out from 
the market by following a competitive process.   
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 352 of 397 
 
 
So may I just take you back for a moment to the 
platform hulls contract.  You say you assumed that the 
division would have known how they would be.  The first 
point which is really one of the points that the Chair has 
raised with you is how do you know that until you have 
gone out with tender prices being submitted whether a 
public tender or an RFO, let us leave that aside, but a 
competitive process?   
 
But what I want to add to that is this, you were 
aware, as was DLS, that just a few months before this of 
10 
entering into an MOU, they had gone out into the market, 
DLS.  Not for a single supplier but for the platform hulls 
manufacture and guess what came out of that competitive 
process?  Not that VR Laser was very competitive with 
prices.  On the contrary their bid was for 260 million and 
LMT was for about 160 million.  Massive difference, almost 
double. 
 
And then when Mr – his own evidence, that you may 
have heard, Mr Burger, was he thought this, really they are 
trying to push their luck here.  So what do I do?  I phone 
20 
them up and I say I am really unhappy, how can you tender 
so much and they say do not worry, Mr Burger, we will 
reduce it from 260 to 195 million, still a major amount more 
than LMT. 
 
So what I am suggesting and I am not asking you to 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 353 of 397 
 
defend the decision of DLS ultimately to sign the MOA but I 
am asking for your comment.  Is it not a bit naïve to 
suggest that a division such as DLS on the strength of your 
mandate can go out and award an MOU on the basis that 
they think that the market is such that VR Laser is not only 
the best to do this but probably has the best price.  We 
know here that it did not give the best price at the very last 
occasion that business was awarded to them.  You get the 
point, Mr Saloojee? 
MR SALOOJEE:   I get the point Mr Kennedy, I mean the 
10 
issue of knowing the market is not just one element that I 
had to raise, the more important element that I wanted to 
raise was the fact that they motivated that for strategic 
reasons this was an important thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please just repeat that. 
MR SALOOJEE:   I said the issue of the market was just 
one element, it wasn’t the motivating factor.  The issue that 
they were motivating specifically was the issue of the 
strategic capability and what they call guarantee of supply, 
that they need ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But why, why is that a justification for 
not going out on open tender, because that factor can still 
be taken into account I would imagine even if it is an open 
competitive process, to say we won’t take that supplier 
because it doesn’t provide the strategic advantage that VR 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 354 of 397 
 
Laser would provide to us.  I may be missing something but 
that is – and I don’t understand something in the defence 
as security but help me understand. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair I agree with you, but if you read 
their motivation there is a lot of engineering terminology 
that they use there in terms of justifying the precision 
welding, the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But they might just be using words and 
words without substance. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Whatever, but they are engineers 
10 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but they may be using that and it is 
...[intervenes]  
MR SALOOJEE:   But I do, I mean I agree with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you say it is like a – you know when 
I was at university for my degree non-law students used to 
say law students at student meetings will throw in a lot of 
Latin words to confuse everybody, even when there is no 
substance, so if VR Laser if it – if they thought it would be 
good to give this job to VR Laser because VR Laser would 
20 
give DLS a certain strategic advantage that would come 
with having a contract with them, that’s a factor that can 
still be taken into account when there are many other 
competitors, you accept that? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes Chair. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 355 of 397 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I don’t want to engage in a legal 
debate with you because that would be unfair to you but I 
just want to point out something that has been stressed by 
our highest courts, both the Constitutional Court and the 
Supreme 
Court 
of 
Appeal, 
and 
that 
is 
this, 
yes 
requirements of procurement processes are often quite 
technical and often quite complex and may take some time, 
but there is a good reason for that, firstly it is what the law 
provides and one has to comply with the law.  Not on the 
10 
basis of well if there is something strategic we think it 
would be good to have or whatever.   If the law says you 
have to follow that process you have to, so the law is an 
end in itself, but secondly in relation to procurement there 
are reasons why the law is so specific, particularly for 
State Departments and State Entities, one of the objectives 
is to ensure that you actually do get the very best deal for 
the State, because you are dealing with public money 
which is limited and the needs of the nation are massive, 
but there is a further reason that the Courts have stressed, 
20 
that there needs to be compliance with these processes 
and that is to ensure that there is accountability, because 
if these things get blurred when you think as an official, 
well I think we should do it because I think it is good for 
the organisation, even if you are genuine in that it just 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 356 of 397 
 
allows room for a lack of accountability and a lack of 
transparency and it then allows a situation in which 
corruption a fester. 
 
Now do you understand that objective of the 
legislation?  And what I want to – I don’t want to debate 
the legal principle, if you accept that what I am simply 
putting to you is this, it is all very well for DLS and 
managerial level to be talking in technical language and 
talking 
about 
strategic 
objectives 
there 
is 
a 
simple 
question at the end of the day, can you do it in terms of the 
10 
law or can’t you?  You accept that that is a fundamental 
point? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, and things like strategic 
suppliers and making sure that you get a committed supply 
from a particular supplier that is all dealt with in the Public 
Procurement Legislation and Supply Chain Management 
Policy.  After Denel had two Supply Chain Management 
Policies, at group level and at divisional level, that could 
make provision for exactly that, not so? 
20 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes you can make provision for strategic 
partnerships. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, yes, and if there is no such 
provision that allows you to do something you cannot do 
that thing unless and until you change your supply chain 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 357 of 397 
 
management policy, correct?   
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now if for example there is a 
situation in which there is a monopoly there is one single 
supplier of a particular item in the country and in the world 
and it is impossible to go out on a competitive process or it 
would be completely silly to go out on a competitive 
process, the law recognises that, and says provided these 
conditions are met and you follow these formalities and 
you report and give reasons and so forth you then don’t 
10 
have to go out to tender.  This was not such a situation not 
so Mr Saloojee? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair I mean I think if you look at the 
motivation, that’s why they call it a strategic supplier 
agreement, that they said even the kind of capabilities that 
are vested in that organisation, the kind of engineering 
requirements to meet the very exact and critical mission 
standards of the Defence Force with equipment of this 
nature they saw it as a critical supplier of this service, so 
you know ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   The question was not whether they 
saw it that VR Laser was a critical supplier, the question 
was could anybody else have done the work? 
MR SALOOJEE:   In South Africa? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Anywhere? 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 358 of 397 
 
MR SALOOJEE:   No of course. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Of course and we know that Denel, 
your people, at the time you were CEO for the hugely 
important platform hulls contract had seen fit quite rightly 
to go out on an RFO, whether they should have gone 
further to a publically advertised tender is debatable, but 
at least they did that.   Now this wasn’t done here, not 
even that was done, so you seem to be suggesting that 
because VR Laser would be a good supplier of a strategic 
item so we could depend on them let’s go the route of VR 
10 
Laser, but in the process you haven’t asked anybody else 
would they like to do it, would they like to try and compete 
and satisfy you that perhaps they do have the capacity, 
rather than the division, leaving it to the division to say but 
we know these things.  The whole point of a competitive 
process is to allow everybody who may be interested and 
capable to put in their tenders, put in their bids and if they 
are technically incapable or untrustworthy or too expensive 
or whatever they can be eliminated or rejected, but none of 
that was allowed for here in a process in which you 
20 
approved that one entity should be approached by DLS, 
namely VR Laser, an entity which by the way you knew was 
connected to a very controversial family and business 
network. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair I can say that with the motivation 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 359 of 397 
 
that was sent to me I said go and explore the possibility 
based on your requirements and MOU, and that is what 
happened.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:    Is that it?   
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you Mr Saloojee.   I would like 
to touch on just a couple of issues to complete the LSSA 
acquisition, you have set that out, if you look in Bundle 10, 
Bundle 10 to go back to your affidavit, page 803. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say page 803? 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Page 803 yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It runs to page 805, and there is a 
heading there if you have got the right document, the 
purchase of BAE LAN Systems South Africa, LSSA, by 
Denel, you have dealt with that in the next two and a half 
pages.  I don’t propose to ask you any questions in relation 
to this issue, I think your affidavit is clear, is there 
anything you want to add in relation to that issue for the 
benefit of the Chairperson before we move on? 
20 
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair I mean this is self-explanatory but 
this issue was the reason why the incoming board within a 
space of a few weeks used to suspend us and then 
eventually exited us from the organisation.  As you are 
aware we had consistently asked for a disciplinary process 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 360 of 397 
 
to take place, that never happened.  The two other 
colleagues, the Company Secretary and the CFO, Mr 
Mhlontlo, they settled early on I think in about March/April 
of that year, 2016.  I then continued asking them for a 
disciplinary, show me what I have done, they refused to 
take me to a disciplinary, they had investigations done, I 
am not sure whether those investigations have been 
concluded, but I do know that right at the onset, and that 
was also in my previous affidavit, the then Chairperson of 
the Board, Mr Mantsha, had directed the then legal person 
10 
in Denel to ask the company that did investigation to 
change the report to support their charges.  I went through 
the whole of 2016, I took them to the CCMA and eventually 
my issue was resolved at the CCMA and for the record I 
never got the settlement from them, I was just paid out 
what was due for me for the rest, the remainder of my 
contract which was expiring in a few months time after 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you recall how many months were 
still to run? 
20 
MR SALOOJEE:   Probably about four/five months were 
left. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay.  Yes Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you Chair.  While we are on 
that topic Mr Saloojee can I ask you please to refer to 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 361 of 397 
 
Bundle – it is in fact marked Exhibit W4B, it doesn’t have a 
bundle 
number, 
this 
was 
before 
the 
current 
bundle 
numbering system I believe was introduced Chair, before 
my time, but it is part of the original affidavit of Mr 
Saloojee, or part of the annexures to that, so if your 
registrar ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So it would be the one that has got Mr 
Saloojee’s two statements? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   No, those are the recent ones, it is 
the 
previous 
one 
from 
the 
previous 
year 
when 
the 
10 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no I mean last year when he gave 
evidence ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There were two statements that he 
...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Oh I see what you mean yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it that one? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That is correct, and it is called 
Exhibit W4B. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so just the one that has got Mr 
Saloojee’s statements. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But it is the second volume of those. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you going to his statements or are 
you going to somebody else’s statements? 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 362 of 397 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am going to an annexure to his 
statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay give me the one that has got 
his statements, they are both in the same file.  What page? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Page RS499 and at that stage they 
were not the two different sets of page numbers, there 
seems to be just the one on the right hand side in black 
Chair, RS499. 
CHAIRPERSON:   RS499, or is it page 499? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That is correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, R – yes okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That is the document Mr Saloojee, 
are you not there yet, sorry. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Have you got it? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That is the document headed 
termination of employment agreement between Denel and 
Saloojee.  Have we got the same document in front of us? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right thank you.   Now Chair I want 
to apologise, in a previous hearing I gave you a truncated 
version of the full facts relating to this which may have 
created the wrong impression, I was in fact under the 
wrong impression.  As I understand it Mr Saloojee when 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 363 of 397 
 
you – when your services were terminated you were 
suspended for a lengthy period, is that right? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Ja, from September of 2015 and we 
resolved the matter in I think towards November of 2016. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   2016, so it was at least a year that 
you were on suspension? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you were on paid suspension 
throughout that period? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that right? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now ultimately and we have heard 
some evidence about this in some detail, particularly from 
Mr Mhlontlo did you listen to his evidence as well? 
MR SALOOJEE:   No, some of it, not all. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Some of it, not at all, have you lost 
interest halfway through. 
MR SALOOJEE:   No, no, no I had other responsibilities as 
well. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am sure.  Mr Saloojee Mr Mhlontlo 
gave evidence that over many months you and he and Ms 
Africa attempted to get documents to substantiate the 
charges, to get details in relation to the charges and to get 
the disciplinary process under way, is that correct? 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 364 of 397 
 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Does that apply to you? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you and your lawyers expressed 
frustration sometimes in correspondence saying if you want 
to charge us charge us and run it to its disciplinary end so 
that we can be heard, get finality in the matter because we 
believe that we are innocent and will be vindicated, does 
that apply to you? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes.  
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And ultimately they never actually 
started the disciplinary process. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   There was a preliminary issue where 
a ruling was made, never did they actually get to the stage 
of presenting evidence against you? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes that’s right. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Or giving you an opportunity to give 
your evidence, is that right? 
MR SALOOJEE:   That is correct yes. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And ultimately your services were 
then terminated? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes Chair.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now at that stage as I understand 
the factual position, please correct me if I am wrong, at 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 365 of 397 
 
that stage there was no settlement agreement concluded, 
this 
settlement 
agreement, 
the 
termination 
of 
the 
employment is something that came sometime later, is that 
right?  Can you not recall?   It is in fact in November 2016, 
page 514. 
MR SALOOJEE:   I just want ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   It was signed on the 8 t h of November 
2016 by both sides. 
MR SALOOJEE:   This was at the end of the CCMA 
process.  
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   The end of the CCMA process?  
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That is really where I am trying to go 
to.  
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So initially you left employment and 
they agreed to pay you to the end of your contract which 
...[intervenes]  
MR SALOOJEE:   No. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Not? 
20 
MR SALOOJEE:   This was concluded while my contract 
was still valid. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   While your contract was still valid, I 
see.  
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes.  
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 366 of 397 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I see and after you had gone to the 
CCMA? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Had gone to the CCMA to challenge your 
suspension? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Challenge the suspension, not the 
actual termination, your employment was still going at that 
stage. 
10 
MR SALOOJEE:    Ja, it was still.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  Alright thank you.   And the 
payment for the balance of your employment contract was 
that the payment that was provided for in this settlement 
agreement? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes, ja.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So if we take you please to page 
505, this provides for the settlement of the disputes and 
termination of employment, 505 are you with me, clause 4.   
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Clause 4 is headed “Settlement of 
Disputes and Termination of Employment”. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And paragraph – Clause 4.2 it is 
recorded that all disciplinary proceedings against the 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 367 of 397 
 
employee have been terminated. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, and then we see in Clause 6.1: 
“Settlement 
The employer shall pay to the employee an ex 
gratia amount of R2 362 492 being an amount 
equivalent 
to 
50% 
of 
the 
employee’s 
annual 
remuneration.” 
And did this cover you for the rest of your employment 
contract? 
10 
MR SALOOJEE:   That was my understanding of it yes.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I see. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well you – I understood you to say you 
didn’t get any settlement, you were just paid for the 
balance of your contract, now I accept that you are not a 
lawyer therefore your understanding of some terminology 
might not be the same as that of a lawyer, but in Clause 
6.1 you and the employer agreed that you would be paid an 
ex gratia amount, an ex gratia amount as you would know 
is an amount that the employer is not obliged to give, that 
20 
is different from an amount that they would be obliged to 
give to you anyway, you understand that. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes Chair I understand that perfectly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that does give the impression that 
the parties were settling the matter, the employer didn’t 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 368 of 397 
 
want to say I am paying you your salary, or the rest of the 
contract what you were going to earn, but it may be that in 
the end in rands and cents it amounted to what would have 
been your salary anyway for all those months but that is 
how they put it.   
MR SALOOJEE:   Chair I mean the issue of ex gratia or I 
specifically said to them that I want the remainder of my 
salary and I want whatever else has accrued to me in terms 
of leave and whatever else and that was what I agreed with 
them. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and what you got reflected 
...[intervenes]  
MR SALOOJEE:   Reflected that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...what would at that, the terminology 
might have meant something else but what you got was 
what you demanded? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  And of course as we 
have seen the settlement was on the basis that effectively 
20 
your employment came to an end by mutual agreement with 
all disciplinary charges against you dropped. 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, now the allegation has been 
made in the various documents that were issued to you at 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 369 of 397 
 
the time of your suspension and then the charges that were 
issued that these were extremely serious charges and 
allegations of disciplinary misconduct which could lead to 
your dismissal.  Do you have any comment on the fact that 
ultimately not only were those disciplinary charges dropped 
completely despite more than a year ’s delay and your 
frequent requests for the process to be undertaken and 
finalised, but in addition they paid you for the balance of 
your contract, do you have any comment on that? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Well Chair I mean all I can say is that 
10 
you know a new Board that comes in it is hardly there six 
weeks, 
we 
have 
taken 
them 
through 
an 
orientation 
programme, we are briefing them on this particular matter, 
they 
are 
not 
fully 
understanding 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
transaction, there is just no way that you could empower 
yourself within that short period of time to take such a 
serious view of getting rid of three of your most important 
people in the organisation.   
 
You know for me it was just a ruse to get us out, 
and immediately we left and in fact if I – I don’t know if I 
20 
can make a comment here Chair.   If you look really what 
happened to Denel after we left, I mean up to that point 
Denel was a very successful organisation.  They had a 
strong order book, we had profits year on year, we had 
clean audits from the Auditor General.  The first thing that 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 370 of 397 
 
happened after we left was the issue of the VR Laser Asia 
and then we know what has happened in the precedent.   It 
has also come to my knowledge that there is a huge 
amount of behind the scenes work that was going on whilst 
I was still at Denel to establish VR Laser Asia okay, and 
that a primary motive for getting rid of myself and Mhlontlo 
was specifically because of the fact that they saw us as an 
obstacle to the further implementation of the Asia project 
and bring it to its logical conclusion because then that 
would have closed the loop completely in terms of VR 
10 
Laser ’s relationship with Denel. 
 
And all I can say is that if there was an impression 
that was created or a narrative that has been created that 
given my role and responsibility within the organisation 
and with the issue of the relationship with the VR Laser 
agreements, I am still thinking to myself that if individuals 
like myself had been captured and remember the context 
within which we are talking here, that during that period 
the entire country was engulfed in the notion of State 
Capture, 
whether 
it 
was 
Law 
Enforcement Agencies, 
20 
whether it was our political principals who were being 
implicated, there was a sense of – almost a sense of fear 
as to how you conduct yourself in these times, you know 
and I tried to do the best of my ability to keep Denel intact, 
I tried to the best of my ability to manage the kind of 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 371 of 397 
 
relationships that we were engaged with and if I was 
compliant 
after 
having 
done 
lifestyle 
audits, 
having 
investigated me, whatever else, if I had done anything that 
was wrong, if I had materially benefitted from this role it 
surely would have come out, that is the first thing.  And the 
second thing is that the very person who has been at the 
forefront of people who have been at the forefront of the 
VR Laser Asia thing were the ones who were put in charge 
of running Denel after I left, I was suspended.  Ntshepe 
who was central to this whole process becomes the Acting 
10 
CEO and then he becomes the CEO, and I know now from 
information that he was central with Burger in the whole 
Asia thing of establishing Asia and partnering and signing 
Memorandums of Agreement with Indian companies in India 
in preparation for this even before they got board approval 
for it. 
 
So the point that I am trying to make is that yes 
there were some of us who were put under huge pressure, 
okay, and I have dealt with it in my previous affidavit, we 
had to manage it to the best of our ability and I tried to 
20 
manage it to the best of my ability.   I tried to be as fair as 
possible, even during the hull contract thing, and we have 
gone into a lot of technical detail about that.  I tried to 
create the best situation for Denel with securing the 
interest of LMD for example. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 372 of 397 
 
 
The 
issue 
of 
genuinely 
the 
memorandum 
of 
understanding was that they would have had to bring it 
back to me to consider but it was just at the point at which 
we were going to be suspended and the new Board was 
coming in, so that process was out of my control. 
 
In fact after I left they used that same thing to then 
enter into the kind of agreements that they want to with VR 
Laser.  So the political context within which all of this 
going on was one in which this whole State Capture thing 
was taking place.  Denel is a clear example of that, that it 
10 
was a target of State Capture.  We were targets of State 
Capture, and we had to manage it in the best way possible, 
to the extent that – and again I ask a simple question if I 
was compliant, if I was colluding why would I have been 
suspended. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no that question remains and it 
is a question that needs to be confronted, certainly when I 
write my report, when I need to make findings.  I have got 
to ask the question, your suspension with the other two 
was for a long time, without any evidence being led in a 
20 
disciplinary 
inquiry 
to 
sustain 
any 
allegations 
of 
misconduct and ultimately with a settlement, a conclusion 
of agreements that you go, if there was no basis for in 
terms of misconduct, if there was no evidence, why was – 
why were the suspensions effected and why were you not 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 373 of 397 
 
allowed to come back and complete your term once it was 
– if it was accepted that there was no evidence and 
therefore you should not have been suspended in the first 
place why was that not done. 
 
Of course Mr Mantsha has not finished his evidence 
and he has said that there was misconduct arising from 
your conduct I think two of you, in regard to this 
transaction, I think in regard to what – it is said it is 
something else I am not sure.  So I am interested in hearing 
what he will put on the table.  I did say to him when he was 
10 
here that it is a pity that he says this now and yet from last 
year he was given your affidavits which said exactly how you 
were suspended and how you – you were kept out of the 
company until you left and 
1. He did not file any application to challenge your 
evidence to say I want to lead evidence and challenge 
Mr Saloojee’s evidence that he and the other two were 
treated like this because they stood for what is right 
and they were kicked out because they were not 
compliant.  He did not do that. 
20 
He had the opportunity to apply for leave to cross-examine 
you.  He did not use that opportunity.  He was given all your 
bundles and affidavits and if I am – and he was invited to file 
affidavits last year by the commission he did not.   
 
And even now he comes before the commission 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 374 of 397 
 
because he has been as far as I recall been compelled to 
come.  I do not know whether I am mistaken in that regard 
but he did not show much enthusiasm certainly last year and 
early this year to come in and challenge your evidence. 
 
So – but he will give his evidence and it will be 
examined – he will be questioned about the allegations of 
misconduct because I am interested in hearing evidence that 
relates to the allegations that the – you had misconducted 
yourselves in the way you – or you had not performed your 
job properly.  I want to hear that if that is the position.   
10 
 
But one will have to bear in mind that it comes very 
late when there had been such a lot of opportunity to have 
brought it much earlier. 
 
So – ja I thought I would say that. 
MR SALOOJEE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  Before we leave this 
bundle Chair and leave the issue of the settlement may I just 
ask you as I understood it you said that only once you 
referred the suspension dispute to the CCMA did you then 
20 
reach the settlement agreement and once the settlement 
agreement was reached you were then paid out for the 
balance of your contract. 
MR SALOOJEE:  That is what I understand Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  You understand?  Can you not recall? 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 375 of 397 
 
MR SALOOJEE:  No that is what I know.  No that is what I 
know. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  That is what you know okay.  Because I 
just want to understand this then if you look in the same 
bundle at page – page 492 there if a form referring a dispute 
to the CCMA for conciliation including Conarb – do you have 
that? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And then at page 495 it has been 
signed by yourself as I understand it and your attorney? 
10 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Is that the attorneys’ signature under 
the name printed name Shahied Dolly is that right? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes I would – ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And then next to that is the printed 
name Riaz Saloojee and your signature? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And it is dated the 23 August 2016, 
correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And that was then accompanied by an 
annexure which we find at page 496 and that is a statement 
setting out as the heading indicates the details of what you 
contended to be an unfair labour practice, correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 376 of 397 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And then at page 497 we see printed at 
the bottom Riaz Saloojee and your signature. 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Did you sign this document? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay.  What interests me is on the 
previous page 496 paragraph 4.  Or in fact can I start at 
paragraph.  You were suspended on the 23 September 2015.  
Paragraph 3 on the 23 December 2015 you were informed of 
the charges against me, that is correct so far is it? 
10 
MR SALOOJEE:  Sorry just where are you? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Page 496. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I have got that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Paragraph 3. 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  On the 23 December 2015 I was 
informed of charges against me. 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  That is factually correct is it? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Alright paragraph 4 says: 
“On 
the 
17 
March 
2016 
before 
the 
disciplinary proceedings could commence I 
was informed that my contract of employment 
would not be renewed for a period beyond 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 377 of 397 
 
January 2007 – 17 I beg your pardon.  I was 
further paid out until the end of my contract 
period being until the end of January 2017 
during April 2016 but I was not informed as 
to how such payment was made up.” 
 
That seems to be saying in April 2016 you were 
actually given the payment to pay you out for the rest of your 
contract period, is that correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Sorry – yes ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  So then what I do not understand 
10 
if I take you back to page 506 your evidence earlier that the 
settlement amount the ex gratia amount of 6.1 – sorry in 
Clause 6.1 the amount of R2 362 492.00 being an amount 
equivalent to 50% of your annual remuneration why that was 
actually the same as what you had already been paid in 
April? 
MR SALOOJEE:  So – no Chair sorry.  It is a mistake – it is 
a mistake on my part. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Your evidence was a mistake.  This was 
in addition to being paid to you. 
20 
MR SALOOJEE:  No, no, no.  When … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The CCMA document did not talk about… 
MR SALOOJEE:  March 16 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Sorry Mr Saloojee what?  March 16. 
MR SALOOJEE:  No it says before the disciplinary hearing I 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 378 of 397 
 
was informed [00:07:09]. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  You at page 496 paragraph 4 are you? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Okay so that was in March.  I was further 
paid out until the end of my contract being the January 2017. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MR SALOOJEE:  So it – so ja it may have been  lapse of 
memory but what happened is that Denel unilaterally said 
that they are not going to renew my contract in January 
2017. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And they paid you out. 
MR SALOOJEE:  And they paid me up to that point. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  In April. 
MR SALOOJEE:  And unilaterally put that money which was 
the remaining part of that half a year 50% of my salary. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I get that. 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So they took it upon themselves while 
you were still suspended. 
20 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Unilaterally to say by the way we telling 
you we are not going to renew your contract in January 
2017. 
MR SALOOJEE:  And they put the money… 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 379 of 397 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Please do not talk over me. 
MR SALOOJEE:  Sorry. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Until – which expires in January 2017 
and then whether you liked it or not they put the money in 
paying you until the end of January 2017. 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  But then there was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was your contract ending – going to end in 
January 2017? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  And then you – when they 
did that you had not referred your suspension dispute to the 
CCMA or had you already referred it to CCMA? 
MR SALOOJEE:  No because I was still saying them 
continue with the disciplinary hearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So you referred the suspension 
dispute to the CCMA after that? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  We note – sorry Chair.  May I continue? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  We know that because we have already 
shown you Mr Saloojee at page 495 you signed that on the 
23 August 2016, correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 380 of 397 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And your – that was accompanied by 
the statement that says already before the – before I 
referred this dispute while I was still suspended which is the 
subject of my referral as an unfair labour practice I have 
already had my contract terminated and I have been paid out 
as far back as April 2016 that was four months before the 
referral was to the CCMA? 
MR SALOOJEE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Correct.  Then you pursue the 
complaint - the dispute at the CCMA and you then settle that 
10 
dispute, not so? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:  It was agreed that we settled. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  It was then settled in terms of the 
settlement agreement that was then signed in November 
2016.  We have seen that at page 514. 
MR SALOOJEE:  Sorry 59? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  514.  8 November 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the agreement that we looked at 
20 
earlier. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Correct.   
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  The Chairperson actually read out 
the date to you earlier when you were taken to this.  So at 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 381 of 397 
 
page 505 in this settlement agreement that you conclude in 
November 2016 after you have referred the dispute and after 
you have already been paid in April for the balance of your 
contract.  You are then – you then agree to a settlement 
amount an ex gratia amount of R2.36 million and then there 
is provision in Clause 7 as to when that is to be paid and 
how.   
7.1  They will render payment into a bank account of your 
choosing and  
7.22 Sorry 7.21 is deduct income tax and 
10 
7.22 Make any payments due by no later than 30 November 
2016. 
 
It seems to me Mr Saloojee that this R2.36 million 
must have been on top of not as the balance of the contract 
that you had already been paid in April 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So maybe the prior question should be 
what happened to the money that the company put into your 
account unilaterally? 
MR 
SALOOJEE: 
 
Chair 
that 
was 
– 
that 
was 
my 
understanding was my monthly salary until my contract 
20 
expired. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not return it to the company? 
MR SALOOJEE:  No. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 382 of 397 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay when you signed the settlement 
agreement that you signed with the company in November 
2016 this amount that is mentioned in that agreement of 
R2.something million was it in addition to the money that 
they had put into your account unilaterally?  Were you going 
to get another amount? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or were they talking about the amount that 
had been put into your account unilaterally? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Chair I know that the total amount that I 
10 
got was about R3.6 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About how much? 
MR SALOOJEE:  R3.6 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SALOOJEE:  Total with… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you counting now the money that they 
put into your account unilaterally plus the money that is 
mentioned in the agreement put together came to R3, 
something million? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Perhaps I can help Mr Saloojee? 
20 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes please do. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  If you received R3.6 million that is 
obviously different from the R2.36 million in Clause 6.1 on 
page 505.  It seems one possible way of looking at this but I 
am speculating we need evidence on this is that you 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 383 of 397 
 
received something maybe R1.something million in April 
2016. 
MR SALOOJEE:  And then this was… 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Then you – then you received a further 
R2.36 million in November 2016 in terms of the settlement 
which was obviously a win for you because you brought the 
claim in the CCMA.  You came out of it with more money not 
so? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Did you not receive a payment in 
10 
November 2016? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes.  Yes if I do recall. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  You do recall? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And you also as your statement earlier 
said you had received an amount in April 2016, correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes, ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So that – so in total you received R3.6 
million made up partly of what was the amount that was paid 
in April 2016. 
20 
MR SALOOJEE:  And then what was paid there. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And then the R2.36 million in November 
2016, is that right? 
MR SALOOJEE:  And including – and including the accrued 
leave. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 384 of 397 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Including accrued leave I see. 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But Mr Saloojee if you – if the company put 
into your account unilaterally in March or April of 2016 put 
an amount that would cover the rest of your contract period 
that would mean that it was an amount that would have 
covered about twelve months or close to twelve months.  
Because you said your contract was going to end in January 
2017. 
10 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right.  So if they were putting in – if 
they put into your account in March an amount that you say 
covered the rest of your contract period that would have 
been about ten months and ten months would not have been 
R1 million, something it would have been much more than 
that if R2.3 which is written I think in the settlement 
agreement amounts to 50% of your annual salary. Can you 
see that?  That is what the agreement says.  It is R2.3 or 2, 
something and that is – they say that is 50% of your annual 
20 
salary.  So that must mean your annual salary must have 
been about R5 million or thereabouts. 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if they put in – if they put into your 
account in March or so 2016 an amount which was – which 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 385 of 397 
 
would cover the rest of your contract period that is – that 
would have been amount that covered about at ten months. 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe nine or ten months.  So that would 
not have been R1, something.  That would have been 
certainly over R3 million I would imagine. 
MR SALOOJEE:  Chair with your permission I mean I can 
get all that information and send it to the commission  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But you understand what I am saying/ 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes you right I do understand what you 
10 
saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that if the amount that they gave you in 
March 2016 was never returned to them and the amount that 
is written in the settlement agreement was in addition to the 
amount that was put into your account then in total the 
amount that you got could not have been less than I think R6 
million.  
MR SALOOJEE:  Chair as I say I will get all the information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SALOOJEE:  And send it to the commission. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I must be right more – you know in 
terms of how I arrive at that – the figure might be… 
MR SALOOJEE:  No Chair you are right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SALOOJEE:  I mean I – my own – let me get the 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 386 of 397 
 
information and I will send it to the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no, no that is fine.  Okay alright Mr 
Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  There is one final 
topic I would like to deal with.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  It arises in your – both in your latest 
affidavit as well as your original affidavit.  I am not going to 
take you to the actual content of it I just want you to confirm 
and then explain certain things.  I just want to remind you 
10 
what you said.  You referred to various meetings that you 
had set up by Mr Essa with the Gupta’s, correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And you said  
“I was eventually summoned to again another 
meeting with the Gupta’s by Essa.  I cannot 
recall the specific date of this meeting save 
that it was in the latter part of 2012.  In this 
meeting I was told in no uncertain terms that 
I was not cooperating and that my lack of 
20 
cooperation was a serious issue.” 
Tony said – that is Tony Gupta presumably correct? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   
“That he did not want to elevate it further.  I 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 387 of 397 
 
took the statement as a threat and the 
purpose of the meeting as means to strong 
arm me into cooperating with Essa and the 
Gupta’s.  I reiterated what I had said in all 
the previous meetings namely that proper 
process must be followed.  All business had 
to be commercially viable and add value to 
Denel.” 
Then there is reference to Tony Gupta saying that 
they were working hard to have the blacklisting of Denel in 
10 
India lifted.  And then – then there is reference to the need 
to support the New Age Newspaper.  And then crucially you 
have said this in your original affidavit and you have 
confirmed it in your latest one.   
“When that meeting ended as we walked out 
Tony asked me why I do not take money and 
that I should take money because everyone 
does.  I categorically stated that I do not.” 
Now you confirm that evidence? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And where did that take place?  At the 
Gupta residence in Saxonwold? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Or one of the Gupta residences. 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes Chair. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 388 of 397 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  Now when he said why you do not 
take money had he offered you money already? 
MR SALOOJEE:  No it was a comment that he made. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But I am trying to understand it.  Do 
you understand it because when somebody says why do you 
not take money it suggests that you had already been 
offered money and you had rejected the offer.  Had you 
previously been offered money by Mr Gupta? 
MR SALOOJEE:  No I was never offered money by him. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So how did you understand the 
10 
question why do you not take money?  And then to follow up 
you should take money because everyone does.  Was he 
actually offering you money now? 
MR 
SALOOJEE: 
 
Chair 
he 
was 
– 
the 
context 
was 
cooperating and whatever else okay.  And I think if the 
discussion had gone in the way in which I was amenable to 
that thing that  is the context within which I thought he made 
the comment. 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
Was 
any 
specific 
amount 
ever 
suggested to you that if you do certain things you could 
20 
expect to get paid? 
MR SALOOJEE:  No Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But did you understand that the 
question here based on the earlier discussion then and 
previous meetings was really to this effect.  If you are 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 389 of 397 
 
amenable and you should be amenable we will pay you 
money to ensure that the business comes to us. 
MR SALOOJEE:  That was my understanding Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  And you rejected that? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Suggestion.  Was this the only occasion 
on which there was any talk by Mr Gupta or any of his 
associates that you should be taking money? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I see.  And did you understand what 
10 
you would have to do if you took the money in exchange for 
doing something what would that something be? 
MR SALOOJEE:  My own view is that there was the India 
issue that was looming that they wanted access to the India 
market.  There were obviously the VR Laser issue was an 
issue.  And then of course the Middle East was a bit thing for 
them you know.  So they wanted to get involved in the 
defence industry via Denel into those environments as well.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I want to remind you of the wording that 
you used in your affidavit, the latest one that is at page 8-1 
20 
in Bundle 10 Chair but I am not – I do not think it is 
necessary for you necessarily to page to it.  I will read it out 
if I may?  Paragraph 10 you said: 
“During this period there was both significant 
public 
debate 
and 
media 
speculation 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 390 of 397 
 
concerning 
the 
relationship 
between 
the 
Gupta’s and senior people in government 
that included the then President” 
Not so? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  That was already part of the public 
controversy.  It is part of the reason for the public 
controversy not so? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Then you say this: 
10 
“Consequently I was genuinely wary of who I 
could turn to, confide in or discuss such 
matters with.  I also was of the view given 
my history and experience that I was strong 
enough 
to 
be 
able 
to 
manage 
these 
advances.” 
Now did you in fact confide in anybody else when you 
were being approached repeatedly by the Gupta’s to make 
sure that business comes their way and for example give – 
give work to New Age Newspapers and for example to assist 
20 
them in the – in the Asian market etcetera.  Did you confide 
in any of your colleagues at Denel that such approaches and 
insinuations were being made? 
MR SALOOJEE:  No Chair I did not. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Did you confide in anybody outside the 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 391 of 397 
 
Denel organisation such as the Minister or DG of Public 
Enterprises? 
MR SALOOJEE:  No Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Why not? 
MR SALOOJEE:  I mean my own view is that – that they 
were supporting the Gupta family. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.   
MR SALOOJEE:  And that if I had elevated it to that level I 
do not know what my situation would have been.  If fact 
frankly as I have indicated there I did not know who to turn 
10 
to.  And I was… 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Did you… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry just repeat that? 
MR SALOOJEE:  I did not know who to turn to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SALOOJEE:  And I was also – I was – I was concerned 
about my own position and my welfare. 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes.  And who was the Minister responsible 
for Denel at the time? 
MR SALOOJEE:  First it was Minister Gigaba and then it was 
20 
Minister Lynne Brown. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but I am talking about that time where 
you had to decide whether you could talk to… 
MR SALOOJEE:  2014 it was Minister Brown then? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 392 of 397 
 
MR SALOOJEE:  Minister Brown was there in 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Did you consider and I am not trying to 
cross-examine you on this but did you consider when you 
said you did not know who to turn to perhaps that the Public 
Protector who at that stage was Advocate Thuli Madonsela 
might have been somebody you could have approached and 
confided in? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Chair I must say I did not. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  You did not think about that? 
10 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay.  And the Auditor General? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Chair I did not. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay.  Just to complete this section of 
your affidavit you say:  
“These advances were not normal business 
practices and I kept resisting them during a 
very difficult period in our collective political 
history.  Again I repeat I was of the view that 
I 
could 
manage 
the 
situation. 
 
I 
must 
20 
acknowledge that I was genuinely concerned 
by the turn of events and concerned for my 
future.  I might add I was also concerned for 
my and my family’s personal security having 
regard to the apparent reach and ambit of 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 393 of 397 
 
the Gupta influence.” 
 
Did you have any actual threat made  to you or did 
you just feel uncomfortable that there might a risk to 
yourself? 
MR SALOOJEE:  No Chair I mean you know you always 
worried about is there a possibility that something could 
happen – always.  And in fact you know you – at some point 
you can become paranoid about some of these things as 
well.  I mean we lived in a very difficult time during that 
period.  I was being put under pressure on this side.  I was 
10 
still trying to manage Denel. I was trying to address all the 
issues that have [00:25:09] here whilst trying to keep my 
head above water you know.  So of course it was a very 
difficult, very stressful period in my life. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  In retrospect do you think that perhaps 
you could and should have confided in somebody such as 
the Public Protector? 
MR SALOOJEE:  No at that point I thought what I was doing 
was protecting my own interest. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But what about the nation’s interests? 
20 
MR SALOOJEE:  Shoo I mean I was trying to manage it the 
best way that I can.  You know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course Mr Kennedy there is the 
question whether you can confide in the Public Protector 
because I guess you either lay a complaint in which case it 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 394 of 397 
 
will be dealt with transparently. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or you do not.  So I am not sure if you can 
confide. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  No I accept that it may not have been 
possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  It is just a suggestion that I am raising 
for his comment.  I understand your predicament Mr 
Saloojee.  Chair may I just have a moment to confer with my 
10 
team to see if there is anything further? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Mr Saloojee, 
thank you Chair we have no further questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is one question which I want to 
check.  Mr Ntsepe I do not know whether Mr Burger as well 
but Mr Ntshepe said that you and Mr Salim Essa had known 
each 
other 
for 
quite 
some 
time 
and 
had 
your 
own 
relationship outside of Denel for some time.  Because when 
he 
gave 
evidence 
he 
sought 
to 
say 
you 
may 
have 
20 
downplayed your own role in what happened.  So did you 
have a relationship of – or did you know Mr Salim Essa 
outside of Denel before you met him at the I think you – I 
understood your evidence to say you met him at the – before 
you met him I think before he took you to the Gupta 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 395 of 397 
 
residence?  When did you get to know him for the first time 
Mr Salim Essa? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Chair if I recall from some of the evidence 
that was led it was Mr Mantsha who said that I had known Mr 
Essa for a long while because we come from the same 
locality. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr Mantsha may have said that but I 
am 
under 
the 
impression 
that 
Mr 
Ntshepe 
also 
said 
something. But I may be mistaken but some witness said you 
and Mr Salim Essa had known each other. 
10 
MR SALOOJEE:  Ja we have never known each other. We 
have never been friends.  We do not come from the same 
locality.  We come from different communities.  I have been 
brought up in the Western – in the old Western Transvaal in 
Johannesburg.  I think he comes from Pretoria if I am not 
mistaken.  I have never known him.  I have never interacted 
with him socially at all.  It was just during this period that he 
made my acquaintance.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So did you meet him for the first time a 
short while before he took you to the first meeting [talking 
20 
over one another. 
MR SALOOJEE:  It was in the first quarter of about 2012. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The first quarter of 2012? 
MR SALOOJEE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before that you did not know him? 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 396 of 397 
 
MR SALOOJEE:  I mean I knew about him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You knew about him. 
MR SALOOJEE:  I used to see him in the streets and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Alright.  Thank you.  Mr 
Kennedy is you recollection the same as mine that Mr 
Ntshepe may have said something similar? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I think he may have Chair but I am 
afraid I cannot be certain about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright.  Thank you very much Mr 
Saloojee for coming back to deal with the matters that you 
10 
had to deal with.  I appreciate the fact that you were 
prepared to give evidence until so late in the evening. Thank 
you very much.  If the need arises we will ask you to come 
back but hopefully it will not be necessary. 
MR SALOOJEE:  No thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: Yes thank you very much you are excused.  
I must also thank you Mr Kennedy and everybody all the staff 
for being prepared to stay and – to so late. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that we could finish Mr Saloojee’s 
20 
evidence.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we are going to adjourn for the day and 
tomorrow I will hear in the morning the evidence of Mr 
Makhubo the Johannesburg Mayor and in the afternoon I will 
26 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 313 
 
Page 397 of 397 
 
continue with the evidence of Mr Ramosebudi who gave 
evidence earlier today.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.
