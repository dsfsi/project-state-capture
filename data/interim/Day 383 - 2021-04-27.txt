PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 27 APRIL 2021 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Seleka, good morning 
everybody. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Zwane. 
MR ZWANE:  Chairperson good morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning on Freedom Day. 
MR ZWANE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning to your attorney.  Thank 
you.   
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I must start by thanking everybody who 
has agreed to work on a public holiday for sacrificing 
enjoying Freedom Day and coming to work. Mr Seleka and 
your team, the investigators, the staff, the technicians, Mr 
Zwane thank you for your cooperation you probably would 
have been at some function today to join others who are 
celebrating freedom and thank you to your attorney again 
for the cooperation that you have given the commission to 
enable the commission to sit today.  We appreciate it.  I 
20 
think we should all look at our sacrifice as our own small 
contribution to dealing with matters that diminish our 
freedom such as corruption and therefore it is really a 
good thing when we can make a contribution.  So thank 
you to everybody for the sacrifices.  Okay Mr Seleka. 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383

chance of making a speech. 
MR ZWANE:  No thank you – thank you Chair I really 
appreciate that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR ZWANE:  Thank you Chairperson for the opportunity 
once more.  This being my fourth appearance to the 
commission some of the questions which were asked were 
already dealt with in my previous engagements but for the 
sake of progress I am here and prepared to repeat myself 
should the need arise. 
10 
 
I want to state in this commission that in the ANC 
we do not self-deploy. There are processes that are 
followed 00:08:00. 
 
I also want to point out that I went to Switzerland to 
try and save the jobs – blood bath that had become 
eminent at the Department of Mineral Resources when I 
joined.  
 
I went there to try and rescue the three thousand 
jobs that were at stake in any manner possible including 
but not limited to a possible buyer of the mine. 
20 
 
I was not married to any particular buyer for as long 
as correct processes will be followed. 
 
I responded at that time Chair to the call of saving 
workers and their families from the jaws of abject 00:08:47. 
 
I also want to state Chair that I went to Switzerland 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 8 of 138 
 
via Dubai at the expense of the Department of Mineral 
Resources.   
 
Let me conclude Chair as I have promised by saying 
to this commission in my cooperation with the commission 
up to this evidence I remain committed to assisting the 
commission 
in 
its 
objectives 
even 
under 
difficult 
circumstance. 
 
That 
is 
the 
reason 
I 
have 
accepted 
the 
commission’s request to appear before it today on a 
Freedom Day. 
10 
 
I 
am 
also 
aware 
of 
the 
constraints 
that 
the 
commission is facing and I have chosen to be part of the 
solution. 
 
I want to thank you Chair once more for allowing me 
to raise this on record.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much Mr Zwane.  Thank 
you.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you did keep your promise.  Mr 
Seleka. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.    Chairperson I 
understand the files which could not be found for you they 
are found but it does not put me in any better position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no, ja.  But it is okay let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383

Page 12 of 138 
 
annexures Chairperson I beg leave to have this affidavit - 
supplementary affidavit of Mr Zwane admitted as Exhibit 
U41.2. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
The 
supplementary 
affidavit 
of 
Mr 
Mosebenzi Joseph Zwane that starts at page 351 is 
admitted as an exhibit and will be marked as Exhibit U41.2. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  Mr Zwane then 
in – that is the affidavits that you have submitted before 
the commission.  You have touched on some of the issues 
that we would like you to testify on before the commission 
10 
in your speech. 
 
But let us start with your – any association for links 
with the Gupta’s and Mr Salim Essa.  Could you tell the 
Chairperson whether you have known the Gupta brothers 
and under what circumstances you came to know them? 
MR ZWANE:  No thanks Chairperson. Thanks for the 
opportunity.  As I have said in my affidavit I know the 
Gupta’s especially Tony Gupta.  I knew him from the year 
2009 – 2010 when they came to the Free State.  We had a 
PEC 
Provincial 
Executive 
Committee 
of 
the 
African 
20 
National 
Congress 
they 
came 
there 
to 
introduce 
themselves and asked to work with the province in terms of 
the newspaper which was called New Age. 
 
I should hasten to say that I have interacted with 
him on a number of occasions but also indicate that on 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 13 of 138 
 
those occasions they were occasions necessitated either 
by a mandate from government or a mandate from my own 
political party.   
 
I have not interacted with him outside that.  So he 
is not my friend as I have said I met – I met him in a 
meeting of the African National Congress and that is how I 
know them.  Thank you Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well do you want to go further in terms of 
what other interactions you have had with him – with him 
10 
and any other member of that family over the years in 
terms of your various capacities whether it is PEC in just 
the Free State or as Minister of Mineral Resources or in 
any other way? 
MR ZWANE:  No thank you Chair.  I met with him on my 
capacity as the Premier of the Province of Free State 
because the meeting after the presentation presented upon 
me a responsibility to see that the content of the Free 
State because that paper was to have a content of every 
province is covered. Should I have any issue in terms of 
20 
the content I should be able to raise that with the province 
and raise it with you. 
 
The second issue when I was a Minister there was a  
necessity for me to go to Switzerland on invitation by Mr 
Glasenberg.  I had initiated a meeting where when – when 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 14 of 138 
 
I arrived at the Department as I have said there was an 
issue of people losing their jobs 3000 jobs and that matter 
was presented before the cabinet and I had to deal with 
that matter and see how best can I save the jobs. 
 
And in interacting with the owners of the company 
Oakbay it was necessary for me to go and engage with 
them on any possible manner to try and resolve their jobs.  
That would have included the issue of a possible buyer. 
 
During my interaction with the department … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And of course that – when you talk about 
10 
a possible buyer you mean a possible buyer of? 
MR ZWANE:  The mines. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The mine. 
MR ZWANE:  Oakbay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja Oakbay – ja. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ZWANE:  During my interaction with the Department I 
was informed that a company by the name of Tegeta is 
willing to – to buy. 
20 
 
Now I requested for a meeting with Mr Glasenberg 
and I was prepared Chair to go anywhere where Mr 
Glasenberg will avail himself.  As a result I got an… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he was what the Managing Director 
of 0-0:20:24. 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 15 of 138 
 
MR ZWANE:  He was CEO of Oakbay I think so.  Glencore. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Glencore.  Ja. 
MR ZWANE:  Glencore Ja.  He was the CEO of Glencore 
and so ultimately he gave me an invitation to Switzerland 
which I went to Switzerland.  
 
I also indicated to the officials that they should 
notify the possible buyer of this mine Glencore that was 
done.  I went to Switzerland. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To notify them that you were going to 
have – to this meeting with Mr Glasenberg. 
10 
MR ZWANE:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ZWANE:  And – and if possible I would want us to 
engage on that matter and see if we cannot get the 
solution to this problem of people losing their jobs. 
 
So I went to Switzerland. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let me just get that clear.  You are 
talking to the officials of the Department. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you are asking them to approach 
20 
Tegeta or Oakbay. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To say the officials must tell them that 
you are arranging to go to Switzerland to meet with Mr 
Glasenberg. 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 16 of 138 
 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To discuss this issue.  That is what you 
were asking the officials? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Continue. 
MR ZWANE:  And Tegeta should avail themselves. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ZWANE:  So that we can deal with this matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay for the meeting? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ZWANE:  Then I went to Switzerland.  I met with Mr 
Glasenberg and in… 
CHAIRPERSON:  This was when 
MR ZWANE:  It was around  
CHAIRPERSON:  December 2015? 
MR ZWANE:  December I think – no December the 2 n d. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ZWANE:  Thereabout. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR ZWANE:  Because if I remember I moved here around 
the 29 t h, 30 t h of November via Dubai as I have said and 
then we had our second – our first meeting which is 
actually according to me the only meeting that we had with 
Mr Glasenberg where we discussed broadly in the meeting. 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 17 of 138 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But did you say second meeting? 
MR ZWANE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said something meeting? 
MR ZWANE:  We had our first meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  First meeting okay. 
MR ZWANE:  Which was the only meeting between me and 
Mr Glasenberg. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR ZWANE:  And in that meeting Salim Essa was also 
there representing Tegeta. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
MR ZWANE:  We discussed about possible solutions.  As 
he discussions ensued Mr Glasenberg said he is not well 
vested with issues of the sale of Glencore and so that 
meeting ended without any result or any decision.   And I 
should 
say 
Chair 
according 
to 
the 
affidavit 
of 
Mr 
Glasenberg which I fully agree he had invited me for a 
dinner to discuss – he wanted to discuss some issues – 
business issues.  I could not honour that dinner and the 
second day that is where Tony Gupta was and Clinton 
20 
Ephron from the site of Glencore to have a meeting 
because the first day he could not have any resolution 
because Mr Glasenberg did not have details. 
 
In that meeting I was not part of that which is the 
second meeting.  I only came in there introduced the 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 18 of 138 
 
subject of my concern in terms of the job losses and my 
wish that a solution should be arrived at.  And I left that 
meeting for the parties to engage. 
 
And I went to another room and after some time Mr 
Glasenberg was brought to the room where I was and 
indicated that they are finished with the meeting.  There is 
an agreement in terms of the mine being sold to Tegeta. 
 
I thanked him for his time.  I stood up and went to 
the room where the meeting was and I shook hands with 
every.  That is the second time when I met with the 
10 
Gupta’s. 
 
Maybe I should hasten to – Chair to give this 
commission information in terms of what happened after – 
after that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR ZWANE:  So that there are no questions that are … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and say the full picture. 
MR ZWANE:  Ja.  Chairperson my itinery was leading me 
India after Switzerland. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat that please. 
20 
MR ZWANE:  My itinery. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes after Switzerland? 
MR ZWANE:  I had to go to India. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ZWANE:  On an official visit paid for by the Department 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 19 of 138 
 
but in 2009 there around I developed a condition – throat 
condition 
which 
was 
affected 
by 
weather 
changes 
especially extreme cold.  
 
During my stay in Switzerland because it was winter 
during that time I could not sustain the strength of my 
throat.  I was struggling.   
 
As I was thanking everybody for the meeting well-
handled and the agreement I then raised an issue that I 
was on my way to India.  That is when Tony Gupta 
indicated that they are also going to India. 
10 
 
Due to my condition at that point struggling with my 
voice because of the throat I requested them to give me a 
lift to India.  
 
I should say this question has – has been asked 
many times and I am sure the commission has my 
responses in terms of how did I – how did I go to 
Switzerland?  I am putting in this commission that I took 
my commercial flight paid for by DMR and went and did the 
work there. 
 
After doing the work I was to proceed on my own to 
20 
India but I had a hindrance of this throat problem so I 
requested a lift because they were going to India – 
because I was struggling in terms of expressing myself. 
 
I went to India I met with possible investors. At that 
particular time my throat was badly swollen – I had to look 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 20 of 138 
 
for a doctor in India.  Fortunately my doctor here in South 
Africa is an Indian chap in Durban.  As we were discussing 
because this – I had to do an operation every year he 
indicated that he knew some specialist in India that have 
equip – better equipments than we have here at home. 
 
So I engaged with him when I was there and I 
got contacts I went to a doctor I think it was my second 
day and when I was there the doctor said I needed to be 
operated.  So I was operated there in a public hospital and 
it was a norm Chair after an operation because this was 
10 
not the first operation.  I would spend about fifteen days 
having to struggle with the voice – my voice would be 
gone.  So coming back I think it was around the 5 t h or the 
6 t h of December.  I had to ask a lift again from Tony to 
Dubai.  And when I arrived at Dubai, I waited there and I 
got my flight to South Africa.  Those were the occasions, 
Chair, that I have met with Tony.  The other occasions, I 
think two, is when I was also invited to a function.  I should 
put it, it is called Diwali function(?).  I went there to that 
function which was a function and attended by everybody 
20 
who was invited including politicians.  Those are the 
occasions that I have interacted with Tony.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So the first one is when he came to a 
PEC meeting in the Free State of the ANC? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 21 of 138 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who did he come with on that occasion, 
if you can remember? 
MR ZWANE:   I think there were two, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR ZWANE:   The one was presenting.  I am not too sure 
whether it was Nazeem. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR ZWANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If it is Nazeem, would it be Nazeem 
Howa? 
10 
MR ZWANE:   Howa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  So ...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   [Indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...that was the first occasion? 
MR ZWANE:   That was the first occasion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then the second occasion was when 
you met him in that meeting, in the second meeting in 
Switzerland where you say you introduced the subject and 
20 
then left the meeting? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That was the second occasion.? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And thereafter, you travelled with him to 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 22 of 138 
 
India. 
MR ZWANE:   India.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then when you came back from India 
to Dubai ...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...you travelled with him again? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And after that you had no further 
interactions with him? 
MR ZWANE:   No. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  And with regard to his 
brothers, did you have any interactions with them? 
MR ZWANE:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not at all? 
MR ZWANE:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  And Mr Salim Essa, was it 
the occasion in Switzerland the only time you interacted 
with him? 
20 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That was the only time? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay.  So going to the first 
meeting in Switzerland which you – was attended by 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 23 of 138 
 
yourself, 
Mr 
Glasenberg 
and 
Mr 
Salim 
Essa.  
Mr Glasenberg said in his affidavit that Mr Salim Essa was 
introduced as your advisor, as I understand it.  I think in 
your affidavit, I think you might not have dealt with that 
issue or I have might have missed it.  What is the position?  
Is that true? 
MR ZWANE:   As I have said, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR ZWANE:   Maye I should give this clear picture. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
10 
MR ZWANE:   Salim came before – he arrived before 
Mr Glasenberg ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   [Indistinct]  
MR ZWANE:   No, before Mr Glasenberg. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At the meeting? 
MR ZWANE:   At the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Venue? 
MR ZWANE:   At the venue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   He was taken to me. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR ZWANE:   By the people in the hotel. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   And he even introduced himself as an 
advisor of Tegeta.   
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 24 of 138 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Advisor of Tegeta? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR ZWANE:   As the company. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR ZWANE:   When Mr Glasenberg came – arrived, Salim 
was already there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR ZWANE:   And I then introduced myself.  I also 
introduced Salim as an advisor to Tegeta. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   That is what I did Chair.  I never introduced 
Salim as my advisor. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  So you introduced him as advisor 
to Tegeta? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So you were suggesting that 
Mr Glasenberg must have been mistaken about that he was 
introduced as your advisor? 
MR ZWANE:   Well, that is my ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe he did not hear you properly? 
MR ZWANE:   That is my assumption Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR ZWANE:   As I have narrated the event.  Salim was 
there for Tegeta.  Mr Glasenberg was there for Glencore. 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 25 of 138 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m.  Okay.  Mr Seleka.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Yes.  Mr Zwane, 
there are other occasions which I thought you would have 
mentioned.  Just going back to Mr Tony Gupta. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I do not know Mr Seleka whether it 
might not be convenient to analyse this Switzerland thing 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...in terms of the content of that 
discussion.  I do not know.  I did not look at his affidavit 
10 
how he dealt with that issue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I know that at some stage, I thought he 
did not deal with it but I may have been mistaken. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair.  It is on page – the affidavit 
is dealing specifically with the issue, it is on page 351. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You mean the supplementary? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The supplementary affidavit.  Eskom 
Bundle 19. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And specifically paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 
on page 352. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And there Mr Zwane says: 
“I wish to state that I have perused the 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 26 of 138 
 
statement 
of 
Ivor 
Glasenberg 
which 
is 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You are reading from where? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Paragraph 4. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 352. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
“I wish to state that I have perused the 
statement 
of 
Ivor 
Glasenberg 
which 
is 
10 
comprehensive analyses of events that took 
place between Glencore and Eskom and I 
would not want to deal with each and every 
allegations in this statement but would want to 
concentrate only on the paragraphs that are 
relevant 
to 
me 
and 
my 
interactions 
with 
Mr Glasenberg...” 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Are you at 353.2? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   352.  Page 352.  I just read paragraph 
4. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   352? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I am looking at his supplementary 
affidavit which starts at 351. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, it starts at – yes, that is correct, 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 27 of 138 
 
Chair.  It starts at 351 but I have gone to the relevant 
paragraphs on the issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, no.  I am sorry.  Okay.  No, I was on 
the wrong...  Yes, okay.  Now I can see.  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, yes.  And then – Mr Zwane, you 
are following me? 
MR ZWANE:   I am with you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You are with me.  Thank you.  Then 
paragraph 5 is: 
“I need to confirm that I went to Switzerland 
10 
only to meet with Glencore, Mr Glasenberg to 
resolve 
the 
intending 
job 
losses 
in 
the 
Optimum Coal Mine after I had requested for a 
meeting in the republic and instead they 
invited me to come over to Switzerland. 
I wish to confirm that I never pressurised 
Glencore or anybody else for that matter to 
sell the mine. 
It 
seems 
to 
be 
confirmed 
by 
Glencore 
(Mr Glasenberg) itself to this Commission...” 
20 
 
And that is the sum-total of the response. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is very brief.  [laughs].  That is very 
brief.  Mr Zwane, for a meeting that you travelled all the 
way from South Africa to Switzerland for. 
MR ZWANE:   Chair, I have tried to give – paint a picture.  
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 28 of 138 
 
The last when I was here, I was warned by the Chair that 
due to time constraints the Chair would want me to be 
straight to the point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   To be brief.  So I thought I was still following 
the instructions of this Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]. 
MR ZWANE:   Otherwise, I would have told the story as I 
have told it now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Your story as you have told it is full? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Well, Mr Seleka let me allow 
you to continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It might be important to look at how 
Mr Glasenberg brought allegations he made because the 
only thing that Mr Zwane says here, in effect is, the 
purpose of his trip to Switzerland, he states it.  And he 
20 
says he did not pressurise mister – or pressurised 
Glencore or anybody to sell the mine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So – only that he really says about the 
meeting. 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 29 of 138 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair.  Chair, that is exactly 
where I am now in Mr Glasenberg’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which is in Eskom Bundle 18(a), 
Mr Zwane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   18(a)? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   18(a). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Registrar? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is a holiday, Chair.  [laughs]   
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  It is too early in the morning. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Zwane, you can go to page 
352.172. 
MR ZWANE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   352.  The affidavit starts on 352.164. 
CHAIRPERSON:   352 point...? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   164. 
MR ZWANE:   Black number? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The black numbers all the time. 
MR ZWANE:   35... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Somebody must assist him, please.  
20 
Okay I have found it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You found it, Chair.   
MR ZWANE:   [Speaker is unclear – moved away from 
microphone] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   352.164 and that is the beginning of 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 30 of 138 
 
the affidavit.  The - development...   
MR ZWANE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So the relevant page where 
Mr Glasenberg starts to deal with matters pertaining to the 
meeting is on page 352.172. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On mine, is that 352.170 – Minister 
Zwane’s office on 24 November 2015. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  No, that is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We can start there.  It is where the 
10 
meetings are.  The details of the meetings are later on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.   
MR ZWANE:   [Speaker is unclear – moved away from 
microphone] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Mr Zwane, we should then be at 
352.172.  Let us go to 170.   
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
I 
guess 
the 
first 
things 
is 
that, 
20 
Mr Zwane.  Mr Glasenberg says at paragraph 41: 
He was not informed of the purpose of the 
meeting that he was going to have with you 
and no specific agenda had been set for the 
meeting. 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 31 of 138 
 
 
What do you say about it? 
MR ZWANE:   Chair, as I said earlier on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR ZWANE:   I was addressing the issue of job losses. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR ZWANE:   I seek an audience with him specifically on 
this matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  And he was informed ahead of the 
meeting that that was the purpose? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR ZWANE:   I had instructed in a letter that was written 
to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR ZWANE:   That I want to meet with him concerning this 
issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Mr Zwane, did you write it?  You 
20 
said you wrote a letter to him. 
MR ZWANE:   The interaction was between the department 
and him.  It was in terms of a written request.  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So.  Well, can you absolutely recall 
that you have written the letter to him or you think it was 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 32 of 138 
 
written? 
MR ZWANE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  The reason I am asking is this.  If 
you – well, one, we – no reference is made to that letter in 
your affidavit but this the one important part. 
“To the extent that he says he was not aware 
of the purpose of the meeting...” 
 
And as you said, in the first meeting a resolution 
could not be achieved because he said he did not have the 
details of the transaction.  So if you connect the two, it 
10 
seems to be correct, on the face of it, that it seems he 
have gone into this first meeting could, as it were, without 
knowing what the purpose is otherwise he would come 
prepared.   
MR ZWANE:   Well, I – from where I am seated, Chair.  I 
have read his affidavit.  I have read his affidavit and I 
heard what he said.  This is actually a bit of a challenge to 
me for a CEO where a minister says:  I am – he need to 
meet with you.  And I will come wherever you are.  But that 
meeting does not have an agenda.  From where I am 
20 
seated.  The agenda was straight and I said that should be 
communicated to him that the issue was about the job 
losses in the mine called Optimum.  It was owned by 
Glencore. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Seleka. 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 33 of 138 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  So he then gives the 
details of the meeting on page 352.172. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, also I see that at 170.  He says at 
45, paragraph 45: 
“Following Minister Zwane’s request for a 
meeting, Glencore issued an invitation letter 
dated 16 November 2015 to Minister Zwane...” 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it is strange.  You said you initiated – 
you asked your officials to ask for a meeting with you and 
10 
he says he did not know the purpose of the meeting and 
there was no agenda.  But he also says he has issued an 
invitation to you.  [laughs]  So it is not sure what was said 
in here.  Or did you know about the invitation – did he 
invite you? 
MR ZWANE:   Chair, I have said earlier and I think it is on 
record that the initiator of a meeting was me.  I interacted 
with Mr Glasenberg’s office through my office, requested to 
meet him.  And I further went on to say I was prepared to 
go wherever he was.  I have seen in his affidavit that he 
20 
says he understood me to be having other businesses in 
...[indistinct]   
 
I have clarified that matter that my only business 
in Switzerland was to go and resolve this issue of job 
losses.  Subsequently, after my initiating to meet with him, 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 34 of 138 
 
he then issued an invitation for me to go over where he 
was, which is the invitation that he is talking about here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, so you know about the invitation 
...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   Yes, I know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...the invitation? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you say it came after you had 
initiated ...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   I initiated a meeting with him. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MR ZWANE:   And I think Chair.  Chairperson is right to 
have made the point that I have made earlier on to 
Advocate here that it is my take that offices were 
interacting on a formal basis using formal communication.  
That is why – say he then issued a letter confirming that I 
should go to Switzerland.  For what?  I mean, if you do not 
know you should ask, as a CEO Minister.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   I understand you want to see me.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   What must I prepare? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   Logically, it should be like that.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 35 of 138 
 
MR ZWANE:   I am clear on my side, the issue was to do 
with job losses. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Thank you, Chair.  Now 
Mr Zwane, as I have heard you.  You say your travel, your 
flight was on the 29 t h of November? 
MR ZWANE:   There around. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So 29 – you say 30  November, then 
10 
you first went to Dubai or you - it was via Dubai? 
MR ZWANE:   Via Dubai. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  To Switzerland? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But the meeting was only on the 
1 s t of December 2015, the first meeting.  So was the trip 
that long or did you actually stop somewhere? 
MR ZWANE:   Ja.  No, Chair.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR ZWANE:   When you arrive in Dubai, you stop there for 
a couple of hours.  I may not have the exact hours that I 
stopped in Dubai but I know I stopped on my way there and 
as I came home – so I had to have a proper arrangement 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 36 of 138 
 
so that I do not come there, I am late and so forth, when I 
was the one who was rushing for a meeting.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, is that all?  Okay.  So the meeting 
then takes place on the 1 s t, which is on page 352.172.  And 
Mr Glasenberg talks about the meeting: 
“I recall that the meeting was attended by 
myself, Minister Zwane and Mr Salim Essa. 
The meeting commenced around 11 a.m. and 
lasted for about an hour. 
We met at the Delta Hotel in Switzerland. 
10 
Mr Zwane introduced Mr Essa to me as his 
advisor...” 
 
So you have dealt with point.  According to you, 
you introduced Mr Essa as Tegeta’s advisor. 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Advocate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why did you not in your supplementary 
affidavit where you deal with this, why did you not say this 
is not true?  Why did you not say when Mr Glasenberg says 
in his affidavit that I introduced Mr Salim Essa as my 
advisor that that is not true?  The position is that I 
20 
introduced Mr Salim Essa as Tegeta’s advisor. 
MR ZWANE:   Chair, I thought I had indicated the reason 
why I was short in terms of my affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but you cannot be so short as to 
leave something that gives a wrong picture, is it not? 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 37 of 138 
 
MR ZWANE:   My assumption was that I would be called to 
this Commission and the Commission would interact with 
me and the issues that the Commission feels that are not 
clarified will be clarified. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but your purpose of deposing to an 
affidavit is, particularly in response to another affidavit 
...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...is to put your side of your story and to 
correct whatever allegations that may be in the other 
10 
person’s affidavit that you believe not to be true or 
justified, is it not? 
MR ZWANE:   I hear you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   I hear you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR ZWANE:   And I am sure next I will take that into 
consideration. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  You see, it – when you do not 
deal with it, the allegation, when you have been given an 
20 
opportunity to do so, the impression is that you have no 
issue with the allegation because if somebody says in an 
affidavit Mr Zwane stole money and you are given a chance 
to respond, you cannot not respond to that allegation 
unless you have no answer to it.  You understand? 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 38 of 138 
 
MR ZWANE:   I do understand Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   As I have indicated. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   I have a full answer to this and this is the 
answer I am giving to the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Paragraph 54, it 
10 
carries on then Mr Zwane. 
MR ZWANE:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It says: 
“Mr 
Essa 
came 
to 
collect 
me 
from 
the 
reception at the hotel. 
I had never met Mr Essa before. 
Thereafter, 
we 
went 
upstairs 
to 
Mr Zwane(sic)...” 
 
Paragraph 55 says ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, where are you now? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Paragraph 54 on page 352.172. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   May I move on to 55, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 39 of 138 
 
“As I thought the meeting was going to be a 
general discussion about Glencore’s business 
in South Africa. 
At that stage, however, Glencore had decided 
to take OCM out of business rescue and I 
intended to inform the minister about that 
fact...” 
 
And you expressed concern about Section 54 
Notices.  Yes.  Mr Zwane, this is an important factor, the 
first part about Glencore to take OCM to of business 
10 
rescue because as at the 1 s t of December 2015, Glencore 
had in fact made that decision that OCM will be taken out 
of business rescue.  In other words, the risk of job 
losses...  You want to say something? 
MR ZWANE:   May I please interact you? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  That is okay. 
MR ZWANE:   Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MR ZWANE:   May I have a small comfort break? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us have a – will ten minutes do? 
20 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us have a ten minutes adjournment. 
MR ZWANE:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 40 of 138 
 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Zwane, I was on 
page - Eskom bundle A, page 352.172, paragraph 55.  I 
had read the paragraph particularly the second sentence 
which says: 
“At that stage, however, Glencore had decided to 
take OCM out of business rescue and I intended to 
inform the minister about that fact and to express 
concern about Section 54 notices.” 
10 
So with Glencore’s decision to take OCM out of business 
rescue, the risk or threat of job losses was then if not 
mitigated but taken away. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not know whether the recording 
continues or not but if the – if our recording continues we 
can continue, if the TV is impacted, they will find us on the 
web. 
MR ZWANE:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, let us first get confirmation we 
are record. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are we on record?  It is recording, ja.  
Continue? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, the risk to job losses, Mr Zwane, 
was then avoided as at a date when you had this meeting 1 
December 2015.  Your comment? 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 41 of 138 
 
MR ZWANE:   As this is read, Chair, Mr Glasenberg is 
saying he intended to tell me.  My understanding is that he 
did not tell me and as far as I remember he did not tell me.  
I have said earlier this morning I was ready to accept any 
method for as long as correct processes were followed that 
would have saved the jobs and that is my response.  This 
was not brought to my attention.  In fact if that issue was 
raised earlier on, I would have not even travelled to 
Switzerland. 
MS GIGABA:   Okay, that makes it important to look at 
10 
what he says was discussed in the meeting and that he 
touches on in paragraph 56.  I will come back to the 
Section 54 notices.  So in paragraph 56 he says: 
“Mr Essa raised the issue of the possible sales of 
shares held by OCH in its subsidiaries in Tegeta 
and the proposal that the Guptas had made to 
Glencore, Mr Essa knew the numbers of the various 
offers that Glencore had discussed with the Guptas 
and referred to various detailed issues such as the 
working capital requirements of the mine.” 
20 
Now you would immediately see there that he has not said 
anything about yourself raising a concern about job losses. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Seleka, in paragraph 59 at page 
352.172 Mr Glasenberg says something that may be seen 
as supporting Mr Zwane’s version. 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 42 of 138 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He says Minister Zwane was cautious in 
what he said. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But he kept saying, and I quote: 
“I am sure you will reach a deal with the Guptas.” 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that particular quotation is one thing.  
Then he says: 
“He never said that Glencore must sell the mine to 
10 
the Guptas, he just said he did not want the mine to 
go into liquidation and that he was sure that 
Glencore would reach a deal with the Guptas.” 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So he mentions a concern about the 
mine going into liquidation, he mentions – he says he 
never said that Glencore must sell the mine to the Guptas.  
On my reading and maybe Mr Zwane you can tell me – give 
me your comment on this, he certainly gives a quotation 
where you say – where he says you said: 
20 
“I am sure you will reach a deal with the Guptas.” 
Okay?  But in the next sentence he says: 
“He never said that Glencore must sell the mine to 
the Guptas.” 
And then he said you said you did not want to see the mine 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 43 of 138 
 
going into liquidation.  What do you say to the proposition 
that you were cautious not to say anything that could be 
construed as you putting pressure on Glencore to sell the 
mine to the Guptas?  But nevertheless, you were giving an 
indication that you are talking to the Guptas, I am sure you 
can reach a deal with them.  Is that a fair – would you not 
say that is a fair reading of the evidence?  One, you did 
not say they must sell the mine to the Guptas but two, you 
said I am sure you can reach a deal with the Guptas. 
MR ZWANE:   May I …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are not forcing them but you were 
saying – you were giving an indication that you think that 
he should be reached.  Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Okay, may I respond, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR ZWANE:   No, thanks, Chair.  Actually, as Advocate 
reads here it becomes clear that Mr Glasenberg knew the 
agenda because he says …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Knew what?  I am sorry, knew what? 
MR ZWANE:   The agenda of the meeting. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   He knew the agenda of the meeting? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MR ZWANE:   He says he wanted to raise an issue with me 
that they are ready to take the mine out of liquidation. 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 44 of 138 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Out of rescue. 
MR ZWANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   Meaning he had an idea that what is the 
meeting all about.  Number two, he says I did not indicate 
– page 59 – that he must sell to the Guptas.  I did not 
pressurise.  But then he comes back to say I was cautious 
not to pressurise him to sell.   
My version, Chair, is that I was not married to any 
party, I was not even married to the mine being sold.  In 
10 
fact if a mine is on liquidation, if I had any intention of 
letting this mine take another direction, why would I have 
gone and engaged Mr Glasenberg in finding a solution 
because there was already a buyer in the name of Tegeta.   
So I thought I was providing leadership to the 
problem that the department was faced with.  This mine 
went into liquidation according to the records in August 
2015, when I was not there.  It is not me who took the 
money into the liquidation.  
It states there August/September/October/November 
20 
and nobody did anything about this issue.  When I arrived 
here is an issue, people are losing jobs, this matter is even 
at the level of cabinet.  I went there to engage him, I was 
prepared to take any solution that would have saved the 
jobs.   
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 45 of 138 
 
He further says here it made sense, business sense 
to him to sell the mind and he gives reasons what are 
those facts that makes him to come to that conclusion.  So 
I find it a bit disingenuous from his part – because I was 
open, Chair, I was there, I met with him, he should have 
indicated to me that no, we are ready to take Glencore out 
of liquidation.  I was happy.  In fact, I would have been – I 
would have failed to understand why I would have gone to 
Switzerland in the first place when Glencore had a 
solution.  Why would I have left this company for all these 
10 
months in liquidation and wait until I am in Switzerland just 
to tell me one thing, we are ready to save the jobs of the 
people.  
So I was not married to the Guptas, that is why I 
left the meeting.  If I had any intention, I am sure I would 
have said in the meeting.  I left the meeting for parties to 
agree or disagree for as long as I would have had a 
solution that saved the jobs.  That was my primary motive 
of going to Switzerland, not to help any other buyer or a 
particular entity(?). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So do you have any issues with the 
statement he makes that you said I am sure you will reach 
a deal with the Guptas? 
MR ZWANE:   I did not say that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What did you say? 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 46 of 138 
 
MR ZWANE:   I said my concern is to save the jobs.  In all 
the deliberations that you are doing, please take note that 
it is also important on my side that the workers must also 
have somebody who looks after their interest and in this 
case I am here with you to help me to save the jobs as I 
have committed that I will do my best at the cabinet level 
to try and save the jobs.  That is all what I said. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me put this to you as well now that 
we are at this meeting that in the first meeting which you 
attended with Mr Glasenberg and Mr Salim Essa not much 
10 
really was discussed, is that correct? 
MR ZWANE:   That I said we could not reach …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   In terms of the real issues that brought 
you to – that took you to Switzerland.   
MR ZWANE:   I have said we could not reach any 
resolution or conclusion as Mr Glasenberg indicated that 
he was not clued up with some of the aspects which Salim 
had. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   So the meeting adjourned without any 
20 
conclusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   So …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But in terms of actual discussions 
because he says that Mr Salim Essa raised the issue of the 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 47 of 138 
 
possible sale of shares held by OCM in its subsidiary 
Tegeta and proposed that the Guptas had made – and the 
proposal that the Guptas had made to Glencore, he says: 
“Mr Essa knew the numbers of the various offers 
that Glencore had discussed with the Guptas and 
referred to various detailed issues such as the 
working capital requirements to mine.  I advised Mr 
Essa that I did not know about all these details and 
that he seemed to know more about the deal and 
business than I did and that is where we left it.  I 
10 
did not negotiate with Mr Essa and Mr Essa simply 
explained why there was no agreement.  I advised 
both Mr Essa and Minister Zwane that I could not 
comment on the deal and was frustrated by the fact 
that Mr Ephron was not at the meeting as he knew 
all the details.” 
Then he says he raised the Section 54 notices and then he 
says you were cautious – that is the paragraph I read 
earlier on and he said nothing was agreed at the meeting. 
 
Now you have not taken issue with that fuller 
20 
version of the meeting than the one you have provided but 
you have said you did not pressure them or anybody.   
Now it seems to me that Mr Glasenberg is in effect 
saying I was not in a position to discuss the issue that Mr 
Salim Essa wanted to be discussed because I did not the 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 48 of 138 
 
details, I needed Mr Ephron who was not there and the 
meeting left the whole thing there.  
Now the following day you have said your role was 
just to introduce the subject and you left the meeting so it 
seems to me that you played – in terms of substance, you 
may not have made any particular contribution on how the 
matter should be resolved.  On your version all you said 
was I am concerned about the jobs, I would not like the 
mine to go into liquidation and Mr Glasenberg says yes, 
you did express concern about the mine going into 
10 
liquidation and you did not pressurise them to sell to the 
Guptas but you did say you are sure they could reach 
agreement with the Guptas.  So I am just wondering why 
they would not have been able to resolve this matter 
without you because you did not play any active role.  They 
just met and they seemed to have been able to resolve the 
matter.  It is not like you heard what everyone said and 
engaged them to say but there is a problem with this, there 
is a problem with this, here is the advantages of solving 
this matter in this way.  They came together and effectively 
20 
resolved it without any substantive input from you and it 
may well be that one should not expect you to make a 
substantive input but from the point of view of saying – of 
undertaking the whole trip to Switzerland to say you want 
to save jobs, the question is, how do you save jobs if you 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 49 of 138 
 
are going to play such a minimal role and if you are not 
going to make a substantive production to how the problem 
is solved?  What do you say to that? 
MR ZWANE:   No, Chair, when I was at the DMR there were 
– this was not the only problem because if one goes back 
to the presentation at the cabinet, it was not only 3000 
jobs that were going to be lost, there were a number of 
jobs that were going to be lost.  This was in the front 
because one mine had bigger numbers, 3000.   
So I had to find the people talking, I did engage 
10 
with other mine CEOs on this matter and we came to an 
agreement.  Others presented that if our mine is extended 
this way – and I called official and said is there any wrong 
– for an example maybe I should mention that one of the 
CEOs I engaged was Mr Matara on the job losses and we 
resolved that matter by merely just engaging people. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but here you did not engage any of 
the parties on the substantive issues. 
MR ZWANE:   I did not engage but Mr Glasenberg says – 
raises the value of a minister taking up an issue.  He says 
20 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat that? 
MR ZWANE:   In his affidavit Mr Glasenberg raises the 
importance of a minister taking an issue on any other 
particular matter in DMR.  He says it was normal for a 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 50 of 138 
 
minister to engage with any CEO of a mine on any 
particular matter and that when that happens he did not 
see anything wrong, that is why he came to them.  So I 
want to believe that my presence and my raising as a 
minister the issue of concern about the job losses gave 
impetus to the urgency of the matter to be resolved.  That 
is what I can say because the Chair is right, I did not 
participate in terms of substance, my being present and my 
willing to go and extra mile and meeting anybody anyway 
was indication enough that this is an urgent matter which I 
10 
am willing to bring my side as the department if the 
department was to do anything to resolve this thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I must be fair to you and let you know 
what is crossing my mind so you can say something on it, if 
you wish to.  One of things that I have noticed in terms of 
evidence that I have heard with regard to the Guptas, 
particularly Tony Gupta, is that he seems to have had a 
pattern when he would meet government officials or 
ministers or SOE officials or members of boards in terms of 
which very often he would have Mr Duduzane Zuma with 
20 
him but almost all the people who would have been having 
a meeting with Mr Tony Gupta. where Mr Duduzane Zuma 
was there, say the same thing that other than Mr Duduzane 
Zuma being present at the meeting and maybe just 
engaging in pleasantries at the beginning, in terms of 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 51 of 138 
 
contribution to the meeting, in terms of substance, there 
would not much – Tony Gupta would be the one doing the 
talking but Mr Duduzane Zuma would be there and one 
thinking might be well, maybe Mr Tony Gupta would bring 
Mr Duduzane Zuma just to bring some subtle pressure on 
the other person with whom he would be negotiating 
because Duduzane Zuma was the son of the former 
President and 
Duduzane 
Zuma seems to have been 
cautious in all those meetings in not saying wrong things.  
Nobody can say Duduzane Zuma said this or that, said it is 
10 
a good deal, no, you must agree, or whatever, but he was 
just present.  Okay?   
Mr Jonas gave evidence about his meeting at the 
Saxonwold Gupta residence, Mr Duduzane Zuma was there 
but he says he was very quiet.   
Mr Dukwana gave evidence about a meeting he had 
with Tony Gupta where he said Duduzane was there, he 
said Duduzane Zuma was very quiet.   
Mr Riaz Saloojee gave evidence about a meeting 
that he had – I think with Salim Essa, I think maybe Tony 
20 
Gupta was there as well and Duduzane Zuma and he also 
said Duduzane Zuma was very quiet.   
Johan Booysen gave evidence about a meeting he 
had with Tony Gupta and Duduzane Zuma and he was 
brought to the meeting by Duduzane Zuma and by the way, 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 52 of 138 
 
Mr Jonas was also brought to the meeting by Duduzane 
Zuma but Johan Booysen also said Duduzane Zuma was 
very quiet.  I think there are others. 
So I wonder whether there was any attempt by 
whether it is Mr Salim Essa or Tony Gupta to say we just 
need Glencore to see that, you know, we have the minister 
wanting this thing to be resolved and we are here, let us 
resolve it. 
So I am just mentioning that to you because it 
crosses my mind and to be fair to you I think I must give 
10 
you a chance to say something about it if you would like to. 
MR ZWANE:   Chairperson, I appreciate your fairness, I 
really do and I would really want to take this opportunity 
then to say something.  I hear what the Chair is saying and 
how 
different 
witnesses 
has 
characterised 
Tony 
and 
Duduzane.  I have however painted a picture as to the 
source of my going to Switzerland.  It is not me, Chair, who 
presented the job losses in the cabinet.  I got it there in 
the cabinet.  I had to respond from a concern from the 
cabinet, not an outside and that necessitated me then to 
20 
go to Switzerland.  It is me who had.  When I was in 
Switzerland I did not keep quiet, to use my stance, I spoke 
with the party and gave them my wish, I want this matter to 
be resolved, it is record, I brought it here.  Then I went out 
of the meeting.   
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 53 of 138 
 
 
I think the question is would I have accepted if the 
deal was not arrived at?  I have indicated earlier on that I 
was not married to the sale of the company, that was not 
the intention, the intention was to reserve job losses in any 
manner possible, that is what I have said. 
I wish to further place it on record Chair, that during 
my tenure at DMR companies linked to the Gupta  received 
one of the most Section 54’s, during my term.  I did not 
care who was involved.  If there was an issue, I would act 
on that issue, irrespective of who is involved in this issue, 
10 
because Chair, my orientation is that I should always fight 
for the oppress.  
 
The oppress, I stand with them.  I would not accept 
any manner where somebody wants me to use me to 
suppress other people, because I know I come from that 
background where I was suppressed myself.  So there 
would not be a need for me to suppress anybody in order 
to resolve this.  
 
I want to place that on record and I want anybody, if 
people have time, must also go back and check for 
20 
records.  I have issued, I have interacted with 86 Section 
11 when I was there as a minister.  I am sure that is the 
most in two years.  
 
Gave people Section 11 mining rights.  I am sure 
that Glenco was the only if not I am forgetting, Section 11 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 54 of 138 
 
that went to the [indistinct].  So I kept on doing my work as 
I was supposed to do and I would not be intimidated by 
anybody.  
 
If I feel this is the right way I would voice myself 
and say this is right, I am not going to do the wrong thing.  
Appreciating Chair of what is going through your mind.  I 
thought I should put this into context that I was driven by 
these principles and I followed.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Mr Zwane ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are at twelve, so. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Alright, yes.  I get the Chair ’s message.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no I just realised that we have spent 
quite some time on this.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not want the whole time we have set 
aside, to be taken [indistinct]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Because there are other matters.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Let me just traverse the last, what I 
20 
would consider the last issue on this Mr Zwane.  Paragraph 
58 of Mr Glassenberg’s affidavit, he does in fact say that 
after Mr Salim Essa talked about the sale of shares, and 
his response to that, saying that he is surprised that Salim 
Essa seem to have known the details more than he did, 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 55 of 138 
 
and he is frustrated by the fact that Mr [indistinct] who 
knows the details, is not there.  
 
He says in paragraph 58: 
 
“I raised the issue about Section 54 notices.” 
 
That is one, two: 
 
“I also indicated that OCM would continue to 
supply coal to Eskom, but that Glenco would 
continue to fund OCM and take it out of 
business rescue.” 
 
So he says he raised that in the meeting he is 
10 
having with you and Mr Salim Essa.  What is your comment 
to that?  Because you were saying he did not raise the 
section, one he did not raise the issue of business, taking 
out OCM out of business rescue with you.  
 
But there he does actually say he raised it with you 
and Mr Essa, in which event ... in which event if your 
purpose was to save jobs, that would answer your concern.  
Yes, your comment?   
MR ZWANE:  I have already commented on this but let me 
briefly try and say what I have said.  In his affidavit, he 
20 
further says it made business sense.  He was not 
pressurised but because of facts that he raises, he thought 
it was a good decision.  Business decision.   
 
I have indicated that he did not raise the readiness 
of Glenco taking this mine out of, because that would have 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 56 of 138 
 
just end the meeting there Chair.  Section 54, Section 54’s 
in the department have a particular section.  That is 
independent of the minister.   
 
It is the department that actually looks after the 
safety of the workers, whether it is safe to work in the 
mine, and all those things.  Section 54 gets implemented 
as and when there is a need for them to be implemented.  I 
did go, checked with the department.  
 
That is when I actually got that the fact is that 
Guptas 
had 
received 
more 
Section 
54’s 
than 
Mr 
10 
Glassenberg and I could not say to my worker, neglect the 
safety of the mine, because safety of the mine, people’s 
live during my tenure, newspapers and information will tell 
you that I would even go the funerals of those people who 
died at the mine.  
 
It was part of my priority issues.  So I did look at it 
Chair, and that is my view on it.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, that is alright, because you see the 
picture that he nurses during the evidence of other 
witnesses, is that prior to your appointment as the minister 
20 
of DMR, on 23 September 2015, Minister Ramahlodi had 
been approached by Mr Molefe and Dr Ngubane.   
 
They 
have 
requested 
him, 
according 
to 
Mr 
Ramahlodi, to suspend the ...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:  Chairperson, may I have a comfort break 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 57 of 138 
 
once more? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Another break?   
MR ZWANE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, no that is alright.  Okay, let us 
take ten minutes break.  Okay.  We adjourn.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES: 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, let us continue.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  Mr Zwane, I 
10 
was just giving you a picture of the evidence that has 
emerged, that prior to your appointment as the Minister of 
DRM, Mr Mahlodi is approached by Mr Molefe and Dr 
Ngubane and on his version Mr Ramahlodi says he had 
been asked in a meeting to suspend the mining licences of 
Glenco.   
 
He refused.  When the president came back from 
the Bricks meeting he had attended, I am giving you a 
snapshot.  He calls Mr Ramahlodi through his residence, 
official residence.  On Mr Ramahlodi’s arrival there, he 
20 
says he saw you and Mr Ace Magashule, waiting for the 
president.  
 
But that he had a private meeting with the president 
in which the president tells him I am going to move you to 
the Department of Public Enterprises, no Public Service.  
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 58 of 138 
 
MR ZWANE: Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Public Service and Administration. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And administration, thank you Chair, 
and that is what happened.  This meeting is taking place I 
think on the 22 n d of September 2015.  Your announcement 
for the appointment as DMR minister is made on that day 
with you being sworn in on the 23 r d of September 2015.   
 
Where after in November 2015 we see these notices 
from the officials of the DMR saying we are instructed to 
make an inspection on a weekend, and this was on the 28 t h 
10 
of November 2015 which according to them, even though 
not unusual, although the other one says it was unusual, 
unless there is an accident at the mine, then we will go 
and do an inspection.  
 
But there are steps taken to suspend the mining 
operations at Glenco owned mines one, and number two 
that at least on the evidence before us you take the trouble 
to go meet with Glenco’s CEO in circumstances on his 
version, where he says we have decided to take OCM out 
of business rescue and we were going to continue to 
20 
supply coal to Eskom.  
 
So the picture emerges that the one minister is 
removed, replaced with the other, the other being yourself 
who seems to be sympathetic to the Guptas on the one 
hand seeking to obtain OCM in order to gain contracts at 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 59 of 138 
 
Eskom.  
 
Now and I know you have commented on this, but 
on Mr Ramahlodi and seeing you at the official residence 
of President Zuma, do you want to comment on that?   
MR ZWANE: Chairperson, thank you for allowing me to 
comment.  I have a great respect of comrade Ramahlodi.  
He is my elder.  Even after his removal from DMR we 
remained very close.  I am afraid to say the facts is that 
when I, he was finally called by the president, former 
President Jacob Zuma, I did not go to his residence with 
10 
the [indistinct] comrade Ace.  
 
It is a fact Ace was not there when I was called and 
comrade Ramahlodi himself had raised a number of issues 
pertaining mining and I called officials and helped whoever 
needed to be helped, and I thought he knows me better.  I 
cannot comment in terms of how he was removed to 
another department and his views thereof.  
 
All what I know and all what I have said, which I 
thought he will also take kind is because his credentials 
are more than my credentials in politics, that in the ANC 
20 
we do not self-deploy.  When I was removed as the 
Minister of DMR, I did not comment, I did not complain 
because of the same principle.  
 
I went on to serve where I am serving currently and 
I am happy because of that principle.  So I want to reject 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 60 of 138 
 
the notion that I was brought as a stooge to try and 
through other things, especially this issue of Glenco, in 
fact Chair I still asked myself what would have happened if 
Glenco had written a letter, a formal letter.  
 
The company is in liquidation.  We are ready to put 
money and take this company out of liquidation.  I think we 
would not be going up and down in terms of what would 
have happened.  But I want to say from my side I was 
never there in Nthuli House with the current secretary 
general of the movement.  
10 
 
He knows nothing about it.  I have never met 
comrade Mahlodi there at Nthuli House. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was Mahlamba Ndlopfu, not Nthuli 
House.  
MR ZWANE:  Oh, Mahlamba Ndlopfu. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR ZWANE: I have never met him there.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But Mr Seleka, I am not sure how 
material it is whether they met there or they did not meet 
there or whether Mr Magashule was there or was not there.  
20 
The fact, the objective fact is that Mr Zwane was his 
successor.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In that ministry and that is accepted.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, no I was just painting, giving Mr 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 61 of 138 
 
Zwane the whole picture.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because of ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  The allegation made, and of course we 
will give him the opportunity to say something to that 
allegation Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no but what I am saying is the fact 
that he may have found him, that is Mr Ramahlodi may 
have found him in, at Mahlamba Ndlopfu does not add 
10 
either 
way 
on 
his 
credentials 
on 
whether 
he 
was 
sympathetic to the Guptas or not.  
 
It was just a meeting.  The whole point might be 
was he appointed because of any view by the former 
president that he would support the Guptas because Mr 
Ramahlodi’s evidence was that he refused to operate with 
the Guptas, but seeing him at Mahlamba Ndlopfu does not 
add anything to that question as I see it.  
 
But I think let us move on.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And ja, let us move on.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, so then well in the totality of the 
picture Mr Zwane, is the allegation that the issuance of the 
Section 54 notices, came about as a result of one of your 
advisors, Mr Mabasu saying to Mr Msiza that it was your 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 62 of 138 
 
instruction that the notices should be issued.   
 
Those notices were to be issued pursuant to an 
investigation that would take place on a Saturday, the 28 t h 
of November and that you would decide when those notices 
should be [indistinct].  Your comment on that?   
MR ZWANE:  I ensured to not know anything of that sort.  I 
think that allegation when the commission raised it, I went 
back to Malcolm, asked about it.  He denied having done 
that.  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Mabaso?   
10 
MR ZWANE:  Mr Mabaso, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ZWANE:  He denied ever having done that.  I had an 
open door policy with all my officials.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Just your face to the Chairperson. 
MR ZWANE: I had an open door policy with all my officials.  
If they had an issue that was untoward, in the department 
my door was always open.  If you go back to the mining 
charter that I left in that department, amongst the people 
who would disagree in a meeting and give us a direction is 
20 
Mr Msiza.   
 
Some of the points he has made were taken in good 
faith.  I still believe that if he had an issue that he is being 
pressurised 
to 
do 
something 
illegal, 
he 
would 
have 
indicated to me Chair and none of such an indication came 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 63 of 138 
 
to me.   
 
I would have reacted immediately.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, how did you come to have Mr 
Mabaso as I think one of your advisors?   
MR ZWANE: Yes Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  How did that come about?   
MR ZWANE: I knew Mr Mabaso for a long time in the Free 
State.  So when I came here, looking for advisors, I wanted 
people who will understand how the organisation works, 
the discipline within the organisation and they are capable 
10 
also of ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  The organisation? 
MR ZWANE:  African National Congress. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  
MR ZWANE:  So, and they are capable also of carrying out 
their duties, yes Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And you also have another advisor called 
Mr Kubin Moodley.  
MR ZWANE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  How did you come to have him as one of 
20 
your advisors?  
MR ZWANE:  I met with him earlier also in the Free State, 
introduced to me by one of my comrades, Nxwaxwa and 
that is how I met him.  Yes, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  How long, when was it that he was 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 64 of 138 
 
introduced to you in relation to your appointment as the 
Minister of Mineral Resources?  How far back did you go 
with him?  At that time ...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:  Way back, when I was still in the province 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR ZWANE:  I think I was still the executive major at that 
particular point.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Which would have been around what 
time?   
10 
MR ZWANE:  Around 2004, 2006 there.  
CHAIRPERSON:  When you got, when Mr Kubin Moodley 
was introduced to you? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And did you keep in touch with him since 
then, between then and you appointing him as your 
advisor? 
MR ZWANE:  We would seldom talk ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR ZWANE:  Matters of the organisation. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR ZWANE:  He is a very warm person. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR ZWANE:  He passes [indistinct].  My house is just next 
to the road.  
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 65 of 138 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR ZWANE:  [indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, and from what you say I take it 
that Mr Mabaso was or is a member of the ANC from what 
you 
say. 
 You 
said 
you 
wanted 
people 
who 
would 
understand the organisation? 
MR ZWANE:  I met him there, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  As a member of the ANC? 
MR ZWANE:  We had a function, I think it was in 
Bethlehem.  He was with other comrades.  They introduced 
10 
him to me and I then said where are you living, he said no 
I am in Joburg but I am frequenting Free State because I 
have friends here.  
 
That is how we got to know, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But you said you wanted people who 
understood the organisation. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I would assume that the people who 
would 
have 
a 
better 
chance 
of 
understanding 
the 
organisation would be those who are members of the 
20 
organisation.  So I am asking whether to your knowledge 
he was at least at that time, a member when you appointed 
him as an advisor, as one of your advisors whether he was 
a member of the organisation. 
MR ZWANE:  No, I did not check that at that particular 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 66 of 138 
 
point.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR ZWANE:  I referred back to our engagements and even 
when, after he was appointed as an advisor.  He is not 
clued up in terms of organisational issues.  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  But you were not sure whether he was a 
member or not? 
MR ZWANE:  No, at that time I appoint him, that I did not 
check Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And Mr Kubin Moodley, why did you pick 
10 
him? 
MR ZWANE:  Mr ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Why did you choose him to be one of the 
advisors?  Would he also understand the organisation 
well? 
MR ZWANE:  Mr Moodley was introduced to me as I have 
said Nxwaxwa by a comrade, who was the Nxwaxwa he is 
still in the Free State this comrade.  He comes from 
Durban, Chatsworth. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Chatsworth. 
20 
MR ZWANE:  Ja, Chatsworth.  That is how I knew him.  He, 
I learnt as we were engaging, that he was properly 
qualified, he is a warm person who can interact with 
people.  So when I wanted to have advisors, I thought his 
crudeness 
in 
terms 
of 
interacting 
with 
people 
with 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 67 of 138 
 
qualifications 
were 
also 
a 
factor 
that 
I 
took 
into 
consideration.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So what was, what was he as a 
profession?  What is his profession? 
MR ZWANE:  He has an MBA if I remember well, and 
another degree, I think it is BSC.  Yes Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And apart from what you seem to say was 
his capability to interact with people, was there anything in 
his qualifications or experience that attracted you to him or 
it was just his ability to interact with people?  
10 
MR ZWANE:  I was venturing into a sector that will need 
somebody who understands at least the theory of this.  So 
his MBA to me came in handy because I was going to deal 
with business.  Their attitude, how to approach them and 
so forth, would have come in handy for me.  
 
That is why I opted for him Chair.  Plus, I had 
known him for quite some time.  Ja.   
CHAIRPERSON:  He was an advisor to you, is that right?   
MR ZWANE:  Part time.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Part time, ja.  But advisor.  
20 
MR ZWANE:  Ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Now I do know that sometimes 
with ministers or some of the cabinet people, some time 
they talked about a political advisor, sometimes about an 
economic advisor.  Sometimes about a legal advisor.  What 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 68 of 138 
 
advisor was he? 
 
Or was he a general advisor.  
MR ZWANE:  Yes Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  He was just a general advisor.  
MR ZWANE:  The department itself had enough resources 
in terms of economy, legal.  We have sections that are 
there permanently.  So my advisors would actually take me 
through anything I want them to take me through, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And when you appointed him, was he a 
business person, was he employed elsewhere?  What was 
10 
the position as you understood it? 
MR ZWANE:  I think he was doing business if I recall 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
MR ZWANE:  I think he was doing business Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR ZWANE:  Ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But do you know what business he was 
doing? 
MR ZWANE:  I did not go into details.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see, the part of the reason I am 
asking you ...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is because you may or may not know that 
he, there was litigation between the commission and him.  I 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 69 of 138 
 
think 2020 or 2019 and one of the things that he I found 
strange, was that in his affidavits he did not say what he 
was doing for a living, but so I am, I was wondering 
whether when you appointed him, you know what business 
he was involved in.  
MR ZWANE:  Oh, okay.  No, I did not go into those details.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR ZWANE:  Because he was going to be part time.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR ZWANE:  As and when I need him. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR ZWANE:  He will then come.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And Mr Mabaso, what was ... was he a 
business person when you appointed him?  Was he 
employed somewhere?   
MR ZWANE:  He was also doing business Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR ZWANE:  If I recall properly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR ZWANE:  Ja.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But do you know what business he was 
doing? 
MR ZWANE:  No.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You also do not know? 
MR ZWANE:  No.  
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 70 of 138 
 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
And 
did 
he 
have 
any 
particular 
qualifications that you, attracted you to him or experience 
in terms of your portfolio at that time?    
MR ZWANE:  I remember that his, he and his family are 
from a legal background.  I think he had dealt with 
communication at some point.  I cannot say, I cannot 
remember his proper qualifications.   But that is what I can 
remember.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So what you remember about his is that 
at some stage he had dealt with communication? 
10 
MR ZWANE:  Yes and he is from a legal background.  
CHAIRPERSON:  His family has a legal background? 
MR ZWANE:  Ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But not him? 
MR ZWANE:  I cannot just recall his ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot recall. 
MR ZWANE:  Proper, ja ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot recall his qualifications 
either? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can you recall what kind of experience 
he had that may have attracted you to him? 
MR ZWANE:  Malcolm understood the jargons of law.   
CHAIRPERSON:  The what? 
MR ZWANE:  The jargons of law.  How courts will work, 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 71 of 138 
 
how are we supposed to be in line with legal principles.  
He would be the one who brings in terms of advising, 
proper administration and so forth.  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But he did not have legal qualifications.  
Why would you be attracted to how he would deal with law 
and he did not have legal qualification? 
MR ZWANE:  As I have said, I know he comes from a legal 
background.  He used to articulate it very well, at least for 
me, a lay man, a person who does not have that 
background.  It may be different with the Chair.  
10 
 
But he came in handy honestly when it comes to 
issues of administration and, in the office.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You see, the fact that you, you know 
sometimes people who are legally qualified, when they 
occupy certain positions, when there are legal matters they 
need a lawyer to advise them.  You, I am sure you know 
that.  
 
Even when judges have got matters, they need a 
lawyer to advise them.  You know that, not so? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes, yes Chair.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now if you, if as you put it you are a lay 
person in law, that is all the more reason why the person 
you need to advise you should be legally qualified and not 
somebody that is not legally qualified.  So what I am 
putting to you is that it does not seem to make sense to 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 72 of 138 
 
me, that when you need somebody to give you legal advice 
and you do not have legal qualifications, you should go for 
somebody who does not have legal qualifications when 
there are many people with legal qualifications who can do 
that job.  
 
So, because then you can rely on somebody who 
has got legal qualifications, than somebody who has no 
legal qualification himself, but maybe I do not know 
whether your approach was he can go and ask his family 
because you said his family had legal qualifications.   
10 
 
The, I have difficulty with that logic.  I would think 
from your point of view you would say look, I am not legally 
qualified, I cannot rely on somebody who is also not legally 
qualified.  It is going to lead me astray.  I need somebody 
who is strongly qualified in terms of the law so that I can 
rely on his guidance and advice.  
 
What do you say to that? 
MR ZWANE:  Chair, I have indicated earlier on that the 
fields of law, dealing with legalities in the department was 
sufficiently staffed.  From, it is correct what the Chair 
20 
says, even at that, in that instance they themselves should 
also look for legal opinions outside the department.   
 
For this position I needed somebody I know I can 
trust, is honest, will advise me properly and discernible at 
least from what I know.  I am saying to this commission I 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 73 of 138 
 
cannot remember well the qualifications of Malcolm, but I 
furnished reasons why I appointed him. 
 
I hear what the Chairperson is saying, getting 
somebody who is very strong legally.  Malcolm’s role was 
not to advise me legally.  I have said my, all my advisors 
were general advisors.  They were not specific.  Yes, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought you said he was, although he 
was not legally qualified he was good in giving legal 
advice.  I thought that is why we got into this discussion. 
10 
MR ZWANE:  Chair, my apology.  Your understanding of 
legal advice and my understanding may differ at the level 
of I would not need a legal advice in the sense of deep 
legal issues.  I would get it in the department.  But I would 
want somebody who would say to me these are the issues 
that you generally need to look at.  
 
I will then look at those issues, amongst other 
issues, but legally until Kubin had gone, and I appointed a 
legal advisor who was legally ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Qualified.  
20 
MR ZWANE:  Qualified, they used to advise me generally, 
both of them.  As we went on, I thought I needed his legal 
strong background.  That is why after Kubin I got 
somebody who was an advocate.  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka? 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 74 of 138 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, thank you Chair.  Mr Zwane, did you 
know that Mr Kubin Moodley was associated in business 
with Mr Salim Essa?  Particularly as it pertains to 
Regiments.   
MR ZWANE:  No, I did not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You did not know that? 
MR ZWANE:  No, I did not.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  So you ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry, this was 2015? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  When he appointed, when you appointed 
Mr Kubin Moodley and Mr Mabaso, was it 2015? 
MR ZWANE:  It was 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the end of the second half of the 
year?  September? 
MR ZWANE:  Ja, late September there.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
MR ZWANE:  Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Well, similarly with Mr Mabaso, 
because he would have seen from the [indistinct] report, 
20 
that he was in business with Mr Salim Essa in some 
security company.  A company called Premium Security and 
Cleaning Services.   
 
Did you know the relations between the two? 
MR ZWANE:  Chair, let me say at the time when I was 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 75 of 138 
 
appointed it would have been difficult for me to know if this 
person is in partnership with that person, what that means 
because I am not ...[indistinct – word cut] I just know that 
these people are doing business, I did not know whom they 
were doing business with.   I did not know Salim Essa at 
that particular point and – but maybe the long and short 
answer is that I did know that information, as I appointed 
them, as I have said earlier on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, because I thought part of the 
appointment is a vetting process, you know looking at this 
10 
person’s 
background, 
what 
does 
he 
do, 
who 
is 
he 
connected with, his qualifications and so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, background check, you did not do a 
background check on them? 
MR ZWANE:   When the background check is done it is 
done by the Department Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  But they need to check you, isn’t 
it? 
20 
MR ZWANE:   Ja, if there is any issue that is untoward, 
then they bring it to my attention, and depending on the 
veracity of the issue we then take a decision, no these 
people can’t be here because of 1, 2, 3, that was not 
brought to my attention. 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 76 of 138 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  Something comes to 
my mind, just quickly, the medical operation you underwent 
at India, I understand from the information given to the 
Commission that it was paid for by Sahara Computers? 
MR ZWANE:   Can I answer Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR ZWANE:   I paid for my expenses as I’ve indicated 
10 
earlier on, I went to a public hospital, not a private 
hospital, I queued with all the people there for my 
operation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, your medical bill or the hospital 
expenses and whatever doctor, you said, you paid for 
yourself? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, I will obtain the information to 
show it to you Mr Zwane, the…[intervenes]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or maybe before you go there, Mr 
Seleka, don’t forget  your question. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So with regard to your decision to 
appoint Mr Mabaso and Mr Kubin Moodley who – the 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 77 of 138 
 
information available suggests were associated with Mr 
Salim Essa who is associated with the Gupta’s.  You say it 
was simply a coincidence that both your advisors that you 
appointed happened to have connections with Mr Salim 
Essa? 
MR ZWANE:   I’m saying I did not know that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja okay, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Mr Zwane, the – Chair I 
10 
just want to move on to this link, your interaction with Mr 
Tony Gupta. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, are you moving away from that issue 
of the – oh she’s looking at it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She’s looking at it ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Zwane, you’ve mentioned a couple 
of times when you met with Mr Gupta – Tony Gupta but we 
know that you also attended the Gupta weddings at Sun 
City, correct? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry, again, Mr Seleka, I’m sorry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me just cover something because 
you’re moving away from the trip to India for now.  You 
said that you asked for a lift with Tony Gupta and then 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 78 of 138 
 
when you had to go to India from Switzerland, is that right? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that, despite the fact that you said 
your trip to India was an official trip and therefore the 
Government or your department would pay for it.  Am I 
right to say the explanation or excuse you give, why you 
didn’t 
use 
the 
Government 
flight, 
paid 
for 
by 
the 
Government is that you had a problem with your voice?   
MR ZWANE:   Yes, it is a well known fact, Chair, I used to 
struggle a lot. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, now how was it going to help you to 
travel with Tony Gupta, in terms of your voice instead of 
taking the flight that had been booked for you and that 
would be paid for by Government? 
MR ZWANE:   Chair, when that happens my – I lose my 
voice I will not be able to express myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Properly as the situation worsens, I couldn’t 
sit here and you are there, you can’t hear me, you could 
hardly hear me when you’re here. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   So, I had to strain my vocal, so I thought if I 
go and, through the commercial line I’ll have to explain 
myself, I was not well, I was sick, let me put it.  So, I 
thought – because these ones are going there, I’ll get into 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 79 of 138 
 
this private jet of theirs, arrive at India and rest.  I can’t 
remember well, Chair, if I’m correct, I think my commercial 
plane was via Dubai to India and they were going straight.  
So, I thought I’d be able to arrive and take precautions as I 
had medicine with me. So, it was a faster way of getting to 
India with the condition that I had. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because you were so sick why didn’t you 
just go back home and cancel your trip to India?  
MR ZWANE:   Chairperson, I went to Russia also.  When I 
was in Russia, I experienced the same and I had to be 
10 
operated right in Russia. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   This thing was not a thing Chair, you’ll say 
it’s a headache it will go away. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   The people of South Africa at some point, 
some radio personalities would even make jokes about me 
and my – the quality of my voice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   About the quality of? 
MR ZWANE:   My voice. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   Nobody knew that I had a throat problem, it 
was not an issue that will go away tomorrow it is a pain 
that I endured – endured during my time as a Minister 
because I was only able to get help after I was relieved of 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 80 of 138 
 
my duties as a Minister.  So, I’ve gone to a number of 
places under…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But my question is, why don’t you go 
home you are sick, why don’t you go back home and cancel 
your trip? 
MR ZWANE:   Chairperson I have said this was worsened 
by the weather. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   And every time I had to go to these cold 
places or where I have to change weathers, I had that 
10 
problem.  In all of them, Chairperson, there’s no single one 
of them that I can recall.  I remember when I was 
addressing a high delegation of Russian deputy Ministers, 
deputy President there there’s another name.  I was at my 
lowest ever, but I continued doing my job as I was 
supposed to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   So, in my mind it wouldn’t have crossed my 
mind that I should come back because it was not a shock, I 
knew that I had to manage this thing.  In fact, let me say 
20 
this Commission, if I addressed any meeting my worry was 
not about the contents, my worry was whether my voice 
would project in that meeting.  There are meetings where I 
failed to address. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 81 of 138 
 
MR ZWANE:   Because of the same condition so, it was a 
condition that I was living with it would have not helped me 
to come back and think I will be fine in the next two weeks, 
the condition was there, I had to live and continue doing 
my work. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But what was the business you were 
going to do in India? 
MR ZWANE:   I was going to meet with possible investors, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But how were you going to communicate 
10 
with them if you couldn’t talk?  So, what was the point of 
proceeding with the trip which required you to talk with 
investors when your voice was giving you such a big 
problem that you thought you shouldn’t – you wouldn’t be 
able to talk to the people at different airports if you used 
the commercial flights? 
MR ZWANE:   Chair, what I’m trying to paint – I hear what 
the Chairperson is saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, you see I just wanted to add this so 
that when you answer you can answer the whole things.  
20 
For me if the purpose of your trip to India involves 
speaking to people, investors, and your voice was – you 
were so sick and your voice, you couldn’t talk even 
somebody who is close to you would struggle, I don’t see 
why you would still proceed because you won’t be able to 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 82 of 138 
 
do what you’re supposed to do that’s why you should go 
back home, why insist on going there? 
MR ZWANE:   I had been in similar situations before Chair, 
I remember one interaction I did whilst I was in the Free 
State, I actually had to write what I’m saying in the 
meeting, I was in that meeting, I actually had to write, this 
is what I want to say and somebody would then read that 
because as I’m saying – I don’t know how to put it Chair 
this was not something that will disappear tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR ZWANE:   It was a condition I was living with, I only 
took advantage that here is a better way of arriving quicker 
in India without me straining my voice which was already 
strained, let me rest it so that when I arrive in India, at 
least I’m better. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I know that you have said, I think in your 
affidavits that when you went to Switzerland there was an 
official of the department that you went there with, is that 
correct? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was the name of that official again, 
if you are able to remember? 
MR ZWANE:   I think it’s Raphela [?]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Raphela , Mr Raphela? 
MR ZWANE:   Ja. 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 83 of 138 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what was his position at the time, 
was he a deputy DG? 
MR ZWANE:   I think he was one of the Directors involved 
in …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At the OCM? 
MR ZWANE:   No, the Regions reports to him in terms of 
mining. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR ZWANE:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And did he go with you to India? 
10 
MR ZWANE:   His specific task was to advise me on the 
issue of finding a solution to – ja, I think he went with me 
on the hindsight, I can’t remember when, but I think so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, on the particular occasion? 
MR ZWANE:   When he was responsible for Switzerland. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, but if I recall well, Chair, I think he 
accompanied me to India if I’m not wrong, I’ll have just to 
refresh my…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But now he was advising you on how to 
20 
find a solution but then he was not in the meeting in either 
of the two meetings, how does he advise you if he’s not 
here to hear what other people have to say? 
MR ZWANE:   Chair, I did not want him to be in the 
meeting for the simple reason because I didn’t want us, as 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 84 of 138 
 
DMR to be part of the decisions or sway any decisions in 
any particular direction. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   If I needed – or I was asked any question in 
terms of our role as the department I thought some of the 
issues, I may not be able to respond properly because I 
had been there since September and it was December so I 
took somebody who’s clued up in terms of issues should 
there be a need for me to commit the department, I should 
do so having taken an advice on somebody who works on 
10 
these things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But is there anything that would have 
been wrong for you to have our advisor with you at the 
meeting? 
MR ZWANE:   My advisors were pretty new Chair, like 
myself …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I’m sorry, when I say – I’m saying 
advisor but I’m referring to that official I’m not talking 
about Mr Mabaso and Mr Moodley. I’m simply saying 
advisor because you said you brought him – took him with 
20 
you to Switzerland because you wanted him to advise you, 
so that’s why I’m referring to him as an advisor in that 
context. 
MR ZWANE:   My aim was not to sit in the meeting at all, 
that is why I never sat in the meeting.  My aim was to 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 85 of 138 
 
introduce the subject and allow the parties to debate in 
case they wanted to engage DMR would have come in 
handy at that particular point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, did he end up advising you at all on 
anything in Switzerland? 
MR ZWANE:   I think when I left the meeting, even after I’d 
met Mr Glasenberg and Essa, we had our own meeting in 
terms of his view as to what would be the best way forward 
on this matter and should we be asked by any of the 
parties, at least I know, how can I approach them.  So, we 
10 
were in constant communication with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   He was there so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   Even when I left the meeting, I went to him, 
we sat down. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, in India did you, ultimately, meet 
with investors that you had intended to meet with? 
20 
MR ZWANE:   I did meet with two because in terms of days 
then my problem worsened, I had to cancel the other 
engagements. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   And – but I was operated, I thought when I 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 86 of 138 
 
come from the doctor, I would have given medicine to – but 
after I was operated then I cancelled the two. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, I met with only two possible investors. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m could they hear you? 
MR ZWANE:   They responded to what I was saying Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Under those difficult conditions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m was your assessment that they were 
struggling to hear you? 
10 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, no that’s true Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They were struggling? 
MR ZWANE:   They were struggling, in fact in most of the 
meetings I’ve attended some people, before they respond 
on what I’m saying as facts, they’ll first respond on my 
medical condition. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see we are at one minute past one.   I 
propose that we go up to – I propose that we don’t take 
20 
lunch now and that we’ll adjourn for the day at two.  Will 
everybody be able to live with that? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   My side, yes, Chair. Mr Zwane will 
have to speak for himself.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay please bear with us I think 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 87 of 138 
 
everybody will try and live with it, Mr Zwane, you – or 
…[intervenes]. 
MR ZWANE:   Chair, I think – I thought Advocate Seleka 
was speaking on our behalf. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay. 
MR ZWANE:   I would be able to live with it, but I thought a 
small break, then we’ll continue, it’s fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let’s take a ten minute break and 
then come back then maybe we’ll just do an hour after 
coming back. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue we will adjourn at 
quarter past two. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  So let me do this.  Mr 
Zwane there is an affidavit in that bundle – Eskom Bundle 19 
if you could please turn to page 353.1.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say Bundle 18? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  19 Chair.  The same bundle where Mr 
Zwane’s affidavits are. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The – it is the – it is an affidavit 
immediately after your supplementary affidavit.   
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 88 of 138 
 
MR ZWANE:  The supplementary? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR ZWANE:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Immediately after your supplementary. 
Go to the end of your supplementary affidavit.  Turn the page 
again.  Yes.  Chair that is page 353.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  353.1. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is Benjamin Theron. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair.  The Chief Operations – 
10 
Operating Officer of OUTA – Organisation on doing Tax 
Abuse.  You see that Mr Zwane?  Mr Zwane this affidavit is – 
is the – is similar to the OUTA report both of which we have 
shared with you this affidavit and that OUTA report. 
 
I want to draw your attention – so just to finish off on 
the issue of the trips to India to draw your attention to 
paragraph 31 which is on page 353.21.  May I – if I may Mr 
Zwane start on paragraph 30?   
 
Now what we are going to look at here Mr Zwane is 
the totality of what this affidavit says are your trips to Dubai 
20 
and to India at the expense of the Gupta’s and give you a 
chance to comment. 
 
I recall that you had said on some of these things – 
some of these things you see them for the first time you will 
indicate to the Chairperson which one you want to deal with 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 89 of 138 
 
in due course. 
 
Paragraph 30 says: 
“Of particular concern is the evidence of a 
kickback from the Gupta’s to Zwane and 
other 
officials 
in 
the 
department 
for 
facilitating the Estina Scheme.  In October 
2012 shortly after the launch of the Estina 
Project Zwane, officials from the department 
and a local gospel choir the Umsingizane 
Gospel Choir that Zwane promotes were 
10 
hosted on an all-expenses paid tour of India 
by the Gupta’s.” 
 
I will – I will start with that paragraph Mr Zwane and 
go through each one of them and give you a chance to 
comment quickly.   
 
I know you deal with this in your affidavit could you 
please tell the Chairperson what is your comment to that 
allegation. 
MR ZWANE:  No thanks Chairperson. Let me indicate up 
front that my view is that I am going to assist the 
20 
commission on all the matters that were raised before me by 
the 
commission 
except 
for 
information 
and 
opinions 
particularly by Mr Benjamin Theron on the information 
extorted from the leaks. 
 
I would not want to vouch for them as they are not 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 90 of 138 
 
verified and I do not want to victimise them.  But on all the 
issues especially on issues like this which was asked before 
I am willing to assist this commission.  I just do not want to 
fall prey to legitimising something that I do not know where it 
comes from – something that seems illegal in terms of how it 
was discovered. 
 
I thought I should make that point. I will – I will 
indicate when I come to such points. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ZWANE:  And if allowed then I will make my comment. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes please. 
MR ZWANE:  Chairperson maybe it is important that I should 
give this commission information that the Vrede Dairy 
because this is about Vrede Dairy.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but maybe let us break up the 
questions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there a choir that you were associated 
with in the Free State that travelled to India at some stage? 
MR ZWANE:  Chairperson I do not own a choir. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ZWANE:  As an executive Mayor in the Free State I did 
participate in youth development which was called social 
00:06:33 at that point and part of the – my partaking was to 
assist all these poor artists from various places in the 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 91 of 138 
 
district and on the 10t h of  August 2008 a choir was formed 
by the name of Umsingizane as Advocate has read it.  It is 
choir that is independent away from me that does its 
business like any other NGO will do.   
 
I think I have tried to give … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So are you saying you have no association 
with that choir Umsingeze? 
MR ZWANE:  Umsingizane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Umsingizane or do you accept that you 
have a certain – some association in which case you could 
10 
tell us what the nature of that association is.  I know you 
have said you do not own it but that might not be the only 
possible association. 
MR ZWANE:  My association with it is that I helped from 
them and in their quest of what we recording I myself also as 
an artist before I had experienced difficulties with my voice I 
have two songs with the choir.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR ZWANE:  Ja.  That is my – the association. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so you helped from the choir. 
20 
MR ZWANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you – you sang two songs with – there 
are two songs. 
MR ZWANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In which you were involved. 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 92 of 138 
 
MR ZWANE:  In their album ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Oh in their album they have got two. 
MR ZWANE:  In their album. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Album there are two songs. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where you are involved – which you were 
involved in. 
MR ZWANE:  Which I was involved ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR ZWANE:  Which I was involved yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Did you sponsor the choir at some 
stage or another or not really? 
MR ZWANE:  I have never sponsored this choir Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ZWANE:  The choir has always looked out for sponsors 
independently. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ZWANE:  From anybody. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ZWANE:  All this time. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And did this choir as far as you 
know take – undertake a trip to India at some stage? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes they did Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They did.  And was that in 2012/2013? 
MR ZWANE:  I think it was 2012. 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 93 of 138 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  2012.  Do – did you have any role to play 
or any activities you engaged in to assist them in – with their 
trip or to support their trip or support them in going to India? 
MR ZWANE:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No. 
MR ZWANE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not speak to anybody to assist 
them in any way? 
MR ZWANE:  No I did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  They went on their own and they 
10 
came back? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  And do you know how they 
were sponsored by any chance? 
MR ZWANE:  No Chair I – I do not know.  I have never asked 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ZWANE:  Ja I have never asked them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Mr Zwane please turn to page 
20 
353.129.  It is way – way.. 
MR ZWANE:  Oh page 129? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja 353.129.  You will see it is an 
annexure marked NJZ18 – 18 
MR ZWANE:  Thank you.   
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 94 of 138 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  NJZ18. 
MR ZWANE:  You said 129. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is right. 
MR ZWANE:  I am there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Now you will see there are emails there. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  There is an email from – now Chair I 
need to explain where you find that one.  If you start at the 
top of the page there is an email from Ashu sent Saturday 
October 13.  If you go after that – below that you will see 
10 
one from Ashok Narayan dated 13 October 2012 to Ashu.  
And you go further down you see the subject sent from i-
Phone begin forwarded message and then there is an email 
from M Zwane- zwanemail@gmail.com.  You see that? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Now the time stamp is important because 
then 
your 
– 
the 
email 
with 
the 
email 
address 
zwanemail@gmail.com is dated October – 13 October 2012 
the time stamp is 2:46:56pm so you lost two hours and this 
email is to Ashok Narayan the subject is Re- which means 
20 
reply detailed itinerary and it says: 
“Hi herewith rooming list as expected.” 
And then it indicates non-sharing, it gives a list 1 to 7 of the 
names of people. 
No. 1 is M J Zwane,  Just before I go into the details of the 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 95 of 138 
 
email do you have anything to say about the email address 
zwanemail@gmail.com?  Is that your email address? 
MR ZWANE:  I think this was my email address yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It was you email? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Was this an email from you to Mr Ashok 
Narayan? 
MR ZWANE:  I have not interacted with Ashok Narayan. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
MR ZWANE:  I remember I think about three – four 
10 
occasions where I had to assist the choir in terms of 
communication methods because at that particular time most 
of them were not working. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR ZWANE:  I did – I did that particular time allow a member 
who was responsible. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR ZWANE:  For fundraising and communication by the 
choir as he told me to use my gadget.  I do not know the 
details in terms of what were – were the details for. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Can – can we take it that you are 
saying that you – this email either was or may have been 
sent from… 
MR ZWANE:  My. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your computer or your cell phone, is that 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 96 of 138 
 
correct? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say it would have been sent by a 
member of the choir who asked – whom you allowed to use 
your computer.  Is that right? 
MR ZWANE:  That is right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Okay Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Thank you Chair. So that email then 
indicates on the face of it and as we read from that affidavit 
the names of those persons who will not share a room at a 
10 
hotel which is the first list of seven names and then the 
second list of ten names are the list of names of persons 
who will share rooms at the hotel when they are in India.  Is 
that correct? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes I see that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Is M J Zwane the first one – number 
1 non-sharing is that yourself? 
MR ZWANE:  I am M J Zwane yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes is that yourself on that list? 
MR ZWANE:  I think it is – it is me. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  So this on the face of it Mr Zwane 
seems to be an email in the context of arrangements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe let us – maybe Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just so that in the transcript it will come up 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 97 of 138 
 
let us say. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have already said – given the email 
address from which the email came and the date was 
October 13, 2012 seems to have been sent at 2:46 pm and it 
was addressed to Ashok Narayan and the email address is 
given there the subject is Detailed Itinerary and you read the 
first part Hi herewith rooming list as expected and then 
seven names are given under that and they are given under 
a heading that says non-sharing which seems to suggest that 
10 
those seven people were not going to share rooms and then 
the – then there is a list of ten which is under a heading that 
says Sharing which I take to mean they were going to share 
rooms and at the end of that it say Regards Inno – I-n-n-o. 
Do you know who Inno is? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who was he or she? 
MR ZWANE:  She was an official of the department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She was an official of the department? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is her surname? 
MR ZWANE:  I think 00:17:53 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it Innocent maybe. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Innocent 00:17:57. 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 98 of 138 
 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. So this would suggest that she is the 
one who sent the – who wrote the email.  Was she part of 
the choir? 
MR ZWANE:  No she was not part of the choir Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ZWANE:  She did not travel with the choir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ZWANE:  I also did not travel with the choir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR ZWANE:  Under normal circumstances I would have – I 
would have thought as I have said I have two songs with the 
choir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ZWANE:  I would have thought that the choir thought I 
will participate in this trip in terms of performing.  I did not 
go with the choir.  I was not part of the arrangement.  There 
is evidence that I went to India.  It was an official trip that 
was paid for by the Department of Agriculture and Rural 
Development information to that expense there. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you – you mention your trip to India – 
official trip is that because that trip happened at the same 
time as the trip of the choir or otherwise why you mentioning 
it in the context? 
MR ZWANE:  It was – it was during 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 99 of 138 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Same trip, same time. 
MR ZWANE:  It was during the same time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR ZWANE:  I learnt – whilst I had already arranged my trip 
because after my – my budget speech we had divided 
projects in terms of regions.  I know we had to go to China to 
– for fish farming which ultimately was supported by China 
and we were on a spree to look for investors.  So that trip 
was planned.  We went to India on that particular days. Me 
and my officials met with potential investors but to come 
10 
back to your point Chair it was around the same time when 
the choir was going to India. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  I assume you know the 
members of the – the names of the members of the choir 
because you sang two songs with them. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes I know them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know them. 
MR ZWANE:  Ja I know them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You – you – if you look at the names on 
that email at page 353.129 other than yourself are the rest of 
20 
the names members of the choir?  There is T I Motawung, 
well A Narayan was not a member of the choir was he – was 
she? 
MR ZWANE:  I – I take it that A Narayan is Ashok. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is Ashok yes.   
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 100 of 138 
 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he was not a member of the choir was 
he? 
MR ZWANE:  No he was not a member of the choir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  So he was written there.  C 
N Radebe, M E Moekena, M P Mabaso. Is M P Mabaso the 
same Mabaso we talked about who became your advisor or 
is it another one? 
MR ZWANE:  No – no.   
CHAIRPERSON:  It is another one? 
10 
MR ZWANE:  It is a female Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh it is a female okay alright. 
MR ZWANE:  This is a female. 
CHAIRPERSON:  M N Mutawung? 
MR ZWANE:  Which page is the Chair reading? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The same one page 353.129. 
MR ZWANE:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja same one well we – that is the email. 
MR ZWANE:  Oh, oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the middle there is a whole list there. 
20 
MR ZWANE:  Okay.  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  And then it says sharing.  M T 
Zwane/T B Tshabalala,  
MR ZWANE: Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  N P Zwane/ N L Radebe, K F Malake/M S 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 101 of 138 
 
Nkuta, N P Sondesi/T M Tshabalala, D M Korma/N A Mvuntle, 
M A Mabe/D M Rancho, K J Buts/T A Sibiya, F L Tomo/M C 
Mosea, T J Matjela/M P Tshabalala, T P Motdlamini/ S T 
Msamanga.  Other than yourself, M J Zwane, A Narayan were 
– are the rest of the people mentioned in that list members 
of the choir? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Do you know why your name 
and Narayan’s name were put there if you were not going 
with the – with the choir?  Well I do not know was Narayan 
10 
going with the choir as far as you know? 
MR ZWANE:  I – I cannot recall properly Chair but it is 
possible that he … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is possible. 
MR ZWANE:  Ja I think it is possible that he went with the 
choir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay well I do remember that when Mr 
Thabetha went with him to India he gave evidence that I 
think he said you – you suggested that he should go with him 
because he would understand the culture in India and so on 
20 
so – so I do not know whether he was included for that 
purpose here or not.  You do not know anything about 
whether – why he would have been included here? 
MR ZWANE:  Chair maybe – maybe I think I should take – 
correct the first version. 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 102 of 138 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ZWANE:  So that we come to this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ZWANE:  Narayan was appointed in the province as part 
of the advisory special counsel of the Premier.  Any trip that 
was to go outside there was an understanding that after 
having made a request there was a department in the 
Premier’s department that was called International Relations.  
They will look into the country you are going and they would 
suggest who accompanies the delegation that is going. So 
10 
that has been a norm in the Free State.   
 
When it comes to this issue I have indicated that I 
was not part of the arrangement to India – the choir’s 
arrangement.  I may not know the details.  I knew that they 
informed me that they will be in India on such and such a 
time and the – I indicated that should I find time in my 
business schedule because I would be there I will – I will 
also 
endeavour 
just 
to 
come 
and 
support 
whatever 
endeavours they are doing and I think that is – that is all 
what I know.   As to the arrangement who was where and so 
20 
forth I do not know the details. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And why would a government official have 
in your department have got involved in sending emails 
about who is going to share rooms with who when 
1. She was not part of the choir. 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 103 of 138 
 
2. You were not supporting the choir in the arrangements 
for the trip. 
Why would an official in your department get involved in 
that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have – I had indicated earlier on Chair 
that I did assist the choir in terms of their communication.  I 
think on several occasions and I would – I would assume 
that this is one of those rare moments where there will be 
communication needed and the choir will then be assisted 
through the means that I had opened. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But are you saying that out of all the 
members of the choir there would be nobody there who 
would be able to send either an email or a whatsapp 
message or a letter or a fax to somebody about the trip and 
they would need to come to your department just for the 
sending of an email? 
MR ZWANE:  Chair this was 2012. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ZWANE:  And I do not want to vouch but the situation as 
it obtained during that time I have indicated that I was 
20 
approached on several times and I did not go into details 
because it was not a major issue for me for somebody to 
request for my i-pad or computer to send some information.  
I did not see the problematic at a particular time.  Because 
these are the people I know after all.  Ja. 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 104 of 138 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean they were sending an email to – 
they needed to send an email to Ashok Narayan for a 
detailed itinerary.  And actually it says the detailed itinerary 
but basically it was a list of names who will share rooms who 
will not share rooms that could have been sent via 00:28:47.  
That could have been sent by one 00:28:49.  Did not have to 
send an email – you cannot say much about that? 
MR ZWANE:  Chair I would – I would not have an answer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ZWANE:  That – that is precise as I am saying should I 
10 
have seen an issue that would have taken me to this 
commission today I am sure I would have got to those details 
while I – why is using my gadget and so forth and so on.  I 
remember at some point if I was nearby and they needed to 
confirm would I – I will give them my phone.  Please make 
your call bring my phone.  It was not an issue which I would 
interrogate as though I foreseeing any other issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But this was a - Mr Zwane that was so 
advanced that it already had two [word cut] it is not – they 
cannot not have ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   For the meeting(?), yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...that idea(?).  All of them?  It cannot 
be.   
MR ZWANE:   Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I mean, it cannot be. 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 105 of 138 
 
MR ZWANE:   Chair, in the industry of music, there are 
many artists who are well-known, who when they appear 
here or anything that because of their fame of a particular 
song or 15 albums they are well-off.  That is not the case.  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   If you see the number of people in here, it 
means they have to meet and practise and do all these 
things 
which 
cost 
money. 
 
Others 
are 
living 
in 
Bloemfontein.  Others in Bethlehem.  Other in Memel.  All 
those details which are not appearing here, I would not 
10 
really say in this Commission these people are well-off.  I 
do not think so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, nobody is says that. 
MR ZWANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Necessarily they are well-off but you 
want to send a message to I am shopping around and tell 
him who in the list of ...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   Would not share ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...who would not share. 
[Speakers intervening each other – unclear] 
20 
MR ZWANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I do not think Mr Narayan was 
necessarily going to say:  No, no, no.  I want it in an email 
and not in a Whatsapp message.  I mean, you just want to 
know who would share, who will not share.  That is all. 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 106 of 138 
 
MR ZWANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And then the email gets to be 
forwarded 
by 
Mr 
Ashok 
Narayan 
to 
Mr 
Ashu 
at 
sahara.co.za.  You see that Mr Zwane? 
MR ZWANE:   Where is that Chair? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is the portion just above your 
name.  Just above the email that comes from you. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
MR ZWANE:   Okay? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   By the way, who is Mr Narayan? 
MR ZWANE:   Ashu?  Ashok? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, Ashok.  Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did he have any connection with 
Sahara? 
MR ZWANE:   With Sahara? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Ashok? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was he – do you know, was he 
associated in any way with the Guptas or any of their 
entities? 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 107 of 138 
 
MR ZWANE:   I know Ashok to be an advisor in the office of 
– part of the Advisory Council in the Office of the Premier.  
That is how I started knowing him.  I have interacted with 
him on this time on that capacity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Up to know, that is all you knew 
about him?  You did not know of any association he might 
have had with the Guptas or any of their entities? 
MR ZWANE:   No, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes.  As the leaks and many other stories 
took place, they linked him with the Guptas. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR ZWANE:   So he better says up to now.  I now have an 
understanding that he was linked to the Guptas. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   In terms of all this information that is 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But at that time ...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...you say you did not know? 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 108 of 138 
 
MR ZWANE:   I knew him to be part of the Special Advisory 
Council ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   To the Premier? 
MR ZWANE:   ...to the Premier. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Why – what was the reason for 
communicating with him here in particular? 
MR ZWANE:   Chair, I have indicated that the best I know 
10 
is that I had allowed a member of the choir to send their 
names.  I was not involved in terms of the arrangements.  
So I would not have the details. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  But I think I am asking a different 
question which is.  Why is he involved in this arrangement?  
Why is the email sent to him?  And I see yours is actually – 
or coming from your iPad.  It is actually a reply.  So there 
would have been an incoming email to which this one was 
replying to.  So why is Mr Ashok Narayan involved in this 
arrangement? 
20 
MR ZWANE:   I would be speculating. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You do not know? 
MR ZWANE:   I do not know. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then he forwards the email to 
Mr Ashu at sahara.co.za.  I will ask the same question.  
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 109 of 138 
 
For what reason?  Do you know? 
MR ZWANE:   No, I do not know. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So is this Sahara, the Sahara 
Computers which was owned by the Guptas? 
MR ZWANE:   I did know it at that time but the information 
as it places itself in the public domain, that is a fact. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So are you saying Mr Narayan 
would have travelled with the choir which you were part of 
and you would not know why this email was sent to him? 
MR ZWANE:   Travel with the choir? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To India. 
MR ZWANE:   Which made its own arrangement outside my 
knowledge.  So I would not know the details thereof. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So your knowledge of this arrangement 
will be limited to you offering your iPad to Ms Enucentia(?) 
Motorum(?) to reply to this email which would have been 
an email address to you at zwane@gmail.com? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So he would have seen that email? 
MR ZWANE:   As I have indicated, Chair, earlier on.  I had 
20 
allowed my Gmail to be used by the choir.  In terms of the 
content and what was going on, I would not know. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Now I have just counted the 
names on this page.  It is 27 persons.  Please turn...  Well, 
let me just complete this before you turn.  Then Mr Ashu at 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 110 of 138 
 
Sahara Computers, at the top of the page, he then 
forwards this information with the sharing and non-sharing, 
the names to some person or two persons, rather.  It 
seems to be the hotel in India.  I see odiraygroup.com(?).  
The other one is sesindia.com.  Room sharing details.  Do 
you see that? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  So on the face of it, Sahara 
seems to have been the interface between the choir and 
the hotel in India.  Do you understand what I am saying? 
10 
MR ZWANE:   I hear what you are saying Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  On the face of it.   
MR ZWANE:   If you look at that email, ps(?). 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes? 
MR ZWANE:   But in terms of my knowledge, as I have 
said, I would not have known this information until it is 
read to me now. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So does it mean members of your 
choir would have known without you knowing, would have 
known about Mr Narayan, Ashu Group, Ashu – what is his 
20 
surname? 
MR ZWANE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Ashu? 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is Ashu Chawla.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chawla.  That is correct.  Thank you, 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 111 of 138 
 
Chair. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   They ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Am I right, Mr Zwane? 
MR ZWANE:   Chair, I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Ashu ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chawla. 
MR ZWANE:   No, I do not know this person. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay ...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   I do not know this person. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Well, there has been a lot of 
evidence before me about him ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...and other people.  That is why I am 
...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think Ashu is Ashu Chawla. 
20 
MR ZWANE:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think you are correct, Chair.  So there 
would have been certain members of the choir that you had 
– who would have know these individuals who are linked to 
the Guptas without you knowing that they have knowledge 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 112 of 138 
 
of such of these persons.  Is that what you are saying to 
the Chairperson? 
MR ZWANE:   Let me speculate because I can see 
Advocate wants me to say something.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Do not speculate.  [laughs]   
MR ZWANE:   Okay.  But I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just tell me what you know. 
MR ZWANE:   Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MR ZWANE:   I have already said in the beginning that the 
10 
arrangement by the choir, I was not involved.  I have said 
that I know.  I was told by the choir that they were going to 
India.  It means at that particular time they told me they 
were ready to go to Indian in terms of preparations but that 
is when I said:  If my schedule permits, I will come and 
support you.  Right?   
 
I have indicated that I had given consent that my 
address(?) should be used by the choir.  Now the issue I 
am trying to raise with the Advocate, with all humility and 
due respect, is that the answer he be giving, I am not sure 
20 
about it.  I am speculating that if I request an assistance of 
lunch in this Commission ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that because – slight hour? 
MR ZWANE:   No, I am saying ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...that you were ...[intervenes]  
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 113 of 138 
 
MR ZWANE:   ...ask for ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...example. 
[Speakers intervening each other – unclear] 
MR ZWANE:   If I were to ask that we are catered for lunch 
in this Commission, the answer I will get from the Chair is 
that:  No, that is possible.  Let us look into it.  We will 
come back to you.  If that is possible, the Chair will come 
to me and come back and say:  On the 27 t h of April, 
especially because it is a public holiday, it is Freedom Day, 
you will be catered for lunch.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR ZWANE:   Will I ever ask:  Who did you talk to beyond 
you?  Normally, I would not.  My request has been 
answered.  I am happy.  Thus this speculation I am 
bringing about the choir that this sophistication(?) that we 
– the level at which we are, I do not think, honestly, 
ordinary people from the Free State will get to those 
details.  After this one, we have asked the help from – he 
knows that one.  This was the arrange – no, they will not.  
That is the speculation I am trying to bring.  I am not too 
20 
sure Chair but I am thinking so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Now I we can go to the next 
stage, Mr Zwane. 
MR ZWANE:   Thank you. 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 114 of 138 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which is my marked MJZ-19, page 
353.137.  The...  Okay.  Just to make sense of it again.  
There is the email at the top of the page from Ashu. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the next page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, the next page. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, the next page you deal with, not the 
page immediately after the one you were dealing with? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is immediately after the next page 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Immediately after the one we were 
dealing with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe there are two pages that look the 
same because I was not looking at...  You said 137 now? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   One...  No, 130.  353.130. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you did not say 130 because I was at 
130. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, you were – oh. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
I 
was 
expecting 
you 
to 
say 
...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You were ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...point 30. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you said another page.  So that is 
why I had to ask. 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 115 of 138 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How is that the next page?  Because the 
page I am expecting you to go to is 130 and you are not 
saying 130.  So I think in your mind you may have intended 
to say 130 but you said another page, I think. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  I think the Chair is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay 130.  That is fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, Chair was ahead was of us.  
10 
Mr Zwane ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, you see, the page that we were 
looking at ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...is 353.129. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the one that has got names. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In the meantime, while you were asking 
questions, I have already looked at 130. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   131, 132, 133, 134 and 135.  And I was 
quite interested in what I see at 134 and 135. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, but I went back to this page.  So 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 116 of 138 
 
when you said let us look at the next page, I am looking – I 
am thinking okay that is one page but ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...I heard you to be saying something 
else.  [laughs]   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But okay we are at 130.  It is fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   One... Yes, thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   130.  Oh, I said it is the one marked 
10 
MJZ-19.  I think that is what the Chair heard.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Ja, I do not know.  I thought it 
was something like 35 or 37. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let us start at the top of the page 
Mr Zwane just to get the sequence of these emails.  At the 
top of the page there is an email from Ashu again, 
ashu@sahara. 
 
Below 
that, 
the 
email 
is 
dated 
10 October 2012.  Below that is an email from Narej(?) 
20 
Kosla(?) sent on Wednesday, 10 October 2012 to Ashu with 
the subject:  ITI Indian 27 passenger details.  And he says: 
“Dear 
sir. 
 
Please 
find 
attached 
the 
confirmation I am giving to Man Travels.   
Please check the prices once. 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 117 of 138 
 
I will try to negotiate if he agrees to conduct 
the Kingdom of Dreams within 8 to 10K to 
avoid any hustles. 
Please revert if you confirm – I will confirm 
for...? 
 
And there is a list, KB(?) and all that...  Now this 
is the itinerary Mr Zwane.  T3 to New Delhi, Arageway(?) 
Station, vehicle required to 00:30(?) a.m. on 16 October 
for RS 7500 plus tax plus parking for charges.  So that is 
A. 
10 
 
Then there is B.  And then the list goes on.  You 
see – required to drop the group from Poporay(?) – I do 
not know what the name is there to T3 Terminal Airport.   
 
Then there is D.  Luxury Volvo required, and 
then it goes on.  There is one I want to ask you about 
Mr Zwane, which is – if you read from the bottom, line 1, 2, 
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. 10, 11, 12, 13.  Which is 14:00.  Lunch 
at Mr Gupta.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Lunch at Mr Gupta house. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   At Mr Gupta house. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you see that? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The number of passengers here, 27, 
matches the number by calculators on the previous page. 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 118 of 138 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which includes M J Zwane. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Narayan.  So on the face of it, this 
is an email from Narej Osle(?) to Ashu and it is about the 
trip to India for the 27 passengers and it gives details and 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   [Speaker unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And there is an itinerary which includes, 
it would appear, that the choir would have lunch at 
Mr Gupta’s house at 14:00 on the 16 t h of October.   
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [Speaker unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  You say you know nothing about 
this itinerary and what the choir was going to do, where 
they were going to eat lunch, when and so on? 
MR ZWANE:   I can say it in this Commission, Chair that I 
have not attended lunch with the Guptas.  I have not gone 
to their weddings.  I have seen this leaks.  I am dealing 
with this one because it was part of – I have not done that 
as it is said here.  I was not part of that lunch.  I would not 
know why this is like this and I do not want to speculate.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Did you meet with the choir in 
India? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, I think I did.  They were singing in some 
big temple.  After the – I went – I think I was there less 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 119 of 138 
 
than two hours because I had to go and prepare for the 
afternoon engagement, yes.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the itinerary as set out here, you 
did not take the part in the activities that are identified 
here? 
MR ZWANE:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And the – let us go back to the 
affidavit which is the affidavit of Mr Trum(?) 
10 
MR ZWANE:   Okay? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Oh, I will go back to those 
paragraphs now.  I am going into the detail of other 
allegations.  It is on page ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well...  Yes, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Page 353.22. 
MR ZWANE:   Point 22? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   353.22.  You remember that affidavit 
...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Paragraph 32.  It says: 
“Following his trip to India in October 2012, 
Zwane enjoyed subsequent trips to India and 
Dubai which were arranged and paid for by the 
Gupta family. 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 120 of 138 
 
This include: 
a. The trip to India in December 2013 to attend 
a wedding with Ashok Narayan, an Executive 
of 
the 
Gupta 
company, 
Sahara 
Systems, 
members of the Gupta family and Chandrama 
Prasad Yadav, the farm manager of the Vrede 
Dairy Project...” 
 
On that last name, do you recognise the name, 
Chandrama Prasad Yadav, the Farm Manager of the Vrede 
Dairy Project? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   What paragraph are you reading from? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   32. 
CHAIRPERSON:   A? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, 32(a). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would you have known the farm manager 
of Vrede Diary Project?  
MR ZWANE:   At that time no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At that time you did not know? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not know him.  Did you 
20 
subsequently know him? 
MR ZWANE:   I went to the dairy when this thing – rumours 
started. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   And my name was thrown around. 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 121 of 138 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR ZWANE:   I met with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR ZWANE:   Wanting to know what are the details.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   Are the beneficiaries looked after.  When he 
was already there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay. 
MR ZWANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The trip – about the trip to India, 
December 2012.  2013, I beg your pardon.  To attend a 
wedding.  Do you – or your comment on that Mr Zwane? 
MR ZWANE:   I will repeat myself Chair.  I have not 
attended any Gupta wedding whether in South Africa or 
anywhere else.  I am putting it on record here. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh.  So, that emphasis – it reminds me 
the Sun City wedding.  Is that what you are ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So you did not attend the Sun City 
wedding? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, it is saying here I did attend.  In fact 
...[intervenes]  
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 122 of 138 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, well, let us go to the – let us go, 
Mr Seleka to MJ-222, is it not?  Is that not the one that 
corresponds to that? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair.  Mr Zwane, let us go there.  
That is on page 353.135.   
MR ZWANE:   135? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not know whether the previous page 
is 
connected 
with 
it 
as 
well 
or 
whether 
that 
is 
10 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, no that is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, that is another ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is a B, Chair.  That relates to 
paragraph B. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that relates to B. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Ja, 
because 
this 
one 
is 
December 2013.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, MJ-22 that is page 353.135.  
Mr Zwane, that appears to be – is it your ticket?  Oh, 
ticket.  And it has got your name, Zwane Mosebenzi Josef.  
It is dated 11 September 2014.  It says Flight EK766, 
Emirates, Class:  First Class, Depart:  22:13 in the 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 123 of 138 
 
evening, O.R. Tambo International Airport to – and you 
were going to arrive in Duba at twenty past eight in the 
morning, Dubai International Airport.  And then flying time 
is eight hours.  That is 13 September.   
 
And then 14 September 2014, according to this, 
your flight was BK516.  Again, it is Emirates.  And it is 
First Class.  And it was going to depart at quarter to ten 
from Dubai International Airport to India, Indira Gandhi 
International in India where you would arrive at twenty to 
three the following day which is...  No, no, no.  It is the 
10 
same day.  Did I get that right, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair you are.  I am looking at 
another page Chair.  [laughs]   
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Mr Zwane, can you see that 
page? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It has got your name. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, I did see. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In effect, it says you are going to take a 
flight from O.R. Tambo in South Africa at twenty past ten 
20 
on the 13 t h of December 2014. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You would arrive in Dubai in the morning 
the following day twenty past eight. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 124 of 138 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then at quarter to ten, you take a 
flight to – from Dubai to Delhi in India.  You would arrive 
there at twenty two three. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And so, are you saying – and your seat 
is supposed to have been 1E.   
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you saying that did not happen? 
MR ZWANE:   No, Chair I think let me upfront say.  As I 
indicated earlier on in terms of me finding the leaks, this 
10 
was part of the information I talked about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You? 
MR ZWANE:   This was part of the information I talked 
about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, h’m? 
MR ZWANE:   We have agreed with my lawyer that it will 
be fruitless of me to go in details with this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR ZWANE:   Information that has not been verified. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
20 
MR ZWANE:   Although I am tempted Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR ZWANE:   Maybe I should also address the issue of the 
Outa document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 125 of 138 
 
MR ZWANE:   It has been of public knowledge for some 
time, yes.  But not to these details. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR ZWANE:   I think we should agree.  Some of the details 
even in the pack that I have received are not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR ZWANE:   I was [word cut] enough to get the original 
document what it was couched by OUTA way back in 2017 
and its real intentions, to remove the President and so 
forth and those who are purported to be linked with the 
10 
Guptas and I was one of them.  So I know …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I think they gave to all members of 
parliament. 
MR ZWANE:   No, it was not given to all members of 
parliament. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, that is what they say. 
MR ZWANE:   No, no, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   I was a member of parliament, I did not 
receive it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR ZWANE:   I received it from somebody on the street. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR ZWANE:   But there is nothing I was not to shy away 
from that, Chair, except to say in cases where information 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 126 of 138 
 
has been obtained in our view in a manner that is not 
clear, we felt that we should not come to this Commission 
and come an authenticate something that we do not know, 
save to say all my trips, including this trip to India and 
other places where I took official engagement, they were 
paid for by the department which I was serving.  I have 
said that earlier on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you say this trip are you talking 
about the one referred to on this page? 
MR ZWANE:   I am not talking about this trip, I think I 
10 
should have been in India, I cannot remember, but I am 
saying there is not trip pertaining me that was paid by the 
Guptas or that I went to the Guptas and asked them to pay 
for me when I was a leader in any department.  I have 
actually not asked anybody for a favour.  So I may not want 
to get into details on these issues because of the reasons 
that I have raised and I raised those reasons with all 
humility and altruism. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Utmost respect, Sir. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but let us leave that aside.  I can 
ask you whether you flew from Oliver Tambo on 13 
September 2014 to Dubai or not, September 2014.  Leave 
out what the document says.  If I just put that question, 
what is your answer? 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 127 of 138 
 
MR ZWANE:   My answer would be it is possible that I flew. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is possible that you… 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  If you did go is it also possible 
that from Dubai you proceeded to India? 
MR ZWANE:   It is possible, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is possible. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And if you did go, would this information  
be within the department – or you were MEC at the time, is 
10 
that right? 
MR ZWANE:   MEC of… 
CHAIRPERSON:   2014. 
MR ZWANE:   Economic …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That was just before you became a 
minister. 
MR ZWANE:   A year before. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR ZWANE:   A year before. 
CHAIRPERSON:   A year before, okay, ja.  Okay. 
20 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so would that information, would 
those records be in that department about officials trips 
that you took? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, they will, Chair. 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 128 of 138 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Would there be any private 
or personal trips that you took to Dubai and/or India that 
would not obviously have been paid for by the department? 
MR ZWANE:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No. 
MR ZWANE:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It would only have been official trips that 
you took. 
MR ZWANE:   Ja, it will only be official trips, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Do you know whether your 
10 
department used different travel agents to make bookings 
or whether it used a particular travel agent that it used? 
MR ZWANE:   What I know, Chair, thank you, is that in the 
Free State we used to have travelling agents.  If I am not 
mistaken, that particular process was then centralised at 
some point, that is the department will use this travelling 
agent and that one will use this one otherwise when we 
arrived there was that arrangement of travelling agents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I see that this ticket bears the name 
Travel – and I think it is Travel Excellence but I am saying 
20 
that because of others that I have seen, does that – would 
you have known what the name of travel agent was or is 
that something that you would not have known? 
MR ZWANE:   No, I Chair, I would not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not know those details. 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 129 of 138 
 
MR ZWANE:   Those are details – once the department has 
been made aware that so and so needs to travel to this 
destination they then make arrangements for that to 
happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Mr Seleka, I see we have 
gone beyond quarter past. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I saw that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Is there one or two questions you 
want to ask before we adjourn? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, just to confirm.  Mr Zwane, by this 
10 
time I see that you were the MEC for Agriculture and Rural 
Development, your period there is 31 March 2011 to 29 
April 2013.  Well, 2012 falls within there. 
MR ZWANE:   Can I answer, Chair? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   I was an MEC of Agriculture in 2011, I think 
around March, late February, up until 2013, March.  April I 
was no longer. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, no it is fine but the 2012, this clip 
would fall within the time when you were the MEC. 
20 
MR ZWANE:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   For Agriculture.  And this is not a 
question, just to confirm with you – I think page 353 – 134, 
where you see an email exchange between Halima Allana 
Thursday, 11 September 2014.  Do you see that? 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 130 of 138 
 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, I see that, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The document is marked MJZ21. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, I see. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  That is Travel Excellence, 
Halima@travelexcellence.co.za. The attachments are given 
there and that includes Zwane 13 September PDF, which I 
think is this air ticket on the next page.  Do you see that? 
MR ZWANE:   I see it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Could it be that your department may 
have used this travel agent but you do not know? 
10 
MR ZWANE:   Chair, maybe I should just ask, with respect, 
that has my request been granted? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which one? 
MR ZWANE:   Of not commenting on this information. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well – but when you are asked whether 
you know something or not you know if you know it, you do 
not know if you do not know it, Mr Zwane. 
MR ZWANE:   No, Chair, I humbly agree – a bit of problem 
with this, as I have indicated, Chair, I really feel that I am 
being used to authenticate issues of the Guptas that I am 
20 
not part of and I do not want to do that.  With all honesty I 
have committed myself to help this Commission on my 
behalf, not on any particular individual.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   And I am humbly requesting to this 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 131 of 138 
 
Commission that that please should be considered. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   I do not want to say at a later stage I had to 
give this information under duress. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no, no. 
MR ZWANE:   I do not want to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me cut you short, Mr Zwane. 
MR ZWANE:   Okay, thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because it is a point you have made 
already.   
10 
MR ZWANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   One, Mr Seleka, I realise that there is an 
Ashu Bai, so maybe where I said it should be – where I 
thought it was Assure Travel, I maybe – it was not Assure 
Travel, I have got Ashu Bai I see at 353.134 that email that 
refers – that says Dear Ashu Bai, so that is just by the way. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think what we should do – well, Mr 
Zwane, let me say this information is available – I think 
that it would be useful if we could get an affidavit that 
20 
looks at all these things that are contained in this affidavit 
as well as the OUTA document.  There if you want to take 
the point that on this one I am not responding because of 
whatever, whatever, I will leave that to you for now, okay?  
But I can tell you that the legal team of the Commission is 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 132 of 138 
 
going to be quite soon taking steps to ensure that the hard 
drive that we announced already in 2019 the Commission 
obtained which will help authenticate a lot of emails that 
came from the Gupta Leaks.  Soon they will take steps to 
make 
sure 
that 
it 
is 
admitted 
properly 
before 
the 
Commission and the emails are authenticated.  That is 
point one. 
 
Point two, the Travel Excellence – because I think 
this is the travel agent that was used here, I think it is 
because I see the name of the person who sent the email 
10 
on the page before the ticket on page 353.134, Halima 
Allana, is one of the people at Travel Excellence.  She has 
already given an affidavit before the Commission in respect 
of other people of whom that travel agent made bookings, 
okay?   
And there is another one who works with her who 
has also made an affidavit and shown bookings that were 
made for certain people.  I will ask Mr Seleka to make 
arrangements to see whether they are able to depose to 
affidavits that tell us about this ticket and these emails and 
20 
so on. 
I know that they did say that some of their records 
got destroyed but others were saved, were not destroyed.  
So we will do that.  So my advice to you is that take this 
opportunity to make sure that your side of the story is 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 133 of 138 
 
added and is told because there might not be another 
chance 
because 
of 
the 
time 
constraints 
that 
the 
Commission has.  If you do not tell your side of the story it 
may well be that the Commission will place, you know, 
weight on some of these things and if you have not told 
your story, your side of the story, you might be prejudiced.  
I am mentioning that – obviously you can take legal advice 
from your legal team and act and make a decision but I am 
just alerting you that you might not tell your side of the 
story only to find that the Commission looks at the emails, 
10 
looks at the tickets and says there is nothing wrong in 
taking into account what is said or, I mean, the ladies from 
travel agents have already indicated in regard to the other 
bookings that they made involving other people.   
I have already said to Mr Seleka they must e called 
to come and give evidence orally about those bookings and 
there is no reason why they cannot give evidence about 
this booking, for example.   
So I am just mentioning that so that when you take 
legal advice you are aware of that and then you take it – 
20 
you can then take a decision how you respond in an 
affidavit.  So that is what I would like you and your legal 
team to look at.  In other words, take the OUTA document 
and I think Mr Seleka should maybe just, if they have not 
done so already, identify the parts of the OUTA document 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 134 of 138 
 
that relate to you as well as this affidavit and say these are 
the parts that relate to you and then you can in your 
affidavit then deal with them.  
If you decide to say I am not saying anything 
because I think this is not legitimate, that is a decision that 
you can take, I am not saying anything now about it, so but 
it is an opportunity also for you to say look, here is my 
side of the story as far as this is concerned.   
Let us put some timeframe for that affidavit.  Can 
we- today is what, Tuesday/ 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Tuesday, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can we – can I ask whether we can get 
that affidavit next Tuesday?  Counsel for Mr Zwane, what 
do you think? 
ADV DENGA:   As to the hearing? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV DENGA:   In essence, the cause of all this debacle, 
Mr Chairperson, we only received this OUTA – myself, as 
the legal representative. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV DENGA:    Only received this report on Friday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV DENGA:    That is just two days back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV DENGA:   So we were not in a position to be able to 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 135 of 138 
 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   To prepare anything. 
ADV DENGA:   Files are being held …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV DENGA:   And that is the reason why we did not deal 
with it in an affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV DENGA:   It is the reason why we cannot answer to 
these allegations, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
10 
ADV DENGA:    And your suggestion to say that we must 
put up an affidavit, I think it is a good proposal but short 
time might well be a problem for us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV DENGA:   Because we need to go back to Free State 
department where he is no longer there to go and look for 
documents 
that 
will 
have 
to 
contradict 
whatever 
is 
contained in the OUTA report or to confirm.  So I think just 
one week will not be sufficient. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
ADV DENGA:   I understand there are time constraints, 
maybe two weeks, I may be able to stretch it to that level. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, of course because of the time 
constraints because he may have to come back. 
ADV DENGA:   Yes. 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 136 of 138 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And we are – this week it is end of April.  
Actually we are supposed to be busy writing the report, we 
are not supposed to be hearing oral evidence, so there are 
those challenges. 
ADV DENGA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can I ask you, both of you, to do the 
best you can? 
ADV DENGA:   Will do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To try and meet the Tuesday deadline. 
ADV DENGA:   I will try to. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   If there are real problems, write and let 
us know but I would like to rely on your commitment to 
cooperate with the Commission. 
ADV DENGA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That you would do everything you can to 
try and meet the Tuesday deadline because we must look 
at it and then it will be May already by that time. 
ADV DENGA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So is that fine? 
ADV DENGA:    We will do our best, definitely do our best. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Mr Zwane is that fine? 
MR ZWANE:   Chair, our commitment to this Commission 
remains unwavering, we want to assist the Commission.  I 
thought we should not be found wanting and guessing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
27 APRIL 2021 – DAY 383 
 
Page 137 of 138 
 
MR ZWANE:   For the sake of rounding up. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MR ZWANE:   Because that will not assist us, it will also 
not assist the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   I think what Mr Denga is saying, we have 
always adhered to your request.  In this case also we will 
give it our best shot.  He is just indicating that it may not 
be possible for us to have all the evidence that we would 
have wanted to collect in order to prove our points but 
10 
otherwise there are not many issues that we have a 
problem with here expect for these leaks that points at 
these tickets and the itineraries where my name is 
mentioned that I was here by this time and here by this 
time.  Otherwise, everything else is part of the affidavit 
that I have done.
