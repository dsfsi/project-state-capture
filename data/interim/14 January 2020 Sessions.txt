PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 14 JANUARY 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody.   
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Good morning DCJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning in the New Year.  Yes are you ready? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes we are ready Chair.  There are a few 
procedural matters to deal with but the respondent in the present 
application for the issue of summons in relation to the evidence of 
former President Zuma are present.  If they could place themselves on 
record? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:   Good morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:   Compliments of the New Year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Compliments of the New Year to you. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:    As together with Mr Skakane and 
instructed by Mantsha. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:   We appear for the former President 
Zuma. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Yes. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  By way of introduction Chair the 
answering affidavit with documents annexed was received yesterday 
afternoon at about four o’clock.  It raises a number of issues in various 
categories and if I could just outlines these in order to decide a way 
forward? 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 3 of 155 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  We are ready to argue the whole matter 
Chair and that could properly ventilated take up to a day and it is 
necessary perhaps given the program today to find an efficient and 
effect way to deal with this application.  The issues fall into various 
categories.   
The first category of issue is the medical condition as we now learned 
in the answered papers.  That is a factual enquiry.  The medical 
condition is not established on the papers but there is a tender to 
provide with confidential information in chambers and you Chair will 
10 
then assess that in relation to a summons issued for 27 January 2020. 
The second category of issue is a category of legal issue.  
Your right to issue summons Chair is challenged on various grounds.  
That is a separate issue.  That Is an issue that perhaps needs properly 
to be ventilated for the present and future purposes but it is not urgent 
that it be dealt with today.   
The third category of issues in the answer there are a number 
of attacks on the integrity of the commission, on members of the legal 
team based on incorrect facts and they need to be dealt with.  We are 
ready to deal with issues to the legal issues and the factual 
20 
inaccuracies and attacks on the integrity of the commission now should 
you wish that to happen. 
But there is one caveat Chair.  The – this application and its 
contents may have future implications in litigation or otherwise and 
perhaps it is necessary for that reason to go on record at some stage 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 4 of 155 
 
or another in a formal sense so that these matters are properly dealt 
with on record rather than just dealt with adhoc in argument but we are 
ready to deal with them.   
Ultimately however today we would seek the issue of a 
summons on an appropriate date.  If that appropriate date becomes 
inappropriate for medical reasons or whatever then that can be dealt 
with at that stage.  But it seems that the case of the former President is 
that he is ill and receiving treatment both here and abroad until – will 
not be available until March for that reason.  That needs to be 
established before you perhaps at your instance by confidential 
10 
information given to you in chambers. 
But those are the procedural issues that need clarity now.  We 
are ready to proceed should you so direct on all issues.  However it 
may be preferable to go formally on record to deal with attacks on the 
integrity of the commission and to deal with inaccuracies and to deal 
properly with the legal issues and challenges raised to your jurisdiction 
and capacity in the answering papers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I do not see why argument on this application 
should take a day at all.  There may be a lot of papers that are put in 
here but really the issues are very crisp as far as I am concerned. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  As far as we are concerned to Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  It depends on the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  It may well be that there are matters that the legal 
team and the secretary might need to respond to because they are – 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 5 of 155 
 
they have been said there on record but that does not necessarily mean 
that we would need to take a whole day for this application.   I think 
that you may need to decide whether you need an opportunity to have a 
replying affidavit to deal with these various matters before the matter is 
argued.  In which case we may have to maybe adjourn for a few days 
before argument is heard.  Because the – the usual way is that if an 
answering affidavit to put up and there are matters that you feel need 
to be responded to is to have that dealt with properly by way of a 
replying affidavit.  So you might wish to take a view of that.  I – I would 
not be disinclined to adjourning the hearing of argument to later this 
10 
week if that were to be the way to go.  So – there – there is that issue.  
I think that is the first issue on which… 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You need to take a view and … 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Chair the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  The factors relevant to that decision are 
firstly that the original urgency of the matter or semi-urgency was 
dictated by the issue of a directive by yourself that Mr Zuma should 
appear on the 27 January.  That may or may not fall away depending on 
20 
your decision in relation to the first issue, the medical condition. 
 
The second issue, the need to go on record.  We are ready to 
argue and deal with all the issues we prepared last night and we are 
ready to go on record.  It may be that it is convenient that an affidavit 
is filed in due course.  It need not delay the argument. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 6 of 155 
 
 
The time taken today is dependent entirely Chair on the 
attitude taken by my learned friend and to what extent he wishes to 
canvas the numerous issues both factual and legal raised in the 
answering affidavit but you – you will control those proceedings no 
doubt Chair. 
 
But other than that we agree that the issues are quite crisp.  
Your power cannot be questioned at this stage at least in this forum.  It 
is a matter of statute and the – the necessity for Mr Zuma to give 
evidence is also a matter that can be dealt with in a straightforward 
matter.  The real issue then is whether a summons is necessary or that 
10 
one can continue to rely on promises of cooperation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I am not sure about having argument first and 
then maybe a replying affidavit later or just responding from the bar on 
matters dealt with in an answering affidavit to put on record, I am not 
sure. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes you are correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether that is the best way. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  It is untidy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And may in fact because of those reasons 
20 
have consequences that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  The commission needs to protect itself 
against. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 7 of 155 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  If there are later proceedings. 
CHAIRPERSON:      Ja, ja. So… 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  That is that issue.  In the meanwhile 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  It may be convenient to deal with the 
factual medical issue in chambers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja.  Let me say this about the medical issue.  
Last time when the lawyers for the former President indicated that he 
was not able to come and appear before the commission because he 
10 
was not well.  The commission did not even ask for a medical 
certificate.  The commission accepted his word.  At least I accepted his 
word.  This time he has offered to make available to the chairperson 
information to support his position that he needs to be away on medical 
grounds.  I just want to say at this stage I am not saying – I think it is a 
good thing that he has offered without being compelled by anybody to 
make that information available to the chairperson.  I may have to – to 
see what he offers to let me see but if I do so I would not be doing so 
without any reluctance.  From what I have been told in the affidavit it 
seems that what he is offering me to see may reveal his illness and I 
20 
have some discomfort with having to see anybody’s – any information 
relating to anybody’s illness as such.  I am not saying that I necessarily 
will not but I just want everybody to know that I – it is not something I 
would do without any discomfort.  But the issue would be – the first 
issue would be whether if we talk about the way forward one of the 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 8 of 155 
 
issues we have to look at is whether as things presently stand the legal 
team would be insisting that the summons be issued in regard to the 
period that has already been determined namely the 27 t 31 January or 
whether the position may be that maybe in regard to those dates there 
may be acceptance that there may be a problem in terms of his medical 
situation and then the question might then be whether the legal team 
would seek that I authorise the issuing of a summons for other dates 
other than the dates of 27 January to 31 January.  I think that that – 
that is – because if what is being – if it is accepted that maybe for the 
dates of 27 to 31 January there is a problem because maybe there 
10 
might be no basis not to accept what he has said I could be shown as 
showing that he needs to be away.  Then it may be that what might 
remain is to say, okay the – the dates of 27 to 31 January might be a 
problem but let us talk about whether a summons should be issued for 
another set of dates and we take it from there.  And that might tie in 
with the question of a replying affidavit as well.  So it may well be 
depending on the position taken in regard to the 27 to 31 January – it 
may well be that an adjournment to enable the legal team to file a 
replying affidavit and new dates to be determined and argument can 
then be heard.  An argument might not need to be heard only when 
20 
those dates may be unknown.  Maybe it can be heard even if they have 
not been determined or maybe they need to be determined first.  So 
there needs to be an application of mind to – to that issue.  So maybe I 
should hear what counsel for the former President has to say in terms 
of these preliminary remarks before we proceed. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 9 of 155 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would that be fine or do you or would you like to say 
something? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  It is in order.  May I just place on record? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  In response to what you have said Chair.  
Firstly we would adopt the latter approach.  We have no basis to 
contest the medical information on the affidavit but would insist 
perhaps insist is too a strong a word Chair would request that summons 
be issued for a later date subject to consideration in the interim.  And 
10 
the next point is because of the importance of the issues raised in the 
answering affidavit for the integrity of the commission and its work it is 
preferable that we go on record before argument.  The other alternative 
is – is too untidy and has possible… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Negative consequences. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your argument would have to be on record and in the 
open hearing. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So maybe let me hear Mr Masuku and then we take it 
20 
from there. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  Just as a – as a preliminary remark.  I 
would urge that this commission and the – particularly the leaders, the 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 10 of 155 
 
legal team of the commission extends to us and our client the 
presumption of integrity.  It is very important because the commission 
is doing very important work.  They must try difficult as it is to extend 
to us the presumption that when we give our word to the commission we 
mean what we say.  It is very embarrassing to stand here and to have 
to tell the commission that the President or the former President has a 
medical condition that prevents him from coming to the commission 
under a threat of subpoena.  These are issues that can simply be dealt 
with to preserve the dignity of people that are involved.  The idea that 
they are ready to proceed and have this matter heard but insist on 
10 
filing an affidavit – a replying affidavit in future is just superfluous.  It 
does not make any sense because or not conceivable basis is a 
replying affidavit conceived under the circumstances where they 
insisted they are ready to argue the matter.  We are ready to argue the 
matter but we accept that we have got to preserve the – the 
atmosphere of dignity that this commission ought to insist on.  We take 
great exception that it has come to this point where the legal team sees 
it fit in the fact of having been told that the President or the former 
President has a medical condition that prevents him from coming that 
they insist on having to argue a summons.  It is just extraordinary but it 
20 
tells us exactly what we accuse them of.  That they are – there is a 
deep seated antipathy and I use very strong terms because it is what it 
is towards our client. 
 
On what basis after he has been told – after – after Mr Zuma 
has gone for medical treatment when he goes next week, on what basis 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 11 of 155 
 
in a summons application is competent?  He was not present on the 
scheduled date because of a medical condition.  On what conceivable 
basis is it – is it – is to proper – is it consonant with the dignity of this 
commission to compel Mr Zuma to come and do this?  And in fact the 
idea that they then issue a media statement telling the world that that 
have summoned Mr Zuma to come under threat of being imprisoned is 
in itself wrong.  But that said perhaps let me take – go to the – to the 
last part of what the Chairperson raised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before you do so because I do not want to 
forget Mr Masuku.  The media statement was sent out on my instruction 
10 
and not on the instruction of the legal team.  What we – what the rules 
of the commission says is that I think it says from time to time the 
commission will inform the public what it will be hearing and as you 
know there was the Christmas break and the media statement was not 
just dealing with – the media statement was simply dealing with what 
will the commission be dealing with as it resumes.  It said it will be 
hearing witnesses relating to law enforcement agencies.  It said it 
would hear an application to be moved by the legal team to seek an 
authorisation from the Chairperson for – to issue summons – for – to 
authorise the secretary to summons against the former President.  As 
20 
far as the former President that is all that it said.  Whatever else the 
media might have said does not – did not come from the statement.  So 
it simply said it will hear some witnesses relating to actually Mr 
Themba Maseko’s issue.  It would hear some witnesses relating to the 
Waterkloof landing.  It will hear an application to be moved by the 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 12 of 155 
 
commission’s legal team for the Chairperson to authorise the issue of 
summons.  It did not say anything more than that about the former 
President. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  That is correct Chairperson.  The impact 
of a media statement in those terms is that there is an incredible 
interest from the public regarding the appearing of Mr Zuma invariably 
exposes him to incredible attacks, political attacks and we – while you 
– while the Chair may believe that that does not – that should not 
concern him I am saying even the idea it – the Chair must consider an 
– a procedure that does not expose witnesses to this kind of attacks.  I 
10 
mean if you look at what – what the media and the commentaries on the 
media regarding the summons you will see that it is an unpleasant 
thing.  For someone we have told the commission he is not feeling well 
to live under the – the threat that he will be forced to appear before the 
commission of inquiry under a threat of being arrested is – lacks dignity 
and – and what we are asking the commission to do is that while the 
commission – while the leaders of the commission – the leaders of the 
legal team of the commission is a law – an obligation to the commission 
they must extend to the President – to the former President the 
presumption of dignity.  When he says he is not feeling well he is not – 
20 
he is not playing games with them.  So I – I – I still maintain that this 
media statement neutral as you put as you have Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  Does become a platform for condemning 
Mr Zuma in public and this greases the commission sitting in public. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 13 of 155 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you know Mr Masuku to the extent that it may be 
necessary and I know the media lies in person of the commission is 
inside the room they could even give you a copy of the actual media 
statement that was sent out.  You can reflect what I am saying. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  No Chair I am not – I am not complaining 
about the content of the media statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  I accept that the media statement is what 
you have said it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  All I am saying is that once that 
announcement is made you must accept that there is an incredible 
public interest. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  That is generated from this position 
taken by the legal team. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  Which is that they are going to be 
bringing this application for summons.  One of which is that the 
impression being given is that it is necessary to summon to him even 
20 
when he is sick or when he is not feeling well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let – let me say that I – I do not think that at the 
time of the issuing of the media statement the commission had already 
been – had been advised that he was not well to come to the 
commission on the 27 t h. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 14 of 155 
 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  There was prior information that he had 
not been able to come previously because he was not well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Previously yes. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that did not mean obviously that he would never 
be able to come.  There will not be dates in the future when he would 
be able to come.  So what – what I am saying is in issuing it is not as if 
the statement was issued in the knowledge that for that week 27 to 31 
July he would not be available because of medical condition. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  But you see if there – if there was a – a 
10 
rigorous adherence to what you – what the Chair said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  In our last adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  Which is that the appearance of Mr Zuma 
will be arranged. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  With Mr Zuma.  This would not have been 
necessary.  But that said can I – can I then – can I then just… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  Just address you on the way forward that 
I – I believe… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no that is fine.  The only reason I want – I 
interrupted you was just to make sure that there is understanding that 
in issuing the statement well one that is if there is any criticism to be 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 15 of 155 
 
raised it not against the legal team, it is against me.  But – but that the 
statement was nothing more than to do what our rules say that from 
time to time we must tell the public what we are going to be busy with 
and that the statement was not intended for other thing than just to be 
– to inform the public.  But I think I accept that you – you accept that 
the statement was neutral.  Your concern is that neutral as it may have 
been once it has been issued it seems to have generated certain 
criticism of the former President.  I think that – I hope I understand you 
correctly. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  Because we – we are of the opinion that 
10 
the position taken by the legal team of the commission suggest that the 
President – former President is not interested in coming to the 
commission and can only do so under compulsion.  We – we – I am 
instructed to offer to the Chair that the leader of the medical team that 
is involved in the treatment of Mr Zuma would be prepared to meet with 
the Chair to explain to the Chair the nature of the condition and the 
challenges that Mr Zuma is facing and do so under very strict 
conditions of confidentiality because of the nature of President’s 
medical condition is a security issue.  And not us, not the legal team, 
not anybody else would be in that room where the Chair would be 
20 
briefed on that aspect.  That we have to come to this is unfortunate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  But that said that is what we have been 
instructed to – to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  To offer. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 16 of 155 
 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  To offer the Chair.  I know that the Chair 
indicated that the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  There was not request. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  For Mr Zuma to – or to issue a sick 
certificate that too would be astonishing under the circumstances. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  We will argue when we – when the matter 
is ripe for hearing.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  Because clearly the matter is ripe for 
hearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  Whether on the so called attacks on the 
integrity of the commission or the leaders or any of the factual issues.  
It is not ready for argument today.  They must prepare a replying 
affidavit to see – to raise whatever issues they want raised, dispute 
whatever disputes they want to make.  As the Chair suggest they must 
then amend their – the target of the summons in terms of the dates for 
20 
which they want to compel Mr Zuma to appear.  In – in fairness they 
cannot ask for an order – an open ended order that anytime he comes 
out of hospital whatever his condition is, whatever the dates are he 
must simply be – he must simply come under summons.  It is just not a 
– a constitutionally compliant – I mean where is Ubuntu in all this?  He 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 17 of 155 
 
is going for an intensive medical treatment.  When he comes back we 
must be arguing about bringing him under summons.  Someone who has 
clearly told the commission that he is going for a medical treatment and 
he – when he comes back what do we know about his condition and 
then to suggest that there is a basis on which he should be brought 
under summons.  But we can argue when they – when they file their 
replying affidavit.  We would obviously reserve our right to respond to 
some of the issues that raise in their replying affidavit to the extent 
that they raise new matters.   We are happy to do that.  But as for 
today I accept that the commission’s position – the commission’s 
10 
suggestion that an – and Mr Pretorius’ concession, if it is a concession 
that it would – there will be no basis to ask for summons in respect of 
the scheduled dates that are coming. They must think about dates in 
future which – or the Chair must then suggest dates after Mr Zuma 
comes from medical treatment which dates will then – once the Chair 
has indicated the date that he proposes after Mr Zuma has come from 
hospital when he wants him here the medical team can then amend 
their – their relief to relate to those particular dates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the – 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:   Why that is important Chair is because 
20 
as in these dates we are able to come and to indicate to the 
commission that he is not going to be available, he is not even in the 
country when that happens.  So a summons would not be possible to 
implement.  As of the future dates what is the basis for – for summons 
after – after he comes back from the thing?  But if they want to argue 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 18 of 155 
 
that they must wait until you schedule dates.  They cannot ask for an 
open ended issuing of summons with no specific dates in mind and then 
we can deal with it on that basis.  Because then we would have to 
consult the President on that time, look at the circumstances that he 
faces at the time and determine whether or not he is able to attend.  So 
that is – that is the way we see the issues going forward. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I just – I think I just want to say something about 
a point which is made in the answering affidavit and which you have 
also touched on with regard to what I said last time namely that dates 
would be arranged.  The answering affidavit does reflect me saying – 
10 
saying so.  I – but this is what I can say.  I never meant and never 
intended that dates would have to be agreed with the former 
President’s legal team first.  I – I had a determined the dates of July 
when the former President appeared here myself and that is what I 
have sought to do whenever the fixing of any dates has had to be done 
by me.  But even other dates they are suggested to me by the legal 
team and I approve.  The reason why I would not want to subject myself 
to a condition that dates would have to be agreed is because I know too 
well the kinds of challenges that can arise when the arrangement is 
that dates would have to be agreed.  So I re – retain to myself and 
20 
reserve to myself the right to determine the dates but that does not 
mean that I do not welcome representations.  If for example I am 
informed that the former President is not going to be in the country for 
the next four weeks you know I am not going to determine a date within 
those four weeks so – because of those representations.  But I do not 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 19 of 155 
 
want to say he will not be required to come to the commission unless 
the dates have been agreed.  I have not done it with other witnesses 
simply for – for the reason that it creates challenges and because there 
are so many people who have come to come to the commission if we 
were to have to agree dates with them because they might say well you 
are agreeing dates with the former President why do you not want to 
agree dates with us. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  Accepted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It could create logistical problems.  So that is the 
only reason.  So – so the only reason why I – I think to the extent that I 
10 
may have used the word arranged the only reason – the only thing I can 
think of is I may have been thinking of arranged within the commission 
as opposed to agreed with the former President’s legal team.  So – so 
that is the only clarification that I wish to make.  And when I do so I am 
not saying that you are bound to understand what I said in the same 
way that I am explaining it I am just saying it. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  No Chair we are bound by your 
explanation.  We would not ignore what you – what you – because we – 
as I started at the beginning we extend… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  The presumption of integrity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  When you tell us that that is what you 
meant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.

ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  That is – we must unequivocally accept 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  No, no thank you. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  But I accept too… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  I am comforted too by the fact that the 
Chair accepts that the – the ruling was open to us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  Believing that we were entitled to be told 
firstly that these are the dates that we are thinking of. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  Is it – is it convenient for you to attend 
or is not convenient for you to attend. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hm. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  That is how we understood the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  The statement. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  The ruling. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  But now that it has been made clear we 
accept. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  That is the position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  And we can take it no further than that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no, no that is … 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 21 of 155 
 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  So in light of that clarification of course 
they may reflect it in their replying affidavit that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  That the clarification was made at the 
hearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  Of this.  This is certainly not how we 
understood. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  Certainly not how we have – we have 
10 
interacted with the – with the legal team of the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  We have indicated to them that 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  We believe that the – there was a ruling 
that we must… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  Agree on the dates or at least arrange 
the dates in concert. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  And not unilateral decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  But you have made that clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  We appreciate that. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 22 of 155 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine.  No thank you.  I think maybe I should 
allow Mr Pretorius. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If he has got something to say but it may be that after 
he has said what he wishes to say we should adjourn for a few minutes 
and maybe counsel on both sides can see me in chambers and we can 
talk about the way forward. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  As the Chair pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Perhaps for the record it is necessary to 
10 
clarify the position from the legal team’s point of view.  We learnt 
yesterday at four o’clock of the medical condition of Mr Zuma.  We do 
not persist in seeking summons for the dates dictated by you Chair at 
27 January but we will seek the issue of summons for a later date that 
is appropriate.  In relation to the question of whether we should go on 
record in an answering affidavit it is clearly our position that before the 
matter is argued we should go on affidavit to deal with the various 
matters raised in the answering affidavit which would require a 
postponement.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I think we – we will take an adjournment now 
20 
and I will invite counsel on both sides to see me in chambers so that 
we can discuss the way forward – the practicalities that need to be 
discussed on the way forward and after that then we will resume.  So I 
will adjourn for that purpose now.   We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.

MEETING ADJOURNS 
HEARING RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Chair following on the meeting in 
chambers may we ask you to direct that the firstly the replying affidavit 
be filed on or before close of business on Friday 24 January and that 
the application – the present application be adjourned to a date to be 
arranged?  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The commission’s legal team will deliver a replying 
affidavit on or before close of business on Friday the 24 January.  That 
10 
is one.  With regard to what is going to happen in regard to this 
application and the further appearance before the commission of the 
former President what has been agreed in the discussion involving 
myself and counsel on both sides is that this application is to be 
adjourned to a date to be arranged and I hasten to say arranged does 
not mean agreed.  That is one.   
2. I have accepted with some reluctance but I have accepted the offer 
made by the former President that the leader of his medical team 
should see me and in confidence convey to me information that may 
assist in understanding the medical reasons relating to his failure to 
20 
appear at some stage in the past before the commission as well as 
information relating to the future concerning up to when he might not 
for medical reasons be able to appear before the commission to give 
evidence and when there would be no medical reasons for him not to 
appear.  It has been accepted that with regard to this 27 to the 20 – to 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 24 of 155 
 
the 31 January the former President need not appear before the 
commission because of the medical reasons that he has given.  The 
consultation or meeting that the leader of his medical team will have 
with me will – it is hoped assist in looking at dates when his medical 
condition would not prevent him from appearing before the commission.  
So this application will then stand adjourned to a date that will be 
arranged at the right time.  Now before we finalise I just want to check 
with Mr Pretorius and Mr Masuku whether I have covered everything 
that needs to be said publicly that we discussed.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Mr Masuku. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  No, no Chair you have – you have missed 
one point – one aspect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  Which is that Mr Zuma has indicated 
unequivocally his willingness to appear before the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  That is a very important aspect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Thank you.  Counsel for Mr Zuma has 
emphasised that Mr Zuma repeats his commitment to appear before this 
20 
commission and answer such questions as the commission may wish to 
put to him.   
ADV THABANI MASUKU SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  With that then the application is 
adjourned and another date will be arranged in due course. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 25 of 155 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you.

prepared? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I am going to take the tea adjournment and we 
will resume at twenty five to twelve. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Twenty five to twelve ja.  We adjourn.

ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Chair.  Before you

Chair.

CHAIRPERSON:  Or your work experience. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 30 of 155 
 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  My career? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Your experience.  Yes. 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Chair I joined the Air Force in 1976.  Where 
after I did my basic training, my Officer’s Forming Course and the 
Junior Staff Course.  I attended to - I was transferred to various units 
in the Air Force in which 19 - I - I finished my career at Air Force Base 
Waterkloof and then I was put on special leave for two years in which I 
retired in 2014, but I used my time while I was on special leave wisely 
10 
and started studying psychology and I am currently busy with my 
Honours. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Could you just tell the Chair 
which years were you based at the Waterkloof Air Force Base? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  I started at Air Force Base Waterkloof at - as 
the Base Ops Officer in 2004.  Where after I was transferred to 
Movements from 20 - 2008 till I finished my career. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and what are the duties of someone 
who is placed at Movements? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  I was there as the Acting Officer in charge of 
20 
Movements Control. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Now you are - you came - you 
submitted your statement in response to a 3.3 Notice that was issued 
and in relation to the evidence of Ms Sindane where the JCPS Report 
was attached.  Is that correct? 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 31 of 155 
 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And in your statement to the Commission 
you responded to some of the allegations contained therein. 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  I did. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  We are going to deal with that, but if 
you do not mind.  Could you just tell the Chairperson, because the 
critical thing as you know is the Waterkloof landing - ag - the Jet 
Airways landing at the Waterkloof for - Air Force Base.  Could you just 
tell the Chair how did that come about? 
How did you know that there was an aircraft that was going to 
10 
land at the Waterkloof Air Force Base which was a commercial aircraft 
and not from the Defence Force? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
COLONEL ANDERSON: 
 
Chair, 
it 
was 
during 
the 
end 
of 
March/beginning of April 2013 that I got a telephone convers - a 
telephone call from Ambassador Koloane which was the Chief Director 
of State Protocol and he wanted to know - it was late in the evening.  It 
was about 9 o’ clock.  I remember I was still in bed - and he said to me. 
He wanted to know whether an Airbus 330 could be - will be 
20 
able to land at Air Force Base Waterkloof.  I said to - he first wanted to 
know if an aircraft.  I said what type of aircraft and he said it is an 
Airbus 330.  I said yes.  It is possible and the way I - why I said it is 
possible is because we can accommodate an aircraft of that size in 
terms of all the ground support equipment that we have and I 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 32 of 155 
 
mentioned to him that although we will have to still have the overflight 
clearance from the Air Force Command Post and he said that he will 
then process - continue with the procedure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one second … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Colonel Anderson.  The air conditioner if it could be 
reduced a bit.  It is - it seems that its noisy … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  For the noise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is interfering.  Yes.  You may continue. 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Then he phoned me again and said to me that 
10 
he is going to send the Advance Team of the delegation to us for a site 
visit.  That visit took place on 2 April.  A Mr Ashuc - I was introduced to 
him as Mr Ashuc.  I am not sure if it is his name or his surname and 
another gentleman came to the base and we - they discussed with me 
that the aircraft is going to arrive … (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you proceed.  Was it normal practice that if 
there was to be an aircraft that was going to land there.  A team be 
sent from the Department of Internal - International Relations to make 
any inspections - conduct any inspections?  Was that normal practice? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Yes.  That - that is. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Continue. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Then they explained to me that it was going to 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 33 of 155 
 
be 200 - 150 to 200 passengers and they wanted to know - they wanted 
to have a - a breakfast for the people.  So I explained to them our 
facilities will not be able to accommodate that number of people.  I 
suggest that they contact the officers’ mess across the road to see if 
they can arrange that. 
So he explained to me no.  It is not a sit down breakfast.  It 
will be coffee and tea and then just snacks.  I also explained to him 
that the two lounges we had - the IP Lounge and the VIP Lounge - 
would not be able to accommodate that number of people.  So he said 
but let us just look at the facility. 
10 
So we went through the facility and adjacent to the two 
lounges is a reception area and he wanted to know if they will also be 
able to use that reception area and I said to him that is not a problem 
and - because then we will be able to accommodate.  That was the visit 
on the 2 n d and then I had another … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Maybe before you proceed to another 
visit.  Let us deal with Ms - Mr Ashuc.  When we had a consultation 
yesterday I had shown you some emails that you had exchanged with 
him and I wanted to know what his surname was.  What - what was his 
surname? 
20 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  I was introduced to him as Mr Ashuc, but later 
I found out that his surname was Chawla or … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chawla. 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Chawla - Chawla - Chawla.  Something like 
that … 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 34 of 155 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  But I - I thought his name - his surname was 
Ashuc.  I - I called him Mr Ashuc. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  Before you deal with 
that meeting.  Chair just to put that correspondence - it is from FF5 
Chair.  That may not have been brought, but to the extent that just to 
give the reference.  It - it is page 0-6-1 of EXHIBIT FF5.  May I just 
hand these up to the witness?  She had written - she had 
correspondence exchange between herself and some … 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Thank you. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Mr Ashuc Chawla.  I beg your pardon.  
Page 61.  I beg your pardon.  Can you see that? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Is that the email? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Who sent that email? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  It came from me. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and you copied him? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Ashuc. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Ashuc.  It - it says.  You call it Ashuc 
because S-A - could you just spell it for the record. 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  A-S-H-U-C. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then what is the email address in full? 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 35 of 155 
 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  The email address is ashuc111@gmail.com. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Is that the person that you were 
liaising with? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Yes Chair.  That was. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Did he tell you who he represented? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  No.  No.  He did not. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And who did you think he was? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  I was under the impression that he was a 
Protocol Officer from DIRCO. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and is that what you still believe 
10 
today? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Yes.  I would say.  I still believe that he was - 
I - I thought he was the Protocol Officer. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Now let us just then move on.  Other 
than Mr Ashuc.  Who else did you deal with in making up 
arrangements?  Other than your official staff.  Any other person from 
outside that you dealt with in setting up arrangements? 
COLONEL ANDERSON: 
 
Chair, 
the 
only 
other 
person 
was 
Ambassador Koloane. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and then you were going to move to 
20 
the 
meeting 
- 
the 
second 
meeting 
that 
you 
had 
with 
Ambassador Koloane. 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  President. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am - I am sorry. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 36 of 155 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms Norman to interrupt you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Chawla. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chawla. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You led the evidence of Sundaram.  Did - did you not? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I did.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I had occasion to have a look at his statement 
recently. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I seem to think - I may be wrong - that he - he said 
somewhere in his statement that the person who acted as the liaising 
person between … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The Presidency. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Themselves and the President … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or the Presidency. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I cannot remember which one. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was Chawla. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that your recollection as well? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is - that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 37 of 155 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  That is the same person. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  It is just that the witness in her 
statement she says Ashook. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  With an A-S-H-O-O-K. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It is the same person.  Thank you.  Then 
Ambassador Koloane just - as you would have listened to - to his 
evidence.  Am I correct Colonel Anderson?  We do not have to go into 
details about what transpired between yourselves. 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Only to the extent that your role is 
relevant.  He has already testified before the Commission, but could 
you then tell the Chairperson about a meeting where he was present at 
the Waterkloof Base? 
20 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Yes Chair.  That meeting took place on 
22 April. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Just bring the mic a little close to you.  
Maybe that will help as well. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 38 of 155 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  That meeting took place on 22 April.  We went 
through the arrival procedures with him as well as the - it was Mr Ashuc 
and two or three other gentlemen and we - I basically went through 
them with the arrival procedure and then the departure procedure 
again. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  That is with Ambassador Koloane? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Ambassador Koloane. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Who else was present? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Mr Ashuc was also present Chair. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  At this meeting - at the time that you 
had the meeting on 22 April had you received any authorisations for the 
landing of the aircraft? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  No sir - Chair.  I also mentioned at that 
meeting to the Ambassador that we can proceed with the arrival and the 
departure procedures.  Provided we get the overflight clearance, 
because at that stage we still did not have the overflight clearance. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and then when did you get those? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  I got that on the 23 r d.  The following day. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  After then you - is the process then 
20 
of you getting the - the clearance - was - did it happen before you had 
a conversation with Major Ntshisi or did it happen thereafter? 
COLONEL ANDERSON: 
 
Chair 
I 
had 
the 
conversation 
with 
Warrant Officer Ntshisi on 9 April and I got the clearance on 23 April. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  You have listened - am I correct - to 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 39 of 155 
 
the recordings between your conversation and Ambassador Koloane 
and your conversation with Major Ntshisi.  For the record do you 
dispute anything that is recorded therein? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  No Chair.  I do not. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Chair those are contained in 
EXHIBIT FF13A and the witness was - was - dealt with those yesterday.  
Yes.  Thank you and in respect of both witnesses you do not dispute 
the recordals as being correct? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  I do not dispute it.  It is correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  Now - then after then 
10 
you received now the - the approvals.  What was the next step? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  We normally have a briefing the day before the 
arrival of the aircraft with the personnel to explain to them what time 
the aircraft will be arriving.  What procedures must be followed in terms 
of ground support equipment, baggage handling and the arrival of the 
passengers? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and at what time then did the aircraft 
land? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  The aircraft landed - the first aircraft?  The - 
the Airbus? 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  The Airbus.  Yes. 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  That aircraft landed shortly after eight that 
morning. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And the - what else - who else landed 
there on that - on that day? 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 40 of 155 
 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  We also had overflight clearances for two 
fixed wing aircraft as well as six helicopters that was - that ferried from 
wherever to Waterkloof.  Ferry means they came to Waterkloof empty 
and at one of the meetings Ambassador Koloane - he phoned me and 
he said that the original arrangement was that the passengers were 
going to be transported to Sun City with a bus and vehicles and then he 
phoned and said but there is going to be two fixed wing aircraft and 
nine helicopters that is now going to take some of the passengers to 
Sun - to - to Sun City. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC: 
 
Yes. 
 
It 
is 
not 
an 
issue 
that 
10 
Ambassador Koloane conveyed to you that there were going to be 
Ministers on that aircraft - on the big aircraft.  Is that correct? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  It - it is not unusual.  Chair, I must state to 
you that there was a very professional relationship between myself and 
Ambassador Koloane and we communicated multiple times on various 
flights.  So it was not strange that he mentioned to me that there will 
be Ministers on board that aircraft. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and then comes the morning of the 
30 t h when the aircraft landed.  Did you see any Ministers? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  We tried to get a list Chair of all the 
20 
President’s names.  We never got hold of that and we also did not know 
whether the Ministers were males or females.  So Mr Ashuc went to the 
aircraft once it was parked and what normally happens is he will 
introduce the VIPs to the person that presents the - Base Officer 
commanding which was in this case Colonel Visser. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 41 of 155 
 
He will then introduce them to the - meet and greet so that 
they can - he can welcome them on - on the air force base, but that 
unfortunately did not happen, because once the aircraft stopped 
Mr Ashuc went to the aircraft.  The first people that disembarked the 
aircraft were ladies and he took them to the lounge.  So - so we waited 
to find out who was the Ministers, but they were never introduced to us. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Am I correct that the basis upon 
which you would have been comfortable with the aircraft in your 
position - official position - landing there would have been if there were 
Ministers on board? 
10 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  That is right sir - Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So … 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  They will be able to land there. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, but what - what then were the steps 
that you took?  Seeing that no one was introducing the Ministers and 
you knew that the basis upon which any aircraft could land there if it is 
carrying a President, Deputy President according to the evidence that 
has been led on Ministers. 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Chair even if I knew there was no Ministers on 
board that flight.  There was nothing that I could do at that stage. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  As at the morning of 30 April when the aircraft was 
about to land.  Was your knowledge that there were Ministers coming 
with the aircraft? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Yes sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was your … 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 42 of 155 
 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Understanding? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and that understanding you had got from who? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  From Ambassador Koloane Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you Chair and is - that is - 
following up on the Chair’s question.  That is the same information you 
conveyed to Major Ntshisi? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Yes Chair.  That is the same information I 
10 
conveyed to him. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Now could you then tell the Chair - 
so people are disembarking the aircraft then what happened? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  They were taken to the lounges and tea and 
coffee was provided to them.  Somebody from the embassy - I cannot 
remember the gentleman’s name - took all the passports and I escorted 
him with the passenger list to the Immigration Official and we started 
with the immigration process. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Who - how did immigration know that 
there was going to be people landing? 
20 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  The base command post distributes lists to all 
relevant departments.  The Department of Agriculture, Border Police, 
Forestry and Fisheries, Customs.  They distribute all the information to 
the relevant departments and then they will arrive there on the morning 
of the arrival to do the responsible tasks. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 43 of 155 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and then these - supposing that you 
had seen ladies alighting - disembarking the aircraft and one would 
maybe assume that maybe they are the Ministers, but then what about 
the 217 or 200 other people?  What was your understanding of what 
these people were coming to do in South Africa? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Chair, at that meeting on the 2 n d Mr Ashuc did 
mention that they were coming to - to a wedding function, but my 
responsibilities as the officer in charge of Movements is to facilitate the 
arrival procedures and the departure procedures.  The purpose of what 
the delegation does in South Africa is not my responsibility.  I cannot 
10 
give an opinion about that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Had you in the past had before - that 
is before 30 April - had you had wedding - a wedding party arriving at 
Waterkloof? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Not that I know of Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Any other party if it is not a wedding party 
… 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  There was … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Without any Ministers? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  There was one incident during the 2010 World 
20 
Cup Soccer where the team of The Netherlands went through our 
facilities.  I cannot remember what aircraft they were on, but they made 
use of the facilities. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well that is - that is important, because I was going 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 44 of 155 
 
to ask you the question.  To what extent the Waterkloof Air Base has in 
the past or had in the past prior to this been used to - for the landing of 
aircrafts which did not carry a Head of State, a Prime Minister, a 
Deputy President or a - a Minister. 
Had that ever happened in your experience since you were at 
Waterkloof?  Is that something that used to happen? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  No sir.  Not that I know of.  That the others - 
there were military aircraft, but that was military personnel, but I do not 
know - I am not - of any such aircraft. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Did you say you started at Waterkloof in 2004? 
10 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Just repeat the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say you started working at Waterkloof in 
2004? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From 2004 to 2013 how much of that time did you 
spend working in a position where you would have known this 
information if such aircrafts did land which did not carry a President - a 
President or a Minister or Prime Minister? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Chairperson when I started there I was the 
Base Ops Officer.  So I would have known from 2008 if such flights took 
20 
place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So from 2008 to 2013 if such a flight had landed you 
would have known? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Even from 2004. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Even from 2004? 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 45 of 155 
 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so are you able to say from 2004 to 2013 except 
for the flight that you are talking about that carried The Netherlands 
Team - soccer team for the World Cup.  No other flights landed at 
Waterkloof Air Base which did not carry either a President or Deputy 
President or a Prime Minister or a Minister? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Chair, I think - if I can remember correctly the 
King of Swaziland - his mother the Queen - the Queen Mother.  She 
made use of the facilities, but other than that I do not know of any. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the former Minister of International Relations 
10 
who was Minister of International Relations at the time - 2013 - 
Ms Nkoana-Mashabane - gave evidence here some time back - I may be 
wrong, but I seem to think that she said something along the lines that 
the landing of aircrafts at Waterkloof Air Force Base that did not carry a 
President or Deputy President or Prime Minister maybe or Minister was 
not something unusual. 
I maybe misrepresenting what she said, but she said 
something that created the impression to me that maybe the landing of 
this aircraft in 2013 should not be seen as something that should have 
caused the big noise that happened, because aircrafts - commercial 
20 
aircrafts land there quite regularly.  I may - I maybe misrepresenting 
what she said.  I do not know whether … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair I could … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Norman has any recollection. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No.  I - no Chair.  I do not have 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 46 of 155 
 
recollection.  I think the difference she - ag - she drew a difference 
between President, Vice - Deputy President … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And the Ministers … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then she was saying so far as the 
Ministers are concerned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  They were landing there … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Because if you recall the evidence of 
Major Ntshisi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Was that it would be the President and the 
Deputy President … (intervenes) … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But - but we will … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Verify that during the lunch break. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So your recollection is that she was saying Ministers 
also land there. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Yes, yes, under certain circumstances 
yes. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 47 of 155 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay, no that’s – and that would fall in line 
with your understanding. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Thank you, sorry Chair, sorry.  And then 
at what point then did you realise that maybe what happened there on 
that day ought not to have happened? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:    Chairperson shortly after the aircraft landed 
or let me start before the aircraft landed the helicopters and the fixed 
wing aircraft that were supposed to take the passengers to Sun City 
10 
they were supposed to land at eight o’clock in the morning, but the task 
in aviation we work with Bravo time and Zulu time, time at the moment 
is Bravo time, but the task was tasked for in Zulu which means it was 
06 Zulu which means it’s actually 08 but they arrived two hours early, 
so our standard operating procedures is two hours before an aircraft 
arrives we need to be at work and everything needs to be ready, so 
when I arrived there at Waterkloof that morning I heard helicopters in 
the background and I realised those aircraft were on the way two hours 
too early and it was still quite dark, but fortunately some of the 
marshals were already there and between the marshals and myself we 
20 
were able to park those aircraft because it was a bit dark, but then 
when I got back to the building there was a lot of people and there was 
a lot of things happening at the same time. 
 
The welcome party was more than what we indicated to them, 
we normally have a welcome party of about twelve, but the welcome 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 48 of 155 
 
party was much more than 12 people, so there was a lot of people and 
at a certain stage I realised that this was maybe not what’s supposed to 
happen, but it was not my – in my job description to make noise about 
that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Let’s just deal with that aspect, then you 
felt uncomfortable, you’re seeing all these people walking around, what 
were your concerns at that point? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:    There was, remember I mentioned that when 
the ambassador phoned me the first time he said, he mentioned 
something about a cultural event, I didn’t listen properly because I 
10 
wasn’t interested on what they are coming to do here, I was more 
interested in the type of aircraft, but later it became known that they 
wanted some traditional dancers to welcome these passengers, and I 
was under the impression that traditional dancers is maybe going to be 
five or six people, it was more, it was about 15 to 20 people that was 
performing traditional dances, and my security people, the 504 security 
squad and people they were on duty to contain the people because 
there was – at that stage nobody went outside the building.   The 
traditional dancers were standing at the entrance door of the lounge.   
Is that what you ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    So we are dealing with your concerns. 
COLONEL ANDERSON:    Yes I basically just sensitised the security 
people and the military police to tell them there is a number, there’s 
more people than we expected, they must just do their responsible 
duties and try to contain the people. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 49 of 155 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Yes, maybe you should, before we go to 
your – to the charges that happened later on, just deal with the 
changes within the airport that were brought about by Mr Charlang, 
people that he was working with. 
COLONEL ANDERSON:    The request that they wanted to present tea 
and coffee I said to them at that meeting we don’t have 200 cups and 
saucers and side plates, we cannot accommodate the tea and coffee, 
so they said no that’s not a problem they will arrange for the tea and 
coffee, and they also indicated that they want to bring in coffee tables 
and easy chairs.   That’s when I decided that I will vacate that area 
10 
adjacent to the lounge and take out all the defence force furniture, 
which were about 20 easy chairs and five coffee tables, I moved them 
to a separate room so that the defence force furniture doesn’t get 
mingled up with the other people’s furniture, I took that out. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Yes, but does that usually happen that 
people could bring in furniture within the base and set up? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:    It has happened  before that we use that 
specific area for functions, we had the Africa Aerospace and Defence 
Opening Function there once and they brought in their furniture. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    So then you’ve got these many people 
20 
and then you went through according to you there were immigration 
officers, who had informed all these departments to be present? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:    Chair the base command post distribute the 
list to all the different departments to inform them of their arrival times. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Is that your section? 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 50 of 155 
 
COLONEL ANDERSON:    No the base command post, the base 
command post is level 4 and we are level 5. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Yes, but SARS was there, Health was 
there and who else was there? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:    Ports were there, Immigration was there, 
Border Police was there and I can’t remember if the Customs people 
were there but the arrangement that we have with that department if 
they are not there then the movements people will X-ray and scan all 
the incoming luggage and that is what happened, the movements 
personnel scanned and X-rayed all the luggage that came in. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Could you just tell the Chairperson the 
process that you followed in checking the passports and verifying who 
has come into the building? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:    Chair with the previous visits we had if it’s a 
big group of people the protocol officer normally collects all the 
passports with the packs list, the passenger list and we take that to the 
immigration official, he will verify the passports with the passenger list 
but it is his prerogative to at any stage stop the process and say he 
wants to see every person with his own private passport.   We cannot 
stop him, if that is what he request then we will do it but the custom is 
20 
that we normally take the passports in a bunch with the passenger list 
and they verify it from there. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    And were you satisfied with that process, 
somebody takes a bunch of 217 passports, gives them to the 
immigration officer and there is nobody to come with the passport? 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 51 of 155 
 
COLONEL ANDERSON:    Yes Chair there was somebody from the 
Embassy that also escorted all the passports. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Then after that day which is – then what 
ultimately happened to the passengers, how did they leave the airport? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:    Some of the passengers Chair left with the 
helicopters and the fixed wings, and the rest were with vehicles taken 
by road to Sun City. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Yes, the – is it correct that everything 
that happened within movement would have been authorised by 
yourself, if there is going to be bringing of Chairs there is going to be 
10 
seating arrangements, there’s going to be parking bays allocated that 
would have fallen within your authority? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:    Yes Chair that is correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Yes and everything that happened there 
was authorised by yourself? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:    That is correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Yes thank you.  Then after that then as 
you are aware then there was a lot of media attention to this and there 
were some enquiries, is that correct? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:    Yes Chair, what happened is when the 
20 
aircraft left, when all the passengers were gone I went to the 
operations room because I was keen that all the people, the 
passengers leave as soon as possible because there was another flight 
that took part that morning and we’ve got a parking bay that’s allocated 
to the President’s aircraft and we had to keep that parking bay clear so 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 52 of 155 
 
because our President was also flying that day I wanted to get the area 
clear as soon as possible.   
 
So once all the passengers left I went to the operations room 
and to find out if the flights of the President is still the same time, 
that’s when they told me in the operations room that there’s – the 
media is aware of this flight and there’s a lot of media attention. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Where was the President flying to? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:   The President was supposed to fly to Sun City 
but when I got to the Ops room they – I looked at the boards and I said 
to them where’s the flight for the President because he is supposed to 
10 
fly to Sun City and they said no it was just cancelled, he is now flying 
to Congo DRC and then he flew to Congo DRC later that afternoon.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Yes, from the base? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:    From Waterkloof yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Yes, now the – let’s deal then with the 
enquiry, what was the first time that you were told that there was 
something wrong, that if there’s anything wrong, there was something 
wrong with the landing of that aircraft at Waterkloof base. 
COLONEL ANDERSON:    That morning when I went to the operations 
room I – and shortly after that, that same day, the Chief of the Air 
20 
Force phoned and said we must come to the Air Force Headquarters, he 
wants to see me.  That is when they were told, we were told that things 
were not what they’re supposed to be. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    We ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry, at some stage that morning I guess to you 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 53 of 155 
 
got to know that there were no ministers that had been passengers in 
the aircraft is that correct? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:    That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Isn’t that the time that you would have become aware 
that because there were no ministers this aircraft should not have been 
cleared to land at Waterkloof airbase? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:    Chair the thing is there was so many things 
that was happening at the same time, the passports were being 
processed, the baggage were being X-rayed and scanned, the 
passengers that flew to Sun City we had to ensure that those 
10 
passengers go to the right aircraft, the other passengers that went to 
the – with the vehicles, there was not time to make that visible. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but what I am saying is there is a time when you 
became aware that there were no ministers on this aircraft, so I would 
have expected that the moment you got to know that fact something 
would have said to you so this aircraft should not have been cleared, 
maybe we were misled? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:    Chair it was never confirmed to me that 
there’s no ministers on board that aircraft. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh that was never confirmed to you? 
20 
COLONEL ANDERSON:    It was never confirmed that there was no 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   On that day or even subsequently? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:    Subsequently nobody has ever confirmed 
that there was no ministers on board that aircraft. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 54 of 155 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So up to today you don’t know whether there were or 
there were no ministers. 
COLONEL ANDERSON:    That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    You just know that that you had been told in 
advance that there would be ministers. 
COLONEL ANDERSON:    That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, if there are ministers wouldn’t there be a 
procedure that would be followed after they have landed whether it’s a 
minister or president, the president or prime minister from another 
country or anything like that, would that not be procedure to be 
10 
followed in terms of protocol that would have brought this to your 
attention? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:    Chair the normal procedure is that the 
Minister or the VIP, the most senior person on board the aircraft 
disembarks the aircraft first, a representative from DIRCO as well as 
the Waterkloof Meeter and Greeter will meet them at the steps of the 
aircraft and escort them into the building.  Whether that happened or 
not I don’t know, those – the VIP’s were never introduced to the meeter 
and greeter.  Mr Ashuk met the people that disembarked first and he 
escorted them to the building so whether those were ministers or not 
20 
ministers I don’t know, they were ladies as I say we never knew, we 
were never informed whether the minsters was ladies or males. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said earlier on the either the Chief of the Air 
Force Base or the Chief of the Defence Force called you, the day, that 
morning ...[intervenes]  
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 55 of 155 
 
COLONEL ANDERSON:    The Chief of the Air Force. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you said he called you that morning. 
COLONEL ANDERSON:    That’s right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that right?   I gained the impression from your 
evidence that whatever he may have said to you made you realise that 
there was something wrong with this aircraft, what did you think was 
wrong with it, and what was then basis for thinking so. 
COLONEL ANDERSON:    My only thought was I cannot confirm that 
there were Ministers on board that aircraft, so I think – and because of 
the number of people that disembarked the aircraft I think I realised 
10 
that there was – must be a problem with this aircraft but other than that 
not really. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes but if you didn’t know whether there were 
ministers or there were no ministers that wouldn’t lead you to conclude 
that there was something wrong with the aircraft if you established or if 
you thought that there were no ministers, isn’t it? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:    Once again Chair if we receive an over-flight 
clearance from the Air Force Command Post that is my authority that 
that aircraft can land there.  I am just the executing person and the 
person that facilitates the arrival.   Who is on board that aircraft or who 
20 
is not on board that aircraft is not my responsibility.  I have an over-
flight clearance and it says this aircraft can land here, whether there 
was ministers on board the aircraft or not I am not in a position to 
question that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no that part I understand.  You were asked the 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 56 of 155 
 
question I think, whether by me or by Ms Norman, at what stage you 
realised that there was something wrong about the aircraft and you 
indicated and then I asked you and I said to you you said that you were 
called by I think you said the Chief of the Air Force and I said you gave 
me the impression when you talked about him calling you that after that 
you realised that there was something wrong about the aircraft, 
remember then I asked the question and then you said well you were 
not sure whether there were ministers or there were not ministers, so I 
am trying to establish what it is that you thought was wrong with the 
landing of the aircraft or with something about this aircraft and how you 
10 
came to that conclusion.    
 
Did I misunderstand your evidence?   Okay, let me start again.  
Did you any stage on the 30 t h of April, the day on which the aircraft 
landed, take the view that there was something wrong about that 
aircraft landing at Waterkloof Air Force Base? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:    Not, no Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, did you take that view at any stage after that 
since then up to now? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:    After I heard all the information that was on 
the media then I realised but that could have been a problem but before 
20 
that not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is it that you heard or learnt that made you 
think there was a problem. 
COLONEL ANDERSON:    The media was referring to wedding guests 
for a private function. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 57 of 155 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And so?   Why did that make it wrong for the aircraft 
to land? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:    Some of the people at Movements told me 
that morning do I know that there is a lot of media across the road at 
the local garage, so I said no I did not know there was a lot of media 
attention and looking at what happened with the arrival and no 
indication of any ministers then I realised but there was – because 
there was no ministers introduced so that made me think but maybe this 
was not above board, but it is not my position to make a comment like 
that.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you saying that at some stage on the 30 t h of 
April, that is the day of the landing of the aircraft you got to know that 
there was no minister in the aircraft? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:    As I say it was never confirmed to me that 
there was no ministers on board that aircraft. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so is there anything that you heard on that day 
that made you think that there was something wrong about the landing 
of the aircraft? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:    No, no Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What did the Chief of the Air Force say to you when 
20 
he called you? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:    He wanted to know what procedures we 
followed to get the authority, the over-flight clearance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
COLONEL ANDERSON:    And I explained to him the same, the request 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 58 of 155 
 
came from DIRCO, once we’ve got the over-flight clearance then we 
can proceed with the functions to perform for the arrival, and he wanted 
to know who was all informed of the arrival and I also mentioned to him 
that all the relevant State Departments was present, there was military 
police present, our security was present. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did he have any concern about the landing of the 
aircraft, did he express any concern about the landing of the aircraft, 
do you know why he was asking all these questions to you? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:   No look I listened to all the radio bulletins 
that was there and that was the deduction that I made that something 
10 
was not above board and they need to investigate and find out where 
the problem, why was this aircraft tasked to land there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but my question is whether the Chief of the Air 
Force expressed any concern to you about the landing of the aircraft 
when he called you? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:   Yes he did because that’s why he called us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was that concern? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:   Chair I can’t remember exactly what his 
concern was, but I knew he wanted to know what was the background to 
the authorisation of this flight. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was  not that the aircraft should not have landed at 
the – should not have been authorised to land at the Waterkloof Air 
Force Base, was that not a concern he expressed? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:   I think that was, but I cannot answer that.   
I’m sorry but he wanted to know what led to the authorisation of the 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 59 of 155 
 
flight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and did you talk about whether those who also 
gave the authorisation knew whether the – there would be ministers or 
heads of state, deputy heads of state in the aircraft, did he raise that 
issue at all whether they knew about that? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:   I cannot remember exactly what was raised at 
that meeting, I know that the officer in charge of the Air Force 
Command Post was also present at that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   Yes well I was asking you these questions 
because I got the impression earlier on that when you came out of that 
10 
meeting from your evidence that when you came out of that meeting 
with the Chief of the Air Force you believed that there was something 
wrong about the landing of this aircraft and I was seeking to establish 
what it is that you understood was wrong as at that time.   Was my 
impression of your evidence wrong? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:   The impression that I got was because it was 
a private aircraft. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but private aircrafts had landed – ja. 
COLONEL ANDERSON:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that should not have been a concern to him, 
20 
should it have been, that on its own? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:   Private aircraft has landed there but with 
clearance from the Air Force Command Post. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes of course there was clearance here isn’t it? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:   The over-flight clearance, the authority from 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 60 of 155 
 
the Air Force Command Post. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I mean there was here was there not? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:   Can you just ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The clearance that should be there first was there in 
regard to this aircraft was well isn’t it? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:   Yes Chair there was a clearance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so he should not have had any concern once he 
knew that there was clearance, even if it was a private aircraft unless 
he thought that it did not meet the requirements on the basis of which 
the clearance should be given, isn’t it?    
10 
 
In other words once there is clearance the fact that it was a 
private aircraft should not have been a concern on its own, is that 
right? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It should only have been a concern if there was 
something else he was concerned about. 
COLONEL ANDERSON:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you don’t know what it was that he was 
concerned about? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:   Not at that stage. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you Chair.   Following up on the 
Chair’s may I just refer you to page 3 of your statement Colonel 
Anderson, paragraph 13, that relates to the questions that the Chair 
has put to you, could you just read, with your permission Chair, 13.1, 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 61 of 155 
 
Chair that is a response to the report of the JCPS, 3.2 of the report 
deals with arrival phase, it’s entitled arrival phase. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, could you just read your responses 
to that please? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:    
“I did agree with Colonel Frederickson and Colonel Visser 
that the flight should never have landed.  I only came to this 
conclusion after the flight has landed and I realised that there 
were no ministers on board the flight.” 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   So I just want you to reflect on your 
answers that you have given to the Chair on that issue. 
COLONEL ANDERSON:   Chair if I can refer back to this paragraph the 
ministers were never introduced so I assumed at that stage there was n 
no ministers or the ministers was – kept private and if you look at all 
the people that arrived there, all the additional helicopters, the 
vehicles, that has never happened before.  I mentioned to Advocate 
Norman yesterday that at one stage it felt like the base was captured 
by this Indian delegation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I ask the question again did you at any stage on 
20 
the day on which this aircraft landed, namely the 30 t h April, take the 
view that this aircraft should not have been allowed to land at the Air 
Force Base? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:   Yes Chair that is the comment I made that 
morning to Colonel Frederickson and Colonel Visser, but that was my 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 62 of 155 
 
personal opinion.   It was not – I wasn’t challenging, it was just my 
personal opinion that looking at all the activities that has taken place 
they should actually have gone to a commercial airfield. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well you must tell me if I misunderstand your 
evidence, I thought earlier on you had given different evidence, namely 
that you didn’t know if there was anything wrong with the landing of 
that aircraft on that day and subsequently until you heard, I think at 
some stage you said until you had read certain articles or heard any 
some things in the media. 
COLONEL ANDERSON:   No Chair, I must correct myself, paragraph 
10 
13.1 is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But do you agree with me that it seems to be 
inconsistent with what you told me earlier on. 
COLONEL ANDERSON:   I agree with you sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Ms Norman do you want to take it from there? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you Chair.  Given your evidence 
Colonel Anderson if – if I follow it properly it really did not matter to 
you whether there would have been Ministers or not there because 
according to you DIRCO had approved and there were overflight 
clearances.  Is that how you looked at the matter? 
20 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So at what point then did you realise that 
it not – ought not to have happened because with that in mind 
supposing that one just goes by the approvals one goes by DIRCO’s 
approvals.  With that in mind knowing that you – I have received these 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 63 of 155 
 
documents why would then – why would it matter whether it ought or 
not – it ought or ought not to have landed at the Waterkloof Base? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Once again Chair the comment that I made is 
not in my – I am not – I should not have made that comment, let me put 
it that way because it is not my area of responsibility of what the 
purpose of the flight is.  My purpose is to facilitate the arrival 
procedures and the departure procedures.   But I made that comment 
when I witnessed all the things that were happening.  The traditional 
dances, the additional helicopters that is when I realised that this was 
actually supposed to take place at a commercial airfield. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it might not be your responsibility but it may that 
you – it might not be right to take a view that as long as there was the 
clearance you should not have bothered about anything else because is 
it not the position that you would not have liked to be party to anything 
that may have been illegal or improper and if there was something that 
you thought was improper you would have felt at ease to raise it with 
somebody and say, should this really be happening?  What is this done 
because terms of the rules it should not be done?  I do not want to be 
party to anything that is improper or unlawful. 
20 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Chairperson in my time working with the – with 
DIRCO I have never had any reason to question any of their – the 
flights that arrived at Waterkloof and this was a unique case in my 
opinion.  Because the – with the number of guests it – it – I have never 
experienced it in this way.  That is why I thought that maybe things – 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 64 of 155 
 
they could have used another venue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But is that not all the more reason why you would 
entitled to ask questions because something completely unusual say, 
we have never done anything like this, is this right?  Is it proper? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  With my discussions with Ambassador Koloane 
he mentioned to me every time that I spoke to him on the telephone and 
in person he mentioned to me that our President is aware of this flight 
and that he knows about this flight.  Now when I was still the officer in 
charge of movements I had five primary objects – objectives and that 
was to never – to avoid an embarrassment to the President, the Deputy 
10 
President, the Minister of Defence, the Chief of the Defence Force and 
the Chief of the Air Force.  I said I will ensure that they will not be 
embarrassed but by the – but the way Ambassador Koloane constantly 
referred to the knowledge of the President of this flight I did not feel in 
my position I can query or question this.   
CHAIRPERSON:  But of course would your attitude not of not wanting 
to do anything that would embarrass the President include not wanting 
to be party to anything that may be improper or maybe illegal?  
Because then the President might then be associated with something 
improper.  Would that not make you say, no but then it means things 
20 
must be done properly if this is associated with the President? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Chairperson I was under the impression that 
this was the wish of the President. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you wanted to do… 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  No I wanted to ensure… 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 65 of 155 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whatever was necessary to make sure his wish 
materialised? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you Chair.  Then – then 
moving forward then you were – after that interaction with the Chief of 
the Airforce what happened to you? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Chairperson then there was a board of inquiry 
that was convened with I think Lieutenant General Mgwebi that was the 
President of that board and I was placed on special leave I think on the 
10 
3 May or the 2 May and I did not return to work even until after I 
retired. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  There is also – you also lodged you 
agree with the record that is contained in FF4 which is the Board of 
Inquiry recordal of your evidence before the – before the board. 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes is – that is the evidence that you 
gave. 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  That is correct Sir. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And also what is contained from page 9 is 
20 
the affidavit which you have already identified that you had filed with 
the board at the time. 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Then you lodged a com… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before that. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 66 of 155 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry, sorry, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Norman. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to go back to what you said. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Earlier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A few minutes earlier. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it possible that your desire to make sure that if this 
is what the President wished to happen it should happen namely what 
Mr Koloane had said to you? Is it possible that your desire to make 
10 
sure that that wish of the President materialised may have influenced 
you in any way to overlook one or other thing that may be you should 
not have overlooked or that maybe you should have raised with some 
officials to say, but this thing looks not right? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  No Chair that is why I constantly in all the 
meetings reiterated to them that we need to have the overflight 
clearance and the overflight clearance is something that is between 
DIRCO and the Airforce Command Post.  I have no say in that process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Just relating to that 
20 
response.  Would you then say if you accept that you had no role to 
play insofar as the interactions between DIRCO and Command are 
concerned would you agree then maybe it was not appropriate for you 
to – although you did not put pressure on Warrant Office Ntshisi to 
actually mention that but are you refusing this is the President’s wish.  
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 67 of 155 
 
Would you agree with me that maybe that was not proper because it 
was not your area according to what you telling the Chair? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Chair I did not phone Warrant Officer Ntshisi.  
He phoned me and I returned his call.  I did not put pressure on him.  
He – after our telephone conversation on the 9 April he approved or the 
Airforce Command Post approved that request.  I had meetings with 
Ambassador Koloane and Mr Ashuc during that time and I – every time I 
mentioned to them I am still waiting for the overflight clearance.  If I 
wanted to put pressure on Warrant Officer Ntshisi I would have phoned 
him again and say, where is this overflight clearance?  Why do I not get 
10 
this overflight clearance?  So I do not think – no I am sure I did not put 
pressure on him. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Alright let us accept that it was not 
pressure.  Why was it necessary for you to mention that the President 
according to what Ambassador Koloane the President was aware of the 
flight? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Chair I conveyed what Ambassador Koloane 
told me.  I just conveyed that again to Warrant Office Ntshisi and – and 
the time that I have worked at Waterkloof it is has never happened.  I 
am not aware of a single case where the – where DIRCO is involved 
20 
with a request that it was denied.  All the requests that I know of that 
came from DIRCO was approved by the Airforce. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well why did you think Ambassador Koloane had to 
mention to you that the President knew about the plans for the landing 
of the aircraft? 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 68 of 155 
 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  That was also strange to me because in all the 
time that I have worked at Waterkloof dealing with DIRCO nobody has 
ever at any planning meeting of any visiting Heads of State mentioned 
that the President is aware of this visit.  That is why I – it was a unique 
case.  It was something completely different.  It has never been 
mentioned to me before that the President knows about this flight and 
we can continue.  At one state I think it was on the 17 April 
Ambassador Koloane phoned me and he said he has just returned from 
the office of the President and the President wants to know if 
everything is still on track for this flight.  And I once again said to him, 
10 
once we have the overflight clearance the rest of the procedures will 
fall in place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you not think at the time he mentioned to you that 
the President knew about the – the flight – the landing of the flight or 
that he wanted to know what was happening?  Did you not think that he 
sought to put pressure on you to either expedite whatever needed to be 
processed or to facilitate the landing of the aircraft by doing whatever 
needed to be done? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Chairperson the only time I really felt 
pressured in a way was when he phoned me – when Ambassador 
20 
Koloane phoned me to say that all the passengers are not going to 
travel by road anymore they are now going to be travelling in seven 
helicopters and two fixed wing aircraft.  At that stage I said to him, 
Ambassador then you must follow the same procedure that you followed 
for the airbus.  And I said to him at that stage, if you are not happy with 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 69 of 155 
 
the procedures then you must phone the Officer Commanding of the 
Airforce Command Post Brigadier General Lombard.  And he said to me, 
but he does not have his telephone number.  I said to him, I will 
forward that telephone number to you and I forwarded that telephone 
number to him.  His office telephone number. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think Mr Koloane accepted when he was giving 
evidence here at least at a certain stage that he had put pressure on 
officials connected with Waterkloof to expedite the approval of the 
authorisation of the landing of the flight.  So would you consider 
yourself to have been one of the officials on whom he put pressure? 
10 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  In the end yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you Chair.  We – I am not 
sure whether you would want to deal with each and every area of 
dispute that you raise in the – insofar as it relates to the JCPS Report. 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But – but generally what you had read the 
report and after you read the report you lodged a complaint to the 
Public Protector is that correct? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  That is correct Chairperson. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And the – a decision from the current 
Protector – Public Protector was also furnished to your attorneys 
indicating that the Public Protector was of the view that because the 
Board of Inquiry had cleared you therefore was no need for her to – to 
pursue the matter. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 70 of 155 
 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. And what was the nature of your 
complaint to the Public Protector? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  My – the reason why we have approached the 
Public Protector was that during the cluster investigation I was never 
given the opportunity to explain my side of the story.   I got a telephone 
call from a Warrant Officer to say to me that Brigadier General Maketwa 
wants to see me.  But they did not tell me in connection with what.  At 
that stage I was already – because I was on special leave I was already 
on my way to our farm in Brandfontein.  So I said to her, I am not going 
10 
to turn around now what is the problem?  I never heard from them 
again.  The next was a letter from the Chief of the Airforce’s office with 
a number of questions and in that letter of the Chief of the Airforce it 
was also indicated that the cluster investigation team were going to be 
busy that weekend and I must be available the Friday or the Saturday if 
they phone me then I must come in and assist them with the 
investigation.  They never phoned me.  So then the letter that I got 
from the Airforce – the Chief of the Airforce had a number of questions.  
I answered them and I forwarded it back to the Chief of the Airforce’s 
office.   
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Just to deal with that aspect.  The Public 
Protector’s Report Chair I may just give references.  It is Exhibit FF2b 
and FF2a.  You would have those records there but there is a letter 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 71 of 155 
 
which shows that the list of questions that you were given was actually 
from 
the 
cluster 
Minister 
– 
the 
Directors 
General who 
were 
investigating the matter. 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Did you get to understand that later that in 
fact you were – they had sent a list of questions for you to respond to? 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Yes Chair I did. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Chair relevant pages will be 
from page 5 to 8 and 5 to 9 where Colonel Anderson’s responses – up 
to 530 where her responses are contained and the list of questions. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  Then – sorry – and you 
had indicated that insofar as the adverse findings in the report which is 
attached to the statement of Ms Sindane which is contained in Exhibit 
FF1. 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That all the adverse findings you were not 
happy with. 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  That is correct Chairperson and we answered 
those in the – in the letter. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  In the letter.  Yes.  Thank you.  Chair the 
– that is the evidence from this witness.  With your leave that is all yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much Colonel Anderson for coming to 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198

we ever need you to come back we will approach you again. 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much. 
COLONEL ANDERSON:  Thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you Ms Interpreter I see that Colonel 
Anderson ended up not needing your services but thank you that you 
were around in case she needed to express something in Afrikaans.  
Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. Thank you Chair.

CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Shingange could you 
please tell the Chair what has been your history of employment with the 
Government of South Africa? 
MR SHINGANGE:  Okay.  I started working in Limpopo Province 
Department of Finance 1994.  1997 I moved to Department of Public 
Works … (intervenes). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well … 
MR SHINGANGE:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Ms Wentzel do you want him to identify 
his affidavit first? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.

ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And confirm that what is in the affidavit is correct 
before … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.

Page 76 of 155 
 
MR SHINGANGE:  Yes.  I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You confirm them as correct.  Is that right? 
MR SHINGANGE:  Yes.  It is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay and is that your signature on page 3? 
MR SHINGANGE:  Yes.  It is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Next to your name? 
MR SHINGANGE:  Yes.  It is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you.  You may go ahead. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Mr Shingange could you tell the Chair under 
what circumstances 
you came 
to provide 
an 
affidavit 
to 
the 
10 
Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you … 
MR SHINGANGE:  Under what circumstances? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I am sorry.  Have you decided to abandon 
the first question you asked? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let us - let us start.  Ms - Mr Shingange you 
have in paragraph 4 of your statement set out the history of your 
employment in - in - within Government. 
MR SHINGANGE:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it correct that among the positions that you have 
held in Government is the position you held between 2009 and 2013.  
That position of being Advisor to Minister Chabane … 
MR SHINGANGE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the Office of the Presidency? 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 77 of 155 
 
MR SHINGANGE:  Yes.  It is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And could you please tell the Chair what was 
your relationship with Minister Chabane? 
MR SHINGANGE:  As - as I said in the affidavit I was his advisor 
between the period of 2009 to 2013 and before that we had worked 
together in the Department of Economic Development and also Public 
Works in Limpopo Province. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And - and not necessarily with him.  At some stage 
10 
you were Acting Head of Department at Public Works.  Is that right? 
MR SHINGANGE:  Ja.  For a period of about three years.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About three years and you were at some stage Chief 
Executive Officer of the Corridor Mining Resources Company. 
MR SHINGANGE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is a private company? 
MR SHINGANGE:  It is a subsidiary of Limpopo Economic Development 
Agency. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is a parastatal? 
MR SHINGANGE:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And are you currently in the employ of 
Government? 
MR SHINGANGE:  No.  I am not unfortunately. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would like to go back? 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 78 of 155 
 
MR SHINGANGE:  No.  I would not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  I thought you said unfortunately. 
MR SHINGANGE:  Ja well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay.  Alright.  Yes.  Continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  In your affidavit you deal with the removal of 
Mr Themba Maseko from the GCIS and the replacement of him with 
Mr Manyi.  When did you first hear about this removal? 
MR SHINGANGE:  It was a week after his - after the removal of 
Themba.  We were walking into a meeting with Minister Chabane and 
then I said - I asked him okay what happened.  Why did you move 
10 
Themba?  He says look I was instructed.  So it was a - roughly a week 
after he was removed. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what did you understand by instructed?  
Instructed by whom? 
MR SHINGANGE:  By … (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I am sorry.  I may have missed 
something.  You - you and Minister Chabane were going into a meeting? 
MR SHINGANGE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say about a week after … 
MR SHINGANGE:  After he was removed. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Maseko’s removal from GCIS … 
MR SHINGANGE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you asked him the question why was Themba 
removed? 
MR SHINGANGE:  Yes. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 79 of 155 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that how you put it and what was his answer - 
Mr Chabane? 
MR SHINGANGE:  That I was instructed.  Then I said - I shrugged.  Oh, 
oh okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SHINGANGE:  That was it.  I never followed up as to why … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SHINGANGE:  You know … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR SHINGANGE:  And by who … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SHINGANGE:  Because my common assumption was that obviously 
it can only be one person who can instruct him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SHINGANGE:  With the appointing authority who is the President. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SHINGANGE:  So I never followed up … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SHINGANGE:  And he never told me I was instructed by so and so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR SHINGANGE:  He never told me that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but that was your own … 
MR SHINGANGE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Understanding? 
MR SHINGANGE:  Ja. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 80 of 155 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That there could only have been one person/ 
MR SHINGANGE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And why did you not ask any questions about 
this? 
MR SHINGANGE:  Look at - at the time if you - if you follow the trend.  
There was a lot of movement of Director-Generals from one department 
to another.  So I - I did not find it extremely curious to say why is he 
being removed.  So I just assumed okay.  It is one of those movements 
that are being done from one place to another, because you must 
10 
remember that it was - what - the (inaudible) of the new administration 
so obviously a lot of the changes were still happening.  So that is why I 
never bothered to ask why. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And if Mr Maseko had been dismissed would 
you have asked questions? 
MR SHINGANGE:  Ja.  Definitely.  That will have attracted my curiosity 
as to why is he being dismissed, but because he was being moved from 
one department to another I never thought it is an interesting matter. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And you know that the former President has 
testified before the Commission that he did not instruct Mr - 
20 
Minister Chabane to move Mr Maseko.  How did - did you know about 
this and how did you come to know about it? 
MR SHINGANGE:  About what?  The testimony of the former President? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
MR SHINGANGE:  Well after his testimony - I did not watch the 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 81 of 155 
 
testimony - a lot of people phoned me to say is this possible what the 
former President said.  I said look.  I did not watch his testimony, but it 
is improbable, because there is only one person who has got the 
powers to remove DGs.  So that is how I end up being here today, 
because I spoke too much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Just - just make sure - just make sure we 
understand.  You did not watch the evidence … 
MR SHINGANGE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was given by the former President? 
MR SHINGANGE:  I only watched the repeat in the evening. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Later? 
MR SHINGANGE:  I did not watch it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  When it was happening? 
MR SHINGANGE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SHINGANGE:  I watched it after people had phoned me … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SHINGANGE:  To tell me this - this and that happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You say a lot of people called you and what 
were they asking or what were they saying exactly? 
20 
MR SHINGANGE:  Is it possible that Chabane will have removed his DG 
without the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SHINGANGE:  Without the knowledge of the President. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 82 of 155 
 
MR SHINGANGE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR SHINGANGE:  Is it - is it in his character to defy.  So to speak. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm; and - and why would - why did they phone you to 
- to find that out? 
MR SHINGANGE:  I suppose because I was his advisor. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SHINGANGE:  They will have expected me to know … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SHINGANGE:  What the … (intervenes) … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  What the position was? 
MR SHINGANGE:  And then also a lot of people assumed that we had a 
certain relationship which was close. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SHINGANGE:  So that is why probably they phoned me. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Yes. 
 
How 
was 
your 
relationship 
with 
Minister Chabane?  Was it a very good relationship? 
MR SHINGANGE:  Ja.  I will - I will say so.  You know I have a Greek 
friend who says do not tell me that I am close to the Minister.  Ask the 
Minister if he is close to me.  Unfortunately he is not here to answer, 
20 
but I - yes - yes Chairperson.  I think we had a good relationship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SHINGANGE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do - do you know how his relationship - that is 
Minister Chabane - how his relationship was with Mr Maseko during the 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 83 of 155 
 
time that they were working together at GCIS? 
MR SHINGANGE:  It was good. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SHINGANGE:  I never saw any tension between the two of them 
during the period that they were working together. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Right up to the time that Mr Maseko was removed? 
MR SHINGANGE:  Yes.  I never saw any tension between the two of 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And were you told by these people who 
10 
phoned you that the former President had stated that Minister Chabane 
had merely used his name? 
MR SHINGANGE:  Yes.  That is what they told and that is what they - 
they - that was the question.  They were asking me that is it possible 
that he could have done that.  Is it in the character of Minister Chabane 
to do something like that?  So I said no.  It is not possible and then I 
mentioned to one or two people that look this is what I - I know about 
the issue. 
He told me something like this - Mr Chabane - before he 
passed away and unfortunately that is what led me to be here today. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No further questions. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  I have no further questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 84 of 155 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Unless you Chair would … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  Thank … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Like to ask some questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you Mr Shingange.  Thank you for coming to 
share with the Commission what you heard and what you knew as far as 
you were told by Ms - Minister Chabane. 
MR SHINGANGE:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much. 
MR SHINGANGE:  Thanks very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are excused. 
10 
MR SHINGANGE:  Thanks a lot. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  Chair, the next witness is 
Brent Simons who previously testified, but Chair you will recall that the 
Rule 3.3 Notice sent to the former President in respect of his testimony 
was provided less than 14 days before he testified and because of that 
it was decided that he should come and testify with regard to the former 
President at a later stage.  He is now available to testify and I - I wish 
to call him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the Rule 33.3 Notices were sent to the former 
20 
President and as of today there has been no reaction? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  Thank you.  Then you can administer 
the oath or affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 85 of 155 
 
MR SIMONS:  Brent Adrian Simons. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the prescribed oath? 
MR SIMONS:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
conscience? 
MR SIMONS:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the 
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?  If so please raise your 
right hand and say so help me God. 
MR SIMONS:  So help me God. 
10 
MR SIMONS:  (duly sworn, states) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may proceed. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You confirm that you will only cover what was not 
covered previously, because he did give evidence and covered quite 
some ground? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Mr Simons you previously testified at the 
Commission 
and 
you 
stated 
that 
you 
previously 
worked 
for 
20 
Minister Chabane in - Minister Colin Chabane in the Office of the 
Presidency and you later worked for him in the DPSA.  Is that correct? 
MR SIMONS:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now during 2017 you submitted an affidavit … 
CHAIRPERSON:  May - maybe we can just too refresh our memories.  
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 86 of 155 
 
Mr Simons you were - you worked in the Presidency between which 
year and which year - from which year to which year? 
MR SIMONS:  I started in - in - joined the Minister in - in the 
Presidency in January 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SIMONS:  Ja and then remained with him until he - he passed on in 
the accident in the following year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you and - and you were his - was 
it Chief of Staff or Advisor? 
MR SIMONS:  No, no.  I was - I was Spokesperson for the Minister in 
10 
the Presidency … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SIMONS:  And then also Spokesperson for the Minister when he 
had his - his role as Minister for Public Service and Administration. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  You say in paragraph 4 of your 
statement that in 2017 you submitted an affidavit to the Secretary of 
Parliament and the Speaker of the National Assembly to refute the pre - 
the former President’s - Mr Jacob Zuma’s - denial that he had used his 
position to secure Government contracts with family members.  Is that 
20 
correct? 
MR SIMONS:  That is correct.  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair, this document is not annexed to 
Mr Simons’ affidavit, but it has been obtained by the Commission.  If I 
might refer you to page 1-4-6 of the bundle in front of you. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 87 of 155 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The bundle is EXHIBIT JJ1. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  The bundle is EXHIBIT JJ1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the page? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Page 1-4-6. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Is that unsigned copy of the statement you 
submitted to the Speaker of Parliament? 
MR SIMONS:  That - that is correct Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And if you have regard to BAS page 1-4-7 
paragraph 11.  It is said: 
10 
“While 
answering 
Parliamentary 
questions 
on 
Thursday 22 June 2017 our President once again 
blatantly lied to the people of South Africa when he 
declared that he had never asked anyone to take 
care of or help a family member secure a contract.” 
Is that correct? 
MR SIMONS:  Ja.  It is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to confirm.  Do you confirm the contents of that 
statement - unsigned statement - to be true and correct? 
MR SIMONS:  I do Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair there are a number of statements then 
or averments made in the statement which are going to be dealt with in 
evidence and have express - expressly being dealt with in Mr Simons’ 
affidavit before the Commission.  So I will not traverse them here … 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 88 of 155 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  In any real detail … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  But would - I would like to point out to you 
Chair is that three is a transcript - an unrevised Hansard - from 
Hansard for this date - Thursday 22 June 2017 and you will find that 
now at page 1-5-1 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And is this the transcript that you were 
referring to? 
10 
MR SIMONS:  In - in fact at that stage I was obviously as an ordinary 
South African and as a Public Servant.  I was reading the newspapers.  
Watching television etcetera and the President was responding to - to a 
question where I think it was one of the DA members who had asked 
whether he helped Duduzane or anyone else with business interests. 
If he had brought people to any Ministers and I thought that 
that was incorrect, because and that is why I actually sat down and - 
and drew up this affidavit, but I should bring it to your attention 
Chairperson that I do say right at the beginning that I wrote it in my 
capacity as a Senior Public Servant as well as an ANC Member and - 
20 
and from about 2016/2015 - end of 2015 onwards I consistently 
submitted a very similar report to the Office of the Secretary-General of 
the ANC saying that the President has - has brought the - the 
organisation into disrepute. 
Pointing out this and - and providing very similar responses 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 89 of 155 
 
to - to what I did in my - my affidavit.  I received no responses from my 
SG. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And - so you say you sent to the Secretary-General of 
the ANC of the time … 
MR SIMONS:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A number of such … 
MR SIMONS:  Submissions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Letters or emails or whatever? 
MR SIMONS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you send them in writing? 
10 
MR SIMONS:  I sent them in writing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is your recollection of about how many you 
might have sent? 
MR SIMONS:  Probably about eight or nine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About eight or nine? 
MR SIMONS:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Instances where you felt - and they all relate to the 
President or did they also relate to other members of the leadership of 
the ANC? 
MR SIMONS:  They - they all particularly dealt with the fact that at that 
20 
stage I believed that the President was - was doing more harm … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SIMONS:  To both the organisation and the country at that stage … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SIMONS:  And obviously as you would see in the affidavit what led 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 90 of 155 
 
to some disciplinary steps against me as well within the Public Sector 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SIMONS:  Was because of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SIMONS:  Statements I made … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SIMONS:  In my capacity as an ANC Member … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SIMONS:  To other organisational members. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SIMONS:  So - so yes we were discussing it and - and if you recall 
my earlier testament.  I actually told you that Minister Chabane was of 
such a nature that - that he would speak politics to you … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SIMONS:  And whenever he had the opportunity and he was also 
interested in knowing or trying to find out what the views of the citizens 
were … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SIMONS:  Regarding the President … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SIMONS:  And regarding the ANC as a … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SIMONS:  As a Government. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 91 of 155 
 
MR SIMONS:  So - so we had that type of interaction very constantly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm.  Did you keep copies of the emails or 
letters that you sent to the … 
MR SIMONS:  Hm.  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Secretary-General of the ANC relating to this - to 
these various concerns that you had? 
MR SIMONS:  I am sure if I - if I sent it via Gmail. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SIMONS:  I should be able to have some … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR SIMONS:  Some records in my … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR SIMONS:  My Gmail, because some of my evidence … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SIMONS:  Was not based on - on my Government emails. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SIMONS:  It was some of the - the evidence of meetings that I - I 
withdrew from my - my Gmail account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  If you can find them.  That would be very helpful 
to send to the Commission. 
20 
MR SIMONS:  I will do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Copies as well and - and then to Parliament did you 
send only one or did you also send a number of them to Parliament? 
MR SIMONS:  I sent it to the Office of the Speaker of Parliament.  I 
sent it to the Deputy Speaker of Parliament.  I also sent to the - the 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 92 of 155 
 
Chief Whip of the - the ANC at Parliament. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Are you saying you sent the same one to all 
those people or do you send different ones to different people? 
MR SIMONS:  No.  The - the signed affidavit I actually - I sent it to all 
of them.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  So - so with regard to Parliament this - the 
affidavit is the only one that you sent to somebody in Parliament 
expressing your concern? 
MR SIMONS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  Thank you. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So maybe just to make sure one - one understands 
this.  You says somewhere around 2016 or thereabout you became 
aware from what you read in the media that in Parliament the former 
President had been asked a question to which he responded by saying 
he had never tried to help any member of the family get Government 
business. 
Is that right?  Is that - is that what you became aware of that 
prompted you to prepare the affidavit? 
MR SIMONS:  Yes.  It was also - that is why I am saying that if I can 
20 
get copies and I - I will go and look in my Gmail account for some of 
the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SIMONS:  The original documents I submitted to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 93 of 155 
 
MR SIMONS:  The Office of the Secretary-General … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SIMONS:  And then you will see that there is a consistency in terms 
of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SIMONS:  My - my concerns raised as - as both a member and as a 
Public Servant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but your - what prompted the affidavit 
particularly is that you had or understood that he had given information 
in Parliament which you considered not to be true … 
10 
MR SIMONS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you prepared the affidavit and sent it to 
Parliament to bring it to their attention that as far as you are concerned 
he had told Parliament something that was not true? 
MR SIMONS:  Yes.  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Did you watch the question time recordings on 
- on television or did you read it in the media? 
MR SIMONS:  In fact at that stage whenever the President was 
answering questions at Parliament it was in our nature to - to - as 
20 
Government communicators and I think that to actually make sure that 
we have time to watch.  If we did not watch it and then we would 
obviously try and follow up later, but I obviously followed up via 
television when the President was addressing Parliament as well later 
when I read through all the online and - and actual physical 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 94 of 155 
 
publications. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And have you had a chance to read this 
extract from Hansard for Thursday 22 June 2017?  That I referred you 
to earlier that starts at page … 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page again was it? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  It starts at page 1-5-1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR SIMONS:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Are you able to tell the Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he …? 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  What …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was the answer yes that you have had a chance to 
read it? 
MR SIMONS:  I read through it.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Are you able to tell the Chair what statement 
it is that you thought was untrue … 
MR SIMONS:  Well … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  That prompted your affidavit? 
MR SIMONS:  Yes.  On page 1 … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe let us - let us put it this way.  Is this the 
statement that prompted you to prepare the affidavit contained in this 
extract of the - from the Hansard? 
MR SIMONS:  The basis of that statement, yes … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Alright. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 95 of 155 
 
MR SIMONS:  Because … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is here? 
MR SIMONS:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay that’s fine, then you can go ahead to identify 
it. 
MR SIMONS:    Okay on page 156 the response is, where the President 
then says, 
 
“Secondly I have never heard that Duduzane’s business has 
 
benefited from the Government.  Where I have influenced by 
 
saying, give him something, I have never done that”. 
10 
 
Now that is particularly to Duduzane, now I’m not familiar of 
any of the relations between the President, his son and whatever 
business ventures he might have gone on but what I then did was, on 
the basis of that an previous statements made by the president I then 
said that look, the President has, in fact, brought family members to 
Ministers that I was aware of and particularly the Minister that I worked 
with and on that basis I then drafted the statement and submitted it to 
the – the affidavit to Parliament. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    And which Minister are you referring to? 
MR SIMONS:    I’m referring to Minister Collins Chabane, the late 
20 
Minister…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Just to go back on your ANC membership at that 
time were you already a member of the ANC at the time of referring this 
affidavit to Parliament? 
MR SIMONS:    Yes. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 96 of 155 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    And why did you believe it not to be true? 
MR SIMONS:    Well one particular incident which I refer to in the 
…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    I’m sorry again Ms Wentzel I may have referred to 
2016, it appears from this extract from the Hansard that the day to 
which the transcripts relates is Thursday 22 June 2017 so does that 
sound more or less right in terms of the year? 
MR SIMONS:    Yes, in fact I think in the affidavit I submitted to 
Parliament I also make reference to that date ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja okay, thank you, okay then I think the question 
that Ms Wentzel had asked you was why did you think that the former 
President had said something that was not true, why did you think it 
was not true? 
MR SIMONS:    There was a particular incident in 2014 where the 
National Development Agency was launching the Solomon Mahlangu 
Scholarship Fund and the President was scheduled to address that 
particular meeting and the Minister was invited to open that meeting 
and on that day in fact, we had secured the Minister to address 
students at a college in Randfontein and that was confirmed, Minister 
20 
had committed that he was going to do it but we then also received a 
request for the Minister to introduce, openly the particular NYDA 
function on that Friday morning.  Now on that particular day, obviously 
the Minister – we were standing around in the foyer of the Sandton 
International Convention Centre, after the President had spoken, I was 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 97 of 155 
 
standing literally, I was next to the Minister we were having a talk.  
Now obviously protocol dictates if the President comes to a Minister 
that you don’t really stand around, you give them their space so I would 
obviously have walked away then but not to far, I mean I was clearly – I 
could see the Minister, I could see the President and with the President 
were several young men.  Now as the President left the Minister came 
to me and he then introduced me to these young men and told me that 
he wanted me to deal with them in terms of meetings etcetera and on 
that basis I was then introduced to some of these men and some of 
them had the surname of Zuma and one in particular, referred to 
10 
Khulubuse Zuma as his father figure and on that basis we left with the 
Minister and we went to the – I think it was Westcol Further Education 
and Training College where GCI’s – the Government Communications 
and Information System had actually organised a function post State of 
he Nation address for the Minister.   
 
So the college students were asking questions very directly 
related to their future in this country, how would they be able to 
contribute asking questions about the State of the Nation address and 
so on.  So after that meeting I actually again had to make contact with 
these young men and we had several meetings since then even when 
20 
the Minister left, was transferred after the election from the Presidency 
to DPSA they still came to us and I was their main go-between for them 
and the Minister.  Now in my affidavit to Parliament I actually very 
clearly articulate what the Minister told me and the Minister was, keep 
them away from the Ministry and keep them away from me.  So you deal 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 98 of 155 
 
with them, I don’t want to deal with them and he would regularly ask me 
– sometimes I would go there and say, chief I’m being threatened here 
and he would just say, look you are protected don’t worry as long as I 
know what you’re up to then that’s okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Mr Simons if we can just unpack what you’ve 
said a little bit more slowly and perhaps in a little bit more detail.  You 
say in your statement that this introduction by the former President of 
these young men to Minister Chabane took place on the 14 t h of March 
2014, how do you know it was that date? 
MR SIMONS:    At first I was also wondering, you know, because 
10 
getting the dates right is important and when were based in the 
Presidency we actually used Gmail accounts for correspondence and 
some of those Gmail evidence which I provided in terms of meetings, 
requests for meetings comes from my Gmail account.  So in those 
Gmails it is very clear that it was at this particular event where the 
Minister had met with the individuals where the President or former 
President, in fact, actually introduced them to the Minister. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    And if you look at Annexure BAS1 on page 
15. 
MR SIMONS:    Ja. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Is that the Gmail that is referred to? 
MR SIMONS:    Ja, my Gmail – these would be some of the 
correspondence that would come from the – the PO is for President’s 
Office, so that would come from the President’s office and it would go 
to, for example Brent278 and would be my Gmail account. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 99 of 155 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    And this is dated the 13 t h of March 2014, 
you say that the meeting would have taken place on the 14 t h of March, 
could you explain that? 
MR SIMONS:    Yes in fact the then DG, Dr Phillips wanted a meeting 
with the Minister.  He then sent that request to one of the senior 
officials in the Ministry who then responded by saying that according to 
his knowledge the Minister was confirmed to speak at the Westcol 
function organised by GCIS as part of their Post-SoNO activities, 
correspondence, in fact from the office as well in which the NYDA 
formally sent a request to the office of the Minister.  It went to the 
10 
Parliamentary liaison officer who then sent it to me and to various other 
officials saying that they see in the Minister’s programme for the Friday 
that it was going to be a tight – to manage that particular event 
because he now had to attend the NYDA function as well.  so I clearly 
remember that particular run of events for that day. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Yes and perhaps for completeness, if I can 
just read what is stated in the email you’re referring to, it says, 
 
“Dear Dr Phillips, Minister is scheduled to address the GCIS 
 
Gauteng Post-SoNA Youth Dialogue at Westcol campus in 
 
Randfontein tomorrow.  According to our spokesperson 
20 
 
Minister will invite the audience to engage with him  thereafter.  
Minister will join this event later than scheduled  
due 
to 
his 
attendance at the launch of the Solomon Mahlangu  Scholarship 
Fund 
in Sandton, by the President, could you  
kindly arrange”. 
MR SIMONS:    Yes. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 100 of 155 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Now you said earlier that after you had seen 
the Minister with these young men, you were introduced to them. 
MR SIMONS:    Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Who were these young men? 
MR SIMONS:    There was a Mr Mqondisi Zuma, Busa Zuma and then a 
Mr Zwane, his first name is in there, James – James Zwane and I was 
basically then introduced to them and told that I needed to meet with 
them. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    And the Commission has ascertained that 
the true surname for Mr Mqondisi Zuma, his surname is in 
10 
fact…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mqondisi will be M-q-o-n-d-i-s-i you know for the 
transcribers, just remember to…[intervenes].   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Thank you Chair.  His surname is actually 
Mathembu, do you know that? 
MR SIMONS:    No, at all stages of our interaction, correspondence he 
refers to himself as a Mr Mqondisi Zuma. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    And what relationship did you believe that 
they had with the President, both Mr Mathembu and Mr Zuma? 
MR SIMONS:    Well they seemed to have a close relationship with the 
20 
President then and actually very openly made reference to that 
relationship and then also, as I indicated, referred to Mr Khulubuse and 
Zuma as a father figure and in the affidavit, at a later stage, you’ll see 
where I actually said where they – when they believed that I was busy 
with delaying tactics they said that they would report me to the 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 101 of 155 
 
President as well as to Mr Khulubuse Zuma. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    And…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    You said that the person referred to in your – in 
paragraph eight in your affidavit as Mr Mqondisi Zuma, you said there 
is correspondence where he represented himself as Zuma? 
MR SIMONS:    In fact all the email correspondence I have, still in my 
possession refers directly to him using the surname Zuma. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay and depending on when, according to the 
information that Ms Wentzel you say the legal – the Commission got – 
when he started using the surname it may well be that he subsequently 
10 
changed the surname so that would have to be investigated. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Chair as I understand it, Mathembu is the 
surname of his mother, so he - his birth certificate I understand is in 
the name of Mathembu but he dealt, as I understand the witness with 
the witness as if his surname was Zuma.  I mean – yes as if his 
surname was Zuma. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well did you get information from him or did you get 
this information from elsewhere, what surname he uses.  Did he say he 
uses Mathembu and not Zuma or is this information you did not obtain 
from him?  
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    I’m advised Chair that he uses both, that his 
father is Zuma, his mother is Mathembu and if I can just lead some 
further 
evidence 
that 
might 
also 
lead 
some 
clarity 
on 
to 
this…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Well before you lead the evidence I just want to 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 102 of 155 
 
understand because I don’t want us to waste time about something that 
might not be important. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So whatever you know, you didn’t get from him, is 
that correct? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    No we didn’t get it from him. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja. 
MR SIMONS:    Chair if I may – if I’m allowed to? 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, yes. 
MR SIMONS:    He also befriended me on Facebook after the initial 
10 
meetings and even there the surname is referred to as Zuma and this 
morning on my way here I actually got a reminder from Facebook that it 
is his birthday today and it clearly pointed again to Mqondisi Zuma. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So the reference to Mathembu is something you are 
hearing for the first time? 
MR SIMONS:    I heard it for the first time from the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:    From Counsel ja, from the [indistinct]. 
MR SIMONS:    Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja okay alright. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Thank you, now you say that after the former 
20 
President had spoken to Minister Chabane, Minister Chabane came to 
you, introduced these people to you and then you used the word that he 
told you to deal with them but to keep them away from him.  What did 
you understand by deal with them, are those the words he used? 
MR SIMONS:    According to the late Minister, the President very 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 103 of 155 
 
specifically requested that we assist these young people and for us 
then they came with a list of potential business concepts and business 
ideas they wanted for Government and our assumption, automatically 
was that the instruction was to assist them with these business 
concepts.  Minister Chabane then obviously, as I indicated, in the 
original affidavit to Parliament that he was to happy with the situation 
then and then asked me to deal with them exclusively. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes Ms Wentzel I don’t know whether he missed 
this, I was looking at paragraph nine of Mr Simons Affidavit because I 
had not heard, as he was giving evidence, him articulate in a way that I 
10 
understood exactly what it is that he says the former President may 
have said to Minister Chabane about the young men. 
MR SIMONS:    No. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Did you want to just deal with – what did he say, is 
there something that he said on that day, that is the former President to 
Minister Chabane which is connected with your thinking that what he 
said in Parliament was not true? 
MR SIMONS:    In fact his – when the Minister introduced them to me 
he said look the request is first to please assist these young people, 
they have some business ideas and to technically introduce them to 
20 
whoever they want to be introduced with and that is why in some of the 
correspondence that they have sent to me, they actually asked, can you 
assist us with getting access to this office or can you assist us to get 
access to that office. So I then, obviously knew that the instruction 
was, you meet with the people that have been referred to me as the 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 104 of 155 
 
Minister, you deal with them and you assist them but the Minister was 
also very coy when he said, look I don’t want you to bring them to me, 
keep them away from our office and I think that’s part of the reason 
why all of the meetings that I had with them either took place 
somewhere in Johannesburg or in the Sandton area but nowhere did we 
take them to the Minister’s office. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So is the position that you yourself did not hear 
what the former President said to Minister Chabane about these young 
men but what you heard is what the Minister subsequently said to you 
he had been told? 
10 
MR SIMONS:    Ja to please assist them yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes okay, yes continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    And …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And in terms of what Minister Chabane said to you it 
is that he said Mr Zuma said he or you people must try and assist these 
young people? 
MR SIMONS:   Ja, in fact, he – the level or respect was always there 
and he was referred to as the President and so the President has asked 
us to assist and so for me the term that stood out there was to please 
assist them and then obviously in subsequent meetings with them it 
20 
became very clear what they wanted assistance with because they had 
some ideas in terms of businesses and all these businesses had direct 
– were directly linked with Government, either tenders or potential 
contracts. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, if you are able to remember quite well, if you 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 105 of 155 
 
have a good recollection of exactly what Mr Chabane conveyed to you 
I’d very much like you to articulate that clearly because it’s important  
for understanding what – whether there was something improper or not 
or not proper that may have been intended or meant and in this regard 
you may or may not be aware that this Commission heard evidence 
from Mr Themba Maseko who said that on the day on which he was 
going to meet Mr Ajay Gupta at the Gupta residence he got a call from 
the former President and the conversation that he had with the former 
President was that former President said – asked him to assist the 
Gupta’s.  So here we are meeting what you say also was a request as 
10 
far as you were told by Minister Chabane from the former President to 
assist these young people.  So it’s important that I understand as much 
as you are able to remember in terms of what Minister Chabane said he 
had been asked to do.  Do you want to just articulate that once again? 
MR SIMONS:    Yes in my submission to Parliament I actually said that 
my instruction was to assist them with all their business concepts that 
they had.  Therefore, to link them up with the correct business people – 
not business people, it even included DG’s and Acting Deputy Director 
Generals and at one stage I personally actually called a meeting with 
another Government official in which I was told to hand over particular 
20 
envelope, I knew the contents of the envelope and I had to brief this 
official on what was to be done. So the understanding was, try and get 
them to the correct people but I think I also make it clear that the 
Minister was saying, keep them at bay as long as – and as far as 
possible. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 106 of 155 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, yes did you – are you able to tell me why you 
thought it was necessary for the former President to ask Minister 
Chabane to assist these young people or for Minister Chabane to ask 
you to assist them as opposed to allowing them, if they needed any 
assistance from Government to approach Government without the 
intervention of the President like everybody.  Did you have an 
understanding why that was necessary? 
MR SIMONS:    At that particular time I don’t think we had a clear 
reason as to why we had to assist them other than having to assist 
them but I think as our meetings progressed I actually came – because 
10 
I did some research for the Minister as well and then found out that 
some of these young people who were brought to the Minster were the 
same people who already had some legal conflict with the National 
Youth Development Agency at that particular time.  I think there was a 
dispute over a R36million contract and they were taking the NYDA to 
Court, that was prior to the meeting. So I think that the position would 
have been that because there’s already some trouble you try and assist 
them as far as possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay so because I guess the National Youth 
Development Agency would have been the place where one wold have 
20 
thought any young person seeking assistance would go so – but if they 
already had disputes and arguments with them they may then have 
sought assistance outside of the National Youth Development Agency. 
MR SIMONS:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 107 of 155 
 
MR SIMONS:   And Chair some of these issues that they wanted, for 
example was for the Ministry who was then the – obviously the 
reporting entity for the NYDA as well to actually assist in securing 
some funding the NYDA for some of the projects. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes did Minister Chabane, at that stage – did his 
portfolio have the NYDA under him, did it include the NYDA in any way? 
MR SIMONS:    If I recall correctly the NYDA reported to the Minister in 
the Presidency. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So he would have been responsible for it okay.  So I 
guess that maybe it would make sense that if they had issues with the 
10 
NYDA and the NYDA might not be able to help them because of those 
issues, they approach the Minister who’s responsible for the NYDA and 
for assistance? 
MR SIMONS:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja depending on what the assistance is but for any 
proper [indistinct] assistance they will be entitled to go to the Minister? 
MR SIMONS:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Thank you Chair.  Mr Simons in paragraph 16 
of your affidavit you list the deals that these young men were interested 
20 
in, could you just tell the Chair briefly what were these businesses that 
they wished to pursue?  
MR SIMONS:    The Government Communication and Information 
System at that stage wanted to appoint companies that would centralise 
Government advertising and they felt that they would be able to benefit 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 108 of 155 
 
from that by assisting and providing their services to GCIS at that 
particular time.  So one of the issues they wanted to re-introduce and 
I’m saying re-introduce because my understanding was that we already 
had public information terminals, most of it which were inactive and 
failing at that particular stage.  So they were looking at the introduction 
of public information terminals and that would be at universities, at 
colleges, at Thusong service centres at that stage I think it was still 
called Multi-Purpose and Community Centres.  They wanted to – when 
we in the Presidency still they were also looking at the NYDA assisting 
them with funding for some of their projects but we steered away from 
10 
that because of the legal conflict that they were technically involved 
with already with the NYDA and then when we left the Presidency and 
we went to Public Service and Administration the request came through 
for them to be considered as the single service provider for cell phone 
contracts within Government.  Now obviously Government spends tens 
of million of rands on cell phone contracts monthly and annually, that 
would have been a huge contract and they wanted us to look at the 
possibility of them becoming the key service provider to Government. 
So they would go to established cell phone companies and be the kind 
of intermediary in these companies and all public servants through 
20 
DPSA and then also the Government employees medical scheme was, 
at that stage advertising – an advert went out for companies to tender 
for a – I don’t know how many years it was but I assume it wold have 
been a two, three, four year contract to provide communication 
services, marketing services, branding services etcetera for GEMS and 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 109 of 155 
 
that in itself was also a very expensive contract which would have run 
well into a few hundred million at that stage. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    And did you get an impression or who was 
funding these young men in their proposed businesses, who was behind 
them, if there was anyone? 
MR SIMONS:    I don’t know if they were particularly being funded by 
any individual but for Mqondisi and his brother, for example, they very 
openly said that Mr Khulubuse Zuma was funding their stay in Sandton 
and that they were getting an allowance from him and that they 
technically, to a large extent then, must also represent him and that is 
10 
how they, consistently portrayed themselves. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And do you know through which entity they 
wished to secure these contracts with government? 
MR SIMONS:  They – they came to us with a company called 
Weintelligent.  Now Weintelligent when I – I was asked to – to do some 
basic check on them is the company that was also in conflict with the 
National Youth Development Agency at that particular stage.  So I then 
obviously as I indicated informed the Minister, gave him my brief little 
report on – on meetings that I have held with them and then also some 
of these online articles which I then basically had printed out and 
20 
provided to the Minister. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Mr Simons I want to show you a letter on 
page 20 and it is dated the 24 March 2014 and it is signed by Mr 
Chabane and in that letter it is addressed to Mr Zwane who you say 
was one of these young men and you say “our recent engagement and” 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 110 of 155 
 
– not you say it said –  
“Our recent engagement and discussion at the launch 
of the Solomon Mahlangu Scholarship Fund refers.  
Thank you for your presentation on HOWZIT.  Your 
interactive web based customer target bill board for 
digital advertising.  It is indeed encouraging to find 
our young people making inroads in the area of 
digital advertising.  In this regard we support the 
efforts of the Weintellingent Technology through their 
HOWZIT project which will not only benefit our youth 
10 
but the community at large.  Yours sincerely.” 
Now you have said that Minister Chabane said to you, keep these 
people away from me.  Under what circumstances did he come to sign 
this letter and could you explain what the HOWZIT project was? 
MR SIMONS:  The – the HOWZIT Project was not presented to the 
Minister.  It was presented to – to me and to a large extent I actually 
drafted the letter as well because I mean if you have an understanding 
of how the Ministries operate.  You – if there is a proposal – if there is 
a project you try and give the Minister as much information as possible.  
The HOWZIT project was not a bad concept at all.  It was about trying 
20 
to empower and getting youth in particular into the advertising industry.  
But since our very first meeting which happened way before this letter I 
constantly told the Minister, Minister they want a letter from you 
indicating that there is some support from the office of – of the Minister 
in the President.  He then told me to draft a letter.  He read through it 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 111 of 155 
 
and then he said, okay fine because it does not commit us to – to 
anything in particular within government.  So it is a letter that just 
broadly says that look Brent spoke to the Minister and the Minister has 
noted this project and that basically through me they will try and get as 
much support as possible from the Minister in the Presidency. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It looks like they – they wanted a letter from the 
Presidency that they could use to get whatever assistance from other 
people or business from people.  Would that have been your thinking as 
well as to what the purpose of the letter was? 
MR SIMONS:  It would have been to try and assist them to open some 
10 
doors within government yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR SIMONS:  And we – we very – I am sure that there would be one or 
two people who would be able to verify that.  Even though we have 
given them this letter beyond that we did not really assist with any 
physical opening of doors to [indistinct] within government. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  But I guess that the list they must have wanted 
it for is to show it around? 
MR SIMONS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To say even government supports us. 
20 
MR SIMONS:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And their understanding would have been that that 
should carry some weight somewhere? 
MR SIMONS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 112 of 155 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  I would now like to refer you to a 
letter on page 22 of the bundle.  It is an email from Mr Matembo or Mr 
Zuma dated the 2 April 2014 addressed to you copied to James Zwane 
and Archie Zondo and it say: 
“Dear Brent.  I trust that this email will find you well.  
Pursuant to our last engagement we would kindly 
request to meet with yourselves on the 4 April 2014 
at Michael Angelo Towers Park Firm restaurant at 
10am to discuss the HOWZIT and connect to 
government project and other digital solutions.  
10 
Thanking you in anticipation.” 
Did you in fact meet with them after this request? 
MR SIMONS:  I – I met with them.  I informed the Minister that there 
was this request and I also had to inform the – the Chief of Staff at that 
stage so that there was at least for our record purpose they are aware 
that I am officially travelling to – to meet with these individuals. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And then after this meeting did you receive a 
business proposal with regard to this HOWZIT project? 
MR SIMONS:  The business proposal was received and then basically 
just filed.  No not formally filed in the Ministry but filed within our own 
20 
little setups on our laptops. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So if I can refer you to page 24.  It is an 
email from James Zwane dated the 7 April 2014 addressed to you. 
“Dear Brent.  Please find attached the bus plan and 
see below notes from our meeting to do for 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 113 of 155 
 
Weintelligent send bus plans, send rates, identify 
sites and get letters to do for Brent.  Meet Donald 
with GCIS and get letter of support for HOWZIT.  Talk 
to Donald about meeting Wintelligent rates 2000 per 
screen per month.  They will be 200 screens to begin 
with.  Regards James.” 
And then on page 25 is that the business proposal that was sent to 
you? 
MR SIMONS:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now in paragraph 23. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of his affidavit. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Of your affidavit you refer to Annexure BAS5 
which can be found on page 44 and if I can take you to that.  And this 
is an email dated the 8 April 2014 and it is from the young Mr Zuma to 
you also copying James Zwane and Busa Zuma and it says? 
“Dear Brent.  There is something we forgot to 
mention on Friday during our meeting.  We had a 
chat with the Minister regarding our application for 
an ICASA licence for the advertising on voice call 
concept ad call.  The Minister was willing to assist us 
20 
secure a meeting with the decision makers at ICASA 
who could help us fast track the application.  We 
also wanted to negotiate more favourable rates as 
we will be giving calls for free to the public.  Can you 
assist us in securing a meeting with them?  Looking 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 114 of 155 
 
forward to your reply.  Regards Mqondisi.” 
Can you explain that to the Chair please?  What was this about? 
MR SIMONS:  At this stage we were also moving I think – I think it 
would have been electing hearing period as well for the then general 
election.  So what they wanted here was they wanted us to – to directly 
put them in contact with ICASA but they wanted us to be present as 
well.  Because then you would have someone from the Presidency also 
participating in the meeting which would have given it a certain 
elevated status according to them.  So for this they were proposing that 
they basically run adverts for government as well through a particular 
10 
company of theirs in which they would get all government departments 
to basically place adverts through them.  And then if your phone rings 
for example and you do not answer and after a couple of seconds it 
goes into a voicemail.  Or if you answer it you get a voice on the other 
side or a recording on the other side basically telling you that this is 
Home Affairs you need to register SASSA etcetera so that was part of 
their – their proposal.  But from their understanding they actually 
needed a particular licence to operate that.  And they then wanted us to 
– to put them in contact with ICASA.  And that meeting also never 
materialised because there was no attempt from our side to – to put 
20 
them in contact with ICASA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it looks like you – you were reluctant to do this 
part of what they wanted you to do.  Am I right? 
MR SIMONS:  Yes they were – they were already in contact with ICASA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So tell me about the basis for your reluctance?  
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 115 of 155 
 
Is it just that they were already in contact with ICASA or is it something 
more than that? 
MR SIMONS:  No it was – it was in fact what – if you read the email 
and they do not say it exactly in the email there.  But what they are 
saying is that look we want you to fast track the – the application.  We 
also want special rates from – from ICASA.  So they wanted us as the 
Presidency or the Minister in the Presidency to come in and then 
basically try and pull some strings and told ICASA look this is a special 
application here.  Fast track it we do not want you to delay it.  They 
then also wanted us to – to – as the officer of the Minister in the 
10 
Presidency to basically instruct ICASA as well.  Look either you reduce 
the rates or you do not give them any – any rates.  You do not charge 
them anything.  And at that stage we – we felt that that is not 
something that we – we were prepared to – to do.  And therefore even 
the Minister had no objection when we – we declined to assist on this 
particular event.  And our declining never went in a formal letter or 
email declining it was just basically ignoring correspondence regarding 
this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  They did not specifically say they wanted 
you to do anything more than being present as such a meeting with 
20 
ICASA or did they? 
MR SIMONS:  In fact the email says they – exactly what they said in 
the meeting as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SIMONS:  They wanted us to – to assist with – with making sure 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 116 of 155 
 
that the application goes through faster and that there is no 
unnecessary delays which – which they in fact regarded formally 
processes as… 
CHAIRPERSON:  As a waste of time. 
MR SIMONS:  As a waste of time and delays. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SIMONS:  So they thought that with us present they would be able 
to expedite the entire proposal that they were presenting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SIMONS:  And then also in that process then we also wanted to 
10 
negotiate what do they say there – more favourable terms. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SIMONS:  In terms of us being youth we want the reduced rate from 
ICASA.  That they not charge us what they would charge any other 
South African company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Excuse me.  So would it be correct to say that they 
wanted you to – to use the Presidency or the Ministry in the Presidency 
to advance their cause or case at ICASA? 
MR SIMONS:  That would be correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And you thought that that was going beyond the 
20 
acceptable line? 
MR SIMONS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of whatever assistance you could give.  Is 
that right? 
MR SIMONS:  Correct. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 117 of 155 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes.  Continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  Mr Simons you then in paragraph 
24.1 of your affidavit on page 7 refer to a meeting… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I am – I am sorry Ms Wentzel.  So the picture that 
I am getting and you must just tell me if that is how you understood it 
as well or how you see it is.  They started with asking for a letter. 
MR SIMONS:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From the Presidency that expresses support for what 
they were doing to trying to get.  Then now they were – they were 
wanting people from the Presidency to be with them in – in their 
10 
meeting with ICASA so as to assist them in their discussions with – with 
ICASA? 
MR SIMONS:  The letter in fact they wanted to use for – for all their 
proposals. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SIMONS:  So that is why they making reference to meetings with 
GCIS. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SIMONS:  And ICASA and Gems etcetera. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR SIMONS:  So – so it is correct to – to conclude that what they 
wanted was – and I mean it is almost like a fishing exercise where you 
put on your bait and everything and then once the fish bites you start 
reeling it in.  And the letter in their possession would have been 
something like that.  That look we have the support of the Presidency 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 118 of 155 
 
or the Minister in the Presidency. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it may well be that there is some comparison to 
be done between what they were doing and what the Gupta’s seem to 
have been doing on the evidence that I have heard so far at least in 
some cases where the evidence suggest that Mr Duduzane Zuma would 
be present when the Gupta’s were talking to certain people but he 
would not be making any serious contribution to the discussion but he 
would be there. 
MR SIMONS:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I heard evidence in that regard from Mr Jonas who 
10 
said when the member of the Gupta family who he said offered him 
money if he agreed to work with them as Minister of Finance.  He said 
Mr Zuma and Mr Hlongwane were there but he said they were as – they 
were very quiet. 
MR SIMONS:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I heard evidence from Mr Dugwana former MEC in the 
Free State government who said there was a day when he and former 
Premier of the Free State Mr Magashule went to the Gupta residence 
when I think Mr Rajesh Gupta spoke to them and on that occasion Mr 
Rajesh Gupta wanted Mr Dukwana to sign a certain letter appointing 
20 
one of their companies giving them some government business in the 
Free State and saying that he should get rid of his Head of Department 
and proposing Mr Richard Seleke as the person to make Head of 
Department and Mr Dukwana said Mr Duduzane Zuma was there but he 
did not say anything.  And then I think there is another incident too 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 119 of 155 
 
when one of the witnesses told me something similar to say the Gupta’s 
were talking to – to him about something and Mr Duduzane Zuma there 
but he did not say anything.  So with you or the Ministery in the 
Presidency first this group of young people as a – for a letter of 
support from the Presidency now they wanted you to be present at a 
meeting they were going to have with ICASA. 
MR SIMONS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where they were going to ask ICASA to agree to 
certain things. 
MR SIMONS:  In the correspondence read out earlier as well they in 
10 
fact asked me to meet with – with the acting CEO of GCIS. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SIMONS:  Before … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SIMONS:  They come on board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SIMONS:  Then when they meeting so… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SIMONS:  So – when I contact the acting CEO of GCIS. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR SIMONS:  I do so in my capacity as a senior official in the Ministry 
of the office for the Minister in the Presidency. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SIMONS:  So they would have assumed that would be a very 
powerful and influencer. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 120 of 155 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  H. 
MR SIMONS:  To open those door and that is why you can see them 
asking very directly, can you facilitate the meeting with ICASA?  Can 
you meet with Donald as GCIS?  Can you then arrange a subsequent 
meeting for us with Donald where you will also be present etcetera? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Actually I have now remember the third witness 
who told me something similar.  Mr Saloojee who was Group CEO on 
Denel said he was taken to a meeting at the Gupta residence by Mr I 
think Mr Essa called him to a meeting.  I think he attended three 
meetings there but on the second meeting if I am not mistaken Mr Zuma 
10 
was part of the meeting when a member of the Gupta family was talking 
to Mr Saloojee wanting some discussion on possible working together 
between Denel or business with Denel and he said Mr Duduzane Zuma 
was there but he did not say anything.  He was just there.  So there 
have been a number of those instances.  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes thank you Chair.  Mr Simons you refer to 
further meetings in paragraph 24.1 and 25 of your affidavit.  You refer 
to a meeting on the 29 May 2014 in paragraph 24.1. How do you recall 
that date? 
MR SIMONS:  I think this was still part of my original affidavit to 
20 
Parliament as well.  At that stage I would have had access to all my – 
my electronic as well as physical diaries so we do archive our diaries.  
So I particularly I remember this date.  I also I think went to go and 
check it with my - what do you call it – your log book – your kilometre 
log book.  So I went to this particular meeting so – but as I indicated in 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 121 of 155 
 
my affidavit as well the one I submitted to – to the commission I no 
longer have access to those electronic diaries and if it is still archived 
it would probably be in an archive somewhere but from my side I – I – 
Once you leave the department you do not have access to that 
department’s email and server. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And can you recall what happened at that 
meeting? 
MR SIMONS:  At this particular meeting they wanted me to secure a 
contract with GCIS.  You see they – they use us to try and assist with 
securing the… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second Mr Simons.  Maybe you can put on the 
aircon just a little bit.  Ja okay thank you.  Yes I interrupted you while 
you were answering.  Ja. 
MR SIMONS:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you must say if she must remind you the question 
– what the question was. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Do you recall what happened at that meeting?  
What was it about? 
MR SIMONS:  Yes.  At that meeting they – they clearly indicated that 
they wanted these public information terminals which is something that 
20 
also comes from the conflict between the NYDA and Weintelligent 
where they have these public information mobile terminals where 
anyone can access any information about government.  But once you 
open up the page there would be adverts either from Home Affairs 
which they would have to pay for as well as any other government 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 122 of 155 
 
department.  And they have already determined the pricing as well 
because they were saying that it was going to be R2000.00 per – per 
terminal.  So let us say for example you then have ten departments 
advertising on that particular terminal then you multiply it by the 200 
plus that they already had available and you come to a substantial 
monthly amount that they would – would be receiving through 
government 
advertising 
in 
public 
information 
– 
through 
public 
information terminals placed at the Thusong Service Centres of 
government.  And at that stage I think there were about over 200 if I am 
not mistaken active Thusong Service Centres throughout the country. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
MR SIMONS:  They also wanted us obviously to secure space for the 
advertisements of those departments and they wanted us to do that 
through GCIS which is very similar to denial defunct TNA would have – 
would have received advertising through GCIS for government adverts 
in used – in the newspaper for example. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And so am I understanding correct that they 
were wishing to earn funds in both renting the terminals and for the 
adverts that would be placed on those terminals by government 
departments? 
20 
MR SIMONS:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And then the meetings you referred to on – in 
paragraph 25 on the 30 September 2014 and the 6 October 2014.  Do 
you also get these dates from your electronic diary? 
MR SIMONS:  Yes. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 123 of 155 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And can you recall what these meetings were 
about? 
MR SIMONS:  Well at that stage it is September and October we would 
have been in the Public Service and Administration Ministry.  So we 
would have moved out of the elections from the office of the Presidency 
to DPSA.  So the – you know they came back and said look you are no 
longer in the Presidency we will deal with people who are in the 
Presidency still on some of these projects that they wanted.  But now 
that we are at DPSA they wanted us to assist them with – with access 
to potential and contracts within the Public Service and Administration 
10 
setup of government.  And this is where they said, look we can offer 
discounted cell phone contracts to all public servants and the Minister 
in DPSA would be able to issue a directive to the entire public service 
after meeting with the Treasury as well to basically say, look here is 
this group of young individuals let them provide cell phone contracts to 
the entire public service.  And that obviously would have – would have 
meant that they would have had a very wealthy contract assigned to 
them through the Minister in Public Service and Administration at that 
stage. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And through which vehicle did they wish to 
20 
pursue this venture? 
MR SIMONS:  That one was also when they meeting with us at this 
particular stage they were still meeting with us as Weintelligent to try 
and ensure that – that this contract progresses. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   With regard to that if I can just refer to you 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 124 of 155 
 
what you have said in paragraph 26. 
MR SIMONS:  6. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  If you can just tell me if that is correct or not? 
MR SIMONS:  Ja.  So at this stage I also reported to the Minister that it 
seems as if there was conflict in the group and the colleagues who – 
not the colleagues but the young people who were referring to 
themselves as Zuma family members then made it very clear that there 
was some contracts that they were going to run through some 
empowerment group which they were directly responsible for.  Now 
somehow I will have to try and find out exactly which company they 
10 
were referring to but they were referring to a company that they would 
directly control.  And that is when I then realised that even in this 
group there were people who – who were looking at the group in its 
entirety and then the meetings with some of these individuals were 
beginning to say that it was a – a more Zuma linked family 
empowerment group that they wanted to benefit from this contract.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And did you receive a proposal from them with 
regard to the business they wish to do with Gems, the government 
medical aid? 
MR SIMONS:  In - in fact as indicated I think if I - if I recall correctly 
20 
GEMS had advertised for companies to tender for a massive marketing, 
branding, communications, PR contract of theirs and these colleagues 
then felt that we should in fact push their company very strongly for 
this and this was then the first time where - where I was actually told 
look here is a - our company profile. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 125 of 155 
 
Can you take this to GEMS and give it to them?  They then 
assumed that by doing that … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  When you say “they” what do you mean? 
MR SIMONS:  The - the young adults … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Oh, yes. 
MR SIMONS:  Who wanted this business assumed that if - if I take it to 
them that this contract was just automatically going to be awarded to 
them, but we all know that that was not how it was supposed to - to 
operate within Government.  I made that very clear to them at that 
stage.  That you - you are not just going to get this - but then they 
10 
insisted that we at least ensure that - that they get - that we deliver the 
- the profile of the company to them. 
That was the first stage at that stage where I then released 
that there was another company involved as well and that was 
particularly focused on - on communications, branding, marketing, 
advertising etcetera.  So - so I was handed a sample.  I took the 
sample up to Minister Chabane, because at that stage there was 
another controversy around it. 
They were saying that it had the endorsement of Lithuli 
House.  I went to Minister Chabane and I said Minister I - I am told that 
20 
this is endorsed by - by Lithuli House.  That - Minister just said look I 
do not think that is - is the truth.  What you can do and the only thing 
you must do is give the sample to the relevant person in - in GEMS, but 
also make it very clear that we - we do not expect anything to happen. 
You are just following a process where - where you can also 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 126 of 155 
 
report that you have given this document to this individual.  I - I failed 
to recall the name.  I know it was a woman and I know that she was 
either the - the Head of Communications at GEMS or she was the 
Spokesperson for - for GEMS, but I - I set up their meeting and that 
meeting I set it up through - through the office - my office in the 
Ministry at DPSA and - and that meeting - I do not know if I recall the 
date exactly, but I actually met with her at a - a restaurant in - in 
Groenkloof in Pretoria. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what happened? 
MR SIMONS:  At that meeting I took the envelope.  I gave it to her.  I 
10 
told her that look there is multimillion Rand contract that you have 
advertised.  That these people are family members of the President.  I 
then very clearly indicated that it was at that stage Busa Zuma and 
Mqondisi Zuma and that they - in this envelope there is a - a profile of 
a company.  That they believe should get this contract. 
She - she was very - I could see that she was either upset or 
very nervous about - about what I was telling her.  To put her mind at 
ease there I actually told her that look.  They do not have to get this 
contract.  That is not why - why I am here.  I am just delivering this 
envelope.  She want - inquired about the Minister and I told her that the 
20 
Minister is very aware that the meeting is taking place, because at that 
stage it is also logged on my - my logbook. 
I drove from the office to - to this particular meeting and the 
Minister is aware.  That she does not need to panic.  That it is beyond 
our control, but handing over the envelope does not mean that the 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 127 of 155 
 
contract is - is being awarded to this particular company.  I - if my 
memory recalls correctly.  I do not think they - they were even 
considered for that particular contract. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And Mr Simons as far as you are aware did 
these individuals succeed in obtaining any Government contracts 
through your introductions? 
MR SIMONS:  From - from our side not a single contract was awarded 
to them.  I - I - as indicated the image and I know Judge you know 
ma’am many people say you cannot speak on behalf of a dead person, 
but some people tend to speak negatively of someone who had passed 
10 
on and - and the Minister that we knew was a very - very different - 
different character. 
In fact he despised corruption to a - to an extent that he 
hated it to - to a level where - where he would not want to want be seen 
or associated with - with people who directly practiced a level of - of 
corruption.  He - he was one of those Ministers where if you sat at a 
particular event you would never find him sitting alone.  He would 
mingle with individuals ordinary Public Servants and so on. 
Even inviting them to come and sit with him.  So - so he made 
it very clear that look I - I - this is our Government.  He used to speak 
20 
very often about the sacrifices they - they made.  Particularly those of 
us how grew up in - in the 70’s and the 809’s as well and obviously 
before that and - and the question he would ask was is - is this the 
ANC that - that people died for. 
Is this the ANC that people paid the ultimate sacrifice for - for 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 128 of 155 
 
example and - and is this the country that - that we want this country to 
move in this particular direction and - and his own answers would be 
that - that we should stop and prevent this country from going in the 
wrong direction and - and that is why I can say, because he - it was an 
instruction from him. 
That look meet with them, but make sure that nothing - 
nothing materialises and keep them away from our office. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And were these individuals happy with the 
fact that all these introductions and meetings with you led to nought? 
MR SIMONS:  No.  They were not happy and - and that is why they 
10 
started issuing threats at some of their - their meetings.  You know that 
we will report you to the President.  We will report you to Khulubuse 
and they would even bring certain messages sometimes from - from - I 
mean I assume it comes from him, because they refer to him as - as a 
father figure. 
Saying that Khulubuse is not happy with the delays.  That he 
wants to meet with the Minister and that he will deal with you.  So - so 
those are things that - that they would say at some of these meetings 
when it became very clear that instead of making the road easier for 
them we - we were actually beginning to make it a little bit more - more 
20 
difficult. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Could you please tell the Chair what 
happened at the Oliver Tambo International Airport? 
MR SIMONS:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Which you refer to in paragraph 33. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 129 of 155 
 
MR SIMONS:  Yes and before that you - you would see part of these 
statements they were made was that “Khulubuse is becoming impatient.  
Do not let him come to a meeting and deal with you” and I put that in - 
in quotation marks there, because that is how it was carried over to me.  
So - so on one of these occasions we were asked - in fact I was phoned 
and I was asked looked we need to meet with you, because Khulubuse 
is now impatient. 
So we must meet with you and I then indicated that look they 
wanted a meeting with the Minister as well.  I lied.  I said the Minister 
is already on his way out of the country.  We were on our way out of the 
10 
country, but I said he is already out and that I am joining him and they 
then asked me where are you. 
I said I am on my way to OR Tambo International and they 
said look can we meet with you at OR Tambo then and I said okay.  No 
problem.  So we had a meeting at OR Tambo.  They then made it very 
clear there that Khulubuse would want to meet with the Minister, 
because of what they termed our delaying tactics and that I must not be 
surprised if - if Khulubuse then just pitches up and comes box me, 
because he - he was angry. 
He was upset that there is no progress with any of the 
20 
contracts and I am talking from the Presidency period now.  So - so - I 
mean we - we had that discussion.  I said I would bring it over to the 
Minister’s attention and we left.  I mean we went out of the country and 
they went back to - to Sandton. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And did they try … 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 130 of 155 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you - I am sorry Ms Wentzel. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are dealing with what is at page 12 of your - of 
the affidavit, but earlier on and I do not know if you said this and I did 
not hear you.  You deal with - you dealt with the - Minister Chabane’s 
failure or refusal to renew Mr Manyi’s contract as the CEO of GCIS or 
… 
MR SIMONS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  DG of GCIS.  Can you just talk more about that? 
MR SIMONS:  The - the … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - you said … 
MR SIMONS:  Sorry.  The removal of Mr Maseko. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said paragraph 48 of your affidavit. 
MR SIMONS:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  DGs - Director-Generals employed on a five year 
contract and then you say when Mr Manyi replaced Mr Maseko.  He was 
still within five - his five year contract.  Do you want to talk more about 
that?  How - what happened when Mr Manyi’s contract as DG of GCIS 
came to an end after he had replaced Mr Maseko? 
MR SIMONS:  At - at that particular time I was at GCIS. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.   
MR SIMONS:  Ja.  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, but I want you to talk about that. 
MR SIMONS:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 131 of 155 
 
MR SIMONS:  Well many - many of us were very relieved when - when 
we got that news, but from the perspective of the Minister.  As I 
indicated the last time I think we were in Australia when he - he spoke 
about it.  I think the then … (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is Minister Chabane? 
MR SIMONS:  Chabane, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  You were with him in Australia? 
MR SIMONS:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SIMONS:  And - and I think that what happened was that that the 
10 
Minister - not the Minister.  The Public Protector was releasing the 
Nkandla Report.  Now while we were sitting in Australia the Minister 
then said look we should deal with the Nkandla issue very decisively 
and we drafted a - a statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no.  I do not want you to take it from that. 
MR SIMONS:  Oh, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As far as that, because … 
MR SIMONS:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I remember you gave evidence about that. 
MR SIMONS:  Ja.  Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  What I do not remember you dealing with either your 
first - when you came here first time … 
MR SIMONS:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or today is what happened when Mr Manyi’s contract 
as DG of GCIS came to an end, because you do deal with it in your 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 132 of 155 
 
affidavit. 
MR SIMONS:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - you remember that? 
MR SIMONS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SIMONS:  In fact you are talking about paragraphs 48 and 49? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am talking about Mr Manyi.  You remember 
Mr Themba Maseko was DG of GCIS. 
MR SIMONS:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was removed and he went to DPSA … 
10 
MR SIMONS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he was replaced at GCIS by Mr … 
MR SIMONS:  Manyi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mzwanele Manyi … 
MR SIMONS:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
And 
you 
say 
in 
your 
affidavit 
when 
Mr Mzwanele Manyi came to GCIS he was within his contract of five 
years as a DG … 
MR SIMONS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he had been DG of the Department of Labour … 
20 
MR SIMONS:  Labour.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And do you recall what happened when Mr Manyi’s 
contract came to an end? 
MR SIMONS:  Do you want me to explain that to you from my 
perspective as a GCS - GCIS … (intervenes). 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 133 of 155 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja or let me - let me ask you the question.  Did 
Mr Chabane renew Mr Manyi - Manyi’s contract as DG of GCIS? 
MR SIMONS:  No.  He did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know how that came about that he made that 
decision? 
MR SIMONS:  In - in fact from - from my experience as a - as one of 
the Senior Managers in GCIS there was a very good relationship 
between the late Minister and Mr Themba Maseko.  From what I know 
and what I understand and even when I got to the - the Ministry in the 
Presidency. 
10 
Afterwards that relationship was not the same level between 
the late Minister and - and Mr Manyi.  So when Mr Manyi’s contract for 
example came to an end the Minister was very clear then that he was 
not going to …  
CHAIRPERSON:  To renew it? 
MR SIMONS:  Renew it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SIMONS:  That in fact leads me to - to another issue which is not in 
the - the affidavit, but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Before you deal with it. 
20 
MR SIMONS:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is one that I see in the affidavit.  Did - do you 
know whether - whether the President at the time had any particular 
position about whether Mr Manyi should - Manyi’s contract should be 
renewed or not? 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 134 of 155 
 
MR SIMONS:  In - in fact there were some people who believed that the 
contract was going to be renewed.  That a new five year contract was 
going to be awarded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SIMONS:  Instead what we did was in the Presidency when we 
realised that Mr Manyi was still representing GCIS on the MDDA Board 
which he was not supposed to have been doing at that stage.  We wrote 
a letter to the President requesting that Mr Manyi also be removed from 
the MDDA Board because he was occupying a position that technically 
belonged to - to GCIS and he was no longer representing GCIS. 
10 
So from that letter also he you can - it is clear that - that 
Minister Chabane was not too keen on - on having Mr Manyi in - in 
Government and in particular back at GCIS. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Look at - look at paragraph 49 of your affidavit.  Do 
you - is that - is that what - is what you say there true?  Do you what to 
read it? 
MR SIMONS: 
 
“In 
fact 
Minister Chabane 
informed 
me 
personally that Mr Zuma was very angry with him 
over his refusal to extend/renew the contract of 
Mr Manyi.” 
20 
And that is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that true? 
MR SIMONS:  That is what Mr - the late Minister Chabane informed me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that what you were told by Minister Chabane? 
MR SIMONS:  Ja.  This was what I reported when - when we - we - 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 135 of 155 
 
when I gave evidence … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SIMONS:  A few months ago … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SIMONS:  And this is part of what … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, you covered that. 
MR SIMONS:  Ja, and this is part of what happened in - in Australia … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SIMONS:  When I explained. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  No.  Thank you.  There was something that 
10 
you said was not here.  Is that … 
MR SIMONS:  No, no.  I in fact … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have dealt with it now? 
MR SIMONS:  In fact I see it is here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Alright. 
MR SIMONS:  Paragraph 50. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   
MR SIMONS:  Where I said that: 
“Shortly before April the - before the April 2014 
20 
elections …” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SIMONS:  “…I drafted a letter for Minister Chabane for 
the attention of the President requesting and 
informing him that Mr Manyi was no longer the CEO 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 136 of 155 
 
of GCIS and therefore had to vacate the position he 
was occupying on the MDDA Board.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you.  You may proceed Ms Wentzel. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  Just to finish off on the business 
dealings of the young gentlemen.  After the event of Oliver Tambo 
Airport was a further attempt made by any of them to contact 
Mr Chabane - Minister Chabane? 
MR SIMONS:  In - in fact on - on - I cannot recall if it was that 
particular trip, because Minister Chabane was very active with the - the 
envoy appointed by the - the President to negotiate the - the peace 
10 
settlement in - in South Sudan at that stage.  So we would very often 
find ourselves flying to South Sudan, Ethiopia or Kenya where the - the 
- because Kenya was also part of the - the AU facilitating country to 
ensure that there was stability in - in South Sudan. 
So at one of our - Minister Chabane would - would - I mean 
on all the trips that I travelled with him.  He stayed at the 
Intercontinental in - in Nairobi and that was the - one of the last 
incidents where I recall a Zuma family member directly where - where I 
was a witness to it trying to meet with Minister Chabane, but that 
meeting never - never happened at the hotel. 
20 
Whether the family member was there to meet with 
Minister Chabane.  That solely I cannot - I cannot verify that as well, 
because I do recall reading that and they were also involved with 
potential business deals in - in Sudan - oil deals in that part of the - 
the continent.  So - so Nairobi would probably just have been a - a very 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 137 of 155 
 
central place for people to meet. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And who is the family member you are 
referring to? 
MR SIMONS:  As indicated it is Mr Khulubuse Zuma. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what did Minister Chabane say when he 
said he wanted to meet him? 
MR SIMONS:  He said I must ensure that no meeting takes place.  That 
he did not want to meet with him. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now Mr Simons from paragraph 51 of your 
affidavit you also deal with the appointment of Mr Steve Tshwete’s son 
10 
as the DDG in the Communications Department of the Department of 
Home Affairs under Minister Gigaba. 
MR SIMONS:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Could you explain how Minister Chabane was 
involved with this? 
MR SIMONS:  As the relevant Minister and I think Judge I need to 
explain the relevance of it.  Broadly the relevance of it is that this was 
one of the occasions where the Minister indicated to me - he in fact 
came to my hotel I was staying at in - in Cape Town.  So after the 
Cabinet meeting had - had ended I was in bed already and he came. 
20 
He phoned on my cell.  I got to the cellphone too late and 
then the - the room phone rang.  I answered it.  It was 
Minister Chabane who said look I am downstairs.  Come - come down 
and - and I want to have a chat.  So I - I went down.  It was roughly 
about 11 o’ clock/half past 11 the evening.  The Minister then indicated 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 138 of 155 
 
to me he is concerned. 
Saying that for - for the first time he was told after sometime 
within the ANC and after sometime as - as a senior politician that this 
is a political decision and therefore the only thing I had to do was - was 
endorse that and I asked what he was referring to and he was referring 
to the appointment of Mr Tshwete as the DDG in the Office of the then 
Minister - I think it was - was it Home Affairs - Mr Gigaba. 
Now DPSA raised certain concerns at that stage with the 
appointment itself.  Part of that would be for example you needed a 
particular amount of years of experience to be appointed at a DDG 
10 
level.  You needed certain qualifications in order for you to - to be at 
that level and some of the reports and I think it is also attached in the - 
in the affidavit where DPSA also raised concerns with the overall 
competency of - of the nominated candidate for this particular post, but 
the correspondence to and from between Home Affairs - at that stage - 
and - and DPSA was that they wanted the appointment expedited. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Irrespective of whether the candidate qualified or 
not? 
MR SIMONS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is … 
20 
MR SIMONS:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was their stance? 
MR SIMONS:  In - in fact part of the process within Government and I 
think maybe even in the private sector.  If you want a particular 
candidate appointed and - and your prescripts would say the advert 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 139 of 155 
 
must indicate that you require a post graduate qualification.  You can 
change the advert to some extent that you can say you know you are 
looking for a three year qualification, relevant qualification or you can 
be very direct. 
So - so DPSA had raised certain concerns regarding the - the 
process.  Regarding the appointment and obviously the Minister felt 
that he was within his legislative duty then to - to sit, ask certain 
questions and then to apply his mind because the - the memorandums 
for appointment from Deputy Director-General level upwards goes 
through the Public Service and Administrative Minister. 
10 
So Minister Chabane had not signed the - the memorandum.  
The appointment was - was - the - the - well was made.  It was 
discussed I think at Cabinet level.  Cabinet had announced that the 
appointment is endorsed and the following day the Minister signed the 
relevant documentation.  I - I doubt that he still signed the actual 
memorandum - Cabinet memorandum, because it was already discussed 
at - at that level and technically endorsed. 
So when he came to my hotel he was - he was - again you 
know Ministers are human at the end of the day.  They are prone to all 
emotional characteristics that we as - as any human would be exposed 
20 
to and - and I think he - he felt a bit upset and - and also a little bit of 
anger at that stage, because he was saying you know that I thought I - 
I used be in the - in the inner circle where - where political decisions 
are made and then I am told that it is a political decision and I am - I - I 
was not even party to that discussion, but it is the responsibility of the 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 140 of 155 
 
relevant Minister and that is why he then signed the - the documents. 
It was not backdated.  It in fact reflects the - the actual dates 
when - when he signed it.  So that was part of the - the discussions 
that the Minister would for example raise with you when he - when he 
wanted to talk to someone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now do you have a clear recollection whether for 
example in the case of Mr Tshwete.  Mr Mayihlome Tshwete whether 
what - what requirements he did not meet for that position of Deputy G 
… 
MR SIMONS:  He … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or do you no longer have a clear recollection of that? 
MR SIMONS:  I think the documentation is - is in the affidavit as well, 
but it talks about the - at that stage it specifically referred to the - the 
overall competency.  The competency in terms of whether you have the 
ability to manage staff.  Whether you have the ability to sit at a 
particular executive level and - and entertain and discussions etcetera. 
The other issues were for example the - the CV would say 
that I qualified for - to get a particular degree from Unisa in 2013 and 
then 2013 you appointed at - at Chief Director level.  So part of the 
concerns would be that you - you need to have a level of experience 
20 
either at Deputy Director level - at Director level in order for you to 
qualify to - to be a Chief Director for example in - in Government and in 
order for you to be appointed at DDG level you also need to have next 
to your overall competencies outside of the Public Service, but you 
need to have a particular amount of experience that you have gained in 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 141 of 155 
 
terms of overall management of staff, finances. 
So - so I think part of the concerns raised by DPSA at that 
stage was around financial management aspects, overall competency in 
terms of people management, supervisory responsibilities and also I 
think there is a direct reference to the person does not have the - the 
relevant academic qualification. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Well - well I am interested to get relevant 
documents that may show exactly what was required for the position 
and what it is that he did not have to meet the requirements.  We have 
had a situation - we have had evidence where according to 
10 
Mr Ramatlhodi and Mr Morphe, Minister Zwane or his Department 
Mineral Resources wanted Minister Ramatlhodi when he was Minister of 
Public Service … 
MR SIMONS:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Administration to approve the appointment of 
Mr Mzwanele Manyi as DG of … 
MR SIMONS:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Of 
the 
Department 
of 
Mineral 
Resources.  
Mr Ramatlhodi said he refused … 
MR SIMONS:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  To approve that appointment, because Mr Manyi did 
not have - I think a Degree or a Post Graduate Degree.  One of the 
academic qualifications that was required he did not have … 
MR SIMONS:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  According to Mr Ramatlhodi and he refused to - to 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 142 of 155 
 
approve his appointment.  Mr Morphe who was Mr Ramatlhodi’s Advisor 
at the time gave evidence that subsequently Mr Manyi went to 
Mr Morphe and told him that the former President was very unhappy 
about the fact that they - I assume that is Mr Ramatlhodi - had refused 
to approve his appointment … 
MR SIMONS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And - but nobody has said Mr Ramatlhodi was 
mistaken or was wrong to think that Mr Manyi did not have the required 
academic qualifications.  So the picture one gets is as if there was a 
requirement in terms of the law or in terms of the advert to say the 
10 
people who may be appointed - the person who may be appointed as 
DG must have this qualification - academic qualification. 
Mr Manyi did not have it.  So Mr Ramatlhodi refused, but 
according to Mr Morphe Mr Manyi went to see him and said the former 
President was very unhappy or was unhappy that he - they had refused.  
So you are telling me now about an instance where as you recall 
somebody did not meet certain requirements and your Minister at the 
time - Minister of DPSA at the time - Mr Chabane - refused to approve - 
to approve the appointment of this person as DDG, but Cabinet over - 
overruled him.  So I - I would like to get more information about that. 
20 
MR SIMONS:  I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if you can assist with whatever information, 
documentation that you - there may be other than what is here.  Please 
do, but … 
MR SIMONS:  Ja. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 143 of 155 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  It has been many years.  So it might not be easy to 
find.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Chair it is 4 o’clock but I don’t expect that 
I’ll be much longer with the witness, I don’t know…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let’s try and finish.  I’m sure Mr Simons will 
prefer that too, let’s try and finish.  I would imagine it shouldn’t take 
more than ten minutes to finish.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    I don’t think so. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja let’s try and finish. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Chair subsequent to Mr Simons giving 
10 
evidence the Commissions investigators asked pursuant to request for 
information from DPSI certain documentation has been obtained which 
has also been included in the bundle.  I don’t know if it’s sufficient 
documentation and whether Chair you would like us to obtain more but I 
can just quickly go…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It must just tell me – if it tells me what requirements 
Mr Mhlongo Twetwe did not meet and what the requirements were for 
the position that will be enough.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Could I refer you to page 59, is it correct 
20 
that this is an Executive protocol regarding the appointments of DG’s 
and Deputy DG’s? 
MR SIMONS:    Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    And was Minister Chabane involved in 
designing these sorts of protocols? 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 144 of 155 
 
MR SIMONS:    In fact when the Minister joined the Ministry, Public 
Service and Administration we brought into his speeches the fact that 
we were referring to the re-inventing the way we work as Public 
Servants and re-inventing the way Public Servants should be working 
and part of his position was that we actually need to ensue – and that 
is why at that stage there was already draft documentation about if you 
are applying for a post in the public service at Deputy Director Level, 
you should at least have four to five years experience as an Assistant 
Director.  If you are applying for a Director in the Public Service you 
should at least have four to five years’ experience at the level of 
10 
Deputy Director and so on and then obviously questioning, you know 
salaries that Public Servants were being paid at that particular time, 
whether the structure of those payments were correct and he would 
often, you know say, we pay people to deal with media and 
communications in Government more than what we pay a policeman 
who – and woman who daily puts their lives at risk to protect us and he 
questioned that, he said there was something fundamentally wrong with 
that and that is why he was beginning to look at how do we restructure 
the entire Public Service so that South Africans actually get maximum 
benefit from the services being rendered and that we don’t have this 
20 
que operation.  So you would find that in there, there would also be 
your Senior Management Services hand-book which would also outline 
the process for the appointment of DDG’s, DG’s etcetera and this would 
largely have been influenced by that document. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Thank you.  I want to refer you to sub-
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 145 of 155 
 
paragraph 7.5. sub-paragraph 7A on page 78 because it is relevant to 
this aspect and there it deals with the selection committee and requires 
it states, sub 7, 
 
“A selection committee constituted for the appointment of, 
 
and then Sub A, a Head of a National Department shall be 
 
Chaired by the Minister responsible for the portfolio in which 
 
the vacancy exists and include at least two other Ministers 
 
and a National Head of Department”, 
 
Do you know whether Minister Gigaba was part of the selection 
committee…[intervenes]? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ms Wentzel, I’m sorry I’m not so interested in that, 
I’m interested in what the requirements were that were laid down, which 
ones did Mr Twetwe not have, not about what other procedures were 
followed or not followed. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Yes Chair, you will see in paragraph 7.8 on 
page 81 it refers to the submission of a Cabinet memorandum which is 
a requirement and then I want to refer you to page 111 and you’ll see 
that this is a draft recommend – memorandum which has got place for 
Minister Chabane to sign on page 118 and it’s a Cabinet Memoranda 
eight of 2015 of the 4 t h of March 2015.  Did Minister Chabane sign this? 
20 
MR SIMONS:    No that was not signed. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    And if I can show you the document on page 
120 it says,  
 
“comments for the Minister’s attention, appointments five-year 
contract appointment, Department of Home Affairs, post applied for, 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 146 of 155 
 
Department Director General Communications Services and the name of 
the 
candidate 
Mr 
M 
Twetse. 
 
If 
you 
– 
who 
prepared 
this 
documents…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ms Wentzel that’s taking too long.  Does the 
document tell me what the requirements for the position were, which 
requirement Mr Twetse didn’t meet, that’s all I need, nothing else, let’s 
go there? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Yes if you have regard to page 121 
paragraph six, and in particular paragraph 6.1, firstly whose comments 
were these? 
10 
MR SIMONS:   These were obviously sourced from the legal and 
relevant sections within DPSA.  
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    And it says, 
 
“relevance of job specifications, qualification versus the post 
 
as advertised.  The post was advertised with a three-year 
 
degree in Public Relations Management and/or a Grade 12 
 
certificate educational requirement.  A post graduate degree  in 
the relevant field would be an advantage.  According to the  job 
description a B Degree in Public Relations  Management 
and 
Communication Services or an NQF level 6  
equivalent 
is 
20 
required whilst a post graduate Degree in the  
relevant field would 
be an added advantage.  It should be  
noted that the advert was 
specific to a three-year Degree in  Public Relations Management and/or 
a Grade 12 Certificate  
educational 
requirement 
and 
the 
recommended candidate is  
in possession of a Bachelor of 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 147 of 155 
 
Administration Degree.  Based  
on this the recommended candidate 
does not seem to meet  
the educational requirements of the post as 
advertised, a  
copy of the job evaluation report which informed the 
advert is  
not availed”, 
 
Can you give any comments on that? 
MR SIMONS:    That obviously would have been handed to the Minister 
as well, from the Department’s side and it should have influenced his 
decision to rather do a thorough investigation.  So what you find here is 
the request from DPSA for the provision of more detailed information.  
So they do respond via an email but that is all after the actual fact. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you may or may not be able to enlighten me on 
this paragraph because it’s been quite some time since these events 
but this requirement here for a three-year Degree in Public Relations 
Management and/or a Grade12 Certificate educational requirement and 
recommended – how do you say you want a candidate to have a Degree 
and/or a Grade 12 Certificate.  What does that mean, so what does this 
requirement mean? 
MR SIMONS:    In fact, that is why I said earlier Chairperson that within 
the Public Sector as well as in the Private Sector it’s very easy to try 
and get a person appointed that you have already identified and prior 
20 
to - so what you will do is, you will craft your advert around the kind of 
qualifications that you think the candidate would have. Now part of the 
concerns, if you read through the documentation in it’s entirety is the 
competency for example and you’ve been in Government for two years, 
you started at Chief Director level and now all of a sudden we are 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 148 of 155 
 
appointing you at DDG level.  So those were some of the concerns that 
were raised with the Minister then. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja but what it does mean if I understand this 
requirement correctly, is that, if you had the three-year Degree in 
Public Relations Management or you just had a Grade 12 Certificate 
you would be fine. 
MR SIMONS:    You would be – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So the question is, well one, why do you want that 
particular degree if Grade 12 is good enough? 
MR SIMONS:    That’s it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    Because they are not saying that Degree would be 
an advantage or is recommended, it seems to be put as a requirement. 
MR SIMONS:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    But if you just have Grade 12, a Grade 12 
Certificate is good enough, so it may, therefore well be that Cabinet’s 
decision be that Mr Twetse be appointed even if he didn’t have that 
Degree in Public – three-year Degree in Public Relations Management 
was based on the fact that the advert said a matric is good enough. 
MR SIMONS:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let’s wrap up.  
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Chair if I can just point one further thing out 
to you if you don’t mind and – because I think it might be helpful. Could 
you turn to the document on page 124, it’s an email dated the 3 r d of 
March 2015 which purports to deal with the comments and queries 
raised and with regard to the qualifications, Chair if you can have 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 149 of 155 
 
regard to paragraph 6.1…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    I’m sorry which page do you want me to look at? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  It’s page 124, sorry Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  124.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes and in the middle of the email at the 
second half of the page you will see it says, para 6.1 which is where 
this issue of his qualifications had been raised and Chair the answer is 
not, he had a Certificate, this is the answer that had – had a matric 
Certificate, the answer that is given is,  
 
“the post was advertised with a three-year post matric 
10 
 
qualification of Grade 12, matric with relevant qualifications. 
 
Mr Tswete is in possession of a three-year post matric 
 
qualification as well as matric with relevant qualifications”, 
 
So …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes it’s not worth – at least on what I have been to 
it’s not worth spending more time on it, ja okay is there anything else 
you want to cover? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Yes, finally Chair if I can just deal with the 
last part of his evidence, I don’t think it will be more than five minutes, 
could you just tell the Chair what happened after you posted something 
20 
on Facebook in and around June 2015 dealt with at paragraph 56 of 
your affidavit? 
MR SIMONS:    Chairperson as indicted to you earlier I believed in – 
you know our organisation allowed people to express their views and 
opinions it was guaranteed and protected in our constitution etcetera 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 150 of 155 
 
so I’d been very vocal against what I thought was – that the ANC, the 
country has been taken in the wrong direction and that the leaders of 
the then President Zuma.  So I usually expressed my views very openly 
and in a discussion with some of the Senior Public Servants and also 
comrades based in the Eastern Cape and Gauteng etcetera I actually 
asked the question, why it was our then President was at the centre of 
most of the corruption, scandals that were happening in our country 
and being reported in the media and then someone who participated in 
that discussion took it to the then Acting Minister of Public Service and 
Administration, Nathi Mthethwa, he called me he was very, very upset 
10 
and angry that I had said this in a group with fellow ANC members and 
so on.  Questioned me and that is where I was then – the next day, I 
was basically told, look I don’t want you in the Ministry.  So I was 
moved sideways, I sat on a half empty floor in a particular corner there 
in DPSA for almost nine months, close to ten months when I was – 
eventually when Minister Ramatlhodi re-joined – not re-joined, joined 
DPSA he then said, no you can’t have someone sitting and doing 
nothing and earning a salary which I had been raising with my DG 
consistently on a monthly basis, then look I’m being paid, I’m not being 
used.  You either charge me or you don’t charge me etcetera.  There 
20 
was a charge sheet it was never presented to me, it had about fifteen 
charges on it, the African National Congress was raising every charge 
that was being raised against me but at the end I was re-assigned to 
head up the Chief Directorate for Knowledge Management within the 
Public Service and we produced a Knowledge Management framework 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 151 of 155 
 
for the entire Public Service and that is now formally been endorsed but 
I mean and the issue was just that even though the senior management 
guidelines allows for any Public Servant to participate in the affairs in 
political parties – discussions of political parties in your private 
capacity in your private time people always turn around and say, you 
know, there’s perhaps – we would be wiser to say there’s no – if you 
are a Public Servant there’s no private time, no private capacity but 
that was protected within the Senior Management Service handbook 
and I think that, to a large extent, was my main defence, I actually had 
to appoint a lawyer as well who also asked DPSA consistently, when is 
10 
my client being  charged and eventually after  a year and a half, two-
year period we said that you no longer have the legal authority to 
charge me because you should have done that almost two years ago.  
So  that’s what happens within the Public Service, I mean, one of the 
charges was that my actions were treasonous and I asked for a 
definition of treason because I don’t think my actions were anywhere 
close to being treasonous but that currently still is what you’ll find 
because most of the people who would threaten you then were with 
these treasonous actions or disciplinary action, I mean, I eventually left 
the Public Service but you still have some of the individuals there and 
20 
it’s their right to serve. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So this discussion which put you into trouble, was 
this a discussion that you were having with a group of friends and/or 
colleagues or comrades within the ANC during your own time. 
MR SIMONS:    On a Sunday afternoon. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 152 of 155 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    On a Sunday afternoon and do you know whether 
maybe almost everybody was participating in the discussion was also a 
member of the ANC? 
MR SIMONS:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    That was so? 
MR SIMONS:    That was so. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So it was like – was it like discussing an issue of 
interest to members of the ANC? 
MR SIMONS:    We were dealing with the issue around corruption and 
we felt then that the ANC had passed – at almost every National 
10 
Conference that the ANC resolutions are adopted that says it is the 
responsibility of each and every ANC member, no matter where you find 
yourself, in society to combat, expose…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    To fight corruption. 
MR SIMONS:    And fight corruption and on that basis we were having 
this discussion.  Someone screen grabbed it and sent it to Minister 
Mthethwa who was obviously very, very angry that I had made that 
statement and that I was regarded as a Senior member in his Ministry 
that he was the Acting Minister of and so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:    But is the position that you were expressing your 
20 
bone fide views about something of concern to you as a member of the 
ANC and to you as a citizen to friends and comrades who you were 
used to conversing with on issues? 
MR SIMONS:    Ja most of the participants in the group were, in fact, 
Senior Managers within the Public Service. 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 153 of 155 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, yes. 
MR SIMONS:    But most of them were also very active within the ANC 
and it just happened that one of those people were closer to Minister 
Mthethwa and because you are discussing it in a Facebook chat you 
expect it to be a public – it’s not a private closed discussion and so 
that is how the threat of disciplinary action then arose within the Public 
Sector but I’m glad to say that no charges were formally put to me at 
any stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:    But did you say that you were stopped from doing 
your normal work as a result of this and made to stay in some office for 
10 
what, nine months or so doing nothing but being paid, is that what you 
said? 
MR SIMONS:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes were you on suspension or were you not on 
suspension?   
MR SIMONS:    I have asked my DG then whether I was formally 
suspended, I was never ever suspended in the Public Service and then 
I asked for charges to be formally put to me and those charges were 
never formally put to me until someone in DPSA brought me a charge 
sheet which is also part of the affidavit that says that these are the 
20 
charges that are being prepared against you so you need to prepare 
yourself for it. The lawyer then requested that the charge sheet be 
formalised and that I be handed that formally and for almost two years 
of asking no charges were then brought forward. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Was it for about two years or about a year? 
14 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 198 
 
Page 154 of 155 
 
MR SIMONS:    No remember I think it was from about 2015 until 
Minister Ramatlhodi joined the Ministry as formal Minister of Public 
Service and Administration when I was given another alternative post 
within DPSA and then I stayed there for about a year before normally 
resigning from the Public Service. 
CHAIRPERSON:    But is your recollection that the time you spent 
sitting in an office and not doing anything but getting paid, is your 
recollection that, that was about a year? 
MR SIMONS:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay alright, thank you. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Yes and Chair the charge sheet referred to 
is at page 46 I don’t think we need to go there and I have no further 
questions Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, no thank you.  Thank you very much Mr Simons 
for coming to share what you know with the Commission we appreciate 
it, thank you very much, if we have need for you to come back we’ll ask 
you again but thank you very much you are excused. 
MR SIMONS:    Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    We are going to adjourn now, tomorrow we are going 
20 
to start at half past ten not 10 o’clock so we’ll – and then tomorrow and 
the days after we’ll – I’ll be hearing evidence relating to Law 
Enforcement Agencies. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    We adjourn.
